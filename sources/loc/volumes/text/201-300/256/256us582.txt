OCTOBER TERM, 1920.
Syllabus.

256 U. S.

The findings of fact leave us in doubt whether there has
been charged against this appropriation any sum for
superintendence in excess of amounts properly chargeable; and counsel were unable to remove these doubts,
to which attention was called at the argument. Unless
the parties can agree as to the facts, the case should be
remanded to the Court of Claims to determine what, if
any, amount was errdneously charged against the appropriations aggregating $23,000; and for the amount of
such improper charges, if any, judgment should be entered for the petitioner. Except as stated the judgment is

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA.
Non. 282-284.

Argued April 22, 25, 1921.-Deided June 1, 1921.

1. Permits to build vaults under sidewalks adjacent to their premises
were issued to private parties for a nominal charge by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, subject to the building regulations, which provided, inter alia, that no charge should be made
the occupants of such vaults, that permits should be revocable
when the space was needed for public use or improvements, and that
the space should be vacated when ordered by the Commissioners or
needed for public u=-e; the permittees signed agreements, as required
by these regulations, accepting the permits on conditions recognizing
the right of the District to construct sewers, etc., which it might
deem necessary, and the duty of vault occupants to clear the space

therefor, without cost to the District, and declaring that the occupation was permitted merely as an accommodation to abutting
owners, and that no right, title or interest of the public was in any
way waived or abridged, "except as expressed in said permit and
the conditions aforesaid." Held, that the building regulations were
not, to be looked to for grants in the streets, and that the permits were
to be strictly construed and were mere licenses, revocable by the
District Government at its discretion. P. 586.
2. An application made long ago to the District Government for permission to build a vault under a sidewalk, followed by its construction and continuous use, may support a presumption of a license
but not of a permanent grant in the street. P. 587.
3. The Act of September 1, 1916, c. 433, ยง 7, 39 Stat. 716, authorizing
and directing assessment and collection of rent from all users of
space under sidewalks and streets of the District of Columbia,
occupied and used in connection with their business, applies to
vaults constructed before as well as those constructed after the date
of the act. P. 588.
49 App. D. C. 273, 276; 263 Fed. Rep. 1017, 1020, reversed.
THE cases are stated in the opinion.
Mr. F. H. Stephens for petitioner.
Mr. M. D. Rosenbkg and Mr. Charles L. Frailey, with
whom Mr. E. H. Jackson was on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JusTicE CLxRY.E delivered the opinion of the court.
These three cases, tried on agreed statements of fact,
were argued and will be disposed of together.

The respondents were assessed a rental upon vaults
under sidewalks which were used in connection with
business conducted in adjacent buildings. They refused
to pay the assessments, and, in these suits to collect them,
judgments were rendered by the Supreme Court in favor
of the District, which were reversed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that the act of Congress authorizing
the assessments was applicable only to constructions
permitted after its date.

OCTOBER TERIM, 1920.

Opinion of the Court.

256 U. S.

The essential facts are as follows:
The appropriation act for the District of Columbia,
approved September 1, 1916, c. 433, ยง 7, 39 Stat. 676, 716,
provided:
"That hereafter the Commissioners of the District of
Columbia are authorized and directed to assess and collect
rent from all users of space occupied under the sidewalks
and streets in the District of Columbia, which said space
is occupied or used in connection with the business of said
users."i

Pursuant to this authority, the Commissioners caused
the space occupied by vaults of each of the three respondents to be valued and then assessed against each of them
a rental which it is stipulated is "fair and reasonable"
in amount "if it be a legal charge."
The permits involved in the Paper Company and Lisner
cases were issued before the act complained of was passed
and these two cases will be first considered.
The essential provisions of each of these permits are:
"This is to certify that . . . .has permission to
build vault

.

.

.

as per plan

.

.

.

in accord-

ance with application . . . on file in this office, and
subject to the provisions of the Building Regulations of
the District of Columbia." There is nothing in either
permit in the nature of a grant or which enlarges the permission beyond the terms quoted.
When these permits were issued, the Building Regulations provided (paragraph 9):
"No charge will be made for the occupancy of public
space by vaults or areas, except the usual permit fee, and
all permits for such occupancy are subject to revocation
by the Commissioners at any time without compensation,
when the vault space is needed for public use or improvements. . . . And this permit is accepted with the
understanding that the occupation of the vault space is
permitted merely as an accommodation to the owner of

Opinion of the Court.

the abutting premises and that no right, title or interest
of the public is in any way waived or abridged thereby,
except as expressed in said permit and the conditions
aforesaid." Then follows an agreement by the licensee to
use the vault only for the purposes authorized by the

Commissioners.
And paragraph 3 provided:
"IThe application for a vault must be accompanied by
a written agreement, upon an official blank, signed by the
owner of the abutting property, . . . contracting
to release and relinquish the vault space and to remove,
free of expense to the District, all machinery, fixtures, or
structural parts of the vault when so ordered by the Commissioners, or needea for public uses." The only charge
made by the District was one dollar for the permit to
construct.
Pursuant to paragraph 3, supra, the applicants each
signed an agreement in precisely the same form, accepting
the permit on condition (1) that the District shall have
the right to construct under, over or through the vault
public sewers or other underground construction which
it may deem necessary, without compensation; and (2)
that upon notice from the District of a desire to place any
such construction in the area occupied by the vault, space
clear and sufficient for it shall forthwith be made therein
(by the acceptor) "without cost to the District." The
acceptance concludes, "This permit is accepted with the
understanding that the occupation of the vault space is permitted merely as an accommodation to the owner of the
abutting premises, and that no right, title or interest of
the public is in any way waived or abridged thereby,
except as expressed in said permit and the conditions
aforesaid."
The respondents, the R. P. Andrews Paper Company
and Abraham Lisner, defended against the collection of
the assessments, claiming that their permits to construct

were in such form as to create in each by contract a vested
right of property in the vault in the street, of which they
would be deprived without due process of law if they were
required to pay the rental.
To sustain this position, the respondents select from
paragraph 9 of the Building Regulations, supra, the provision that "no charge shall be made for the occupancy
of public space by vaults," and that all permits are subject to revocation "when the vault space is needed for
public use or improvements." From paragraph 3, supra,
they select the stipulation that the vault space shall be
vacated when ordered by the Commissioners "or needed
for public uses," and from the terms of the acceptances
of the permits the provision, that the Commissioners may
place in the vaults any construction they may "deem
necessary." Grouping these unrelated excerpts together
it is contended that they constitute a contract on the part
of the District to leave the respondents in the undisturbed
possession of the vaults, free of charge, until such time as
the space may be demanded because needed for some
public use and improvement, and that since the act of
Congress under which the disputed rental is imposed is
purely a revenue measure which does not require the
surrender of the space for any public use, but contemplates the continued private use of it, it is an -invalid
attempt to deprive the respondents of their property
without due process of law.
This statement of the contention of the respondents
is its own sufficient refutation.
In form the permit is a mere naked permission to build.
Two of the three clauses relied upon to create rights of
property in the streets are derived from the Building
Regulations, which, as their name implies are designed
to regulate the materials of buildings and the manner of
their construction and use,-they are not looked to, on
such a mere referenee as we have here, for a grant of rights

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA v. ANDREWS PAPER CO. 587
582.

Opinion of the Court.

in streets,--and the third clause is from the acceptances
of the permits, which are signed only by the applicants.
When to this we add that, the applications culminated
and ended in acceptances of the permits "with the understandi g that the occupation of the vault space is permitted merely as an accommodation to the owner of the
abutting premises and that no right, title or interest of
the public is in any way waived or abridged thereby,
except as expressed in said permit and the conditions [in
the acceptances] aforesaid," and that the settled rule of
law is that the grants of rights and privileges in streets
are strictly construed so that whatever is not unequivocally
granted therein is withheld, and that nothing passes in
such case by implication, (Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxvale, 200 U. S. 22; Blair v. Chicago, 201 U. S. 400, 471;
Piedmont Power & Light Co. v. Graham, 253 U. S. 193, 194)
we cannot doubt that the permits to the respondents
were mere licenses, subject to revocation at any time in
the discretion of the Government of the District.
The Saks & Company case, No. 283, is, if possible, even
less substantial than the other two. Whatever rights in
the streets this respondent has must be derived from the
application made in 1884 for a permit to erect a building
with adjacent vaults, and from the presumption of a permit, arising from the fact that a vault was constructed
and has been in use ever since. No formal permit appears
in the record.
A license to Saks & Company to construct and use the
vaults, revocable at will, would be sufficient to render
them lawful constructions in the street until the privilege
should be revoked, and this is all that can fairly be inferred
against the public from the facts stated. Without a permit presumed the vault would be a public nuisance, but
no grant of a permanent right in the street can be inferred
from a mere application and use.
The Court of Appeals gives much greater significance

Opinion of the Court.

256 U. S.

to the concluding words of the acceptances in permits in
Nos. 282 and 284 "except as expressed in said permit
and the conditions aforesaid," than we can find in them.
There are certainly no limitations upon the rights of the
public in the permit itself, and the conditions of acceptance here referred to were special agreements, in the
acceptances, on the part of the applicants to surrender
the vault space upon demand of the Commissioners for
special purposes and to an extent designated, which we
think not inconsistent with the larger declaration with
which the permit was accepted, that the occupation of
the vault was a mere accommodation to the receiver of
the permit and did not constitute any waiver of any right,
title or interest of the public in the streets.
Concluding, as we do, that the respondents were mere
licensees, we see no reason for limiting the act of Congress,
as the Court of Appeals limited it, to constructions after
the date of the act. Such an interpretation of the act
would so obviously result in unjust inequality that it
should be adopted only under stress of imperative language which we do not find in it.
It results that the judgment of the Court of Appeals
of the District will be reversed and that of the Supreme
Court affirmed in each of the cases.
Revrsed.
