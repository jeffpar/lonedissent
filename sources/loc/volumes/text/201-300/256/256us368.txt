to remedy the uncertainties of this statute by attributing
to Congress an intention to include a baggage porter with
those who discharge official duties in the operation of a

DILLON v. GLOSS, DEPUTY COLLECTOR OF
UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 251.

Argued March 22, 1921.-Decided May 16, 1921.

1. Article V of the Constitution implies that amendments submitted
thereunder must be ratified, if at all, within some reasonable time
after their proposal. Pp. 371, 374.
2. Under this Article, Congress, in proposing an amendment, may
fix a reasonable time for ratification. P. 375.
3. The period of seven years, fixed by Congress in the resolution proposing the Eighteenth Amendment, was reasonable. P. 376.
4. The Eighteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitution on
January 16, 1919, when, as the court notices judicially, its ratification
in the state legislatures was consummated; not on January 29, 1919,
when the ratification was proclaimed by the Secretary of State.
P. 376.
5. As this Amendment, by its own terms, was to go into effect one
year after being ratified, §§ 3 and 26, Title II, of the National
Prohibition Act, which, by § 21, Title III, were to be in force from
and after the effective date of the Amendment, were in force on
January 16, 1920. P. 376.
262 Fed. Rep. 563, affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Argument for Appellant.

Mr. Levi Cooke, with whom Mr. Theodore A. Bell and
Mr. George R. Beneman were on the brief, for appellant:
The Eighteenth Amendment is invalid because of the
extra-constitutional provision of the third section. Congress has no power to limit the time of deliberation or
otherwise control what the legislatures of the States shall
do in their deliberation. Any attempt to limit voids the
proposal.
The legislative history of the Amendment shows that
without § 3 the proposal would not have passed the Senate.
Cong. Rec., 65th Cong., 1st sess., pp. 5648-5666; Cong.
Rec., 65th Cong., 2d sess., p. 477.
The same taint attended the passage of the amendment
in the House, because there what is now § 3 was considered
and the limitation changed from six to seven years, and
it is impossible to say now that without the attempted
time limitation upon the States two-thirds of the House
would have assented to the proposal of the amendment.
The fact that thirty-six States thus ratified within the
time emphasizes the evil that was accomplished by the
limitation, and can in no way be invoked to suggest that
the third section became surplusage in view of this result
attained so well within the seven-year limitation attempted
to be set by Congress. On the contrary, the fact of there
being a time limitation tended to destroy any deliberation
by the States and to enable the faction which was pressing
for ratification of the amendment to urge immediate
indeliberate action in order to avoid the possibility of
the time limitation expiring without thirty-six States
having made ratification.
The history of the times discloses,if the court may take
judicial notice thereof, that legislators elected prior to
the submission by Congress were urged to act forthwith,
without awaiting the election of legislators by an electorate
aware of the pendency of the congressional proposal, and
that in some legislatures ratification was secured without

debate in the precipitate action urged by the faction
advocating the amendment. The speed with which the
amendment was disposed of by the state legislatures tends
to establish the absence of deliberation; and in any view
the fact stands that the States were acting in the presence
of a limitation fixed by Congress, violative of Art. V,
in terms unheard of in the history of the country, and
contrary to any procedure sanctioned by the organic
law, with the very nature and structure of which both
the Congress and the state legislatures were dealing. See
2 Story, Const., 3d ed., § 1830.
The National Prohibition Act should be found to have
become effective, if at all, January 29, 1920, a year after
ratification of the amendment was proclaimed and made
known to the public. The proclamation of the Secretary
of State must be treated as the publication of the fact
of ratification, under Rev. Stats., § 205, of which all persons may be considered to be charged with knowledge.

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This is an appeal from an order denying a petition for
a writ of habeas corpus. 262 Fed. Rep. 563. The petitioner was in custody under § 26 of Title II of the National
Prohibition Act, c. 85, 41 Stat. 395, on a charge of transporting intoxicating liquor in violation of § 3 of that title,
and by his petition sought to be discharged on several
grounds, all but two of which were abandoned after the
decision in National Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350.
The remaining grounds are, first, that the Eighteenth
Amendment to the Constitution, to enforce which Title II
of the act was adopted, is invalid because the congressional

DILLON v. GLOSS.

Opinion of the Court.

resolution, 40 Stat. 1050, proposing the Amendment,
declared that it should be inoperative unless ratified
within seven years; and, secondly, that, in any event, the
provisions of the act which the petitioner was charged
with violating, and under which he was arrested, had
not gone into effect at the time of the asserted violation
nor at the time of the arrest.
The power to amend the Constitution and the mode
of exerting it are dealt with in Article V, which reads:
"The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses
shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments of this
Constitution, or, on the application of the legisiatures of
two-thirds of the several States, shall call a convention
for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be
valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of
the several States, or by conventions in three-fourths
thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may
be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand
eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the
first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first
article; and that no State, without its consent, shall be
deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate."
It will be seen that this article says nothing about the
time within which ratification may be had-neither that
it shall be unlimited nor that it shall be fixed by Congress.
What then is the reasonable inference or implication?
Is it that ratification may be had at any time, as within
a few years, a century or even a longer period; or that it
must be had within some reasonable period which Congress
is left free to define? Neither the debates in the federal
convention which framed the Constitution nor those in the
state conventions which ratified it shed any light on the
question.
The proposal for the Eighteenth Amendment is the

first in which a definite period for ratification was fixed.I
Theretofore twenty-one amendments had been proposed
by Congress and seventeen of these had been ratified by
the legislatures of three-fourths of the States,--some
within a single year after their proposal and all within
four years. Each of the remaining four had been ratified

in some of the States, but not in a sufficient number.
Eighty years after the partial ratification of one an effort
was made to complete its ratification and the legislature
of Ohio passed a joint resolution to that end,3 after which
the effort was abandoned. Two, after ratification in one
less than the required number of States, had lain dormant
for a century.4 The other, proposed March 2, 1861, declared: "No amendment shall be made to the Constitution
which will authorize or give to Congress the power to
abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic
institutions thereof, including that of persons held to
labor or service by the laws of said State." I Its principal
purpose was to protect slavery and at the time of its proposal and partial ratification it was a subject of absorbing
interest, but after the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment it was generally forgotten. Whether an amendment

proposed without fixing any time for ratification, and
which after favorable action in less than the required
number of States had lain dormant for many years, could
be resurrected and its ratification completed had been
mooted on several occasions, but was still an open question.
These were the circumstances in the light of which Congress in proposing the Eighteenth Amendment fixed
seven years as the period for ratification. Whether this
could be done was questioned at the time and debated
at length, but the prevailing view in both houses was
that some limitation was intended and that seven years
was a reasonable period.'
That the Constitution contains no express provision on
the subject is not in itself controlling; for with the Constitution, as with a statute or other written instrument,
what is reasonably implied is as much a part of it as what
is expressed. 2 An examination of Article V discloses that
it is intended to invest Congress with a wide range of
power in proposing amendments. Passing a provision
long since expired,' it subjects this power to only two
restrictions: one that the proposal shall have the approval
of two-thirds of both houses, and the other excluding
any amendment which will deprive any State, without

its consent, of its equal suffrage in the Senate.1 A further
mode of proposal-as yet never invoked-is provided,
which is, that on the application of two-thirds of the
States Congress shall call a convention for the purpose.
When proposed in either mode amendments to be effective
must be ratified by the legislatures, or by conventions, in
three-fourths of the States, "as the one or the other mode
of ratification may be proposed by the Congress." Thus
the people of the United States, by whom the Constitution
was ordained and established, have made it a condition
to amending that instrument that the amendment be
submitted to representative assemblies in the several
States and be ratified in three-fourths of them. The
plain meaning of this is (a) that all amendments must
have the sanction of the people of the United States, the
original fountain of power, acting through representative
assemblies, and (b) that ratification by these assemblies
in three-fourths of the States shall be taken as a decisive
2
expression of the people's will and be binding on all.
We do not find anything in the Article which suggests
that an amendment once proposed is to be open to ratification for all time, or that ratification in some of the
States may be separated from that in others by many
years and yet be effective. We do find that which strongly
suggests the contrary. First, proposal and ratification
are not treated as unrelated acts but as succeeding steps

in a single endeavor, the natural inference being that
they are not to be widely separated in time. Secondly,
it is only when there is deemed to be a necessity therefor
that amendments are to be proposed, the reasonable
implication being that when proposed they are to be considered and disposed of presently. Thirdly, as ratification
is but the expression of the approbation of the people
and is to be effective when had in three-fourths of the
States, there is a fair implication that it must be sufficiently
contemporaneous in that number of States to reflect the
will of the people in all sections at relatively the same
period, which of course ratification scattered through a
long series of years would not do. These considerations
and the general purport and spirit of the Article lead to
the conclusion expressed by Judge Jameson I "that an
alteration of the Constitution proposed today has relation to the sentiment and the felt needs of today, and
that, if not ratified early while that sentiment may fairly
be supposed to exist, it ought to be regarded as waived,
and not again to be voted "Ipon, unless a second time proposee by Congress." That this is the better conclusion
becomes even more manifest when what is comprehended
in the other view is considered; for, according to it, four
amendments proposed long ago-two in 1789, one in 1810
and one in 1861-are still pending and in a situation
where their ratification in some of the States many years
since by representatives of generations now largely forgotten may be effectively supplemented in enough more
States to make three-fourths by representatives of the
present or some future generation. To that view few
would be able to subscribe, and in our opinion it is quite
untenable. We conclude that the fair inference or implication from Article V is that the ratification must be
within some reasonable time after the proposal.

limits, to fix a definite period for the ratification we entertain no doubt. As a rule the Constitution speaks in general
terms, leaving Congress to deal with subsidiary matters
of detail as the public interests and changing conditions
may require; I and Article V is no exception to the rule.
Whether a definite period for ratification shall be fixed
so that all may know what it is and speculation on what
is a reasonable time may be avoided, is, in our opinion,
a matter of detail which Congress may determine as an
incident of its power to designate the mode of ratification.
It is not questioned that seven years, the period fixed in
this instance, was reasonable, if power existed to fix a
definite time; nor could it well be questioned considering the periods within which prior amendments were
ratified.
The provisions of the act which the petitioner was
charged with violating and under which he was arrested
(Title II, §§ 3, 26) were by the terms of the act (Title III,
§ 21) to be in force from and after the date when the
Eighteenth Amendment should go into effect, and the
latter by its own terms was to go into effect one year after
being ratified. Its ratification, of which we take judicial
notice, was consummated January 16, 1919.2 - That the
Secretary of State did not proclaim its ratification until
January 29, 1919,1 is not material, for the date of its
consummation, and not that on which it is proclaimed,
controls. It follows that the provisions of the act with
which the petitioner is concerned went into effect January

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 453.

Argued January 6, 7, 1921.-Decided May 16, 1921.

1. The Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, Tit. II, 40 Stat. 300, 302, in providing for a deduction of a percentage of "invested capital " before
computation of the "excess profits " tax upon. the income of a domestic corporation, does not mean to include in its definition of invested capital (§ 207) any marking up of the valuation of assets
upon the corporate books to correspond with increase of market
value or any paper transaction by which new shares are issued in
exchange for old ones in the same corporation but which is not in
substance and effect a new acquisition of capital property by it.
Pp. 386, 389.
2. A corporation, having acquired ore lands for $190,000, proved,
by extensive explorations and developments, that their actual cash
value was over $10,105,400; thereupon, in 1912, it increased their
book valuation by adding $10,000,000, as surplus, and, based thereon,
declared a stock dividend for $9,915,400, which was carried out by
surrender and cancellation of all the common stock, of like aggregate
par value, and the issuance of one share each of preferred and new
common stock for each share of the stock surrendered. The increased value of the ore lands persisted when an excess profits tax
was laid under the Act of 1917, supra. Held: That such increase
of value was not included in "in iested capital " under § 207 (a)
(3), as "paid in or earned surplus and undivided profits," (though
an amount equal to the cost of the exploration and development
might be), pp. 386, 390; nor under id. (2) as "the actual cash value
of tangible property paid in other than cash, for the stock or shares"
of the corporation. Pp. 386, 390.
