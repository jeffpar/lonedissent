BROWN v. UNITED STATES.

It would seem indisputable, therefore, if there be an
assertion of the claim or remedy growing out of an occurrence in which there are constituents of interstate commice, the burden of explanation and avoidance is on
him who asserts the claim or remedy, not on the railway
company to which it is directed, and there is nothing
in Osborne v. Gray, 241 U. S. 16, in opposition. Indeed,
the court was asked in that case to do what the referee
and the Supreme Court in this case have done, that is,
to aime to know things of which there is no evidence.

Mr. James R. Dougherty and Mr. E. C. Brandenburg,
with whom Mr. W. E. Pope, Mr. Gordon Boone and Mr.
H. S. Bonham were on the brief, for petitioner:
The court below erred in not holding that the indictment upon its face did not charge any offense either
against the laws of the United States, or within the
territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
It was error t0 instruct the jury that petitioner, though
in a place where he had a right to be and though the deceased was making a felonious assault upon him, with
intent to kill him or do him some serious bodily injury,
was obliged to retreat, though without fault on his part,
before he could exercise his right of self-defense, and slay
the deceased.
The duty to retreat did not exist in cases of justifiable
homicide or justifiable self-defense at the common law.

A man need not retreat from his place of business when
feloniously assaulted, but may stand his ground. A
servant or employer has the same right as the owner. If
petitioner had owned the lot he would not have been
obliged to retreat. He was at the place of his business or
his master's business. We submit that this gave him the
right to stand his ground. Andrew v. State, 159 Alabama,

Counsel rely largely upon Fosters view-that, in case
of justifiable self-defense, the assauLlted party may repel
force with force and is not obliged to retreat-(Foss
Crown Cases, pp. 255, 267, 273), and upon Beard v.
United States, 158 U. S. 550, 564, which sutaips their
view. But Foster's statement does not represent the
common law. 1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, pp. 104115; Pond v. People, 8 Michigan, 150, 177; Bracton,

important in the case or was called to the attention of
the judges. In the Beard Cas, the defendant was on his
own premises, and, in view of the subsequent decisions
in Alia v. United Stats, 164 U. S. 492, 497, 498, and
v. United Staie, 162 U. S. 499, 507, 508, that

decision should be limited to the right not to retreat when
assaulted in one's own house. It is not clear whether, in
v. United States, 165 U. S. 184, 187, the court
Addiat

meant to reaffirm the general statement of the right to
kill without retreating, made in the Beard Case, or not, or
to extend it-beyond the exact case there presented.
.The common law knew nothing of two kinds of homicide in self-ddense, mutually destructive. If Foster's
statement were correct it would follow that on an assault
with manifest intent to commit a known felony on the
person assaulted there would be (a) no duty to retreat
generally, but (b) a duty to retreat if this manifest
assault was part of a "chance medley." Such a distinction is clearly impracticable and impossible of application

before a jury.
As it recognized only one species of homicide in selfdefense, so the common law applied without question to
all such homicides the rule that the person assaulted was
under duty to avoid killing his assailant by retreating,
if that was practically possible under the circumstanxes
as they appeared to him. Even Foster admits it as to
what he calls excusable homicide in self-defense; and when
his distinction of two species of such homicides disappears

OCTBER TERM, 1920.
Argument for the United States.

256 U. 8

(as it does in so far as the common law is concerned),
the rule, since its existence is admitted, must extend as
well to his so-called justifiable homicide in self-defense.
Even assuming that Foster's statement can be taken
as in any way representing the common law, it should not
be extended to cases (like the present) where the assault
from which the right to kill is derived is no more than,
but, on the contrary, is exactly equivalent to the assault
with manifest intent to commit a felony specified in the
alleged rule. The doctrine of Foster, if adopted at all,
should be limited to cases where the assault is merely
a collateral means to carry out an independent intent to
commit a felony, as where A lies in wait for B, to murder
him, and on his approach attacks him. If the rule be so
limited, it does not apply to the case at bar because there
is no evidence of any independent intent on the part of
Hermes to murder petitioner, but, on the contrary, the
evidence of the latter himself shows that Hermes came
to the excavation to haul dirt, and that the assault was induced by petitioner's statement in regard to such hauling.
In order to excuse or to justify the taking of human
life, it must appear that the killing was reasonably necessary to protect other interests which for good reasons the
law regards as more important, under all the circumstances,
than the continued existence of the life in question. The
difficulty lies in defining such "other interests." In so
far as self-defense is concerned, the normal case of another interest is the life of a person other than the one
killed. If the protection of that life makes necessary the
homicide in question, there can be no doubt that the law
must excuse or justify the killing. But one evident
method of avoiding a homicide is to avoid a conflict from
which it may arise, and hence to retreat if assaulted,
provided such a retreat would, under all the circumstances as they present themselves to the person assaulted,
accomplish the end desired by the law, viz., to preserve

BROWN v. UNITED STATES.

human life if it can be done without seriously endangering
other human lives. The rule of the common-law, therefore, that the person assaulted is bound to retreat provided such a retreat would not be dangerous to his personal safety, is clearly founded on a reasonable, sensible
principle, and goes as far as such reasonable principle
requires, if the only "other interest" had in mind is the
life and personal safety of the one assaulted.
The rule laid down by Foster and approved in the
Bewd Cas must be supported by a respect for some
interest which the law ought to protect other than human
life or personal safety, since the latter are sufficiently
protected by the very trms of the common-law rule. The
Only "other interest " which can be had in mind is the
self-respect and honor of the person assaulted. The
question therefore is whether such self-respect and honor
are in the eye of the law sufficint to weigh down the balance as gainst human life. We submit that they are not.
MJ. Jusrncz Haimm delivered the opinion of the court.
The petitioner was convicted of. murder in the second
degree committed upon one .Hermes at a place in Texas
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States,
and the judgment was affirmed by the Cireuit Court of
Appeals. 257 Fed. Rep. 46. A writ of certiorari was
granted by this Court. 250 U. S. 637. Two questions
are raised. The first is whether the indictment is sufficient,
inasmuch as it does not allege that the place of the homicide was acquired by the United States "for the erection
of a fort, magazne, arsenal, dock-yard, or other needful
building," although it does allege that it was acquired
from the State of Texas by the United States for the exclusive use of the United States for its public purposes and

Opinion of the Court.

256 U. S.

Constitution, Art. I, § 8. In view of our opinion upon
the second point we think it unnecessary to do more than
to refer to the discussion in the Court below upon this.
The other question concerns the instructions at the
trial. There had been trouble between Hermes and the
defendant for a long time. There was evidence that
Hermes had twice assaulted the defendant with a knife
and had made threats communicated to the defendant
that the next time, one of them would go off in a black
box. On the day in question the defendant was at the
place above mentioned superintending excavation work
for a postoffice. In view of Hermes's threats he had taken
a pistol with him and had laid it in his coat upon a dump.
Hermes was driven up by a witness, in a cart to be loaded,
and the defendant said that certain earth was not to be
removed, whereupon Hermes came toward him, the
defendant says, with a knife. The defendant retreated
some twenty or twenty-five feet to where his coat was and
got his pistoL Hermes was striking at him and the defendant fired four shots and killed him. The judge
instructed the jury among other things that "it is necessary to remember, in considering the question of selfdefense, that the party assaulted is always under the obligation to retreat, so long as retreat is open to him, provided he can do so without subjecting himself to the
danger of death or great bodily harm." The instruction

was reinforced by the further intimation that unles
"retreat would have appeared to a man of reasonable
prudence, in the position of the defendant, as involving
danger of death or serious bodily harm" the defendant
was not entitled to stand his ground. An instruction
to the effect that if the defendant had reasonable grounds
of apprehension that he was in danger of losing his life
or of suffering serious bodily harm from Hermes he was
not bound to retreat was refused. So the question is
brought out with sufficient clearness whether the formula

BROWN v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion d the Court.

laid down by the Court and often repeated by the ancient
law is adequate to the protection of the defendant's rights.
It is useless to go into the developments of the law from
the time when a man who had killed another no matter
how innocently had to get his pardon, whether of grace
or of course. Concrete cases or illustrations stated in the
early law in conditions very different from the present,
like the reference to retreat in Coke, Third Inst. 55, and
elsewhere, have had a tendency to ossify into specific
rules without much regard for reason. Other examples
may be found in the law as to trespass ab initio, Commonwealt v. Rubin, 165 Mamhusetta, 453, and as to fresh
complaint after rape. Commonwealth v. Cleary, 172
Mschusetts, 175. Rationally the failure to retreat
is a cirunmstance to be considered with all the others in
order to determine whether the defendant went farther
than he was justified in doing; not a categorical proof of
guilt. The law has grown, and even if historical mistakes
have contributed to its growth it has tended in the direction of rules conaistent with human nature. Many
respectable writers agree that if a man reasonably believes
that he is in immediate danger of death of grievous bodily
harm from his assailant he may stand his ground and that
if he kills him he has not exceeded the bounds of lawful
self-defense. That has been the decision of this Court.
Beard v. United Stt s, 158 U. S. 550, 559. Detached
reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife. Therefore in this Court, at least, it is not a
condition of immunity that one in that situation should
pause to consider whether a reasonable man might not
think it possible to fly with safety or to disable his assailant rather than to kill him. Rowe v. United States, 164
U. S. 546, 558. The law of Texas very strongly adopts
these views as is shown by many cases, of which it is
enough to cite two. Cooper v. State, 49 Tex. Crim. Rep.
28, 38. Baltrip v. State, 30 Tex. Ct. App. 545, 549.

OCTOBER TERM, 1920.
Dissment.

256 U. S.

It is true that in the case of Beard he was upon his own
land (not in his house), and in that of Rowe he was in the
room of a hotel, but those facts, although mentioned by
the Court, would not have bettered the defence by the
old common law and were not appreciably more favorable
than that the defendant here was at a place where he was
called to be, in the discharge of his duty. There was
evidence that the last shot was fired after Hermes was
down. The jury might not believe the defendant's testimony that it was an accidental discharge, but the suggestion of the Government that this Court may disregard
the considerable body of evidence that. the shooting was
in self-defence is based upon a misunderstanding of what
was meant by some language in Batle v. UnitedStates, 209
U. S. 36, 38. Moreover if the last shot was intentional
and may seem to have been unnecessary when considered
in cold blood, the defendant would not necessarily lose
his immunity if it followed close upon the others while
the heat of the conflict was on, and if the defendant believed that he was fighting for his life.
The Government presents a different case. It denies
that Hermes had a knife and even that Brown was acting
in self-defence. Notwithstanding the repeated threats
of Hermes and intimations that one of the two would die
at the next encounter, which seem hardly to be denied, of
course it was possible for the jury to find that Brown had
not sufficient reason to think that his life was in danger
at that time, that he exceeded the limits of reasonable
self-defence or even that he was the attacking party. But
upon the hypothesis to which the evidence gave much
color, that Hermes began the attack, the instruction that
we have stated was wrong.
