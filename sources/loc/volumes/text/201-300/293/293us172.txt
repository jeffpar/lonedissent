The controversy in these cases hinges upon the date

Revenue.
On July 16, 1921, Zellerbach Paper Company filed a
consolidated income and profits tax return in behalf of
itself and a subsidiary, National Paper Products Com-

pany, for the fiscal year beginning May 1, 1920, and ending April 30, 1921.
On March 15, 1921, it filed an income and profits tax
return for the calendar year 1920 in behalf of A. S. Hopkins Company, a dissolved subsidiary, including in its own
consolidated return the income of the A. S. Hopkins Company between January.l, 1921 and the date of dissolution.
At the filing of these returns the income and profits tax
statute applicable to the taxpayers was the Revenue Act
of 1918 (40.Stat. 1057). Later (on November 23, 1921)
another tax statute, the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat.
227), became a law, with a provision (§ 263) that it
should take effect retroactively as of January 1, 1921.
By the Act of 1921 (§ 239a) every corporation subject
to taxation- thereunder was required to "make a return,
stating specifically the items of its gross income and the
deductions and credits allowed by this title." Treasury
Decisions 'issued by the Commissioner in March, 1922
(T. D. 3305,'March 16, 1922, amended by T. D. 33,10,
March 28, 1922 1) gave notice in substance that taxpayers
who had filed. returns under the Act of 1918 and who were
subject to an additional tax for the same period under the
Aot of 1921, should file a new or supplemental return
covering such additional tax. By implication this was
a ruling that an additional return was not required of taxpayers whose taxes were not increased by the new law.
'The text of the amended decision is as follows:
"If any taxpayer has, before November 23, 1921, filed a return for
a fiscal year ending in 1921, and paid or become liable for a tax
computed under the revenue act of 1918, and is subject to additional
tax for the same period undcr the revenue act of 1921, a return
covering such additional tax shall be filed at the same time as the
returns of persons making returns for the fiscal year ending February
28, 1922,.are due under the laws and regulations, and payment of
such additional tax will be due in the same installments and at the
same times as in the case of payments based on returns for the fiscal
year ending February 28, 1922.,. "

Opinioff of the Court.

By implication also the new return was to be limited to
a statement of the facts or figures necessary to exhibit
the additions, without repetition of facts or figures that
had been well returned already.
The Act of 1921 in its application to the petitioners
made one change and one only. If the net income of the
taxpayer was more than $25,000, there.was to be a denial
of th6 credit or exemption of $2,000 otheriwise' allowable.
§ 236b. The fiscal year of the petitioners ran, as we have
seen, from May 1, 1920, to April 30, 1921, and of this
period one-third was in the calendar year 1921. The net
income being largely in excess of $25,000, the effect of. the
new law was to cut down the: permissible credit by onethird of $2,000, thus increasing the tax by little more than
a nominal amount. What. that amount was could be
ascertained by a simple computation, dependent upon
data fully supplied by the return already filed, and calling
only for the application of the statutory rule.
The petitioners did not make a new or supplemental
return correcting the computation in the one on file. The
change was so trivial and so obvious as perhaps to lead
them to believe that no amendment was expected. Be
that as it may, they heard nothing more from the Bureau
of Internal Revenue with reference to their taxes till May
11, 1928, an interval of nearly seven years, when they received from the Commissioner notices of deficiency assessments in large amounts upon grounds unrelated (except for the deduction already mentioned) to any changes
in the law. The Revenue Act of 1921 lrovides (§ 250d)
that income and profits taxes shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within four years after a return is filed. If the return filed by the petitioners or in
their behalf in July, 1921, served to set in motion the
term of limitation, the assessments were too late. The
Board of Tax Appeals, however, upheld the action of the
Commissioner, and ruled (two members dissenting) that

-the return on file was a nullity, and hence that the statute of limitationshad never been set running. 26 B. T.
A. 96. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 69 F. (2d) 852. In so doing, it refused to follow decisions directly to the contrary by courts of cojrdinate jurisdiction. Myles Salt Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner,
49 F. (2d) 232 (Fifth Circuit); Isaac Goldmann Co. v.
Commissioner, 60 App. D. C. 265; 51 F. (2d) 427 (Court
of Appeals, District of Columbia); Valentine-Clark Co.
v. Commissioner, 52 F. (2d) 346 (Eighth Circuit). Because of that conflict writs of certiorari were granted by
this Court. 292 U. S. 621.
The opinion of the court below rests heavily upon the
argument that what is required by the statute is a return
under the act, and that this excludes by implication a
return by the taxpayer before the act became a law. Various sections are cited as enforcing that conclusion. See,
e. g., §§ 205a, 239a, 250d, which so far as material are
quoted in the margin.' But the Act of 1921 was retro2

§ 205a:1" That if a taxpayer makes return for a fiscal year De-

ginning in 1920 and ending in 1921, his tax under this title for the
taxable year 1921 shall be the sum of: (1) the same proportion of
a tax for the entire period computed under Title II of the Revenue
Act of 1918 at the rates for the calendar year 1920, which the portion
of such period falling within the calendar year 1920 is of the entire
period, and (2) the same proportion of a tax for the entire period
computed under this title at the rates for the calendar year 1921,
which the portion of such period falling within the calendar year 1921
is of the entire period."
§ 239a: "That every corporation suoject to taxation under t.'.is
title and every personal service corporation shall make a return, stating specifically the items of its gross income and the deductions and
credits allowed by this title."
§ 250d: "The amount of income, excess-profits, or war-profits taxes
due under any return made uider this Act for the taxable year 1921
or succeeding taxable years shall be determined and- assessed by the
Commissioner within four years after the return was filed, .. ."

Opinion of the Court.

active (§§ 263, 14Q0), taking effect, as we have seen, as
of the beginning of the year. Being law by relation, to
the disadvantage of the taxpayer, in respect:of the burden of his' tax, it may well have been law by relation to
his benefit in respect of the form and time of his return.
There is no anomaly, to say the least, in such a rule of
reciprocity. Indeed, there are special reasons why this
very result must have been thought of in the framing of
the statute. If a new return. was required, when was it
to bet due? The statute tells us (§§ 227a, 241a) that
when Ia taxpayer makes* his return on the basis of a
fiscal year, the time for filing shall be the fifteenth: day
of the third month following the close of such year, which
.for these petitioners was the fifteenth of July. Thus the
date fixed for filing was far. in advance of the date when
the statute was enacted. From this the inference is a
fair one that returns already filed were continued in effect, being: treated as if made under the new act, which
thus adopteid and renewed them. Otherwise the taxpayer was placed in default before the duty was imposed.
'Nor is there anything unworkable in thus applying the
doctrine of relation to keep returns alive.. To the extent
that' gross income or deductions were to be computed
differently thereafter, the Commissioner could make the
necessary adjustment -in connection with his audit.
Moreover by virtue of his general power to make "all
needful rules and regulations" with the approval of the
Secretary (§ 1303), he might require oft taxpayers whatever supplementary information would be necessary to.
enable him to act correctly. .,This, as we have seen, he

did, designating a new date selected by himself and wholly
unrelated to the fiscal year coveted. The validity of such
a regulation will be assumed and indeed is not contested.
None the less, the return exacted by the statute, the
one that in' the absence of fraud is to start the term of

limitation (§ 250d), is the return filed by the taxpayer
at the close of the fiscal year, though supplementary
information may modify or add to it. Cf. Florsheim
Bros. Drygoods Co., Ltd. v. United States, 280 U. S. 453,
462.
A different conclusion would lead in practice to complications and injustice. Many taxpayers filing returns
under the Act of 1918 were unaffected by the changes
wrought by the Act of 1921. Their returns, if made over
again, would have been an exact reproduction of those
they had made already. A statute would have to be very
plain to justify a holding in such circumstances that there
was an obligation to report anew. Certainly the average
.man would be slow to suspect .1hat he was subject to such
*a duty. If he looked .into the Treasury Decisions,- he
would learn that the Commissioner agreed with him. In
these he was told by the plainest implication: that unless
he had an additional tax to pay, his return would stand
as filed, without" supplement or correction. Now, the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue is without dispensing
power. If a return under the old act is not good.under
the new cne, but, instead, is an utter nullity, he may not
relieve the taxpayer, of making a return over again. To
this the Government assents, and on it builds the argument that the first returns are to be disregarded altogether, whether more is due or nothing. In that view,
hundreds of taxpayers, perhaps thousands, though innocent of wilful wrong, have been deprived of the protection
of any rule of limitation, not to speak of other penalties
unwittingly incurred. A statute of uncertain meaning
will not readily be made an instrument for so much of
hardship and confusion.
Administrative construction, confirmed by acts of Congress, brings reinforcement to the argument. Reference
has been made already to the Treasury Decisions issued
in March, 1922. The pertinent administrative history,

ZELLERBACH CO. v. HELVERING.
172

Opinion of the Court.

however, does not:begin at that point. It goes back to
earlier statutes presenting a like problem. In the transit
from the Revenue Act of 1917 to the Act of 1918 (40 Stat.
1057), there was the same gap to be filled, the same neccessity for determining the standing of returns made on
a fiscal year basis before the new act became law. Treasury Decision 2797, issued by the. Commissioner March
11, 1919, was designed to guide the taxpayer in that predicament. It is quoted in the margin.' It calls for an
additional return when an additional tax is due, but not
at other times. It treats the whole tax, computed under
both returns, as made up of separate parts, one the part
due under what is:styled "the original return," and the
other the additional part due " under the amended return." This regulation was in substance re-adopted in
the regulations already referred to under the Act of 1921.
There are" verbal variations, but not of such a nature as
to suggest a 6hange of meaning. The like is true of a
Treasury Decision issued under the Revenue Act of 1926
(44 Stat. 9; T. D. 3843). All these regulations have had
the tacit assent and confirmation of the lawmakers. Successive revenue, statutes have been enacted without substantial change in the applicable sections. Congress
seemingly has 'been satisfied with the Decisions of the
"If a corporation has before February 25, 1919, filed a return for
a fiscal year ending in 1918 and paid or become liable for, a tax com-'
puted under the revenue act of 1917, and is subject to additional
tax for the same period under the revenue act of 1918, the return
covering such additional tax shall be filed at the same time as returns of persons making returns for the calendar year 1918 are due
under existing rulings, and payment of such additional tax is due in
the same installments and at the same times as in the case of payments based on returns for the calendar year 1918. If no part of
the tax for such fiscal year was due until after February 24, 1919, the
whole amount of tax due, including tax due under the original return
and additional tax due under the amended return will be payable in
the same installments and at the same times as in the cage of pay'ments based on returns for the calendar year 1918."

Treasury and with the interpretation of its own meaning
implicit in them. National Lead Co. v. United States,
252 U. S. 140, 146; McCaughn v, Hershey Chocolate Co.,
283 U. S. 488, 492, 493; Costanzo v. Tillinghast, 287 U. S.
341, 345; Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, 288
U. S. 294,:315.
From this administrative history the inference is- compelling that a second return, reporting an additional tax,
is an amendment -or supplement to a return already
upon the files, and bng effective by relation does not
toll a limitation which has once begun to run. Florsheim
Bros. Drygoods Co., Ltd. v. United States, supra. , Cf.
United States'v. Merphis Cotton Oil Co., 288 U. S. 62,
.67; N. Y. Central& H. R. R. Qo. v. Kinney, 260 U. S. 340,
346. Perfect accuracy or comPleteness is not necessar~y to
rescue a return from nullity, if it purports to be a return, is
sworn to as such (Lucas v. Pilliod Lumber Co., 281 U. S.
245); and evinces an honest and genuine endeavor to
satisfy the law. This is so though at the time of filing
the omissions or inaccuracies are such as to make amendment necessary. Even more clearly is it so when the
return is full .and accurate in the beginning under the statutes then in force, but is made inaccurate or incomplete
by supervening changes of the law, unforeseen and unforeseeable. Supplement and correction in: such circumstances will not take from a taxpayer, free from, personal
fault, the protection of a term of limitation already running for his benefit. Cf. Myles Salt Co., Ltd. v. Commissioer, supra, at p. 233; Valentine-Clark Co. v. Commissioner, supra, at p. 349, At the very least the statutes
are sufficiently ambiguous 'to be susceptible of that con,
struction without strain upon their meaning. So iA
effect the Commissioner has construed them by relieving
taxpayers of the duty of filing a new return except for additional taxes and by treating such new return as an

Opinion of the Court.

amendment or a supplement. So this Court construes
them now.
In the argument for the Government much is made
of the point that in giving effect for any purpose to the
original return we cut down the period available to the
Bureau for audit and assessment. The reduction, however, is not serious. In the first place, it applies only to
that part of the taxable year as to which the two statutes
overlap. In the second place, the return in"
its first form
was subject to immediate audit in respect of everything
embraced within it. Indeed, at that time the examiners.
could not know whether a new statute would be passed
before the end of the calendar year, or whether the
changes would be great or small. Whatever shortening
of time there has been is limited to those matters as to
which the statutes differ from each other. Even for that
purpose, however, the time available was ample. Almost
three years and eight months were left for carrying the
audit to completion. The curtailment is too slight, the
inconvenience too nearly negligible, to affect the process
of construction.
A middle ground has been suggested, a path of compromise between the position of the petitioners at one
extreme and that of the Government at the other. Some
such compromise is indicated, it seems, in decisions of the
Board of Tax Appeals; though the rulings of the Board
in that respect are involved in some obscurity. At all
events, the suggestion is that the term of limitation shall
run from the new return when it appears on the face of
the original return that because of the changes in the law
a tax will be due beypnd the liability reported,' and that

293 U. S.

the limitation shall run from the original return when
there is nothing on the face of that return to indicate
that the liability reported is less than is owing.- The
statute supplies no basis for such a principle of division.
An examiner needs more time for an audit when errors
are latent, to be discovered only by digging into books
and vouchers, than when errors are apparent upon a bare
inspection of the record. It would be a strange rule of
limitation that would vary his opportunity inversely to
his needs.
One other contention of the Government is stated
merely to exclude it from the scope of our decision. The
Government makes the point that the petitioners' return,
even if filed at the proper tidpe, must be held to be a
nullity for the reason that it commingles the income of
the affiliated companies, parent and subsidiary, with that
of another company, the A. S. Hopkins Company, previously dissolved. No such point was considered by the
court below, nor was it suggested either in the petition
for certiorari or in any response thereto. Review 'by
this Court will be limited accordingly. Johnson v.,Manhattan Ry. Co., 289 U. S. 479, 494; Charles Warner Co.
