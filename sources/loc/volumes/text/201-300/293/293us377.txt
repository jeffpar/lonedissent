Syllabus.

subdivision e.' .These special exceptions exclude any
other."
By the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 840) § 23b was
further amended so as to include in the exception suits
for the recovery of property under section 70, subdivision
e. See Weidhorn v. Levy, 253 U. S. 268, 272.
We think that the exceptions thus established by the
amending acts show clearly that it was the intent of the
Congress that § 23b should operate as a grant of jurisdiction to the federal court of suits brought by a trustee
in bankruptcy against adverse claimants, provided the
defendant consented to be sued in that court, although
the bankrupt could not have broukht suit there if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, and that,
in suits falling within the exceptions, the federal court
should have jurisdiction without the defendant's consent.
The question was not necessarily involved in the case of
Lovell v. Newman & Son, 227 U. S. 412, 426, and so far
as the language of the opinion indicated a contrary view,
it is not approved. Compare MacDonald v. Plymouth
Trust Co., 286 U. S. 263, 268; Page v. Arkansas Gas
Corp., 286 U. S. 269, 271, 272.
We conclude that the court had jurisdiction in the
instant case, and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals setting aside the order of the District Court and
directing that court to hear and determine the controversy
upon its merits is affirmed.
Decree affirmed.

PER CURIAM.

Review was limited to the question of the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The suit was brought'
for the infringement of the common law right of property in a song, and the bill sought an accounting of profits
made by the defendant. The District Court sustained
the plaintiff's right as author and found infringement.
Decree was entered granting an injunction and appointing a special master to take and state an account of profits
and to report to the court, with the usual provisions for'
exceptions to the report. The decree was interlocutory.
