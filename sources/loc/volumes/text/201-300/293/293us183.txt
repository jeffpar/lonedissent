ending April 30, 1925, were subjected to an increased rate for the
four months following January 1, 1925, by the Revenue Act of 1926,
operating rptroactively. They filed an additional return merely
referring to the net income- previously reported and applying the
new rate to the part of the income attributable to those four
months. Held that the period of limitation against deficiency assessments prescribed by § 277 (a) (1) of the 1926 Act began to run

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO

293 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases present in slightly different circumstances
a question substantially the same. as the one consider6d
in Nos. 37 to 39, decided herewith. [Zellerbach Paper
Co. v. Helvering, ante, p. 172.1
Here, on .uly 15, 1925, the Zellerbach Paper Company
filed for itself anil its subsidiary, National Paper Products Company, a consolidated return under the Revenue
Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 253) for the fiscal year ending April
30, 1925.
On February 26, 1926, the Revenue Act of 1926 (44
Stat. 9) was enacted effective retroactively in respect of
income taxes (with exceptions not now important) as of
January 1, 1925. §§ 286, i200.
The tax payable by the petitioners for the preceding
fiscal year was changed by the new act in one respect only.
For the four months of that year following January 1,
1925, the 121/1 per cent. tax fixed by the Act of 1924 was
increased to 13 per cent, § 230 (a) (1), an amount ascertainable through a simple computation when once the
data had been supplied for separating income attributable
to 1925 from income attributable to an earlier time. For
other taxpayers differently situated the changes might
be different or greater. So far as the new act affected the
petitioners it changed the rate and nothing else.
In accordance with Treasury Decision 3843 * which
Any corporation which has filed a return for a fiscal year ending in 1925 and paid or become liable for a tax computed under the
re-venue act of 1924, and is subject to additional tax for the same
period under the revenue act of 1926, must file a new return covering
such additional tax on or before May 15, 1926. Payment of the
additional tax may be made at the time the return is filed or,
if installment payments are desired, such installments must be paid
-it the time they would be due if based upon a return for the fiscal
year ended February 28, 1926."

Opinion of the Court.

called for an additional return wnenever there was an additional tax, the Zellerbach Paper Company for itself ad
its subsidiary filed a document which amounted to an
"amended return" and was so stamped by a representative of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The new
return did not repeat what had been stated in the return
of July, 1925, then upon the files. All that it did was to
refer to the net inicome as previously reported, and then
apply the new rate to that part of the income stated to
be attributable to 1925.
On October 10j 1928, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue gave notice of deficiency assessments against the
two petitioners. The period of limitation prescribed by
the Act of 1926. is three years after the filing of the return.
§ 277 (a. (1). .If the three years began tW run 'uponthe
filing of the original return in July, 1925, th9 assessments
were too late, If the term began to run when the additional return was filed (May 14," 1926), the assessments
were in time.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed
the determination of the Board of Tax Appeals, 26 B. T.
A. 92, upholding the action of the Commissioner, 69 F.
(2d) 857, and again, as in Nos. 37 to 39, refused to adhere to a contrary ruling in courts of cordinate jurisdiction: Myles Salt Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner, 49 F. (2d)
232; Isaac Goldmann Co. v. Commissioner,60 App. D. C.
2.65; 51 F (2d) 427; Valentine-Clark Co. v. Commissioner,
52 F. (2d) 346. Writs of certiorari followed.. 292 U. S.
621.
The points of difference between: these cases and Nos.
37 to 39 are these: Here the new statute was the Revenue
Act of 1926, superseding as of January 1, 1925,' the Act
of 1924; there the new statute was the Act of 1921,
superseding as of January 1, 1921, the Act of 1918. 'Here
the change applicable to the petitioners was an increase
of the rate; there the applicable change was the disallow-

ance of a credit. Here the taxpayers filed an additional
returxi, supplementing the original one by a statement of
the additional taxes due; there the taxpayer stood upon
the original return, and omitted to. file another.
The conclusion is unaffected by any of these points of
difference.
For reasons stated in our opinion i4 Nos. 37 to 39, the
period of limitation began to run on the filing of the first
return, and a return for additional taxes, even if filed afterwards, was an amendment or supplement which didnot toll the statute.
The decrees should be
Reversed.
