Statement of the Case.

The Negotiable Instruments Law of Wisconsin was part
of the law of that state. when the bonds in controversy
were pledged. This being so, the decision in Pollard v.
To]bin supplies the governing rule irrespective of the date
when the decision was announced. In that view, Kuhn v.
Fairmont Coal Co. is seen to be irrelevant. there is no
occasion in such circumstances to mark its limits more
precisely. Hawks v. Hamill, supra.
The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for
further proceedings in accordance with this opinioh.
Reversed.

Opinion of the Court.

293 U. S.

Mr. Coleman Avery, with whom Messrs. Paul A.
Baden, Frank H. Shaffer, Jr., and John W. Peck were on
the brief, for petitioner.
Messrs. Province M. Pogue and Henry B. Street for
respondent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
In granting the writ of certiorari, we limited our review to the question of the jurisdiction of the District
Court under § 23 (b) of the Bankruptcy Act. That provision, and its immediate context, § 23 (a), are set forth
in the margin.1 44 Stat. 664;-11 U. S. C., § 46 (a) (b).
This is a plenary suit brought by respondent, trustee
in bankruptcy, in the District Court t.o enjoin the sale
of certain property, alleged to be fixtures, attached to the
manufacturing plant of the bankrupt, which petitioner,
as sheriff, was threatening to sell under an execution
issued more than four months prior to the bankruptcy
proceeding upon a judgment recovered against the :bank'Section 23 (a) (b), as amended by the Act of May 27, 1926, c. 406,
§ 8, is as follows:
"Sec. 23 (a). The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction of all controversies ht law and in equity, as. distinguished from
proceedings in- bankruptcy, between trustees as such and adverse
claimants concerning the property acquired or claimed by the trustees, in the same manner and to the same extent only as though bankrup" -y proceedings had not been instituted and such controversies had
beer. between the bankrupts and such adverse claimants.
"(b) Suits by the trustee shall be brought or prosecuted only in the
courts where the bankrupt, w4hose estate is being administered by such
trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings jn
bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant, except suits for the recovery of property under
section 60, subdivision b; section 67, subdivision e; and section 70,
subdivision e."

Opinion of the Court.

rupt in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County,
Ohio. The trustee's petition alleged that sale by the
sheriff, pending a determination whether or not the property was a part of the realty, would cause irreparable
damage to the bankrupt's estate. The trustee contends
that the sheriff's levy upon the property in question was
invalid under the law of Ohio, and that at the time of the
filing of the petition in bankruptcy all writs of venditioni
exponas, or orders for the sale of the real estate, had expired, and also that, as there were mortgages upon the
property, the appropriate method of enforcing the judgment was by a creditor's bill.
The sheriff first appeared specially, asserting his claim
by virtue of levy under execution, and sought dismissal of
the suit upon the ground that the court was without jurisdiction. Shortly after,. the sheriff withdrew his motion to
dismiss, entered his general appearance, and made answer
to the petition, expressly consenting that the District
Court should hear and determine all matters to which the
petition referred. The sheriff in this answer, after stating
that he had levied upon personal property and real estate
of the judgment debtor, said that a controversy had arisen
whether or not certain items of "chattel property," set
forth in the exhibit attached to the trustee's petition,
were "in law fixtures and therefore a part of the real
estate "; that it would be necessary to have that question
determined so that he might be advised as to what part of
the "chattel property," he had a right: to sell under the
execution; and that he did not know "as a matter of law
whether the levy so made by him upon the real estate"
was or was not a valid levy, and fherefore he put the
plaintiff "on proof thereof." The next day the sheriff
asked leave to withdraw his answer.. The disposition of
that motion does not appear and the court below has
assumed that it was not pressed. Later, the sheriff again

moved to dismiss the cause for the want of jurisdiction,
and the motion was granted.
This order was reyersed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
That court concluded that the validity of the trustee's
claim, and of that of the sheriff, depended upon disputed
facts and issues of law; that the adverse claim of the
sheriff was substantial and that its merits could be adjudged only in a plenary suit; that this proceeding should
be treated as one of that nature and that there was consent
to the jurisdiction of the District Court within the meaning of § 23 (b) of the Bankruptcy Act. As the case had
not been heard upon its merits, and the record presented
no findings of fact or conclusions of law, the Circuit Court
of Appeals did not deal with aiy question except that of
jurisdiction and directed that the cause be remanded to
the District Court with instructions to hear and determine
the controversy.
The trustee's petition, which the Circuit Court of Appeals treated as a bill of complaint, did not allege diversity
of citizenship. Nor did it contain clear and sufficient
averments showing that the complainant, as against the
sheriff claiming under a judgment recovered and an execution issued more than four months before the bankruptcy, had possession of the property in question by
virtue of which the District Court would have jurisdiction
of the suit irrespective of the consent of the defendant.2
The case thus turns on the effect. of the sheriff's consent
under § 23 (b). The sheriff contends that he had no
authority to give the consent; but he was the defendant

Opinion of the Court.

in the suit and his consent was actually given. We find
no ground for concluding that the consent was invalid.
Conflicting views have been held of the, meaning of the
provision for. consent in § 23 (b). In one view, the provision relates merely to venue, that is, only to a consent to
the" local jurisdiction." Matthew v. Coppin, 32 F. (2d)
100, 101. See, also, McEldowney .v. Card, 19.3 Fed. 475,
479;:De Friece v. Bryant, 232 Fed. 233, 236;' Operators'
Piano Co. v. First Wisconsin Trust Co., 28*3 Fed. 904, 906;
Coyle v. Duncan Spangler Coal Co., 288 Fed. 897, 901:
Stiefel v. 14th Street Realty Corp., 48 F. (2d) 1041, 1043.
Compare Lovell v. Newman & Son, 227 U. S. 412,. 426.
It has been said that if § 23 (b) affects "substantive
jurisdiction," as distinct from venue, § 23 (a) appears to
be redundant. Stiefel v. 14th Street Realty Corp., supra.
The opposing view was set forth by the court below in
Toledo Fence ,& Post Co. v. Lyons, 290 Fed. 637, 645, and
that decision was followed in the instant case. See, also,
Boonville National Bank v. Blakey, 107 Fed. 891, 893;
Seegmiller v. Day, 249 Fed. 177, 178; Stiefel v. 14th Street
Realty Corp., supra;Lowenstein v. Reikes, 60 F. (2d) 933,
935.: It proceeds upon the ground that the Congress had
power to permit suits by trustees in bankruptcy in the
federal courts against adverse claimants, regardless of diversity of citizenship, and that by § 23 (b) the Congress
intended that the federal courts should have that jurisdiction in cases where the defendant gave consent, and,
without that consent, in cases which fell within the stated
exceptions.
We think that the latter view is the correct one. The
provisions of the earlier bankruptcy acts and the purpose and significance of § 23 of the Act of 1898, as originally enacted, were elaborately considered in Bardes v.
Hawarden Bank, 178 U. S. 524. Section 8 of the Act of
1841 (5 Stat. 446) conferred on the Circuit Courts con-

current jurisdiction with the District Courts of all suits,
at law or in equity, between assignees in bankruptcy and
adverse claimants. This broad grant of jurisdiction was
continued in § 2 of the Act of 1867. 14 Stat. 518. Lathrop v. Drake, 91 U. S.516. The Act of 1867 recognized
and emphatically declared the distinction between proceedings in bankruptcy, properly so-called, and independent suits between assignees in bankruptcy and adverse
claimants. Jurisdiction of such suits was conferred upon
the District Courts and Circuit Courts of the United
States by the express provision to that effect in § 2 of
that act, and was not derived from the other provisions of
§§ 1 and 2, conferring-jurisdiction of proceedings in bankruptcy. Bardes v. Hawarden ,,Bank, supra, p. 533. The
jurisdiction of such suits in law and equity was of; the
same character as that conferred upon the Circuit Courts
by the eleventh section of the Judiciary Act of 1789
(Morgan v. Thornhill, 11 Wall. 65, 80) and the conferring
of that jurisdiction upon the federal courts did not divest
or impair the jurisdiction of the state courts over like
cases. Eyster v. Gaff, 91 U. S. 521, 525; Bardes v.
Hawarden Bank, supra, pp. 532, 533.
It was with this -legislative background that the Congress undertook the framing of the Act of 1898. 30 Stat.
544. The distinction between proceedings in bankruptcy
and suits between trustees in bankruptcy and adverse
claimants was maintained. As appellate jurisdiction had
been vested in the Circuit Courts of Appeals by the Act
of :1891 (26 Stat. 826), the Act of 1898, in lieu of the
"general superintendence and jurisdiction " given to the
Circuit Courts by the Act of 1867 " of all cases and questions " arising in bankruptcy, conferred upon the CircuiA
Courts of Appeals the jurisdiction " to superintend and
revise in matter of law the proceedings of the several
inferior courts of bankruptcy within their jurisdiction."

SCHUMACHER v. B3EELER.

373

Opinion of the Court.

§ 24 b. But the Circuit Courts at that time were still
courts of original jurisdiction and, by § 23 of the Act of
1898, the Congress provided the extent to which the Circuit Courts should have jurisdicti6n of suits at law or in
equity between trustees in bankruptcy and adverse claimants. Section 23,. as originally enacted, was as follows
(30 Stat. 552, 553):
"SEc. 23. Jurisdiction of United States 'and State
Courts."a The United States circuit courts shall have jurisdiction of all controversies at law and in equity, as distinguished from proceedings in bankruptcy, between
trustees as such and adverse claimants concerning the
property acquired or claimed by the trustees, in the same
manner and to the same extent only as though bankruptcy
proceedings had not been instituted and such controversies
had been between the bankrupts and Such adverse
claimants.
"b Suits by the trustee shall'only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is
being administered by such trustee, might have brought or
prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been
instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant.
"c The United States circuit courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of bankruptcy, within
their respective territorial limits, of the offenses enumerated in this Act."
Section 23a thus related exclusively to the Circuit
Courts. Section 23b applied both to the Circuit Courts
and the District Courts, as well:as to the state courts.
"This appears," said the Court in Bardes v. Hawarden
Bank, supra, (p. 536) "not only by the clear words of the
title of the section, but also by the use, in this clause, of
the general words, 'the courts,' as contrasted with the
specific words, 'the United States Circuit Courts,' in the

374

293 U. S.

first and in the third clauses." The argument that if § 23b
affects "substantive jurisdiction," § 23a is redundant,
loses sight of the original distinction and application of
the section and of its historical development.
By § 289 of the Judicial Code of 1911 (36 Stat. 1167),
the Circuit Courts were abolished; and by § 291 of that
Act it was provided that wherever, in any law not embraced within the Judicial Code, any power or duty is'
conferred or imposed upon the Circuit Courts, that power
and duty shall- be deemed to be conferred and imposed
upon the District Courts. This provision had the effect
of amending § 23a of the Bankruptcy Act so as to make
it apply to the United States District Courts instead of the
United States Circuit Courts, Formal amendment, to
conform the language of the section to the fact, was made
by the Act of May 27, 1926. 44 Stat. 664.
In enacting § 23, it was clearly the intent of the Congress. that the federal courts should not have the unrestricted jurisdiction of suits between trustees in bankruptcy and adverse claimants which these courts had
exercised under the broad provisions of § 2 of the Act of
1867. The purpose was to leave such controversies to be
heard and determined for the most part in the state courts
" to the greater economy and convenience of litigants and
witnesses." But no reason appeared for a denial of jurisdiction to the federal court if the defendant, the adverse
claimant, consented to be sued in that court. The Congress, by virtue of its constitutional authority over bankruptcies, could confer or withhold jurisdiction to entertain
such suits and could prescribe the conditions upon which
the federal courts should have jurisdiction. See Sherman
v. Bingham, 21 Fed. Cas. (No. 12,762), 1270, 1272. Exer-'
cising that power, the Congress prescribed in § 23b the
condition of consent on the part of the defendant sued by
the trustee. Section 23b was thus in effect a grant of
jurisdiction subject to that condition.

SCHUMACHER v. BEELER.
367

Opinion of the Court.

That this was the interpretation by this Court of § 23b,
inits original form, is shown not only by the statement of
the result of the Court's analysis in the Bardes case, supra,
(p.538) but quite clearly by its formal disposition of the
questions before it. The Bardes case was a bill in equity
in the District Court by a trustee in bankruptcy to set
aside a conveyance of property in fraud of creditors. The
)istrict Court dismissed the bill for want of jurisdiction
and the case came here on direct appeal with a certificate
by the District Judge submitting the questions which had
arisen. This Court considered those questions and specifi,eallyanswered the first and second questions as follows:
" lst. The provisions of the second clause of section 23
of the Bankrupt Act of 1898 control and limit the jurisdiction of all courts, including the several District Courts
of the United States, over suits brought by trustees in
bankruptcy to recover or collect' debts due from third
parties, or to set aside transfers of property to third
parties, alleged to be fraudulent as against creditors, including payments in money or property to preferred
creditors.
" 2d. The District Court of the United States can, by
the proposed defendants' consent, but not otherwise. entertain jurisdiction over suits brought by trustees in bankruptcy to set aside fraudulent transfers of money or property. made by, the bankrupt to third parties before the
institution of the proceedings in bankruptcy."
As there was no pretence of consent of the defendant
in that case, the District Court was found to be without
jurisdiction and its decree was accordig1ly affirmed.
Compare Mueller v. Nugent, 184 U. S. 1, 16; Spencer v.
Duplan Silk Co., 191 U. S' 526. 531; Whitney v. Wenman,
198 U. S. 539, 552; Bushv. Elliott, 202 U. S. 477, 479, 483;
Harrisv. First Niotional Bank, 216 U. S.382, 383; Wood v.
Wilbert's Co., 226 U. S. 384, 387.
After the decision in the Bardes case, and by § 8 of the
Act of February 5, 1903 (32 Stat. 797, 798), § 23b was

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Opinion of the Court.

293 U.S.

amended by -adding, after the words " unless by consent
of the proposed defendant," the following:
"except suits for the recovery of property under section
sixty,, subdivision b, and section sixty-seven, subdivision e."
The excepted suits are those brought by the trustee in
bankruptcy to recover property transferred by the bankrupt in effecting preferences made voidable by the Act,
and suits to recover property conveyed by the bankrupt
in fraud of creditors within four months prior to the filing
of the petition in bankruptcy. The effect of the exception was to remove, as to these classes of cases, the requirement in § 23b of the consent of the defendant as a condition of the exercise of jurisdiction. The Act of 1903
also amended sections 60b, 67e, and 70e, so as to
provide that in suits to recover property under those
sections " any court of bankruptcy," and "any state
court " which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy
had not intervened, " shall have concurrent jurisdiction,".
Act of February 5, 1903, §§ 13, 16; 32 Stat. 799, 800. The
scope of the amendment of § 23b by the Act of 1903, in
the light of the amendment by the same Act of section'.
,70, e-a question which was left undetermined in Harris v.
First National Bank, supra (p. 385)-was passed upon in
Wood v. Wilbert's Co., supra (pp. 389, 390). The Court.
,there decided that the amendment of section 70e could not
be regarded as intended to create a conflict with the
amendment of § 23b, which did not include-in the exception suits .brought under section 70e. The Court said:
'In other words, the respective sections and their subdivisions confer jurisdiction on the designated courts so
far as it isdependent upon the character of the suits, but
when t. .ondition expressed in subdivision b of § 23
exists the:consent of the defendant determines the court,
.except when the suit is 'for the recovery of property
under section sixty, subdivision.b, and section sixty-seven,

GEORGE v. VICTOR CO.

Syllabus.

subdivision e.' .These special exceptions exclude any
other."
By the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 840) § 23b was
further amended so as to include in the exception suits
for the recovery of property under section 70, subdivision
e. See Weidhorn v. Levy, 253 U. S. 268, 272.
We think that the exceptions thus established by the
amending acts show clearly that it was the intent of the
Congress that § 23b should operate as a grant of jurisdiction to the federal court of suits brought by a trustee
in bankruptcy against adverse claimants, provided the
defendant consented to be sued in that court, although
the bankrupt could not have broukht suit there if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, and that,
in suits falling within the exceptions, the federal court
should have jurisdiction without the defendant's consent.
The question was not necessarily involved in the case of
Lovell v. Newman & Son, 227 U. S. 412, 426, and so far
as the language of the opinion indicated a contrary view,
it is not approved. Compare MacDonald v. Plymouth
Trust Co., 286 U. S. 263, 268; Page v. Arkansas Gas
Corp., 286 U. S. 269, 271, 272.
We conclude that the court had jurisdiction in the
instant case, and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals setting aside the order of the District Court and
directing that court to hear and determine the controversy
upon its merits is affirmed.
Decree affirmed.
