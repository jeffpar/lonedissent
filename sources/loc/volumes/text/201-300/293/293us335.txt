MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW
YORK v. JOHNSON, ADMINISTRATOR.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 154.

Argued November 15, 1934.-Decided December 3, 1934.

A life insurance policy, issued in Virginia to a resident of that State,
provided that if the insured, before attaining a certain age and
while no premium was in default, should furnish the company due
proof of his being totally and permanently disabled, the company
would grant him specified monthly payments from receipt of such
proof through the remainder of his lifetime as long as such disability continued, and would also, after receipt of such proof,
waive payment of each premium as it thereafter became due during
such disability. Before the expiration of a period of grace allowed
for payment of a premium, the insured became totally and permanently disabled, both physically and mentally, to such an extent
that he was unable to give notice to the company in advance of
default, and thus procure the waiver called for by the policy. The
disability persisted until his death. Held:
1. The contract.is to be interpreted according to the law of Virginia where delivery was made. p. 339.
2. So interpreted, the right to have the premiums waived during
the disability was not lost by the failure to give notice, caused by
the disability. Id.
3. The question concerns merely the meaning implied in the
words of a highly specialized condition, involving no rule of the
law merchant or general principle of the law of insurance contracts;
it is a doubtful one upon which the courts of the country are divided; and. in deciding it, this Court (though it may have power
to do otherwise) will be guided in its decision by. the law of the
State of the contract. P. 339.
70 F. (2d) 41, affirmed.

to review a judgment which reversed a

judgment on a verdict directed by the District Court for
the Insurance Company in an action on a life insurance
policy.
Mr. James C. Martin, with whom Mr. Frederick L.
Allen was on the brief, for petitioner.
Messrs. Burnett Miller and John S. Barbour for
respondent.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO

delivered the opinion of the Court.

On May 16, 1930, the petitioner, the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, issued in Virginia to
Benjamin F. Cooksey, who resided in that state, a policy
of life insurance in the amount of $4,500 with disability
benefits. Upon the face of the policy, it is provided that
if the insured is totally and permanently disabled before
the age of sixty, the company will pay him " forty-five
dollars monthly during such disability . . ., besides waiving premium payments, all upon conditions set forth in
section 3." The conditions thus incorporated by reference are these: "If, before attaining the age of sixty
years and while no premium on the policy is in default,
the Insured shall furnish to the Company due proof that
he is totally and permanently disabled,. . . the Company
will grant the following benefits during the remaining lifetime of the Insured as long as such disability continues.
Benefits (a) . . . The Company will pay a monthly income to the Insured of the amount stated on the first page
hereof . . . beginning upon receipt of due proof of such
-disability . . . (b) Waiver of Premiums. The Company
will also, after receipt of such due proof, waive payment
of each premium as it thereafter becomes due during such

disability." There is also a provision that the policy will
be reinstated within six months after a default if proof
is given within that time that at the date of the default
the insured was totally disabled and has continuously
remained so.
A quarterly premium became payable under this policy
upon November 16, 1931, subject, however, to a period of
grace of thirty-one days, whereby the time for payment
was extended until December 17. This premium was
never paid by the insured, though all earlier premiums
had been paid as they matured. On December 17, the
date of the default, the insured, who was under sixty,
was confined to his bed, a sufferer from chronic nephritis,
which on January 20, 1932, resulted in his death. There
is evidence by concession that as early as December 14,
1931, he was totally and permanently disabled, not only
physically but mentally, to such an extent that he was
unable to give notice to the insurer in advance of the default, and thus procure the waiver called for by the policy.
The company takes the ground that because of the omission of that notice the default is unexcused and the policy
has lapsed.
In this action by the administrator the District Court
upheld the company's position, and directed a verdict for
the defendant. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit reversed, and remanded the cause for trial. 70
F. (2d) 41. For the defendant it was argued that insanity is no more an excuse for the failure to give a
notice that will cause the payment of the premiums to
be waived than for the failure to make payment of the
premiums when waiver is not a duty, either conditional
or absolute. Cf. Klein v. Insurance Co., 104 U. S. 88.
For the plaintiff it was argued that waiver having been
promised, though subject to a condition as to notice, there
must be a liberal construction of a requirement that is

merely modal or procedural, and the insurer will not be
deemed, in respect of matters of that order, to have
exacted the impossible. The controversy is one as to
which the courts of the country are arrayed in opposing

panies v. Boykin, 12 Wall. 433, 436; Restatement of the
Law of Contracts, American Law Institute, ยง 301 (4).
The case is here on certiorari.
We think the contract is to be interpreted in accordance with the law of Virginia where delivery was made.
Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. McCue, 223 U. S.
234; Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Clements, 140
U. S.226; Scudder v. Union National Bank, 91 U. S. 406,
412, 413. As to the meaning and obligation of such a
policy, the highest court of the State has spoken in
Swann v. Atlantic Life Ins. Co., supra, construing a provision substantially the same as the one in controversy
here. The ruling there was that notice was excused by
physical and mental incapacity to give it. "When the
disability of the insured occurred while the policy was in
force, he was entitled to have his premiums waived until
his death, for his disability continued until his death. - He
had paid for this right, and to say that he should lose. the
benefit of his policy because he failed, through mental
and physical incapacity, to present proofs would be
harsh and unreasonable under the circumstances."
In this situation we are not under a duty to make a
choice for ourselves between alternative constructions as
if the courts of the place of the contract were silent or
uncertain. Without suggesting an independent preference either one way or the other, we yield to the judges
of Virginia expounding a Virginia policy and adjudging
its effect. The case will not be complicated by a consideration of our power to pursue some other course. The
summum jus of power, whatever it may be, will be subordinated at times to a benign and prudent comity. At
least in cases of uncertainty we steer away from a collision between courts of state and nation when harmony
can be attained without the sacrifice of ends of national
importance. No question as to a rule of the law merchant is present in this case. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1.

No question is here as to any general principle of the law
of contracts of insurance (Carpenterv. Providence Washington Ins. Co., 16 Pet. 2495, 511; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v.
Moore, 231 U. S. 543, 559), with consequences broader
than those involved in the construction of a highly specialized condition. All that is here for our decision is
the meaning, the tacit implications, of a particular set of
words, which, as experience has shown, may yield a different answer to this reader and to that one. With choice
so "balanced with doubt," we accept as our guide the
law declared by the state where the contract had its
being. Trainor Co. v. Aetna Casualty Co., 290 U. S. 47,

1. By the law of the District of Columbia, a forged signature of
the payee on a check is inoperative to pass to a subsequent bona
fide holder for value, either the title to the instrument, or the
right to enforce payment, or the right to retain the proceeds if
payment is made in ignorance of the forgery. P. -345.
2. Under settled principles of conflict of laws, the validity of a
transfer of a chattel brought into a country by consent of the
owner, is governed by the law of that country; and this rule
"applies to neg(tiable instruments. P. 345.

drawn and payable in the District of Columbia, but which was
