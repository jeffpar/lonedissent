IRVING TRUST CO. v. BOWDITCH.

breach of the lease may not be proved. We hold
otherwise.
By the terms of the contract the filing of the petition
in bankruptcy was, of itself, and irrespective of the election of lessor or lessee, a breach of the lease. The claim
of the landlord, consequent upon the breach, arose and
*matured at the moment. of the filing of the petition. The
claim is not for rent reserved or upon the lease as such,
but is founded upon an independent express contract, and
hence within the very words of § 63 (a) 4.
The Circuit Court c6nstrued the stipulation as an
agreement on the part oi. the tenant to pay as. liquidated
damages, in the event of the specified breach, an amount
equal to the difference between the present fair value of
the remaining rent due under the lease and the present
fair rental value of the premises for the balance of the
term. The covenant is fairly susceptible of this construction. So read, the court held the clause provided a reasonable formula for ascertaining the damages of the landlord, did not smack of a penalty, and was therefore
enforceable. See Win. Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed, 245
U. S.597. We concur in the view that the contract, as
its terms were interpreted and applied, supports a provable claim for the stipulated damages.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF - INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. TWIN BELL OIL SYNDICATE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 170. Argued November 15, 16, 1934.-Decided December 3, 1934.
1. The legislative history of § 204 (c) (2) of the Revenue Act of
1926 shows that this section does not grant a deduction for depletion but merely provides methods for computing the amount of the
deduction granted by § 234 (a) (8) of the Act. Pp. 315, 319.
2. The deduction for depletion in the case of a lease of oil and gas
wells must be apportioned between the lessor and lessee as provided
by § 234 (a) (8), irrespective of which of the methods prescribed
by § 204 for computing the amount of the deduction is chosen.
