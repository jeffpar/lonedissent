PER CURIAM.

The Circuit Court of Appeals has certified the following questions:
"Question 1. Where, on an appeal properly" in this
court, the appellee contends that one of the assignments
'of errors has been- abandoned and all others are not presentable because defective either as assignments of errors
or as specifications of errors and urges affirmance of the
decree appealed from and this court determines that such
contention is well founded in all respects and that no
issue on the merits is, for such reasons, presentable to it,
is it proper to affirm the decree appealed from?

Syllabus.

"Question 2. If question 1 should be answered in the
negative, should the order of this court be a dismissal
without prejudice?"
Where an appellant fails to file assignments of error as
required by the applicable rule (28 U. S. C. 862, 880; Rule
No. 11 of the Rules of the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit), the appeal may be dismissed. Compare Rules of this Court No. 9 and No. 27, pars. 4, 5. But
where an appeal is properly before the Court and, upon
hearing the appeal, the Court determines that such' assignments of error as have been duly filed have been abandoned, the Court may affirm the decree from which the
appeal is taken.
Question No. 1 is answered in the affirmative.
