SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 51.

Argued November 7, 1934.-Decided December 3, 1934.

1. A corporation which sold an issue of bonds at a discount and

paid commissions for marketing them, and which keeps its accounts
and makes its returns on the accrual basis, may amortize the commissions as well as the discount over the life of the bonds; and
the amount so allocated to each year may be deducted from gross
income as a loss or expense of that year. P. 284.

JUSTICE

STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

Prior to 1913 respondent, directly or through a subsidiary corporation, sold three issues of bonds, all maturing
at dates subsequent to 1923. All were sold at a discount
and petitioner paid or allowed to bankers an additional
amount as commisions for marketing the bonds. The
commissions and discounts, amortized over the periods

from the dates of issue to maturity of the bonds, exceeded
$300,000 in each of its taxable years 1918 to 1923 inclusive. Respondent kept its books and made its tax returns on the accrual basis. Deduction from gross income,
in its tax returns, of the amortized amount of the commissions and discount was disallowed by the Commissioner, who found a corresponding !,ficiency under the
applicable Revenue Acts of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, and
1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227.
The Board of Tax Appeals ruled that the petitioner
was entitled to the deduction for the discount but not
commissions. 26 B. T. A. 11.26. On the appeal of the
taxpayer alone the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Board, holding that the commissions
should be treated in the same manner as the discount and
that the deductions were rightly made. 69 F. (2d) 67.
This Court granted certiorari on the petition of the Commissioner, which set up that the decision below conflicted
with that of the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit,
in Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Commissioner, 47 F.
(2d) 990, see also Bonded Mortgage Co. v. Comnmissioner,
70 F. (2d) 341, and is inconsistent with the decision of
this Court in Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, 284
U. S.552, which held that premiums received by the taxpayer upon the sale of its bonds before 1913 could not be
subjected to income tax in later years by the expedient
of prorating them over the period between the date of
issue of the bonds and their maturity.
In support of the petition the Government contends
that the commissionzs are ,iot. as tht cout below held,
losses incurred in the taxable year which are deductible
under ยง 234 (a) (4) of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and
1921, although not to be realized until payment of the
bonds at maturity. It inbists instead that the commissions are expenses incurred and -paid at the date of the

15ond issue which cannot, on any theory, be deducted in
later years. Further, it contends that the amortization
of the commissions paid before 1913 and their deduction
as amortized in tax returns in later years is inconsistent
with the decision of this Court in Old Colony R. Co. v.
Commissioner,supra.
1. There is no provision in either the 1918 or 1921 Revenue Acts specifically authorizing the deduction from
gross income of commissions or discount paid or allowed
by the taxpayer upon an issue of bonds. Section 234
of the 1918 and 1921 Acts, like the corresponding. provisions of the Acts before and since, allow deduction of
expenses paid or incurred, interest paid or accrued, and
losses sustained during the taxable year. Sections 212 (b)
and 213 (a) of the 1918 and 1921 Acts, like ยง 13 (d) of
the 1916 Act, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 771, authorize the taxpayer to make his income tax returns on the accrual basis
where his books are kept on that basis and reflect true
income; they require it if he fails or is unable to make
his return on a cash receipts and disbursements basis.
The taxpayer is thus enabled to charge against income of
the taxable period expenses incurred in and properly attributable to the process of earning income during that
period, although payable in a later one. See United
States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 440; Aluminum Castings Co. v. Routzhan, 282 U. S. 92; Niles Bement Pond
Co. v. United States, 281 U. S. 357. It follows that when
the return is made on the accrual basis, expenses or obligations incurred by the taxpayer in connection with a
bond issue, which are not discharged until the payment
of the bonds at maturity, may properly be accrued or
amortized over the period of the life of the bonds and
allowed as annual deductions from gross income.
By Article 150, Treasury Regulations 33, as revised,
relating to the 1916 Revenue Act, both commissions and
discount upon bond issues of the taxpayer were classified

Opinion of the Court.

as losses sustained on payment of the bonds at maturity,
and taxpayers were permitted to amortize them over the
life of the bonds and deduct them as amortized from gross
income in each year, These regulations were continued
under the 1918 and 1921 Acts, but the reference to commissions was omitted.'
Art. 544 of T. R. 45; Art. 545
of T. R. 62. The Board of Tax Appeals has consistently
applied the regulations as to bond discount allowed before
1913 and in each case, as in the present, the Government,
by failing to seek review of the ruling, has acquiesced
in it.2
1 Notwithstanding this change in the regulations, the Commissioner
appears to have continued to permit taxpayers to amortize and deduct commissions paid on bond issues prior to 1913, as the regulations under the 1916 Act had expressly permitted. A change of practice was sanctioned in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v.
Commissioner, 13 B. T. A. 988, 1034, affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit, 47 F. (2d) 990, 991, where the taxpayer,
while allowed to deduct bond discount, was not allowed to deduct
from gross income the amortized expenses of a bond issue incurred
before 1913. This refusal to allow amortization of commissions was
confined to the case of bonds issued before 1913.
Treasury regulations have also been silent as to commissions on
bonds issued after that date. Art. 544 of T. R. 45; Art. 545 of T. R.
62, 65, 69; Art 68 of T. R. 75, 77. But there are a number of Treasury rulings which permit the amortization of commissions on bonds
issued after 1913. 0. D. 936, 4 Cum. Bul. 276; 0. D. 959, 4 Cum.
Bul. 12-; I. T. 1412, 1-2 Cum. Bul. 91; I. T. 1962, 111-1 Cum. Bul.

to allow the amortization, on the theory that the bonds were issued
not by the taxpayer but by a predecessor corporation. Western

by the taxpayer the Board was reversed. .33 F. (2d) 695, 697
(C.. C. A. 4th). The Government did not seek review.

293 U. S.

Both commissions and discount, as the Government
concedes, are factors in arriving at the actual amount of
interest paid for the use of capital procured by a bond
issue. The difference between the capital realized by
the issue and par value, which is to be paid at maturity,
must be added to the aggregate coupon payments in order
to arrive at the total interest paid. Both discount and
commissions are included in this difference. If the difference be viewed as a loss resulting from the funding operation, it is one which is realized only upon the payment
of the bonds at maturity.
But even if the commissions, unlike discount, may, as
the Government insists, be regarded as a contemporary
expense of procuring capital, it is one properly chargeable
to capital account. In practice it is taken out of the proceeds of the bonds by the banker. 'But in any case it must
be deducted from the selling price to arrive at the capital
realized by the taxpayer from the sale of the bonds, in
return for which he must, at maturity, pay the face value
of the bonds. The effect of the transaction in reducing
the capital realized, whether through the payment of
commissions or the allowance of discount, is the same.
In this respect the commissions do not differ from brokerage commissions paid upon the purchase or sale of property. The regulations have consistently treated such
commissions, not as items of current expense, but as additions to the cost of the property or deductions from the
proceeds of sale, in arriving at net capital profit or loss for
purposes of computing the tax.'
3 Art. 8 of T. R. 33, revised; Art. 293 of T. R. 45, 62; Art. 292 of
T. R. 65, 69; Art. 282 of T. R. 74, 77; Hutton v. Commissioner, 12
B. T. A. 265, 266. Commissions paid to a banker for selling the taxpayer's corporate 'stock' have not been allowed to be deducted as a
current business expense, but have been treated as a capital expenditure. Simmons Co. v. Commissioner. 33 F. (2d) 75, 76 (C. C. A.
1st); Appeal of Charles H. Lilly Co., 2 B. T. A. 1058; Appeal of
Emerson Electric Manufacturing Co., 3 B. T. A. 932, 935; Harrisburg

Opinion of the Court.

Here the commissions, when paid. were properly chargeable against capital, and reduced by their amount the
capital realized by the taxpayer from the bond issue.
They come out of the pocket of the taxpayer only on payment of the bonds at maturity. But, unlike the purchase
and sale of property, the transaction contemplated from
the beginning a fixed date, the due date of the bonds, at
which the difference between the net -amount of capital
realized upon the issue and the par value of the bonds
must be paid to bondholders by the taxpayer. We think
that the revenue acts, as they have been interpreted by
this Court and the treasury regulations upon this and
related subjects, require that this difference between re-'
ceipts and disbursements of the taxpayer should, in some
form, enter into the computation of his taxable income.
It is a loss to the taxpayer, definite as to its date and
amount, and represents a part of the cost of the borrowed
capital during each year of the life of the bond issue. Cf.
United. States v. Anderson, supra. At least where the
taxpayer's books are kept upon the accrual basis, its final
disbursement may be-anticipated by amortization and
โขthe.amortized amount deducted annually from his gross
income.

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Opinion of the Court.

293 U. S.

2. Our decision in Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner,
1.pra. does not require a different conclusion because the
,,ommissions in the present case were allowed before 1913.
It was recognized in that case that premiums on a bond
issue received after the Sixteenth Amendment might be
prorated over the period of the life of the bonds and taxed
annually as income during this period. In refusing to
allow premiums received before 1913 to be thus prorated
and taxed, the Court was moved by the consideration that
the premiums, which were received as income and had
become a part of the taxpayer's capital before the Sixteenth Amendment, could not be taxed as income by
virtue of that amendment and legislation under it.
:No such consideration is presented here, where the
question is only of the deduction of an expense incurred
before the amendment. Hence, the decision in the Old
Colony case can militate against our conclusion here only
if returns, prepared in conformity to it, would fail to reflect true income if the rule announced in the Old Colony
case were also complied with. Plainly such is not the
case. There can be no question of receipt of a premium
where the bonds are sold at a discount. When sold at
a premium. as in any other case, commissions must be
,leducted from gross proceeds in arriving at the capital
realized upon the bond issue. There is no occasion for
edue'tion of commissions from gross income at a later
ifine unless the total amount realized by the sale of the
bon(*! is less than their par value. In that case the differevi.ce alono is the amount to 1he amortized and deducted
from gross income in the :n6nual returns of the taxpayer
This would reflect his true income, where, as in the present case. his accoun% are kept on the accrual basis.
