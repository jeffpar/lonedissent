ance of a credit. Here the taxpayers filed an additional
returxi, supplementing the original one by a statement of
the additional taxes due; there the taxpayer stood upon
the original return, and omitted to. file another.
The conclusion is unaffected by any of these points of
difference.
For reasons stated in our opinion i4 Nos. 37 to 39, the
period of limitation began to run on the filing of the first
return, and a return for additional taxes, even if filed afterwards, was an amendment or supplement which didnot toll the statute.
The decrees should be
Reversed.

The time for making deficiency assessment, prescribed by ยง 250 (d)
of the Revenue Act of 1918,:began to run in.his case, not from the'

Opinion of the Court.

Assistant to the Attorney General Stanley, with whom
Solicitor General Biggs, Assistant Attorney General
Wideman, and Messrs. James W. Moyris and J. Louis
Monarch were on the brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE CARDozo delivered the opinion of the

Court.
A question of limitation, similar to the one considered
in our opinions in Nos. 37 and 39, and in Nos. 35 and 36,
comes up for decision here. [Zellerbach Paper Co. v.
Helvering, ante, p.. 172, and National PaperProducts Co.
v. Helvering, ante, p. 183']
The petitioner filed a return on. May 28, 1918 under
the Revenue Act of i917 for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1918. The Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. i057)-became a law on February 24, 1919, with retroactive provisions as of January 1, 1918.. Thereafter the petitioner
filed an additional return in accordance with Treasury
Decision 2797 (approved March 11, 1919 and quoted in
our opinion in Nos. 37 to 39), showing an additional tax
of $50,638.75. The Act of 1918 provides (ยง 250d) that
except in the case of fraud, "the amount of tax due
under any return shall be determined and assessed by the
Commissioner within five years after the return was due
or was made." See also ยง 250d, Revenue Act of 1921. A
deficiency assessment was imposed in May, 1921, which
is admitted to have been timely, and another on May 26,
1926, which is contested as too late. There is also a contest in respect of both deficiencies growing out of delay
in the collection. True, written waivers were in existence,
adequate in form, which extended the date for assessment and collection until December 31, 1926. The taxpayer asserts, however, that they were procured by misrepresentation and signed without authority, and must
therefore be ignored.

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Statement of the Case.

293 U. S.

In an action to recover the tax paid by the petitioner
under the two assessments in controversy, the District
Court held (1) that irrespective of any waiver the term of
limitation ran from the date of the Additional return, and
(2) that the waivers were valid and binding. I F. Supp.
508. On the authority of decisions in the Ninth Circuit
(Zellerbach Paper Co. and National Paper Products Co.
v. Commissioner, 69 F. (2d) 852, 857), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed ruling No. 1 and
did not pass upon the correctness of ruling No. 2. :70 F.
(2d) 102.
For the reasons stated in our opinions in Nos. 37 to 39,
and in Nos. 35 and 46, the first ruling is erroneous. The
second ruling we do not consider,, the question of the
validity of the waivers being still openfor determination
in the court beloW.
The decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded
to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further
proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
Reversed.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 186. Argued November 12, 1934.-Decided November 19, 1934.
A judgment of a'state court refusing to enjoin proceedings under a
state statute: alleged to be unconstitutional does not present a

substantial federal question when the outcome of those proceedings,
if pursued, and its effect upon the federal rights aserted by the
complainant, are matters of conjecture.
Appeal from 264 N..Y. 475, dismissed.
APPEAL from a judgment, entered on remittitur, which
reversed an injunction order of the Supreme Court of
New York (150 Misc. 467) and denied the injunction.
