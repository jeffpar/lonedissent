State's power. The section under attack merely limits the
time for the assertion of the right, affects the remedy
only, and that in a manner not unreasonable, arbitrary or
oppressive. Such a limitation of time within which appellant's remedy must be pursued does not deprive him of
due process.

Affirmed.

WARNER, ADMINISTRATRIX, v. GOLTRA.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI.

No. 4. Submitted October 8, 1934.-Decided November 5, 1934.
1. In § 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, giving to "any
seaman" injured in the course of his employment a cause of action
for damages similar to that given by the statutes of the United
States to railway employees, the term " any seaman" includes the
master of the vessel. P. 156.
2. This provision should be construed liberally; "seaman" in this
particular context should be interpreted in. its broad sense, not in
the narrower sense distinguishing the crew from the master, found
in other statutes; and this accords with the purpose of the Act as
revealed by its history and by other legislation in pari materia.
Pp. 157-159.
3. Section 713, c. 18, of Title 46 of the U. S. Code, purporting to
define master and seaman, must be confined to the sections in chapter 18 which were derived from thE same earlier legislation as § 713;
it is. inapplicable to § 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920,
placed in the same chapter 18 by 'the compilers of the Code.
P. 160.
4. The compilers of the U. S. Code were not authorized by Congress
to amend existing law. P. 161.

CERTIORARI,

292 U. S. 617, to review the affirmance of

a judgment dismissing the complaint in an action for
damages for the death of the master of a vessel. The

action was brought by the administratrix of the master
against the owner of the vessel..

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. Walter P. Armstrong, Samuel W. Fordyce,
Henry J. Richardson, and C. Powell Fordyce submitted
for petitioner.
Mr. Joseph T. Davis submitted for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE CARD0ZO delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The master of a tug-boat met his death on the waters
of the Ohio River through the negligence of a pilot employed to navigate the tug. The personal representative
brought suit against the owner under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, § 33 (41 Stat. 1007; 46 U. S. C. § 688)
for the recovery of damages. The trial court sustained a
demurrer to the complaint on the ground that a" master"
is not a "seaman " within the meaning of the statute.
The Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed the judgment
for the owner. 334 Mo. 396; 67 S. W. (2d) 47. The case
is here on certiorari. 292 U. S. 617.
The statute is set forth at large in opinions of this
Court. Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U. S. 375, 383;
Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, 287 U. S. 367, 371.', It.
gives to "any seaman" injured in the course of his employment, and in case of the death of such seaman to his
personal representatives, a cause of action similar to that
given by the statutes of the United States to railway employees. In the enforcement of the statute a policy of
liberal construction announced at the beginning has been
steadily maintained. Early in the history of the act, the
question came up Whether it gave a remedy to stevedores.
We decided that it did. "It is true that for most purposes,
as the word is commonly used, stevedores are not 'seamen.'" International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, 272
U. S. 50, 52. None the less, verbal niceties were bent to
the overmastering purpose of the act to give protection
to workers injured upon ships. "Words," we said, " are

flexible." International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty,
supra, at p. 52. Later decisions of this Court have been
conceived in a like spirit (Jamison v. Encarnacion,281 U.
S. 635; Uravic v. F. Jarka Co., 282 U. S. 234; Cortes v.
Baltimore Insular Line, supra, at p. 375), and other courts
have followed suit.'
The problem for solution here stands out upon this
background.
There are contexts in which the word seaman is held
to exclude the master or even any officer. See, e. g.,.R. S.
§ 4530, as amended by § 31 of the Merchant Marine Act
of 1920 (46 U. S. C. § 597,) ; also 46 U. S. C. §§ 564, 568,
570, 592, 594, 597, 658, rebnacting R. S. §§ 4511, 4515,
4517, 4525, 4527, 4530, 4561 as 'from time to time
amended. There are other contexts in which it takes
them in. 28 U. S. C. § 837; also R. S. §,2174; Ii re
Scott, 250 Fed. 647, 648; The Balsa, 10 F. (2d) 408; The
Burns Bros., No. 31, 29 F. (2d) 855. The respondent
points to statutes that develop the antithesis between a
seaman and those over him. See citations, supra. They
do not carry us very far, any more than the contrast that
exists for many purposes between a seaman and a steve(lore. In a broad sense, a seaman is a mariner of any
degree, one who lives his life upon the sea. It is enough
that what he does affects "the operation and welfare of
the ship when she is upon a voyage," The Buena Ventura, 243 Fed. 797, 799, where a: wireless operator was
brought within the term. In a narrow sense the term is
See Grimberg v. Admiral Oriental S. S.. Line, 300 Fed. 619; The
Sea Lark, 14 F. (2d) 201; Kuhlman v. W. & A. Fletcher Co., 20 F.
(2d) 465; Rogosich v. Union Dry Dock & Repair Co., 67 F. (2d)
377; and cf. The Buena Ventura, 243 Fed. 797, 799: "The word
'seaman' undoubtedly once meant a person who could 'hand, reef
and steer,' a mariner in the true sense of the word. But as the
necessities of ships increased, so the word 'seaman' enlarged its
meaning."

all persons composing the ship's company, including the

comprehend the common seamen only, excluding the master and officers." UnitedStates v. Winn,,3 Sumn. 209, 213,

160, 164; United States v. Huff, 13 Fed. 630. What concerns us here and now is not the scope of the class of
seamen at other times and in other contexts. Our concern is to define the meaning for the purpose of a particular statute which must be read in the light of the
jnischief to be corrected and the end to be attained. Congress knew that' men employed upon a ship were without
a remedy in damages for negligence beyond their cure and
maintenance, unless the injury was a consequence of the
unseaworthiness of the ship or a defect in her equipment.
Chelentis v. Luckenbachi S. S. Co., 247 U. S. 372, 384;
Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, supra. This restriction
upon remedies was applicable to ordinary seamen, ,but
applicable also to officers and even to the master. The
George, 1 Sumn. 151, Fed. Cas. No. 5,329 (Story, J.);
The Balsa, supra. "It is said, that the allowance by the
maritime law belongs to the seamen only, and cannot be
claimed by the master of the ship. . . . No authority
is cited for this position; and I am not aware that any
exists." Story, J., in The George, supra, at p. 155. Cf.
the rule in. Great Britain under the Merchant Shipping
Act, 1906 (6 Edw. 7, No. 48, § 34). The old measure of
recovery was the same for all aboard, the highest and the
lowest. The new measure was not designed to narrow
the protected class while broadening the damages. We

Opinion of the Court.

stick too closely to the letter if we say that Congress had
the will to give damages for wounds or death to the crew
at large or their dependents and to leave the master and
his dependents out. An ancient evil was to be uprooted,
and uprooted altogether. It was not to be left with
fibres still clinging to the soil.
The purpose of the lawmakers, clear enough, we believe.,
upon the surface of the act, takes on an added clearness
when the act is viewed in the setting of its history. Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 is derived
from § 20 of the Act of 1915. 38 Stat. 1185. The parent
section was aimed t the fellow-servant rule in its application to torts upon navigable waters. Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., supra. It provided that "in any suit to
recover damages for any injury sustained on board vessel
or in its service seamen having command shall not be held
to be fellow-servants with those under their authority."
Masters were thus recognized as within the genus seamen.
though they were seamen having command. The decision of this Court'in the Chelentis case gave warning that
the change, if any, thus effected, did not availto increase
the damages beyond the cost of cure and maintenance.
Thus warned, the lawmakers amended § 20 of the Act
of 1915 by substituting § 33 of the Act of 1920. We cannot believe that in this process of amendment the-word
seamen lost the broad meaning that it .had in the law to
be amended, and was narrowed by the exclusionof a particular species of seamen, i. e., seamen having command.
The change is too sudden to be accepted as intended
unless unmistakably declared.
The scheme of legislatipn becomes symmetrical and
consistent when the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 is read
in the light of another act in pari materia,the Longshoremen's & Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U. S.
C. § 901 et seq.) adopted in 1927. This act expressly excludes from its "coverage " a "master or member of a

crew of any vessel.'
§ 903. . The exclusion was at the
request of seamen who notified the committee in charge
that they Treferred the remedy for damages under the act
of 1920 to the benefits that would be theirs under a system of workmen's compensation. See Hearings before a
Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
69th Cong., 1st Sess., on S. 3170, at p. 17; Cong. Rec.,
69th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. 68,. part 5 p. 5908; Noguezira v.
N. Y., N. H..& H. R. Co., 281 U. S. 128, 134, 136. The
bill was accordingly amended in its progress through the
House by declaring the exception. There can be little
doubt that Congress did this in the belief that under
the statutes then in force master and crew alike were already adequately protected in case of injury or death.
The belief had a sound foundation in the act of 1920. Cf.
Nogueira v. N. Y., N. H. & H. R. Co., supra, at p. 134.
In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Supreme
Court of Missouri rested its opinion on § 713 of Title 46* c.
18 of the U. S. Code, which for the purpose of construction defines a inaster and a seaman as well as other terms.2
With a few verbal changes ! 713 is a reenactment of
§ 65 of the Act of June 7, 1872 (17 Stat. 277), which was
2" In the construction of this chapter, every person having the

then known as § 4612 of the Revised Statutes. In the
compilation of the Code some of the provisions for the
protection of seamen contained in the Act of .1872 were
placed in Title 46, which relates to shipping, and particularly in Chapter 18 of that title, which relates to
"Merchant Seamen." :They had previously been reenacted, as parts of the Revised Statutes, along with
§:65. TheActs of 1915 and 1920 were placed in the same
chapter and title, and were thus brought into contiguity
with the sdctions carried over from the Act of 1872. Very
clearly the change of location did not work a change of
meaning. The rule of construction laid down in § 713
must be confined to thase sections of the chapter which'
were contained in the Act of 1872. or in the equivalent
provisions of the Revised: Statutep, before the Code had
rearranged them. The compilers of the Code were not
empowered by Congress to amend existing law, and doubtless had no thought of doing so. As to that the command
of C6ngress is too clear to be misread. 44 Stat. Part I, 1.4
To this it must be 'added that § 713, even in its,relation to
the sections fairly within its rahge, is"directed to extension not to restriction." Uravic v. Jarka Co., supra, at

of this act.
"'The- matter set forth in the Code, ... shall establish piima

nature in force on the 7th day of December, 1925; but nothing in
this act shall be construed as repealing or amending any such law,
or as enacting as new law anyJmatter contained in the Code. In
case of any inconsistency arising through omission or, otherwise between thepnrovisions of any section of this Code, and the corresponding portioi of legislation heretofore enacted, effect shall be given for
all purposes whatsoever to such enactments."

p. 239. It means that "for the purposes of the chafpter
'seamen' shall include persons who otherwise might be
deemed not to be seamen." It puts into the class some
that might otherwise be excluded; it does not take any
one out who would otherwise be there.
The. case for the respondent reduces itself to this, that
by express or implied antithesis the word seaman is used
in many statutes to designate a class of mariners exclusive of the master. It is also true, however, that in these
same statutes a seaman excludes a stevedore. A goodly
number of the statutes where the antithesis is sharpest
lay a duty upon the master to be performed for the seamen under him. In laws so framed, there is no room for
construction. A goodly number in addition give a rem,ejy to seamen for wages wrongfully withheld, or define
ternis of payment that agreement may not vary. In
respect of dealings of that order, the maritime law by
inveterate tradition has made the ordinary seaman a
member of a favored class. He is a ".ward of the admiralty," often ignorant and helpless, .and so in need of
protection against himself as well as others. The master,
on the other hand, is able in most instances to 'drive a
bargain for himself, and then when the bargain is made,
to stand upon his rights. Discrimination may thus be
rational in respect of remedies for wages. The Bethulia,
200 Fc1. 876; The Putnick, 291 Fed. 902. It is neither
rational nor just if extended to remedies for bodily
wounds. At such times mater and seaman are approximately equal. Coilgress 'did not mean that the master,
any more than the seaman, should be left without a remedy if wounded in his body, or that his dependents were
to be helpless if the wounds resulted in his death.
The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to
the Supreme Court of Missouri for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
