SEXTON, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OF KESSLER & COMPANY, v. KESSLER & COMPANY,
LIMITED.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT,
No. 92.

Argued December 12, 13, 1911.-Decided May 27, 1912.

The conduct of business men acting without lawyers andin good faith,
attempting to create a personal security for an actual debt, should be
fairly construed as actually effecting what the parties meant; and
so held, in this case, that an escrow of securities made by a b4nking

firm in New York to secure its drafts upon a foreign bank amounted
to a lien on the securities to be preferred to the claim of the trustee
in bankruptcy, notwithstanding that the New York firm retained
physical power over the securities, as agent for the foreign house, and
had the right to substitute other securities for those withdrawn and
sold.
Under the decisions of this court, and the courts of New York, a customer has such an interest in securities carried for him by a broker
-that a delivery to him after the insolvency of the broker is not necessarily a preference under the bankruptcy law. Richardson v. Shaw,
209 U. S. 365.
172 Fed. Rep. 535; 97 C. C. A. 161, affirmed

facts, which involve the question of whether under
the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, certain transfers of securities
by the bankrupt constituted a fraudulent preference,

Possession is of the essence of a pledge; without it no

492; Casey v. Schuhardt, 96 U. S. 494.
The legal pledge having failed, it cannot be supported
either as an eqtitable pledge, an equitable mortgage or a
declaration of trust. There was no equitable pledge.

A court of .equity will not uphold, on the theory of
equitable lien, an attempted pledge which fails at law,
when the rights of creditors are involved. Casey v.

206 U. S. 415; Wilson v. Little, 2 N. Y. 446; Buffalo G. I.

Co., 172 Fed. Rep. 177; Zartmanv. Bank, 189 N. Y. 267.
What the courts have defined as "the inexorable rule
of law" is that possession of the pledge must be in the
pledgee. Van Zile's Bailments and Carriers, § 237a;
Skelton v. Codington, 185 N. Y. 88; Frank v. Volkommer,
205 U. S. 529.
There is no such thing as an equitable pledge; one either
has made a pledge or' he has not. Support for the existence of such a contradiction as "equitable pledge" must
be found, if at all, in the fact that equity in some circum.stances will consider as done what was agreed to be done.
But that doctrine has no application where bankruptcy
intervenes.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Argument for Appellant.

225 U. S.

The bankrupts never agreed to give nor did Manchester
stipulate to receive, possession (except after financial
embarrassment had intervened)-and hence there was no
contract, relative to possession, for equity to enforce by
deeming it performed.
There was no equitable mortgage, as held by a majority
of the Court of Appeals.
The parties did not intend to create a mortgage, but
only a pledge with peculiar features, viz., possession to
remain in the pledgor with absolute power of disposal.
In New York, as elsewhere, a mortgage of personal
property is a transfer of title subject to be divested on
condition subsequent, viz., by .payment of the debt. The
parties intended no such thing.
The intention of the parties is shown by their correspondence.
Even if the parties had intended to make a mortgage
it would have been invalid in so far as it purported to
cover after-acquired property; and in toto because of provisions in it, and in the method of carrying it out, that
made it fraudulent in law and absolutely void as to creditors. The Zartman Case, 189 N. Y. 271.
The word "escrow" has usually to do with the passing
of title, but it has to do with the passing of title only
upon delivery, and prior to the delivery of the escrow the,
rights of the parties as to title remain exactly as before
the escrow was created.
The Chattel Mortgage Act of New York (Lien Law,
§ 90) provides that all mortgages of "goods and chattels"
shall be absolutely void unless there is an actual and continued change of possession, or the mortgage is filed.
Stackhouse V. Holden, 66 App. Div. 433; Risley v. Phenix
Bank, 83 N. Y. 318; Hudson River Bank v. Chaskin, 28
App. Div. 311, can all be distinguished.
The learned judge was in error in stating that there
was no fraud in the transaction here, and that, as no rights

of purchasers or attaching creditors intervene, the taking
possession by the Manchester house was entirely legal
and proper; such is not the law of New York. Parshally.
Eggert, 54 N. Y. 18; Skilton v. Coddington, 185 N. Y. 86;
Sabin v. Camp, 98 Fed. Rep. 97, are not authority as a
declaration of the laws of the State of New York.
There was no declaration of trust.
Whether there was a declaration of trust, and a consequent transfer of the title, is just as much a question
of local law as the other questions, namely, those of pledge
and equitable mortgage. As to the law of New York,
on this subject, see Martin v. Funk, 75 N. Y. 137; Matter
of Totten, 179 N. Y. 112; Young v. Young, 80 N. Y. 422;
Barry v. Lambert, 98 N. Y. 300; Matter of Bolin, 136
N. Y. 177; Locke v. Farmer,' L. & T. Co., 140 N. Y.
135.
Unless, therefore, Kessler & Co. of New
York by their
letters, certificates and acts intended to divest themselves
of all beneficial interest in the securities and to hold the
whole interest therein for the benefit of Kessler & Co. of
Manchester, the transaction cannot be sustained as a
declaration of trust.
If a pledge, imperfect or invalid because of want of
delivery of the pledged property, can be sustained as a
declaration of trust, the result will practically be to abolish
tecnicai pledges, "whose very essence" is the possession
of the pledged property by the pledgee. Young v. Young,
80 N. Y. 422.
The cases where equity has given relief in insolvency
cases are generally where the claimant's money has produced the very thing sought to be subjected to the lien.
National Bank v. Rogers, 166 N. Y. 380; Hauselt v. Hamson, 105 U. S. 401; Hurley v. Atcheson &c. R. R., 213 U. S.

bad faith and deceived existing as well as prospective
creditors.
The law is in favor of the appellant without respect
to the appellee's good or bad faith. Robinson v. Elliott,
22 Wall. 525.
The New York house held -themselves out to all the
world as, the owners of the securities, as the arrangem.Ient
expressly authorized. Theresult was a credit with various
bankers and customers, fictitious in fact and fraudulent
in law.
This case is not one of fraud based upon express misrepresentation, and it is not necessary for the trustee in
bankruptcy to show that the defendants made express
representations false in fact. But the case is full of evidence to show that with the knowledge and consent of
the Manchester house the New York house represented
itself as the owner of the securities over which the Manchester house claimed a secret lien. Martin v. Mathiot,
14 Serg., & R. 214.
The agreement between the parties was fraudulent as
a matter' of law irrespective of good or bad faith, and was
void as against creditors.
Clauses permitting the debtor to use the securities as
his own make the agreement fraudulent in law and void
ab initio as to creditors; and if the debtor and creditor
act in such a way that :the debtor uses the property as
his own, the result is the same. Zartman v. Bank, 189
N. Y. 267, 273; Skilton v. Codington, 185 N. Y. 80; Bowdish v. Page, 153 N. Y. 104; Scherl v. Flam, 120 App. Div.

Opinion of the Court.

When an agreement for security or protection is thus
fraudulent in law and void, it may be attacked by any
creditor, whether having a judgment or not, if it is impracticable or useless to obtain a judgment. Skilton v.
Codington, 185 N. Y. 80, 86, 89; Russell v. St. Mart, 180

MR.JUSTIcE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill brought by a trustee in bankruptcy to set
aside an alleged fraudulent preference. The Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed a decree of the District Court for the
plaintiffs and dismissed the bill. 172 Fed. Rep. 535. 97
C. C. A. 161. It will be enough for our decision to state
the following facts: The appellee was an English company
and the bankrupts a New York firm intimately connected
with it which for many years had drawn upon it. In
February, 1903, the English house- requested the New
York firm to set aside securities for their drawing credit.
The New York firm wrote on June 30 that they had that
day placed in a separate package in their safe deposit
vaults certain securities named, the package being marked
'Escrow for account of Kessler & Co., Limited, Manchester;' adding 'This escrow is intended as a protection
against our long drawings against your good selves.' This
letter was acknowledged and it was added "If at any time
you have the opportunity of realizing these securities or
any part of them, you are at liberty to take them and to
replace them by others of equal value, though in that case
we should of course like to see rather better quality." In

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion -f the Court.

225 U. S.

December of the same year the English house suggested
a form of certificate as follows: "We certify that we have
specially set aside and hold for your account, on this, the
31st day of December, '03, as security for the drawing
credit which you accord us, the following securities.
Name secs. and market value." This was conformed to
and the New York house also entered the securities and
all substitutions on their loan book. Substitutions were
made from time to time and the English house notified.
The securities always were either negotiable by delivery
or indorsed in blank. They were marked and kept as
stated in the letter upon a separate shelf of the New York
firm's vault, and they never were removed except in 1905
and 1906 when they were taken to the office to be examined and checked off by representatives of the English
company.. Business went on in this way until the panic
of 1907. On October 25 of that year) the stability of the
New York firm being in doubt, it handed over the escrow
securities to an agent of the English company then in
New York and he deposited them in a safe deposit vault
in the name of the company. On November 8 a petition
of bankruptcy was, filed and on November 27 the New
York firm was adjudged bankrupt. Notwithstanding
arguments to the contrary it may be assumed that the
arrangement between the parties was made in good faith
and intended and believed to be valid, and on the other
hand that at the time of the change of custody on October 25, within four months of the petition, the New York
firm was insolvent and that the English company had
reasonable cause to believe that a preference was intended
if its rights began only on that date.
So far as the interpretation of the transaction is concerned it seems to us that there*is only one fair way, to
deal with it. The parties were business men acting without lawyers and in good faith attempting to create a
present security out of specified bonds and stocks. Their

SEXTON v. KESSLER.
225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

conduct should be construed as adopting whatever method
consistent with the facts and with the rights reserved is
most fitted to accomplish the result. If an express declaration of an equitable lien, or again a statement that the
New York firm constituted itself the servant of the English company to maintain possession for the latter, or that
it held upon certain trusts, or that a mortgage was intended, or any other form of words, would effect what
the parties meant, we may assume that it was within the
import of what was done, written and said. So the question is whether anything in the situation of fact or the
rights reserved prevents the intended creation of a right
in rem, or at least one that is to be preferred to the claim
of the trustee.
The bankruptcy law by itself does not avoid the transaction. Thompson v. Fairbanks, 196 U. S. 516. Humphrey v. Tatman, 198 U. S. 91, 95. A trustee in bankruptcy
does not stand like an attaching creditor; he gets no lien
by the mere fact of his appointment. York Manufacturing
Co. v. Cassell, 201 U. S. 344. Zartman v. First National
Bank of Waterloo, 216 U. S. IL34, 138.

The most obvious

objection is that the continued physical power of the
New York firm over the securities and its right to withdraw and substitute admittedly reserved are inconsistent
with a title or lien of the English house in any form. But
the decisions of this court and of New York agree that
there may be title in a stronger case than this. When a
broker agrees to carry stock for a customer he may buy
stocks to fill several orders in a lump; he may increase his
single purchase by stock of the same kind that he wants
for himself; he may pledge the whole block thus purchased for what sum he likes, or deliver it all in satisfaction
of later orders, and he may satisfy the earlier customer
with any stock that he has on hand or that he buys when
the time for delivery comes. Yet as he is bound to keep
stock enough to satisfy his contracts, as the New York
vou,, ccxxv-7

firm in this case wa§ bound to substitute other security
if it withdrew any, the customer is held to have such an
interest that a delivery to him by an insolvent broker is
not a preference. Richardson v. Shaw, 209 U. S. 365.
Markham v. Jaudon, 41 N. Y. 235. So a depositor in a*
grain elevator may have a property in grain in a certain
elevator although the keeper is at liberty to mix his own
or other grain with the deposit and empty and refill the
receptacle twenty times before making good his receipt to
the depositor concerned.
Whether enough has been done to give a right of any
kind in certain property is a question of more or less.
See Union Trust Co. v. Wilson, 198 U. S. 530, 537. In the
case of ordinary goods and chattels, where, for instance,
a man mortgages his stock irr trade as it may be from
time to time, retaining possession and full power to sell
and replace or not as he sees fit, it well may happen that
the security fails. Skilton V. Codington, 185 N. Y. 80.
Zartman v. First National Bank of Waterloo, 189 N. Y.
267. So a general promise to give security in the future is
not enough. But the present was a more limited' and
cautious dealing. It was confined to specific identified
stocks and bonds on hand, and purported to give an
absolute present right, qualified only by possible-substitution and perhaps by a right of partial withdrawal if the
remaining 'securities had risen sufficiently in value. It
purported not to promise but to transfer; and the subjectmatter was not goods and chattels in the sense of the
New York mortgage law as we understand that law to be
inte rpreted by the New York courts., The transaction
was not void as against creditors irrespective of. attachment, as in Knapp v. Milwaukee Trust Co.; 216 U. S. 545.
Nile8 V. Mathusa, 162 N. Y. 546. There can be no doubt,
as was said by the court below, that before the bankruptcy
he English house had an equitable right at least to possession if it wanted it. While the phrase equitable lien

may not carry the reasoning further or do much more
than express the opinion of the court that the facts give a
priority to the party said to have it, we are of opinion that
the agreement created such a lien at least, or in other
words, that there is no rule of local or general law that
takes from the transaction the effect it was intended to
produce. Hurley v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co.,
213 U. S. 126, 134. When the English firm took the
securities it only exercised a right that had been created
long before the bankruptcy and in good faith. Such we
understand to be the law of NewYork and in the absence
of any controlling statute to the contrary such we understand to be what the law should be. Parshallv. Eggert,
