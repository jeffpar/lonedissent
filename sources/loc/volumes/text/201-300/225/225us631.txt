in error is not in position to complain, because not being
-the owner of one of the smaller sort, he does not suffer
from the alleged disciimination.
There is no contention that these provisions, permitting
hotels to maintain a room in which their regular and registered guests might play were evasively inserted, as a means
of "permitting the proprietors to keep tables for hire.
Neither is it claimed that the ordinance is being unequally
enforced. On the contrary, the city trustees are bound
to revoke the permit granted to hotels in case it should be
made to appear that the proprietor suffered his rooms to
;be used for playing billiards by other than regular guests.
If he allowed 'the tables to be used for hire he would be
guilty of a violation of the ordinance and, of course, be
subject to prosecution and .punishment in the same way,
and to the same extent, as the defendant.

HENDERSON, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY
OF BURNS, v. MAYER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.
No. 219.

Argued April 19, 1912.-Decided June 7, 1912.

The provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 preventing preferences,
kpply not only to mortgages and voluntary transfers but also to
preferences obtained through legal 'proceedings; but the act was not
intended to lessen rights already existing nor to defeat inchoate
liens given by statute of which all -creditors were bound to take notice.
The gencrallien given by the laws of Georgia to the landlord on the
property of the tenant is the equivalent, as to goods levied on by
distress warrant, to the common law distress; while it does not ripen
into a specific lien until the distrss warrant is issued, it exists from

the time of the lease, and the lien of. the distress warrant is not one
obtained through legal proceedings within the meaning of the antipreference provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.
Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 a statutory attachment for rent
in the nature of a landlord's distress warrant levied within the
preference period was not nullified or discharged by the bankruptcy
proceedings and there is nothing in the act of i898 opposed to this
conclusion.
The general provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 indicate a
purpose and intent, as against general creditors, to preserve rights
such as those given by the Georgia statute to landlords even though
not enforced until within four months of the bankruptcy.
175 Fed. Rep. 633, affirmed.
SAMUEL MAYER

owned a plantation in Dooley County,

Georgia, which he rented to Joseph Burns for one year.
The rent not having been paid at maturity, Mayer, on
Nov. 13, 1908, made an affidavit in conformity with the
statute, and a justice of the peace thereupon issued a distress warrant, which, on the same day, was levied upon the
cotton, corn and other products of the place. The crops
found on the premises being, apparently, insufficient to
pay what was due, the sheriff, at the same time, levied
upon other property by virtue of § 2795 of the Code of
Georgia, which declares that "Landlotds shall have a special lien for rent on crops made on land rented from them,
superior to all other liens except liens for taxes .
.
and shall also have a general lien on the property of the
debtor, liable to levy and sale, and such general lien shall
date from the time of the levy of a distress warrant to
enforce the same."
Three days after the levy a petition in bankruptcy was
filed against Burns, the tenant, who was subsequently adjudged a bankrupt. The trustee, when elected, obtained
possession of all the property seized by the sheriff, and
subsequently sold it in the due administration of the
estate. The proceeds of the cotton and corn Were paid
over to Mayer, it being conceded that the Landlord's

Argument for Petitioner.

Special Lien on the crops had not been affected by the
bankruptcy proceedings.
Mayer also claimed that, by virtue of his general lien,
he was entitled to have the balance of the rent paid out of
the proceeds arising from the sale of the other property
levied on, and filed his intervention to secure such an
order. The trustee's object~ion was sustained by the
referee on the ground that the -Landlord's General Lien
was discharged because it had been "obtained by legal
proceedings" or levy made three days before the filing of
the petition in bankruptcy. His ruling was reversed by
the District Court (175 Fed. Rep. 633). That judgment
was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals without
opinion. The case was then brought here by writ of certiorari, granted at the instance of the trustee, who claims
that under the Georgia Code the landlord had no lien on
the property prior to the levy of the distress warrant, and
that whatever right had been acquired by that seizure was
discharged by § 67f, which declares that "all levies, judgments, attachments, or other liens obtained through legal
proceedings against a person who is insolvent at any time
within four months-prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him shall be rtull and void in case he is
adjudged a bankrupt."

MR. JUSTIcE LAMAR, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, preventing an
insolvent from giving or the creditor from securing preferences for preexisting debts, apply not only to mortgages
and transfers voluntarily made by the debtqr, but also to
those preferences which are obtained through legal pro-

Opinion of. the Court.

ceedings, whether the lien dates from the entry of the
judgment, from the attachment before judgment, or, as
in some States, from the levy of execution after judgment.
But the statute was not intended to lessen rights which
already existed, nor to defeat those inchoate liens given
by statute, of which all creditors were bound to take notice
and subject to which they are presumed to have contracted
when they dealt with the insolvent.
Liens in favor of laborers, mechanics and contractors
are of this character; and although they may be perfected
by record or foreclosure Within four months of the bankruptcy, they are not created by judgments, nor are they
treated as having been "obtained through legal Droceedings," even when it is necessary to enforce them by some
form of legal proceeding. The statutes of the various
States differ as to the time when such liens attach, and
also as to the property they cover. They may bind only
what the plaintiff has improved or constructed; or they
may.extend to all the chattels of the debtor, or "all the
property involved in the' business." In re Bennett, 153
Fed. Rep. 673.
In some cases the lien dates from commencement of the
work, or from the completion of the contract. In others,
prior to levy they are referred to as being dormant or inchoate liens, or as "a right to a lien." In re Bennett, 153
Fed. Rep. 677; In re Laird, 109 Fed. Rep. 550. But the
courts, dealing specially with bankruptcy matters, have
'almost uniformly held that these statutory preferences
are not obtained through legal proceedings, and, therefore,
are not defeated by § 67f, even where the registration,
foreclosure or levy necessary to their completion or enforcement was within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.
Similar rulings-have been made where the landlord has
only a common law right of distress. In re West Side Paper
Co., 162 Fed. Rep. 110. Thits is often referred to as a lien,

18. The pledge, or quasi-pledge, which the landlord is
said to have is, at most, only a power to seize chattels
found on the rented premises. These he could take into
possession and hold until the rent Was paid. Doe ex dem
Gladney vi Deavors, 11 Georgia, 79, 84. But before the
distraint the landlord at common law has "no lien on any
particular portion of the goods and is only an ordinary
creditor except that he has the right of distress by reason
of which he may place himself in a better position."
Sutton v. Reese, 9 Jur. (N. S.) 456. A right fully as great
is created by the Georgia statute here in question. For
while giving the owners of agricultural lands a special
lien on the crops, there was no intention to deprive the
proprietor of urban and other real estate of the lien for
rent which there, as in other States, is treated as an incident growing out of the relation of landlord and tenant.
The Code (§ 2787) expressly "establishes liens in favor
of landlords." It (§ 3124) gives them "power to distrain
for rent as soon as the same is due." It declares (§ 2795)
that landlords "shall have a general lien on the property
of the tenant liable to levy and sale . . . which dates
from the levy of the distress warrant to enforce the same."
It is true that prior to levy it covers no specific property,
and attaches only to what is seized under the distress
warrant issued to enforce the lien given by statute. But
in this respect it is the full equivalent of a common law
distress-the lien of which is held not to be discharged by
§ 67f. In re West Side Paper Co., 162 Fed. Rep. 110;
Austin v. O'Reilly, 2 Wood, 670.
The fact that the warrant could be levied upon property
which had never been on the rented premises does not
change the nature of the landlord's right, though it may
increase the extent of his security. The statutory restrictions as to date, rank and priority may be important
in a controversy with other lienholders, but was wholly
but it is "only in the nature of security."

Opinion of the Court.

immaterial in this contest between the landlord and
trustee, where the latter was only representing general
creditors. As against them the landlord had from the
beginning of the tenancy the right to a statutory lien,
which had completely ripened and attached before the
filing of the petition in bankruptcy. The priority arising
from the levy of the distress warrant was not secured because Mayer had been first in a race of diligence, but was
given by law because of the nature of the claim and the
relation between himself as landlord and Burns as tenant.
In issuing the distress warran1 the justice acted ministerially. Savage v. Oliver, 110 Georgia, 636. The sheriff
was not required to return it to any court, and no judicial
hearing or action was necessary to authorize him to sell
for the purpose of realizing funds with which to pay the
rent. Such a lien was not created by a judgment nor
"obtained through legal proceedings."
Decisions to the same effect were made under the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 (14 Stat. 517, 522, § 14), which dissolved attachments or mesne process within four months
prior to the filing of the petition. In Austin v. O'Reilly, 2
Wood, 670, decided in 1875, it appeared that in Mississippi
the landlord had no lien, but as in Georgia was authorized
to seize (but by attachment) the tenant's goods wherever
found. Justice Bradley, presiding at Circuit, said that
the landlords' right to a distress at common law was not
a strict lien, "but being commonly called a lien, and being
a peculiar right in the nature of a lien, . .
the Supreme Court of the United StatEs, and most of the District

and Circuit Courts have regarded it as fairly to be classed
as a lien, within the true intent and meaning of the Bankrupt Act," and that the statutory attachment being in
the nature of a common law distress was not nullified or
discharged by the bankruptcy proceedings.
There is nothing in the act of 1898 opposed to this conclusion. On the contrary, its general provisions indicate a

purpose to continue the same policy and an. intent, as
against general creditors, to preserve rights like those
given by the Georgia statute to landlords, even though the
lien was enforced and attached by levy of a distress warrant within four months of the filing of the petition in
bankruptcy.

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT 'COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

No. 716.

Argued April 3.0, 1912.--:Decided June 7, 1912.

Public policy requires that the mail be carried subject to postal regulations, and that the Department and not the railroad shall, in the
absence, of contract, determine what service is needed and the con4itions finder which it shall be performed.
A railroad company, not required so to do by its charter, is not bound
to furnish postal cars of the kind demanded or to accept terms named
by. the Postmaster General, but if it does carry the mail, it does so

as an agency of the G.o'ernment- and subject to the laws and the
regulatiofis of the Department.
A riailroad company cannot, by using a larger railway postal car than
that authorized by the Department, recover the greater value of the
car.
The Postmaster )eneral can establish full railway postal lines, and
as the greater includes b ic less, he can also establish half lines; he
can abolish between two points a full line in one direction and a
half lifie in the other.

THE- facts, which involve claims made by a railroad
company for furnishing railway post-office cars to the

Government, are stated in the opinion..
