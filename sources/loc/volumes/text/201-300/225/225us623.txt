MURPHY v. PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA.
ERROR TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY,
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 204.

Argued March 11, 1912.-Decided June 7, 1912.

While the Fourteenth Amendment protects the citizen in his right to
engage in any lawful business, it does not prevent legislation intended
to regulate useful occupations, which because of their nature and
location, may prove injurious or offensive to the public.
The Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent a municipality from
prohibiting any business which is inherently vicious and harmful.
The Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent a State from regulating
or prohibiting a non-useful occupation which may become harmful
to the public, and the regulation or prohibition need not be postponed
until the evil is flagrant.
An ordinance prohibiting the keeping of billiard halls is riot unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, either as depriving the
owner of the hall of his property without due process of law or as
denying him the equal protection of the laws.
Where, in the exercise of the police power, the municipal authorities
by ordinance determine that a certain class of resorts should be
prohibited as harmful to the public, the courts cannot except from
the operation of the statute one of the class affected on the ground
that his particular place does not produce the evil aimed at by the
ordinance.
One cannot be heard to complain of his money loss by reason of the
legislating out of existence of a business in which he had invested
and which is not protected by the Federal or state constitution and
which he knew was subject to police regulation or prohibition.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

225 U. S.

A classification in a statute regulating billiard halls based on hotels
having twenty-five rooms is reasonable; and the owner of a billiard
hall, not connected with a hotel, is not denied equal protection of the
laws by an ordinance prohibiting keeping billiard halls for hire
because hotels having twenty-five rooms can maintain a billiard hall
for their regular guests.
One who does not keel) a hotel with less than the specified number
of rooms, cannot be heard to complain that a statute denies the
owners of the smaller hotels the equal protection of the laws, it not
appearing that the provision was inserted for purposes of evasion or
that the ordinance was unequally enforced.
The fact that one of a class excepted from the operation of a police
ordinance on complying with a conditioh, does not comply therewith, does not render the statute unconstitutional as against the
classes upon which it operates, but renders the person violating the
condition subject to the penalties of the ordinance.
The ordinance of South Pasadena, California, passed in pursuance of
police power conferred by the general law of the State, prohibiting the
keeping of billiard halls for hire, except in the case of hotels having
twenty-five rooms or more for use of regular guests, is not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment either as depriving
the owners of billiard halls not connected with hotels of their property without due process of law, or as denying them equal protection
of the laws.
155 California, 322, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under
the Fourteenth Amendment of a police law of California

regulating billiard halls, are stated in the opinion.

The police power may be exercised to protect the

public health, morals, safety and the general welfare,

Even if an ordinance prohibiting all billiard and pool
rooms were valid, this ordinance is unconstitutional in
that it confers privileges and immunities on some citizens
which it denies to others and the distinctions and classification sought to be drawn are arbitrary, are not based
on natural grounds of reasonableness or public policy

delivered the opinion of the court.

In 1908 the city of South Pasadena, California, in
pursuance of police power conferred by general law,
passed an ordinance which prohibited any person from
keeping or maintaining any hall or room in which billiard
or pool tables were kept for hire or public use, provided
it should not be construed to prevent the proprietor of
a hotel using a general register for guests, and having
twenty-five bedrooms and upwards, from 'maintaining
'billiard tables for the use of regular guests only of such
hotel, in a room provided for that purpose.
The plaintiff in error was arrested on the charge of

225 U. S.

violating this ordinance. His application for a writ
of habeas corpus was denicd by the Court of Appeals
and Supreme Court of the State. In re Murphy, 8 Cal.
App. 440; 155 California, 322. Thereafter the case came
on for trial in the Recorder's Court, where the defendant
testified that, at a time when there was no ordinance
on the subject, he had leased a room in the business
part of tle .city, and -at large expense fitted it up with
the necessary tables and equipments; that the place was
conducted in a peaceable and orderly manner; that no
betting or gambling or unlawful acts of any kind were
permitted, and "that there was-nothing in the conduct
of the business which had any tendency to immorality
or could in the least affect the health, comfort, safety
or morality of the community or those who frequented
said place of business." This evidence' was, on motion,
excluded and testimony of other witnesses to the same
effect was rejected.
The defendant was found guilty and sentenced to pay
a fine, or in default thereof to be imprisoned in the county
jail. The conviction was affirmed by the Superior Court
of the County, the highest court to which he could appeal.
The case was then brought here by writ of !error, the
plaintiff contending that the ordinance violated the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, claiming, in the
first place, that in preventing him from maintaining a
billiard hall it deprived him of the right to follow an
occupation that is not a nuisance per se, and which therefore could not be absolutely prohibited.
The Fourteenth Amendment protects the citizen in
his right to engage in any lawful business, but it does
not prevent legislation intended to regulate useful occupations which, because of their nature or location, may
prove injurious or offensive to the public. Neither does
it prevent a municipality from prohibiting anybusiness
which is inherently vicious and harmful. But, between the

MURPHY v. CALIFORNIA.
225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

useful business which may be regulated and the vicious
business which can be prohibited lie many non-useful
occupations, which may, or may not be harmful to the
public, according to local conditions, or the manner in
which they are conducted.
Playing at billiards is a lawful amusement; and keeping
a billiard hall is not, as held by the Supreme Court of
California on plaintiff's application for habeas corpus, a
nuisance per se. But it may become such; and the regulation or prohibition need not be postponed until the evil
has become flagrant.
That the keeping of a billiard hall has a harmful tendency is a fact requiring no proof, and incapable of being
controverted* by the testimony of the plaintiff that his
business was lawfully conducted, free from gaming or anything which could affect the morality of the community
or of his patrons. The fact that there had been no disorder or open violation of the law does not prevent the
municipal authorities from taking legislative notice of
the idleness and other evils which result from the maintenance of a resort where it is the business of one to stimulate others to play beyond what is proper for legitimate
recreation. The ordinance is not aimed at the game but
at the place; and where, in the exercise of the police power,
the municipal authorities determine that the keeping of
such resorts should be prohibited, the courts cannot go
behind their finding and inquire into local conditions; or
whether the defendant's hall was an orderly establishment,
or had been conducted in such manner as to produce the
evils sought to be prevented by the ordinance. As said
in Booth v. Illinois, 184 U. S. 425, 429:
"A calling may not in itself be immoral, and yet the
tendency of what is generally or ordinarily or often done
in pursuing that calling may be towards that which is
admittedly immoral or pernicious. If, looking at all the
circumstances that attend, or which may ordinarily at--

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the'Court.

225 U. S.

tend, the pursuit of a particular calling, the State thinks
that certain admitted evils cannot be successfully reached
unless-that calling, be actually prohibited, the courts cannot interfere, unless, looking through mere forms and at
the substance of the matter, they can say that the statute
enacted professedly to protect the public morals has no
real or substantial relation to that object, but is a clear,
unmistakable infringement of rights secured by the fundamental law."
Under this principle ordinances prohibiting the keeping
of billiard halls have many times been sustained by-the
courts. Tanner v. Albion, 5 Hill. 121; City of Tarkio v.
Cook, 120 Missouri, 1; City of Clearwater v. Bowman, 72
Kansas, 92; City of Corinth:v.' Crittenden, 94 Mississippi,
41; Cole v. Village of Culbertson, 86 Nebraska, 160; Ex
parte Jones, 97 Pac. Rep. 570.
Indeed, such regulations furnish early instances of the
exercise of the police power by cities. For Lord Hale in
1672 (2 Keble, 846), upheld a municipal by-law against
keeping bowling alleys because of the known and demoralizing tendency of such places.
Ufider the laws of the State, South Pasadena was au*thorized to pass this ordinance.

After its adoption, the

keeping of billiard or pool tables for hire was unlawful,
and the plaintiff in error cannot be heard to complain of
the money loss resulting from having invested his property
in an occupation which was neither protected by the state
nor the Federal Constitution, and which he was bound
to know could lawfully be regulated out of existence.

There is no merit in the contention that he was denied
the equal protection of the law because, while he was prevented from so doing, the owners of a certain class of
hotels were permitted to keep a room in which guests
might play at the game. If, as argued, there is no reason-

able basis for making a distinction between hotels'with
25 rooms and those with 24 rooms or less, the plaintiff

HENDERSON v. MAYER.
225 U. S.

Syllabus.

in error is not in position to complain, because not being
-the owner of one of the smaller sort, he does not suffer
from the alleged disciimination.
There is no contention that these provisions, permitting
hotels to maintain a room in which their regular and registered guests might play were evasively inserted, as a means
of "permitting the proprietors to keep tables for hire.
Neither is it claimed that the ordinance is being unequally
enforced. On the contrary, the city trustees are bound
to revoke the permit granted to hotels in case it should be
made to appear that the proprietor suffered his rooms to
;be used for playing billiards by other than regular guests.
If he allowed 'the tables to be used for hire he would be
guilty of a violation of the ordinance and, of course, be
subject to prosecution and .punishment in the same way,
and to the same extent, as the defendant.
