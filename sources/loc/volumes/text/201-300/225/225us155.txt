CHICAGO & ALTON RAILROAD COMPANY v.
KIRBY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

No. 226.

Argued April 25, 1912.-Decided May 27, i912.

The implied agreement of a common carrier is to carry safely and
deliver at destination within a proper time; evidence of diligence
and no unreasonable delay excuses.
A carrier who agrees to expedite assumes a more burdensome liability
and can exact a higher rate than where mere carrier's liability exists.
An interstate carrier can assume an extra liability for expediting, provided it makes and publishes a rato therefor and opens it to all.
To agree with a particular shipper to exlpedite a shipment at regular
rates, where no rate. has been published for special expediting, is a
discrimination and as such a violation of -he Elkins Act of February 19, 1903, 32 Stat. 847,.c. 708, and relief on the contract will be
denied.
The broad purpose of the Commerce Act to compel the establishment
of reasonable rates and uniform application will'not be defeated by
sanctioning special contracts giving special advantages to particular
shippers.
To guarantee. a particular connection and transportation by 4 particular train amounts to giving a preference when not open to all
and provided for in the published tariffs, and under the Elkins act
is an illegal discrimination.
A shipper is presumed to know. what. the published rates are, and if
they do not contain provisions for the special service. guaranteed to
him he must be taken as having contracted for a rate discriminatory
in his favor,
Where plaintiff sues only on a special contract for prompt delivery
by specified train, and there is no count for negligence as a carrier
only, his claim for damages based on such negligence is not presented, and cannot be considered, on the record.
242 Illinois, 418, reversed.
THE facts, which involve the validity under the Elkins
Act of a special contract for prompt delivery of goods by
an interstate carrier, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. GarrardB. Winston and Mr. William Patton, with
whom Mr. Silas H. Strawn was on the brief, for plaintiff
inerror:
The guarantee of special delivery upon which alone
this suit was brought is an unlawful discrimination, and,
therefore, void. New Haven R. R. Co. v. Int. Com. Comm.,
200 U. S. 361, 391.
The case was brought in 'assumpsit, not' upon, the
common-law obligation of the railroad to carry within a
reasonable time without negligent delay, but upon a
special contract of guarantee to connect Kirby's car of
horses with the "Horse Special" of the Michigan Central
Railroad Company. Armour Packing Co. v. United States,
209 U. S.56, 80.
The contrabt set out in the declaration being for a
special service not noted in, but on the contrary prohibited by, the published tariffs, even if made, was void, as
being in violation of the sections of the Interstate Commerce Act prohibiting discrimination, and no recovery
can be had thereon. Tex. & Pac. By. Co. v. Cotton Oil
Co., 204 U. S.439.
No service, privilege or facility may be extended to a
shipper by a carrier which is-not provided for and set out
.in the filed and published.'tariff.
The facility and service of specially expedited transportation, or transportation by a particular connection or
train, is such that it requries pihblication to be lawful.

The giving of a greater service in consideration of the
tariff rate than is noted in the tariff is unlawful. See
the Hepburn Act of 1906, which provides specifically
against the very thing which the Commission had already
provided against by construction of the act before that
amendment. Tex. & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Cotton Oil Co., 204
U. S. 447.
The Alton had complied in every 'respect with the provisions 'of the act with reference to filing and publishing
its joint tariffs.
These tariffs consisted of three documents, all of which
must be construed together to arrive at the rate, and the
service to be given for that rate, viz., the Official Classification, the Joint Interstate Tariff, and the List of Stations Taking Percentage Rate Bases.
These documents must be read together to arrive at the
rate and service to be performed for the rate. Man. Ins.
Co. v. Erie & .W. T. Co., 75 N. W. Rep. 62.
The classification sheet is binding on both carrier and
shipper. Smith v. Gt. N. Ry. Co., 107 N. W. Rep. 56..
The ,elements of classification are those that "affect
either the cost or risk of carriage to the carrier, or the value
of carriage to the shipper."
So thWe elements must necessarily be important which
impose a greater degree of care on the carrier. Beale &

If the rate is duly published and thus called to the attention of shippers and consignees, they cannot depend

carriers to adopt a rule under which the right of routing
beyond its own terminal is reserved to the initial carrier,
as the condition of guaranteeing the through rates of the
shipper.
The shipper having the right to use the Horse Special
in shipping had the right to select the place he desired to
connect with it, and in according him that right no privilege or preference of any.kind was given him, but he was
given what he or any shipper had a right to demand.
This being true it cannot be said that if the carrier
agrees with such shipper to handle his shipment so as to
connect with the Horse Special at such place selected by
him, such:agreement constitutes a contract prohibited by
the Interstate Commerce Act.
There was nothing in this arrangement which in any
way violated either the spirit or letter of the Interstate
Commerce Act. Foster v. Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. Ry.

The general rule that an illegal contract is void and unenforcible is qualified by the exception that where a con-

tract is not evil in itself and its invalidity is not denounced
as a penalty by the express terms or by rational implication from the language of the statute which it violates,
and that statute prescribes other specific penalties, it
is not the province of the courts to do so, and they will
.not thus affix an additional penalty not directed by the

There is nothing in the holding of the Illinois courts that
the limitation of recovery to $100 for each animal was not
binding, that in any-way conaicts with any provisions of
the Interstate Commerce Act.
In Illinois, the law is well established that a carrier cannot limit its common-law liabilities unless the shipper
knowingly assented and agreed to such limitation, and
whether there was such assent or not, is a question of fact.

MR. JUSTICE LURTON

delivered the opinion of the court.

Action in assumpsit to recover damages for the breach
of a special contract for the shipment of a carload of highgrade horses from Springfield, Illinois, to New York city.
There was a jury, verdict and judgment, which was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Illinois. The facts
essential to be here stated are these: Kirby was engaged
in developing high-grade horses, and desired to send a carload to be sold at a public sale to be held in Madison
Square Garden, New York city. Several routes were
available, and the published live-stock .rates for carload
shipments were the same by each route. It was, however,
desirable to send them by the route which would insure
their arrival in the shortest time after delivery to the
carrier.
.The declaration in substance avers that the plaintiff in
error knowing the anxiety of the shipper for quick transportation, and that the horses were to enter the horse
sale to be held late in the month, did, on January 24, 1906,
contract and agree to carry a car, rented by defendant in
error, loaded with horses, for the consideration of $170.60,
over its own rails from Springfield to Jolief, Illinois, and
there deliver so that it would be carried by a fast stock
train known as the "Horse Special," over the M. C. Railroad, through to New York. Said Horse Special was run
but three timres each week, and was due to leave Joliet
the following morning. It is then alleged that the defendant in error, as directed by the railroad company,
delivered and loaded his horses on the afternoon of the
twenty-fourth; but that the company did not promptly
carry and deliver the same to the said fast stock train on

CHICAGO & ALTON R. R. CO. v. KIRBY.

163

Opinion of the Court.

the morning of the twenty-fifth, as it had guaranteed to
do, having failed to make connection with that train;
and, that, as a consequence, the car was forwarded by a
later and much slower train, and the horses were delivered
in New York forty-eight hours after they would have
arrived had they been carried by the Horse Special, as
the plaintiff in error undertook. As a result of this prolonged transportation, the horses did not reach New York
in time to be put in proper -condition for the horse sale,
whereby the defendant in error sustained damages, aggregating several thousand dollars.
The plaintiff in error pleaded the general issue and
under this presented certain defenses which we shall pass
by,- as not constituting questions of law or fact open to
review upon a writ of error to a state court.
The single Federal question arises upon the validity of
the contract to so carry these horses as to deliver them at
Joliet to be carried through to New York by the Horse
Special, leaving Joliet on the twenty-fifth of January.
That the railroad company had established and published through joint rates and charges upon carload shipments of live stock to New York is not disputed. The
rates furnished the defendant in error were the regularly
published rates. Those rates and schedulbs did not provide for an expedited service, nor for transportation by
any particular train. Neither was Kirby required to pay
any other or higher rate for the promised special service,
by which his -car was to be carried so as to be attached to
the fast stock special and carried by-it to New York.
By the third. section of the original act of February 4,
1887, 24 Stat. 379, it is made unlawful to give any undue or unreasonable "preference or advantage," to any
particular person, or to subject any particular person to
"any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in
any respect whatever." By the sixth section of the same
act it is required that the carrliers subject to the act shall

225 U. S.

print and keep for public inspection schedules showing the
rates, charges and.classifications, "and any rules or regulations, which in any wise change or affect or determine
any part or the aggregate of such aforesaid rates and fares
*and charges." The same section also provides as follows:
"And when any'such common carrier shall have established and published its rates,, fares, and charges in compliance •With' the -provisions of this section, it shall be unlawful fox such common carrier to charge, demand, collector. receive from any person or persois a -greater or less
compensation, for the transportation of passengers or
property, or for any services in connection therewith, than
is specified in such published schedules of rates, fares, and
charges as may at the time be in force."
By the act of February 19, 1903; known as the
Elkins Act, amending the act of 1887, 32 Stat. 847,
c. 708; it is made. "unlawful for any 1erson, persons, or
corporation to offer, grant, or give or to solicit, accept or
receive any rebate, concession, or- discrimination in respect of the transportation of any property in interstate
or foreign commerce by any common carrier subject to
said act to regulate commerce and the acts amendatory
thereto whereby any such property-shall by-any device
whatever be transported at a less rate than that named
in the tariffs published and filed by such carrier, as is
required by said act to regulate commerce and the acts
amendatory thereto, or whereby any other advantage is
given or discrimination is practiced."
The implied agreement of a common carrier is to carry
safely and deliver at destination within a reasonable
time. It is otherwise when the action is for a breach of a
contract to carry within a particular time, or to make a
particular connection, or to carry by a. particular train.
The railroad company, by its contract, became liable for
the consequence of a failure to transport according to its
terms. Evidence of diligence would not excuse. If the

CHICAGO & ALTON R. R. CO. v. KIRBY.

Opinion of the Court.

action had been for the common-law carrier liability,
evidence that there had been no unreasonable delay
would be an answer. But the company, by entering into
an 'agreement for expediting the shipment, came undel a
liability different and more burdensome than would exist.
to a shipper who made no such special contract.
For such a special service and higher responsibility it
might clearly exact a higher rate, But to do so it must.
make and publish a rate open to all. This was not done.
The shipper, it is also plain, was contracting for an
advantage which was not extended to all others, both in
the undertaking to carry so as to give him a particular
expedited service, and a remedy for delay not due to
negligence.
An 'advantage accorded by special agreement which
affects the value of the service to the shipper and its cost
to the carrier should be published in the tariffs, and for a
breach of such a contract, relief will be denied, because
its allowance without such publication is a violation of the
act. It is also illegal because it is an undue advantage in
that it is not one open to all others in the same situation.
In Armour Packing Company v. United States, 209
U. S. 57, 72, Mr. Justice Day, dealing with a violation of
the act by carrying out a contract for. a rate, after the rate
had been changed by publication of a higher rate, said:
"The Elkins Act proceeded upon broad lines and was
evidently intended to effectuate the purpose of Congress
to require that all shippers should be treated alike, and
that the only rate charged to any shipper for the'same
service under the same conditions should be the one established, published and posted as required by law. it
is not so much the particular form by which or the motive
for which this purpose was accomplished, but the intention was to prohibit any and all means that might be
resorted to to obtain or receive concessions and rebates
from the fixed rates, duly posted and published."

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

225 U. S.

The broad purpose of the Commerce Act was to compel
the establishment of reasonable rates and their uniform
application. That purpose would be defeated if sanction
be given to a special contract by which any such advantage is given to a particular shipper as that contracted
for by the defendant in error. To guarantee a particular
connection and transportation by a particular train, was
to givie an advantage or preference not open to all and not
provided for in the published tariffs. The general scope
and purpose of the act is so clearly pointed out in New
York, N. H. & H. Railroad Company v. Interstate Commerce Com., 200 U. S. 361, 391, and in Texas & P. Railroad
Company v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426, as to
need no reiteration.
That the defendant in error did not see and did not
know that the published rates and schiedules made no
provision for the service he contracted for, is no defense.
For the purposes of the present question he is presumed
to have known. The rates were published and accessible,
and, however difficult to understand, he must be taken to
have contracted for an advantage not open to others.
Texas & P. Railway Co. v. Mugg, 202 U. S. 242.
The claim that the defendant in error may recover upon
the carrier contract, stripped of the illegality, under
Merchants' Cotton Press Co. v. Insurance Co., 151 U. S.
368, is not presented by this record. The declaration
counted only upon the breach of a special contract which
was illegal. There was no count based upon the carrier's
liability for negligence in not promptly shipping and delivering. The judgment was rested upon the damages
resulting from the breach of the special contract, and not
at all upon the liability of the carrier otherwise.
For the error in not holding the special contract invalid
under the Interstate Commerce Act, the judgment must
be reversed and the case remanded for such further proceedings as are not inconsistent with this opinion.
