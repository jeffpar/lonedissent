They are an enumeration of the elements identifying and
determining the present rates that are to be reduced.
We see no reason to suppose that Congress intended to
require a special and expensive investigation at the cost
of the Government rather than to adopt the existing

the'exact time when the last thirty days' weighing occurred or should occur.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
WASHINGTON.
No. 177.

Argued January 23, 1919.-Decided April 14, 1919.

The construction of a state statute must be judged by its necessary
effect; the name is not conclusive. P. 394.
A law of the State of Washington requires that products of petroleum,
intended for use or consumption in the State, shall be inspected before being sold or offered for sale, and imposes fees for inspection by
which in 10 years over $335,000 was collected, of which only about
.$80,000 was disbursed for expenses, leaving a revenue of over
$255,000. Held, in respect of such products imported from another
State for sale in Washington, that the charge is excessive and an
unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Id.
94 Washington, 291, reversed.

Sutro, Mr. R. A. Ballinger, Mr. Alfred Battle and Mr.
Bruce C. Shorts were on the brief, for plaintiff in error.
Mr, L. L. Thompson, Assistant Attorney General of
the State of Washington, with whom Mr. W. V. Tanner,
Attorney General of the State of Washington, and Mr.
Glenn J. Fairbrook, Assistant Attorney General of the
State of Washington, were on the brief, for defendant
in error, discussed and relied upon the following: Woodruff v. Parham,8 Wall. 123; Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall. 148;
Brown v. Houston, 114 U. S. 622; Machine Co. v. Gage,
100 U. S. 676; Emert v. Missouri, 156 U. S. 296; Bacon
v. Illinois, 227 U. S. 504; American Steel & Wire Co. v.
Speed, 192 U. S. 500.
The act does not prohibit the solicitation of interstate
business, as in Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District,
120 U. S. 489; or the introduction of goods into the State,
as in Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100, and Schollenberger
v. Pennsylvania, 171 U. S. 1; nor does it impose a tax
upon the goods before the transit is completed, as in
Foote & Co. v. Maryland, 232 U. S. 494. It merely provides that all such products of petroleum, before being
sold or offered for sale, shall, at some time and place, be
inspected, just as did the statutes sustained in General
Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211, and Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall.
148. The question is really decided by.this court in the
Crain Case, supra. In Foote & Co. v. Maryland, supra,
it is stated in the argument and assumed in the opinion
that the inspection was made before the goods reached
their destination, and therefore was an interference
with articles in course of interstate transportation.
This is apparent from the fact that the court nowhere
mentions or refers to the Crain Case, which clearly holds
that an ostensible inspection fee, which is in reality a
revenue mcasure, does not interfere with interstate. comnierce if imposed upon an article after it has ceased to

Opinion of the Court.

move in such commerce and after it comes within the
protection of the state laws. The Foote Case, without
any discussion of the self-evident fact that the Maryland,
act did so operate, holds the inspection fee prescribed
by that act to be void because it was in reality a revenue
measure. If the distinction in the two acts which we have
pointed out be adopted, they are in no way inconsistent.
If it be rejected, the Foote Case must be taken as overruling the Crain Case. See State v. Bartels Oil Co., 132
Minnesota, 138.
The first inquiry in determining whether there is an
interference with interstate commerce is to ascertain
whether the transit has ended. If it has, the goods cease
to be in interstate commerce, and whether the particular
tax be an inspection law, a general property tax, or an
excise tax is immaterial to this court.
MR.JUSTICE DAY

delivered the opinion of the court.

Plaintiff in error filed a complaint and an amended complaint in the Superior Court of Thurston County, Washington, to enjoin the collection of fees prescribed by the
Oil Inspection Act of that State upon the ground that the
statute was in contravention of the Constitution of the
United- States. The Superior Court held the law to be
unconstitutional. Upon appeal the Supreme Court of
Washington reversed the judgment. 94, Washington, 291.
The statute is the "State Oil Inspection Law" of the
State of Washington. Its provisions are thus sunmarized
in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the State: "The
inspection law referred to in the complaint was first
passed during the legislative session for the year 1905
(Laws 1905, p. 310). That act was amended in 1907,
and will be found in chapter 192 of the Laws of 1907,
p. 413 (Rem. Code, § 6051 et seq.). Section 3 (Id., § 6052)
of this act provides that all gasoline, benzine, distillate or

OCTOBER TERM, 1918.

other volatile product of petroleum intended for use or
consumption in this state for illuminating, manufacturing,
domestic or power purposes, 'before being sold or offered
for sale,' shall be inspected by the state oil inspector or
his deputies. When the inspection is made, a certificate
is to be issued, and the barrel or receptacle which contains
the oil must be labeled or branded. Section 4 (Id., § 6053)
of the act contains a schedule of the fees which shall be
paid for the inspection. Section 6 (Id., § 6055) provides
that if any person or persons, whether manufacturer,
vender or dealer, or as agent or representative of any manufacturer, vender or dealer, 'shall sell or attempt to sell'
to any person, firm, or corporation in this state, any illuminatiilg oil, gasoline, benzine, distillate or any volatile
product of petroleum, intended for use or consumption
within this state, that has not been inspected and branded
according to the provisions of the act, 'shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor.' By the laws of 1913, chapter 60, p. 196
(Rem. Code, § 3000-1 et seq.), it was made the duty of the
conunissioner of agriculture to exercise all the powers and
perform all the duties which, by the law of 1907, were
vested in, and required to be performed by, the state oil
inspector."
.The case was heard upon demurrer to the amended
complaint.
Among other things, the amended complaint set out:
"Plaintiff is engaged in the State of California in the business of producing and buying crude petroleum oil, and of
manufacturing and refining the same, and of shipping
products of such manufacture, to-wit, illuminating oils,
gasoline, distillate and other volatile products of petroleum. from its refineries in California into the State of
Washington, where the same are sold by this plaintiff in
large quantities for use and consumption in the State of
Washington, for illuminating, manufacturing, domestic
and power purposes. None of the products hereinabove

referred to are manufactured by plaintiff in the State of
Washington, but all of said products are shipped into said
State from the State of California.
"Plaintiff maintains in the State of Washington wharves
and docks, tanks, warehouses, buildings, machinery,
horses and wagons, and other equipment for receiving,
.:hipping, handling, selling and otherwise distributing said
products shipped as aforesaid from the State of California into the State of Washington."
The fees collected under the inspection acts are set
out in the amended bill of complaint:
"The total receipts from the fees collected under said
statute, chapter 192 of the laws of 1907, and chapter
161, laws of 1905, of the State of Washington, for the inspection therein provided for of said products mentioned
in said laws intended for sale or consumption in this
State, and the total disbursements in connection with the
collection thereof, and in connection with the administration of said laws, and the net revenue from such receipts during the following years have respectively been

receipts for the same time $335,776.30, a difference of
$255,672.93.
It is contended by the plaintiff in error that this inspection law violates the commerce clause, Art I, § 8,
of the Constitution of the United States, in that it directly burdens such commerce by imposing inspection
taxes far in excess of the cost of inspection. The Supreme
Court of the State held that the tax was not upon property,
but could be sustained as an excise or occupation tax
upon the business of selling oil within the State. The
reason given by the court for holding that the tax could
not be upheld as a property tax rested upon provisions
of the state constitution.
While this court follows the decisions of the highest
court of a State, as to the meaning of statutes in cases of
this character, the name given to the statute is not conclusive. It must be judged by its necessary effect, and
if that is to violate the Constitution of the United States,
the law must be declared void. Minnesota v. Barber,
136 U. S. 313, 319; Crew L evick Co. v. Pennsylvania, 245
U. S. 292, 294, and cases cited.
That the State may pass proper inspection laws for
oils brought into its borders in interstate commerce,
there can be no question. But, taking the allegations of
the complaint to be true, as we must for present purposes,
the cost of the inspection was greatly less than the tax
imposed. The general principle that a State may not
impose burdens upon interstate commerce is so well
settled, and has been so often declared in the opinions
of this court, that a repetition of the reasons which
have induced these decisions would be superfluous. In
this case the amended complaint alleges that the oils
were shipped into Washington from California. They
are brought there for sale. This right of sale as to such
importations is protected to the importer by the Federal
Constitution, certainly while the same are in the original

Opinion of the Court.

receptacles or containers in which they are brought into
the State. Under this law the oils cannot be lawfully sold
at all until the importer has paid the inspection fees
provided in the statute, after inspection. That inspection fees, so grossly in excess of the cost of inspection imposed upon articles brought into the State in interstate
commerce are unconstitutional, was held in Foote & Co.
v. Maryland, 232 U. S. 494. In that case the plaintiffs
were engaged in the business of packing oysters in the
City of Baltimore, and brought large quantities in from
the State of Maryland and also from the waters of the
States of Virginia and New Jersey. These oysters were
inspected in Baltimore, where they were unloaded from
vessels, by officials appointed under the provisions of the
Maryland act which fixed an inspection fee of one cent
per bushel to be paid one-half by the seller and one-half
by the buyer. The case was brought to this court upon
the ground that the inspection fee was excessive, and a
burden upon interstate commerce, and levied an unlawful
tax upon goods shipped into Maryland from other States.
It was held that in view of the excessive nature of the inspection fees the requirement of the payment thereof
necessarily imposed a burden upon interstate commerce
in excess of the expenses of inspection, and that the act
was, therefore, void. The subject was fully considered'
in an opinion by the late Mr. Justice Lamar, speaking for
this court, and after recognizing the power of the State
to impose reasonable inspection fees,. and that such legislation will not be declared void unless the fees are obviously and largely beyond what is needed for the cost
of inspection, he said: "If, therefore, it is shown, that
the fees are disproportionate to the service rendered;
or, that they include the cost of soniething beyond legitimate inspection to determine quality and condition, the
tax must b6 declared void because such costs, by necessary operation, obstruct the freedom of commerce among

the States. McLean v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. "Co.,
203 U. S. 38; Brinmer v. Rebman, 138 U. S. 78, 83;
Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Taylor, 192 U. S. 64; Patapsco Co. v. North Carolina, 171 U. S. 345, 354; Red 'C'
Oil Co. v. North Carolina, 222 U. S. 380, 394; Savage v.
Jones, 225 U. S. 501." (P. 504.) The principles stated in
Foote & Co. v. Maryland were recognized in Pure Oil Co.
v. Minnesota, decided by this court at this term, 248
U. S. 158. The inspection fees there in question were
held not excessive, and we said (p. 162) "But if such inspection charge should be obviously and largely in excess
of the cost of inspection, the act will be declared void
because constituting, in its operation, an obstruction
to and burden upon that commerce among the States
the exclusive regulation of which is committed to Congress by the Constitution."
It is said that the Foote Case did not overrule the
previous case of General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211,
and that the principles of that case should be controlling
here. In the Crain Case this court sustained a tax upon
oil which had been removed from the tank cars in which
it was transported into Tennessee, and which, although
destined for points beyond Tennessee, was then in storage
in that State. The distinction between that case and the
one now under consideration is obvious. Bacon v. Illinois, 227 U. S. 504, is also relied upon. In that case this
court sustained a property tax upon grain brought from
another State, but taken from the carrier and held by the
owner in Illinois with full: power of disposition in that
State, and although intended to be ultimately forwarded
to a point .beyond the State,-the property tax, after a
review of the previous decisions of this court, was sustained.
We reach the conclusion that the statute imposing
these excessive inspection fees, in the manner stated,
upon all sales of oils brought into the State in interstate

commerce necessarily imposes a direct burden upon such
commerce, and is, therefore, violative of the commerce
clause of the Fedeyal Constitution. We may remark that
the conclusion at which we have arrived has been reached
by the supreme courtg of North Dakota and Ohio. Bartels
