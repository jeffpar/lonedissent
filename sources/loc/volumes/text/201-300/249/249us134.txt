APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.
Nos. 92, 93, 94, 95. Submitted December 17, 1918.-Decided
March 3, 1919.
Orders of a state commission fixing railroad rates under legislative
authority are state laws within the meaning of the 'provision of the
Judiciary Act of 1891, ยง 5, and Jud. Code, ยง 238, allowing direct
appeals from the district court to this court in cases in which a law
of a State is'claimed to contravene the Federal Constitution. P. 141.
When this court, having jurisdiction on constitutional grounds, under
Jud. Code, ยง 238, reverses a final injunctional decree of the district'
court on direct appeal, with directions to dismiss the bill without
prejudice, and the district court,-acting under a reservation in its
own decree, and within authority for further proceedings allowed
by the mandate, assesses and decrees the damages caused by its
injunctions, such supplementary decree is part of the main cause
and appealable directly to this court. Id.
Upon reversal of final injunctional decrees of the district court with
directions to dismiss the bills without prejudice, the mandates
allowed further proceedings in the causes in conformity with the
opinion and decree of this court, according to right and justice, etc.

decree damages arising under the injunction bonds prior to the reversed decrees. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v.
MeKnight, 244 U. S. 368, explained. P. 143.
In awarding final injunctions restraining the enforcement of railway
rates as fixed by state authority, the district court ordered that the
preliminary injunction bonds be released and the sureties thereon
discharged from further liability. Held, that a failure to appeal
from and assign error to this action created no obstacle to the assessment of damages under -the bonds, after reversal of the final decrees
by this court, where the mandate allowed further proceedings and
the district court had retained jurisdiction to make further orders
if necessitated by changed conditions. Id.
In suits by railroads to determine the adequacy of rates fixed by a
state commission, injunction orders restraining enforcement pendente
lite were obtained on bonds conditioned for refund to shippers if it
should eventually be decided that the orders should not have been
made. Held: (1) That the conditions were broken by ultimate
failure of plaintiffs to prove the inadequacy of the rates and ultimate
denial of relief on that ground, although there was no specific adjudication that the prelirainary injunctions were improper; (2) that
the period of the obligation ended with final decrees of the district
court awarding permanent injunctions, and that the sureties were
not liable for claims arising thereafter and before reversal by this
court. Pp. 144, 145.
A railroad company which, in virtue of an erroneous final decree of
injunction, collects charges in excess of rates lawfully fixed by A
State, is equitably liable to make refunds to the shippers when the
decree is reversed on appeal. P. 145.
For the purpose of claiming such restitution in the injunction suit,
shippers not named as parties and represented theretofore only by
the state railroad commission, but who have been subjected to the
injunction as a class and obliged to pay the overcharges, may intervene in a reference to a master, ordered by the district court. P. 146.
And although such reference be ordered under a rule of court relating
only to damages recoverable on injunction bonds, it may still furnish
foundation for a decree against the railroad on the theory of restitution also, if the merits are fully heard and the facts undisputed. Id.
In its relation to the rights of shippers to recover overcharges, whether
under injunction bonds or on the theory of restitution, a decree
reversing the final injunctive decree of the district court, with -a
direction to dismiss the bill, is none the less conclusive because

made without prejudice to the right of the carrier to bring future
suits under changed conditions. P. 146.
Interest is recoverable upon such overcharges from the dates of payment. P. 147.
Semble, that a carrier which has failed in a suit to enjoin the enforcement of state rates as confiscatory is still free to contest'the validity
of particular schedules as applied to particular shippers, in supplemental proceedings for restitution. P. 148.
rhe objection that a state rate discriminates between shippers, in
violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, is not available to a carrier. P. 149. Lake Shore & Michigan

A movement of rough lumber from the woods to milling points in the
same State, where it remains for some months in the process of manufacture before being sold and shipped as finished products to purchasers and destinations previously unidentified, is not a movement
in interstate commerce, although the shipment of the rough material
is actuated by a belief, which is justified by experience and market
conditions, that 95% of the products will be marketed and shipped
outside of the State. P. 1.50.

Opinion of the Court.

On July 18, 1908, the two railway companies concerned
-the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern, which for
brevity may be 'called the Iron Mountain, "and the St.
Louis Southwestern, which may be called the Southwestern-brought separate suits in equity in the Circuit Court
(now the District Court) of the United States for the
Eastern District of Arkansas against the members of the
State Railroad Commission in their official capacity, and
against two citizens of that State named as frequent
shippers of freight upon the railroad lines, for injunctions
to restrain the enforcement of certain intrastate freight
and passenger rates; setting up that the commission was
duly organized under an act of the legislature, and was
thereby authorized to fix rates to be charged by the railroads in the State of Arkansas for the transportation of
freight and passengers in that State; that the commission had officially adopted a tariff of freight rates applying
to all classes and commodities of freight on all railroads
operated in the State., and had ordered it to take effect
on June 15, 1908; that the rates were unreasonable, un'
just, discriminatory, confiscatory, and void; that they
did not yield an adequate return for the services rendered;
and that the operation of said tariff would deprive complainants of their property without due process of law
and deny to them the equal protection of the laws, in
violation of ยง 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It was further alleged that
the rates for the transportation of passengers in the State
fixed by an act of the legislature passed February 9, 1907,
and promulgated by order of the railroad commissioners,
were confiscatory and void in their effect upon the complainant railways and, therefore, violative of the Fourteenth Amendment; but the passenger rates are not involved in the present appeals, and need not be further
mentioned.
The: jurisdiction of the federal court depended solely

OCTOBEIR. TERM, 1918.
Opinion of the Court.

249 U. S.

upon the ground that the cases arose under the Constitution of the United States, and that the matter in controversy in each case exceeded the jurisdictional amount.
Temporary injunctions were issued in September,
1908, and continued in force during the pendency of the
suits. The circuit court upon granting them ordered in
each case that the complainant should execute a bond
in the penal sum of $200,000, conditioned that complainant should keep a correct account respecting its carriage
of passengers and freight, showing the difference between
the tariff actually charged and that which would have been
charged had the rate inhibited been applied, also showing
the particulars of the carriage, and the names of the persons affected as far as practicable, the record to be kept
subject to the further order of the court; and further conditioned that if it should eventually be decided that so
much of the order as inhibited the enforcement of the
rates ought not to have been made, the complainant
should within a reasonable time to be fixed by the court
refund in every instance to the party entitled the excess in
charge over what would have been charged had the inhibited rates been applied, together with lawful interest
and damages. Complainants entered into such bonds
with sureties. Later an additional injunction bond waF
required to be and was furnished by each complainant,
but without sureties, conditioned substantially as above.
Full answers having been filed by the railroad commission, and testimony having been taken, the cases were
brought on to final hearing, and on May 11, 1911, final
decrees were made, the same in both cases. They enjoined the commissioners and their successors, the individual shippers named as defendants, and all other
patrons of the road in the shipment of freight between
stations in the State of Arkansas, from enforcing or attempting to enforce any of the provisions of the freight
tariff in question. In addition to this, and after disposing

ARKADELPHIA CO. v. ST. LOUIS S. W. RY. CO. 139
134.

Opinion of the Court.

of the question of costs, each decree ordered that the bond
for injunction be released and the sureties thereon discharged from liability-, and concluded as follows: "And
the court reserves and retains unto itself jurisdiction of
the subject matter of this suit and of all parties hereto,
to the -nd that such other and further orders and decrees may be made herein as may become necessary by
reason of any changed. conditions as to the-facts, equities
or rights that may hereafter take place or arise."
The railroad commissioners appealed to this court (the
defendant shippers having been severed), the cases were
heard together, and the decrees of the circuit court were
reversed June 16, 1913, with directions to dismiss the bills
without prejudice. Allen v. St. Louis, Iron Mountain &
Southern Ry. Co., 230 U. S. 553. The causes were remanded to the district court, the mandate in each case
reciting the reversal and the order remanding the cause
with directions to dismiss the bill without prejudice, and
concluding as follows. "You, therefore, are hereby commanded that such execution and further proceedings be
had in said cause, in conformity with the opinion and decree of this Court, as according to right and justice, and
the laws of the United States, ought to be had, the said
appeal notwithstanding."
Upon the going down of the mandates the district court
on July 18, 1913, entered decrees in obedience thereto
dismissing the bills without prejudice and dissolving the
injunctions; and at the same time and as a part of the
same decrees made a reference under a rule of the court
to a special master for the purpose of determining the
damages alleged to have been sustained by the railroad
commissioners by reason of the granting of the temporary
and permanent injunctions, declaring: "That in determining these damages, for the recovery of which the said commissioners are not acting for themselves but for the benefit
of all persons, shippers, consignees and passengers, who

OCTOBER TEAM, 1918.
Opinion of the Court.

249 U. S.

have sustained any damages by reason of the granting
of said injunctions," the master was authorized to examine witnesses and to give notice by publication that
all persons having claims against the complainants by
reason of the granting of the injunctions should present
them within a time specified for the purpose.
Under this reference the appellants in cases Nos. 92
and 93 and the appellee in Nos. 94 and 95 intervened and
presented claims for a refund of the difference paid by
them in freight rates between the rates prescribed by the
commission and those put in force by the railway companies. The master reported favorably upon these claims,
dividing the amounts allowed into three periods, the first
and second of which included the time elapsed between
September 3, 1908, when the interlocutory injunctions
were issued, and May 11, 1911, the date of the final decrees,
and the third period included the time elapsed between
the latter dare and July 18, 1913, the date of the decrees
entered upon the mandates. The railway companies
filed exceptions to the master's report, which were sustained by the district court as to the claims involved in
cases Nos. 92 and 93 and overruled as to those involved
in Nos. 94 and. 95, and a combined decree was made accordingly.
The parties aggrieved desiring to appeal, and being in
doubt whether the appeal lay to this court or to the circuit court of appeals, prayed for and were allowed appeals to both courts. Hence the first question that confronts us is whether the decree is the subject of a direct
appeal to this court.
We are clear that this question must be answered in the
affirmative. The appeals 'from the final decrees in the
main causes were brought direct to this court, because of
the constitutional question, under' ยง 5 of the Circuit
Court of Appeals Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat.
827, which provided for such- an appeal in the following

cases, among others: " In any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United
States.
.
. In any case in which the constitution or
law of a State is claimed to be in contravention of the
Constitution of the United States." This section, of
course, was the predecessor of ยง 238, Judicial Code, under
which the present appeals were taken. And it is plain
that the orders of the railroad commission were state
laws within the meaning -of this provision. Williams v.
Bruffy, 96 U. S. 176, 183; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co.
v. Goldsboro, 232 U. S. 548, 555;
The provisions of the Judicial Code which regulate the
jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals originated in
ยง 6 of the Act of 1891. They must be construed together
with those provisions of law that confer upon the district
court (ยง 24, Judicial Code), and formerly conferred upon
the circuit court, original jurisdiction in suits of a civil
nature arising under the Constitution or laws of the United,
States, and in suits between citizens of different States.
By ยง 128 of the Code, the circuit courts of appeals are
to exercise appellate jurisdiction over the final decisions
of the district courts "in all cases other than those in
which appeals and writs of error may be taken direct
to the Supreme Court, as provided in section two hundred and thirty-eight, unless otherwise provided by law;
*and, except as provided in sections two hundred and
thirty-nine and two hundred and forty, the judgments and
decrees of the circuit courts of appeals shall be final in
all cases in which the jurisdiction is dependent entirely"
upon 'diversity of citizanship. Section 239 provides for
the certification of questions by the circuit court of ap-.
peals to this court; ยง 240 permits this court to review -by
certiorari any case in which the judgment or decree of
the circuit court of appeals is made final; and, by ยง 241,
in any. case in which the judgment or decree of that court
is not made final, there may be an appeal or writ of error

'to this court where the matter in controversy exceeds one
thousand dollars besides costs.
The present appeals relate to a decree made iii a subordinate action ancillary to thd main causes, in which, %s
has been stated, the federal jurisdiction was invoked
solely upon the ground that the cases arose under the
Constitution of the United States. It has been held
repeatedly that jurisdiction of subordinate actions is to
be attributed to the jurisdiction upon which the main
suit rested, and hence that where jurisdiction of the main
cause is predicated solely on diversity of citizenship and
the decree therein is for this reason made final in the circuit court of appeals, the judgments and decrees in the ancillary litigation also are final. Rouse v. Letcher, 156
U. S. 47; Gregory v. Van Ee, 160 U. S. 643; Rouse v.
Hornsby, 161 U. S. 588; Pope v. Louistille, &c., Ry. Co.,
173 U. S. 573, 577.
The proceeding out of which the decree now in question
arose was not merely ancillary but was in effect a part
of the main causes, taken for the purpose of carrying into
effect the decrees of this court reversing the final decrees
in the main causes and, at the same time, for the purpose
of giving effect to a reservation of jurisdiction by the
court below as contained in those final decrees. The
supplementary decree that is now before us, since it
simply brings to a conclusion those former suits pursuant
to our decrees therein, must be treated as involving the
construction and application of the Constitution of the
United States and as being made in a case in which a
state law was claimed to be in contravention of the Federal Constitution, within the meaning of ยง 238, Judicial
Code.
Therefore the motions to dismiss must be denied.
Upon the merits, it will. be convenient to take up first
the case of the Southern Cotton Oil Company, appellee
in Nos. 94 and 95, in whose favor claims were allowed by

ARKADELPHIA CO. v. ST LOUIS S. W. RY. CO. 143

Opinion of the Court.

the master as against each of the two railways and for
each of the periods referred to. The railways excepted
upon two grounds: (1) because the final decrees of May 11,
1911, discharging the injunction bonds and releasing the
makers thereof from liability had the effect to relieve the
railways and their sureties from all liability by reason of
the granting of the injunctions; and (2) as .to such claims
for overcharges as accrued subsequent to the date of the
final decrees, on the ground that upon the rendition of
those decrees the injunction bonds ceased to be operative
and. created no further liability, and that the railways
incurred no liability to the claimants under the final decrees. The district court overruled the exceptions and
sustained the claims of the Oil Company as against the
railway companies and the sureties with interest at 6
per cent. per annum from the respective dates that the
overcharges*were made.
We deal first with so much of the overcharges as accrued prior to the final decrees. In St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. McKnight, 244 U. S. 368, 373,
doubt was expressed whether, in view of the form of the
mandate, there was any power in the district court to
determine the liability of the railway companies upon
the bonds. But at that time our attention was not called
to the fact that the mandates contained a provision authorizing further proceedings; a provision that removes
all question of the power of the district court. In re
Louisville, 231 U. S. 639, 645; Louisville v. Cumberland
Telephone Co., 231 U. S. 652.
In support of the contention that the final decrees had
the effect of discharging the complainants and their
sureties from liability upon the bonds by reason of previous overcharges, it is pointed out that this part of the
decrees was not appealed from nor was error assigned to
the court's action in vacating the bonds and releasing
the sureties. Whether, under the circumstances, the ?

OCTOBER TERM, 1918.

249 U. S.

action of this court in reversing the decrees in respect of
their main provisions granting permanent injunctions had
the effect of reversing also that portion which discharged
the liability upon the injunction bonds is a question upon
which we need not pass. For, irrespective of this, those
clauses of the final dqcrees by which the district court
retained jurisdiction, for the' puipose of making such
further orders and decrees as might become necess'ary,
coupled with the subsequent mandates of this court -permitting further proceedings to be taken in conformity
with ou. opinion and decrees and according to right and
justice, empowered the district court to set aside so much
of its final decrees as released the railways and their
sureties from liabilities theretofore incurred under the
injunction bonds. This is what the district court in effect
did when it ordered the reference and sustained the claims
of the Oil Company so far as they accrued prior to the
final decrees.
It is argued that the condition of the bonds-that if
it should eventually be decided that the order inhibiting
the enforcement of the commission rates should not have
been made the complainant should refund, etc.-never
was broken because it was not at any time adjudged that
the allowance of the temporary injunctions was improper.
But this is to construe the bonds according to the letter
and not according to the substance. The state statute
and the orders of the railroad commission entitled shippers
to the benefit of the rates thereby establisheq; and they
were thus entitled at all times except as it became necessary tostay the operation of the rates by equitable process
in order to permit of a judicial investigation into the question of their adequacy. The burden of proof to show them
inadequate was upon the railway companies; and when
they failed to sustain this burden they at the same time
showed that the injunctions ought not to have been

allowed.

ARKADELPHIA CO. v. ST. LOUIS S. W. RY. CO.
134.

145

Opinion of the Court.

As to that portion of the claims which accrued after the
final decrees, this, as we already have held in the McKnight
Case, 244 U. S. 368, '1374, was not recoverable upon the
injunction bonds, nor against the sureties therein. On a
fair construction of the conditions of those instruments,
their obligation expired by limitation when the suits
were brought to a final conclusion. Hence, to the extent
that the supplemental decree now under review awards a
recovery against the sureties for claims accruing after
the final decrees, it must be modified.
But, in our opinion, this portion of the claims is allowable against the railway companies themselves upon the
principle, long established and of general application, that
a party against whom an erroneous judgment or decree
has been carried into effect is entitled, in the event of a
reversal, to be' restored by his adversary to that which
he has lost thereby. This right, so well founded in equity,
has been recognized in the practice of the courts of common law from an early period. Where plaintiff had judgment and execution and defendant afterwards sued out a
writ of error, it was regularly a part of a judgment of
reversal that the plaitiff in error "be restored to all
things which he hath lost by occasion of the said judgment"; and thereupon, in a plain case, a writ of restitution issued at once; but if a question of fact was in doubt,
a writ of scire facias was first issued. Anonymous, Salk.
588; citing Goodyere v. Ince, Cro. Jac. 246; Sympson v7
Juxon, Cro. Jac. 698; Vesjey v. Harris, Crop Car. 328;
see also Lil Ent. 641, 650; Arch. Append. 198, 200. The
doctrine has been most fully recognized in the decisions
of this court. Bank of the United States v. Bank of Washington, 6 Pet. 8, 17; Erwin v. Lowry, 7 How. 172, 184;
Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, 139 U. S. 216.
That a course of action so clearly consistent with the
principles of equity is one proper to be adopted in an
equitable proceeding goes without saying. It is one of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1918.
Opinion of the Court.

249 U. S.

equitable powers, inherent in every court of justice so
long as it retains control of the subject-matter and of the
parties, to correct that which has been wrongfully done
by virtue of its process. Northwestern Fuel'Co. v. Bock,
139 U. S. 216, 219; Johnston v. Bowers, 69 N. J. L. 544,
547.
It is argued that the claimant is not in a position to
invoke the principle of restitution in this proceeding because it was not a party to the original proceedings, but
came in by intervening before the master. This point
is unsubstantial. The railroad commission, in defending
the rate schedules against the attack of the railway companies, represented all shippers; the permanent injunctions
that were awarded by the final decrees restrained all shippers from taking advantage of the commission rates;
and during the time that those decrees remained unreversed the railway companies obtained the benefit of
the injunction by exacting from this claimant, among
others, in addition to the commission rates, those excess
charges that form the basis of the present claims. It is a
typical case for the application of the principle of restitution; and the district court properly held the commission
to be the representative of the shippers for this purpose.
The suggestion that the order of reference was made
under a rule of court that related only to damages recoverable on injunction bonds, and furnished no foundation for a decree against the railways on the theory of
restitution, is without weight. The companies were
fully heard upon the merits, and there is no question about
the facts.
In behalf of the railways, it is argued that the reversal
of the decrees of May 11, 1911, "without prejudice,"
left the rights of the parties still in doubt, and thus rendered it improper for the district court to award damages
against the railways, either on the basis of a breach of the
injunction bonds or on the basis of restitution.

ARKADELPHIA CO. v. ST. LOUIS S. W. RY. CO.
134.

147

Opinion of the Court.

But it seems to us tihat the rights of the present shippers were so clear as to make an allowance of damages
upon the injunction bonds and restitution upon the reversal of the decrees manifestly their due. That the reversal was "without prejudice" did not deprive the decrees of conclusiveness as to past transactions, but only
prevented them from being a bar to future suits for injunction upon a showing of changed conditions. Missouri
v. Chicago,Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., 241 U. S. 533,
539.

The contention that there was error in allowing interest
upon the amount of the overcharges is unsubstantial.
The damage was complete when the overcharges were
made, and as they were wrongfully made and without
consent of the shippers, interest ran from that date on
general principles.
For these reasons, the decree in favor of the Southern
Cotton Oil Company, modified so as to relieve the sureties

from that part of the claims which accrued after the final
decrees of May 11, 1911., will be affirmed.
The claims of both the Arkadelphia Milling Company
(No. 92) and Hasty & Sons (No. 93) .vere based upon the
difference between rates charged on rough lumber from
the forest to milling points and the rates provided in the
commission tariff oV such movements. The tariff contained certain maximumn rates on lumber of this character applicable generally, and in addition certain "rough
material rates" much lower than the others, conditioned
upon a certain percentage of the manufactured product
being shipped over the same line that brought in the
rough material. The railway companies excepted to the
allowance in favor of each of these appellants upon the
ground that the "rough material rates" were discriminatory against shippers who did not reship the specified
percentages of the finished product. As to the Hasty
claim, there was an additional exception based upon the

OCTOBER TERM, 1918.
Opinion of the Court.

249 U. S.

ground that the movement of rough material to milling
points in the State and the subsequent forwarding of
the finished product to market points outside of the State
constituted interstate commerce, so that the rough material rates prescribed by the state commission were not
applicable. The court sustained the exceptions on both
grounds,
To take up first the question of discrimination: The tariff
gave the benefit of the rough material rates only where
the shipper transported over the line of the carrier a certain percentage of the product manufactured from the
rough material. The master found that the condition
was complied with by these shippers and sustained the
allowances accordingly.
The district court sustained the defense of discrimination upon the authority of Lake Shore & ichigan Southern Ry. Co. v. Smith, 173 U. S. 684, and Cotting v. Kansas
City Stock Yards Co., 183 U. S. 79.
We assume, without deciding, that, notwithstanding
the general result adverse to the railway companies in the
main suits, they were still at liberty to dispute the validity
of the rate schedule as it related to particular shippers.
See Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Minnesota,
134 U. S. 418, 460, concurring opinion of Mr. Justice
Miller; St. Louis & San FranciscoRy. Co. v. Gill, 156 U. S.
649, 659, 666; Ex pare Young, 209 U. S. 123; Missouri v.
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., 241 U. S. 533,
538.
In our opinion, however, the district court erred in its
ruling. The rough material rates were but parts of a
general schedule that covered a wide field. This schedule
was established in the exercise of the legislative authority
of the State, and could not be set aside by the court on
the ground of discrimination unJess it amounted to a
denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment.

ARKADELPHIA CO. v. ST. LOUIS S. W. RY. CO.
134.

149

Opinion of the Court.

But there is nothing to show that the rough material
rates wrought any discrimination against the railway
companies. They were applicable upon all railways alike.
If there was--not in the least intimating that there wasundue discrimination as against small shippers or those
who had no occasion to obtain transportation for the
manufactured product over the line of the same carrier,
this was not a matter of which the railways could complain. It is most thoroughly established that before one
may be heard to strike down state legislation upon the
ground of its repugnancy to the Federal Constitution he
must bring himself wi thin the class affected by the unconstitutional feature. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 531, 544; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, 235
U. S. 571, 576; Mallinckrodt Works v. St. Louis, 238 U. S.
41, 54; Cusack 'go. v. Chicago, 242 U. S. 526, 530.
Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co. v. Smith, 173

The discrimination in favor of certain patrons, there referred to, was laid hold of ratther as showing the unreasonable character of the regulation. The authority of- that

not at all in point. While the opinion of Mr. Justice
Brewer covers a wide range of discussion, a majority of
the court:(p. 114) placed the decision upon the ground
that the statute of Kansas applied only to a single company, and not to others engaged in like business in the
State, and thereby denied to that company the equal
protection of the laws.
There remains the question whether the shipments by
J. F. Hasty & Sons of rough material from the forest to
the milling point, followed by the forwarding of the finished
product to points outside of the State, constituted inter-

state commerce. If they did, it is obvious that the state
tariff was not applicable to them.
The following statement, taken from the record, shows
the admitted facts as to the course of business:
"When the rough material reached the mills, it was
manuf~ctured into finished staves, headings and hoops,
and in this condition shipped to whoever purchased them.
The purchaser uses them in making barrels, casks, etc.
The wastings in the finishing of said articles from the
rough material were either disposed of for firewood, or
destroyed. When the rough material left the woods, a
bill of lading was issued from the woods to the mill. When
the rough material reached the mill, it was finished into
some or all of the articles described, when it was stacked
in the yards or placed in kilns to dry. The process of
manufacturing and drying occupied several months, or
on an average this process would be gone through with,
the finished products sold and shipped to the purchaser,
in about five months from the date the rough material
was received at the mill. The claimants classified the
different parts after they came from the mill completely
finished, and made sales from such stock. The markets
for the manufactured articles were almost altogether in
other states than Arkansas, or in foreign' countries, and
about ninety-five per cent. of the sale of finished articles,
that. is, of the total outbound shipments, were made for
delivery at points outside the State of Arkansas, the remaining five per cent. being sold and delivered, or shipped
to points within the State of Arkansas. At the time the
rough material was shlpped to the mills, the mills did
not know to whom they would sell the finished product,
or to what points it would be shipped, but did know that
there was little market for the finished articles in the
State of Arkansas, and expected that they would sell
ninety-five per cent. of said finished articles and ship
them to points outside the State of Arkansas.

Opinion of the Court.

"It was the inte lion of all the claimants herein, at
the time they shipped the rough material into the milling
points, to mill said rough material with the object of

selling the said finished product and shipping it out as
soon as practicable, and all of them knew and intended
at the time they brought the rough material into the mill,
on account of previous course of dealings in the business,
that ninety-five per cent. of the finished product would
be by them shipped to points outside the State of Arkansas.
"The claimants paid the usual property tax to the State
of Arkansas on their stock of materials on hand at the
milling point, whether said stock was in the rough or
finished, the amount of the tax being arrived at according
to the methods in use in the State of Arkansas by the use
of an average basis."
Upon the facts as stated, it is our opinion that the district court erred in treating the movement of the rough
lumber from the woods to the milling point, as interstate
commerce. It.
is not merely that there was no continuous
movement from the forest to the points without the State,
but that when the rough material left the woods it,
was
not intended that it should be transported out of the State,
or elsewhere beyond the mill, until it had been subjected
to a manufacturing process that materially changed its
character, utility, and value. The raw material came
to rest at the mill, and after the product, was manufactured it remained stored there for an indefinite period-manufacture and storage occupying five months on the
average--for the purpose of finding a market. Where it
would eventually be sold no one knew. And the fact that
previous experience indicated that 95 per cent. of it must
be marketed outside of the State, so that this entered
into the purpose of the parties when shipping the rough
material to the mill, did not alter the character of the
latter movement. The question is too well settled by

516; McCluskey v. Marystille & Northern Ry. Co., 243
U. S. 36.
The distinction between these cases and those cited
to sustain the decision of the district court (Swift & Co. v.
United States, 196 U. S. 375, 398; Ohio R. R. Commission
v. Worthington, 225 U. S. 101; Texas & New Orleans R. R.
Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., 227 U. S. 111; Louisiana R. R.
Commission v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., 229 U. S. 336) is so
evident that particular analysis may be dispensed with.
The exceptions sustained by the district court to the
claims of the Arkadelphia Milling Co. and Hasty & Sons
having been found to be untenable, it results that these
claims should be allowed as against the railway companies
and their sureties, so 'far as they, arose before the final
decrees, and as against the railway companies only, so
far as they arose after the final decrees.
Nos. 92 and 93, decree reversed; Nos. 94 and 95, decree
modified and affirmed; and the cause remanded.for
further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
