Argued March 21, 1919.-Decided April 21, 1919.

A state law relieving the plaintiff of the burden of proving negligence
is constitutionally inapplicable to a case under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. P. 532. New Orleans & Northeastern R. R.
Co. v. Harris, 247 U. S. 367.
For the purpose of determining whether error was prejudicial, this
court will examine the whole record, lcav'ing state questions to the

OCTOBER TERM, 1918.

Opinion of the Court.

249 U. S.

under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. At the trial
the Railroad requested a directed verdict on the ground
that there was no evidence of negligence on its part. This
request was refused; the case was submitted to the jury
under instructions, some of which were objected to; and
the verdict was for the plaintiff. Upon appeal from the
judgment entered thereon the Supreme Court of Mississippi refused to consider the question of sufficiency of the
evidence of negligence; and affirmed the judgment on the
ground that the so-called "Prima Facie Act" of Mississippi (ยง 1985 of the Code of 1906, as amended by c. 215,
Laws 1912, p. 290), as to which the trial court had given
no instruction, applied and relieved the plaintiff of the
burden of establishing negligence. 115 Mississippi, 343.
The case comes here'by writ of error under ยง 237 of the
Judicial Code, as amnended by the Act of September 6,
1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726.
Since the decision below, this court has decided that
the Mississippi "Prima Facie Act' ' cannot be applied to
suits under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, NewOrleans & NortheasternR. R. Co. v. Harris,247 U. S.367.;
and the Supreme Court of Mississippi now recognizes this
rule. New Orleans & Northeastern R. R. Co. v. Hanna,
78 So. Rep. 953. The administratrix contends that, as
the trial court did not give any instruction concerning the
"Prima Facie Act," - the error of the Supreme Court in
resting its decision on that statute should not prevent an
affirmance of the judgment below, because the Railroad
was not prejuduced by "the error.
It is true generally in cpses coming from lower federal
courts that the rendering of an erroneous decision on a
particular question, Fidelity & Deposit Co. v., Courtney,
186.U. S. 342, 351; West v. Camden, 135 U. S. 507, 521;
or the assignment by the lower court of an erroneous
reason for a right decision; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v.
Moore, 228 U. S. 433, 435; United States v. One Distillery,

Opinion of the Court.

174 U. S. 149, 151; will not entitle the complaining party
to reversal, if it is clear that his rights were not prejudiced
thereby. And this is likewise true of cases coming from
state courts. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v.
Wright, 239 U. S. 548, 551; New York, Philadelphia &
Norfolk R. R. Co. v. Peninsula Exchange, 240 U. S. 34,
41-42. See Murdock v. City of Memphis, 20 Wall. 590.
Whether the case comes from a state court or a federal
court, this court will, for the purpose of determining
whether the error found may have been prejudicial, examine the whole record; state questions being left to the
decision of the state court in cases coming here from those
courts.
But we cannot say here that the rights of the Railroad
were not prejudiced by the error of the Supreme Court of
Mississippi. It may be, as contended by the administratrix, that there was sufficient evidence of negligence to
go to the jury, and that the general instructions concerning negligence were proper. But the trial court also instructed the jury that "It was the absolute duty of the
defendant to furnish the deceased with a*safe place to
perfonn the duties incident to his employment." It is
clear that, under the circumstances of this case, the duty
was not an absolute one; there was merely a duty to use
reasonable care. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. v.
Bower, 241 U. S. 470; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton,
233 U. S. 492; Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf R. R. Co. v.
Tennessee, 191 U. S. 326, 331. As-examination of this
record does not convince us that the admitted error was
harmless, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi is reversed. The questions presented being properly
here on writ of error, the petition for a writ of certiorari
is denied.
Reversed..
