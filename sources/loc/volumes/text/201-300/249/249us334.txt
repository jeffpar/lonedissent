this retracing of the Hancock line is not directed to the
plaintiffs, but, as we have said, is an investigation by the
United States on its own account. The plaintiffs gained
no rights by the approval of the Sickler line; they lose
none by the substitution of the Perrin line. These acts
were neither adjudications nor agreements. The plaintiffs' rights were fixed before. Even after land had been
sold with reference to a survey and plat that had been
approved, this Court refused to restrain the Secretary
from making a new survey in Kirwan v. Murphy, 189

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 231.

Argued March 14, 17, 1919.-Decided March 31, 1919.

An owner 1who by personal contract has warranted the seaworthiness
of a vessel, and is also privy to and has knowledge of her unseaworthiness, to which is due a loss of cargo, is not within the Limited
Liability Act of June 26,'1884.
Concurrent findings of two lower courts accepted.

CAPITOL TRANSP. CO. v. CAMBRIA STEEL CO. 335
334.

Opinion of the Court.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. J. Parker Kirlin, with whom Mr. George L. Canfield was on the briefs, for petitioner.
Mr. FrancisS. Laws, with whom Mr. Sherwin A. Hill
was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUsTIcE HoLEs delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a petition to limit liability for the loss of cargo
on The Benjamin Noble, brought by the present petitioner
after libels in personam had been filed in different districts by the cargo owners, the Cambria Steel Company.
The right was denied by the District Court on the ground
that the vessel was unseaworthy with the privity and
knowledge of the owner when sloe sailed and that the
owner had made a personal contract by which it warranted seaworthiness. 232 Fed. Rep. 382. The findings,
rulings and decree of the District Court were affirmed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals. 244 Fed. Rep. 95. 156
C. C. A. 523. Sub nom. The Benjamin Noble. A writ
of certiorari was granted before Luckenbach v. McCahan
Sugar Refining Co., 248 U. S. 139, and Pendleton v. Benner
Line, 246 U. S. 353, were decided but when they were
before this Court. 245 U. S. 648. See 242 U. S. 638.
241 U. S. 677. The findings of fact are contested here,
and because of some expressions it is suggested that the
Circuit Court of Appeals is to be taken not to have made
findings of its own upon the facts. On the contrary it
appears to us to have reconsidered the evidence, giving
to the findings below only the weight usually accorded
to those of the tribunal that sees the witnesses and we
see no sufficient reason for departing from the general
rule where'the two lower courts have concurred. 248
U. S. 139, 145.

OrOBER TERM, 1918.
Opinion of the Court.

249 U. S.

We are urged to reconsider the question w'hetaer the
limitation of liability is not made independent of the
"privity or knowledge" of the owner by the omission 6f
those words from the Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121, ยง 18,
23 Stat. 53, 57, coupled with the repeal, in ยง 30, of all
laws and parts of laws in conflict with. the provisions of
that act. It is argued that the effect of the omission and
the repealing section is to do away with the former qualification in Rev. Stats., ยง4283, and the argument is fortified by a reference to the history of the act, which shows
that some of the Senators thought it important to make
the limitation absolute. On the other hand in Butler v.
Boston & Savannah S. S. Co., 130 U. S.527, 553, 554, it
was said by Mr. Justice Bradley that possibly the later
act was intended to remove all doubt as to the application of the law to all cases of loss "caused without the
privity or knowledge of the owner." We find no different
expression in O'Brien v. Miller, 168 U. S.287, 303. Mr.
Justice Bradley's opinion was adopted after considerable
discussion in Richardson v. Harmon, 222 U. S. 96, 106,
and Richardson v. Harmon was accepted as establishing
that the statute does not limit liability for the personal
acts of the owners done with knowledge, in the late case
of Pendleton v. Benner Line, 246 U. S. 353, 356. In that
case the argument that the limitation of the exoneration
to acts &c. done or incurred without the privity oi knowledge of the owner was repealed by the Act of 1884, was
presented in the fullest way.
We very much appreciate the danger that the act
should be cut down from its intended effect by too easy
a finding of privity or knowledge on the part of owners,
as also by too liberal an attribution to them of contracts
as personally theirs. We are not disposed to press the
law in those directions further than the cases go. But in
this case in addition to the finding of the owner's privity
to the unseaworthiness was the further finding that the

contract was the personal contract of the petitioner--a
finding that seems warranted if any contract by a corporation can fall within the class. That such contracts may
impose a liability that cannot be transferred to what is
left of the ship is decided. Luckenbach v. McCahan
Sugar Refining Co., 248 U. S. 139, 149. Upon the whole
case we cannot escape from the conclusion that the decree
must be affirmed.
Decree afirmed.

UNION OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA v. SMITH.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA.
No. 8: Submitted November 13, 1918.-Decided March 31, 1919.
In order to create valid rights or initiate a title as against the United
States under the mining laws, a discovery of mineral within the
location is essential. P. 346.
For the purpose of exploring for mineral, a qualified person who has
entered peaceably upon vacant public land is treated as a licensee
or tenant at will of the United States and allowed, as of necessity,
a right of possession, the extent of which, i. e., whether confined to
pedis possessio or coterminous with the boundaries of his inchoate
location,-is not here decided. Id.
The.right of possession before discovery may be maintained only by
continued actual occupancy by a qualified locator or his rpresentatives, engaged in persistent, and diligent prosecution of work
looking to the discovery of mineral. P. 348.
Discovery may follow the marking and recording of a mining claim,
and perfect the location as of the time of discovery, provided no
rights of third parties have intervened. P. 347.,
The terms "assessments," "annual assessment labor," and "assessinent work," in acts of Congress as in the practice of miners, have
nothing to do with the locating or holding of a claim before discovery, but refer to the annual labor required by Rev. Stats., ยง 2324,
