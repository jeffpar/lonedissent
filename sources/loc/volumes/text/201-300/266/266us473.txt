COMPAGNIE INTERNATIONALE v. MILLER.

Statement of the Case.

457

we find no adequate support for the suggestion that Congress authorized the taking of property of other corporations because one or more stockholders were enemis.
Logically carried out this view would have permitted the
seizure of all property of companies incorporated by any
associated power, e. g., Great Britain, solely because some
German held one share of the*many thousand. The
result indicates that the premise is bad. What the President might do was plainly set down in well considered
words.
The challenged decree must be reversed and the cause
will be remanded to the Supreme Court of the District
of Columbia for further proceedings in conformity with
this opinion.
Reversed.
