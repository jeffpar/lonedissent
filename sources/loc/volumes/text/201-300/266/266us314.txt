The land in question here was not ih that situation
when the petition was filed. It was not then exempt under the state law, but was subject to levy and sale. One
of the conditions on which it might have been rendered
exempt had not been performed. Under the state law
the fact that the other conditions were present did not
suffice. The concurring presence of all was necessary to
create a homestead exemption.
Decree reversed.

DAVIS, AGENT OF THE PRESIDENT UNDER SECTION 206 OF THE TRANSPORTATION ACT, 1920,
v. O'HARA.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT

OF THE STATE OF

NEBRASKA.
No. 63. Argued October 10, 13, 1924.-Decided November 24, 1924.
1. General orders of the Director General of Railroads providing
that suits against him must be brought in the county or district
where the plaintiff resided at the time of accrual of the cause of
action, or in the county or district where it arose, are in legal
effect orders of the President and are valid. Federal Control Act,
§ 10, 40 Stat. 456. P. 317.
2. An action by an employee of the Director General for personal
injuries sustained in the operation of a railroad under federal control is an action against the United States; and only to the extent
clearly indicated by the Federal Control Act and orders of the
Director General was the sovere-gn immunity from suit waived.
Id.
3. Decision of a state supreme court that the Director General, by
not sufficiently asserting and insisting upon it, waived immunity
under the federal act and orders from being sued in the particular
venue, does not bind this court on review. P. 318.
4. A special appearance for the declared purpose of objecting to
jurisdiction over the subject matter, as well as to jurisdiction over
defendant's person,-construed as confined to the latter point by
the grounds set up in the motion to quash the summons. P. 318.

Opinion of the Court.

5. In Nebraska, objection to jurisdiction over the person, in a special
appearance and motion to quash the summons for defects not apparent on the face of the complaint, is not waived by adding an
unfounded objection to jurisdiction over the subject matter. P.
319.
6. A motion to quash service and a defense, based on allegations of
fact which show that the action is in a wrong venue, which are
consistent with the complaint and not denied by the plaintiff,
should not be overruled because the defendant did not bring evidence to sustain the allegations. P. 319.
7. A defense well pleaded but not urged at a first trial may be insisted on at a second trial. P. 321.
8. A ruling of a state supreme court that its former decision of a
federal question became the law of the case on a second appeal,
does not affect the power of this Court to examine the question
upon review of the final judgment. P. 321.

CERTIORARI

to a judgment of the Supreme Court of

Nebraska which affirmed a judgment recovered by O'Hara
in an action for personal injuries brought against the Director General of Railroads. The case went .twice to the
court below. 108 Neb. 74; 109 Id. 615.
Mr. C. A. Magaw and Mr. N. H. Loomis, with whom
Mr. A. A. McLaughlin and Mr. Edson Rich were on
the briefs, for petitioner.
Mr. John 0. Yeiser and Mr. John C: Travis, with whom
Mr. Benjamin S. Baker was on the brief, for respondent.
MF. JUSTICE BuTIR delivered the opinion of the Court.
September 13, 1919, while employed by the Director
General of Railroads in the operation of a railroad under
federal control, plaintiff was injured by explosion of a
blasting cap. The injury occurred at Council Bluffs,
Iowa, where he then resided. He brought this action in
the district court of Douglas County, Nebraska, to recover damages for his injuries. His petition did not show

where the injury occurred or where he lived when injured.
The Director General appeared specially for the purpose
of objecting to the jurisdiction of the court " over the person of the defendant and over the subject matter of this
action ", and moved to quash the summons; the grounds
alleged were "that General Orders Nos. 50, 50-A, 18, 18-A
and 18-B,' issued by the Director General
. . provide that all suits against the Director General of Railroads, as authorized by General Order No. 50-A, must be
brought in the county or district where the plaintiff resided at the time of the accrual of the cause of action, or
in the county or district where the cause of action arose ";
that plaintiff, at the time of the accrual of the cause of action, did not reside in Douglas County, Nebraska, and that
the cause of action did not arise there. Plaintiff did not
deny the allegations on which the motion was based. The
district court overruled the motion without more. The
defendant answered, setting up the same objection to
jurisdiction and his defenses on the merits. Later, plaintiff filed an amended petition; and to that defendant filed
answer, inwhich he again asserted his objection tb jurisdiction. At the trial, after the evidence was heard, the
court upon its own motion instructed the jury to return a
verdict for defendant; and judgment was entered in his
favor. The plaintiff made a motion for a new trial which
was denied. He then appealed to the Supreme Court.
Defendant's objection to the jurisdiction was urged by
brief filed by leave of court specially given. But the
question was not decided, because defendant had not
taken a cross appeal. 108 Neb. 74, 81. The judgment of
the district court was reversed on the merits. At the new
trial plaintiff testified that his injuries occurred at Council
Bluffs, Iowa, and that he resided there when he was in'See Bulletin No. 4, United States Railroad Administration, p. 186

jured. The defendant, by appropriate objections and motions made at the time of impaneling the jury, at the
close of plaintiff's evidence, and at the close of all the
evidence, insisted upon its objection to the jurisdiction of
the court, but all were overruled. There was a verdict
and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed to the
Supreme Court. A syllabus (by the court) contains the
following: "Where the director general specially appears
to object to the jurisdiction of the court over his person,
and at the same time challenges the jurisdiction of the
court over the subject matter of the controversy, as to
which the motion is not well founded, this is a voluntary
appearance equivalent to the service of summons, and
gives the court jurisdiction over the person of such officer."
109 Neb. 615. The judgment appealed from was affirmed.
Section 10 of the Federal Control Act, 40 Stat. 456, provides that "carriers while under Federal control shall be
subject to all laws and liabilities as common carriers
* . . except in so far as may be inconsistent with
* . . any order of the President
. . " The general orders are in legal effect orders of the President, and
are valid.2 This is an action against the United States.
The railroads were taken over and operated by it in its
sovereign capacity, and it will not be held to have waived
any sovereign right or privilege unless it has plainly done
so. DuPont De Nemours & Co.v. Davis, 264 U. S.456,

General.

plaintiff's claim in the Nebraska court. Alabama, &c.

Opinion of the Court.

266 U. S.

Ry. Co. v. Journey supra. This Court is not bound by
the decision of the state court that defendant waived his
federal right under the act and the orders of the Director
General, and it may determine for itself whether he sufficiently asserted and insisted upon that right. Davis v.
Wechsler, 263 U. S. 22, 24; Railroad Commission v. Eastern Texas R. R., 264 U. S. 79, 86; Georgia Ry. Co. v. Decatur, 262 U. S. 432, 438; Creswill v. Knights of Pythias,
225 U. S. 246, 261.
Defendant's special appearance and motion did not
amount to an objection to the jurisdiction over the subject matter; that is, it did not raise the question whether,
considering the nature of the cause of action asserted and
the relief prayed by plaintiff, the court had power to adjudicate concerning the subject matter of the class of
cases to which plaintiff's claim belonged. Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 316; Reynolds v. Stockton, 140 U. S.
254, 268. The stated purpose of the special appearance
was broader than the grounds alleged and, in so far as it
related to the subject matter, was not carried into effect.
There was nothing in the moving papers to suggest that
the Nebraska court had no jurisdiction to try and determine actions, founded on negligence, to recover damages
for personal injuries suffered by railway employees while
engaged in the performance of their work. Undoubtedly,
the district court of Douglas County would have had
jurisdiction if the accident happened in that county or
district, or if plaintiff resided there at the time he was injured. The general orders on which defendant's motion
rested did not relate to jurisdiction of the subject matter;
and the Supreme Court of Nebraska so held. The substance of the objection stated and the grounds alleged
should control, rather than the declaration of purpose.

etc. Co., (rehearing), 71 Neb. 273, 275. And,-even if the
motion amounted to an objection to jurisdiction over
subject matter,--it cannot reasonably be held that it
gave the court jurisdiction. Under the statutes and practice in Nebraska, defendant was not required to appear
specially to object to jurisdiction over his person. Where,
as in this case, the defects do not appear on the face of the
petition, objection to jurisdiction over the person of the
defendant and over the subject matter of the action may
be taken by answer setting up defenses on the merits,
without or after prior objection by special appearance and
motion. § 8612, Compiled Statutes, 1922. Hurlburt v.
Palmer, 39 Neb. 158, 178, 179; Kyd v. Exchange Bank of
Cortland, 56 Neb. 557, 561; Baker v. Union Stock Yards
Nat. Bank, 63 Neb. 801, 803; Templin v. Kimsey, 74 Neb.
614. And the rule that objections to jurisdiction over the
person are waived by general appearance does not apply.
It follows that, in such cases, there is no reason for holding that an unfounded objection to jurisdiction over the
subject matter, in a special appearance and motion to
quash the summons, waives objections to jurisdiction over
the person. We hold that defendant did not by his motion waive his right to immunity from suit on plaintiff's
claim in the Nebraska court or voluntarily appear and
give that court jurisdiction.
As additional reasons for its conclusion, the Supreme
Court said that the special appearance and motion to
quash the summons were properly overruled, because
there was no evidence to support the motion; that no objection was made during the first trial to the jurisdiction
of the court, and that no motion for rehearing was made
in that court after the filing of its opinion on the first
appeal, "and the former decision of the court has become
the law of the case".
The facts on which the defendant's motion was based
were not denied by plaintiff. The order of the district

court states that "being fully advised in the premises, the
court does overrule said special appearance . . ." The
order overruling the motion was made March 13, 1920,
some time before the decisions of this Court which declared the validity and effect of the general orders on
which plaintiff's motion was based. Missouri PacificR. R.
Co. v. Ault, supra, was decided June 1, 1921. Alabama,
&c. Ry Co. v. Journey, supra, was decided November 7,
1921. There had been a number of decisions holding
general orders 18 and 18A invalid.' The record does not
show whether the district court followed these decisions,
or, as suggested in the opinion of the Supreme Court,
based its ruling on a lack of evidence to support the motion. There wasno issue as to the facts on which defendant's motion was based, and it could not reasonably be
held that he was bound to bring forward evidence to establish statements consistent with the allegations of the petition, and which had not been questioned by plaintiff.
Notwithstanding its reference to the matter, the Supreme
Court, as we read its decision, did not hold that defendant's failure at the first trial to insist that the district
court again rule on the objection to jurisdiction operated
to deprive him of the right to do so at the second trial.
1General Orders Nos. 18 and 18-A were held invalid in Friesen v.
Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. (U. S, D. C. Neb., Dec. 27, 1918), 254

The objection was well pleaded as a defense in accordance

with the Nebraska practice. There is no reason why a
defense pleaded, but not urged at an earlier trial, may not
be insisted upon at a new trial. See Moulor v. American
Life Insurance Co., 111 U. S. 335, 337. The ruling that
the former decision of the state court became the law of
the case does not affect the power of this Court to regxamine the question. Messenger v. 4nderson, 225 U. S.
436, 444; Grays Harbor Co. v. Coats-Fordney Co., 243
U. S. 251, 257; GeorgiaRy. Co. v. Decatur,supra,437.
It must he held that defendant plainly asserted and
reasonably insisted upon his immunity from suit on plaintiff's claim in the Nebraska court under § 10 of the Federal
Control Act and the orders of the Director General. His
objection to the jurisdiction should have been sustained.
Judgment reversed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR TE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 70. Submitted October 13, 1924.-Decided November 24, 1924.
1. Under the provision of § 14b of the Bankruptcy Act denying
a discharge to a bankrupt who has "obtained money or property
on credit upon a materially false statement in writing made by
him to any person . *. . for the purpose of obtaining credit
from such person," the vice inherent in the original falsity of a
statement is not remedied by lapse of time; and if the creditor
extend credit upon such a statement while it is still in force and
binding upon the bankrupt, within the time in which the bankrupt intended it should serve that end, it does not lie in the bankrupt's mouth to say that, by reason of extrinsic circumstances,
the creditor was not justified in relying upon it. P. 326.

a bankrupt upon the ground that he failed to keep books of ac-
