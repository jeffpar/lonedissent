Syllabus.

represents the full benefit to the railway property within
the district.
The contention is faulty in several respects. The increased traiffic will not be carried from one end of the railway to the other, but only from DeQueen to Kansas City.
The railway property within the district includes much
more than the two miles of main track. Doubtless, the increased traffic will in a way benefit the railway as a whole;
but the traffic will be appurtenant to the portion of the
railway at DeQueen, and will specially enhance the importance and value of the property there as a part of the
line.
Other contentions are advanced which need not be
specially noticed here, because they are shown to be quite
untenable in the decisions before cited.
We conclude that the objections made to the assessment
on constitutional grounds are not well taken.
Judgment affirmed.
AETNA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ET AL. v.
DUNKEN, ADMINISTRATRIX OF DUNKEN.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF CIVIL APPEALS OF THE THIRD
SUPREME JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.

No. 62. Argued October 14, 1924.-Decided December 15, 1924.
1. A finding of a state court that a contract was completed,--a pure
question of fact,--held not reviewable by this Court where the
.'federal right involved depended on the legal question whether, the
contract being completed, rights and obligations under it were
governed by a local statute or the laws of another State. P. 393.
2. A seven-year term policy, issued by a life insurance company in
Connecticut and delivered to the insured in Tennessee where he
resided, provided that, at the sole option of the insured, upon any
anniversary of its date, without medical regxamination, it was convertible into a twenty payment life commercial policy, bearing
the same date and issued at the same age, on payment of the

difference between the premiums then already paid and those required under the converted policy. The insured in due form exercised the option after he had become a citizen and inhabitant of
Texas, and the converted policy was sent to him there. Held:
(a) That the second policy was in effect but a continuation of the
first and, like it, was controlled by the laws of Tennessee. P. 395.
(b) That, in an action upon the second policy in Texas, where th.e
insurance company was doing business when it issued, a Texas statute (Art. 4746, Rev. Civ. Stats. 1911,) imposing a penalty and
allowing attorney's fees could not constitutionally be applied
against the company, since a State cannot regulate business outside
of her limits and control contracts made by citizens of other States,
in disregard of their laws. P. 399.
248 S. W. 165, reversed.
ERROR to a judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals of
Texas which affirmed a judgment for the amount of a
life insurance policy, less certain offsets, together with a
statutory penalty and attorney's fee. The Supreme
Court of the State dismissed an application for a writ
of error for want of jurisdiction.

was on the brief, for plaintiffs in error.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an action brought by the defendant in error
upon a policy of insurance issued by the insurance company on the life of W. J. Dunken. The insurance conpany is a Connecticut corporation. When it issued the
policy it was doing business in Texas under the laws of
that State, of which Dunken then was a citizen and inhabitant.
The Texas statute provides:
"Any contract of insurance payable to any citizen or
inhabitant of this state by an insurance company or cor-

poration doing business within this state shall be held to
be a contract made and entered into under and by virtue
of the laws of this §tate relating to insurance, and governed
thereby, notwithstanding such policy or contract of insurance may provide that the contract was executed, and
the premiums and policy (in case it becomes a demand)
should be payable without this state, or at the home office
of the company or corporation issuing the same." Art.
4950, Rev. Civ. Stats., 1911.
The statute further provides that where loss occurs
failure to make payment within thirty days after demand
shall render the company liable to pay the holder of the
policy in addition to the amount of loss twelve per cent.
damages on the amount of such loss, together with reasonable attorney fees for the prosecution and collection thereof. Art. 4746.
These provisions, together with others, are declared to
be conditions upon which foreign insurance companies
shall be permitted to do business within the State and
any such corporation engaged in issuing insurance policies
within the State is deemed to have assented thereto as a
condition precedent to the right to engage in such business. Art. 4972.
The policy in question was issued under the following
circumstances: On December 17, 1910, H. B. Alexander,
manager for the insurance company in the State of Tennessee, took the application of Dunken, then a resident of
Tennessee, for a seven-year term policy. The policy was
duly issued in Connecticut and delivered in Tennessee to
Dunken. By its terms, at the sole option of the insured,
upon any anniversary of its date, without medical regxamination, it was convertible, among other forms of insurance, into a twenty payment life commercial policy, bearing the same date and issued at the same age, on payment
of the difference between the premiums already paid and
those required under the converted policy. On February

19, 1916, the seven-year policy still being in force, Dunken, in the meantime having moved to Texas, exercised
his option and applied to the company, for a conversion
"in accordance with the conditions" of that policy just
stated. His application stipulated that the statements
and answers in the original application for the seven-year
term policy should be the basis of the new policy and form
a part of the same. The application was mailed to the
Tennessee manager and by him forwarded to the home
office of the company in Connecticut. There the old
policy was cancelled, stamped "Surrendered; new number, 152,775; $10,000 ",and a twenty payment life commercial policy, bearing the new number and conforming to
the express terms of the agreement in the original policy,
was issued and forwarded to Alexander in Tennessee for
delivery. Alexander sent the policy by mail to Dunken at
Waco, Texas, together with a loan note and a form authorizing the company to deduct the 1916 premium from
the proceeds of the loan to be signed by him and returned.
Dunken received these documents in due course of mail
and retained the policy, but did not answer Alexander's
letter, pay the premiums or execute the loan papers.
Three months later he died. In the letter transmitting
the policy Alexander fixed no time for the execution and
return of the loan note and authority to deduct the 1916
premium; nor did he suggest that the delivery of the
policy was in any way qualified. There was no further
correspondence or notice of any kind from the company.
It was agreed that the demand required by Article 4746
of the Texas statute, heretofore cited, was made by defendant in error. Judgment was rendered against the
company for the amount of the policy less certain offsets,
together with the statutory penalty of twelve per cent.
and an attorney's fee of $3,000, which judgment was duly
affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals. 248 S.W. 165.
The Supreme Court of the State having dismissed an ap-

plication for a writ of error for want of jurisdiction, the
writ of error here was issued to the intermediate court.
Randall v. Commissioners, 261 U. S.252.
The judgment below is challenged upon these .grounds:
(1) The policy as shown by the undisputed evidence
never became a completed or binding contract; (2) it was
a Tennessee or Connecticut contract and, since under
the laws of those States no penalty or attorney's fee was
recoverable, the Texas statute as construed and applied,
violates the contract impairment clause, the full faith
and credit clause, and the several clauses of § 1 of the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution;
and (3) assuming it to be a Texas contract, plaintiff having demanded and sued for substantially more than she
recovered, the suit was rightfully defended and the statute as construed and applied to that'situation violates
the same provisions of the Federal Constitution.
Defendant in error moves to dismiss the writ of error
or affirm the judgment of the state court upon the ground
that the asserted federal questions are so lacking in substance as to be frivolous. This motion must be denied.
Other matters aside, the contention that the contract is
controlled by the law of Tennessee or Connecticut-in
which event the Texas statute in respect of penalty and
attorney's fee as construed and applied, is unconstitutional-clearly presents a substantial question under the
full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. Royai

to be considered presents a pure question of fact, which

was decided against plaintiffs in error by the jury in response to specially submitted issues. Upon these issues
the jury found that the new policy was delivered by an
agent of the insurance company as a completed contract
with the intention that it should become effective and
binding from the time of its receipt by Dunken; aiid that
such delivery as a completed contract was acquiesced in
by an executive officer of the company. This verdict met
with the concurrence of the trial court and, after a full
review of the evidence, of the appellate court. The rule
is settled that the decision of a state court upon a question of fact ordinarily cannot be made the subject of inquiry here. See for example, Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co.
v. Haber, 169 U. S. 613, 639; Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U. S.
447, 453-454. To this general rule there are two equally
well settled exceptions: " (1) Where a Federal right has
been denied as the result of a finding shown by the record
to be without evidence to support it, and (2) where a
conclusion of law as to a Federal right and findings of
fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary, in order
to pass upon the Federal question, to analyze the facts."
Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, 236 U. S. 585,
593, and cases cited. See also Truax v. Corrigan,257 U.
S. 312, 324-325. This case comes within the general rule
and not within either of the exceptions. The fact decided
is that the policy sued upon was delivered as a completed
and binding contract. The federal question presented
arises from the ruling of the court that the Texas and not
the Tennessee statute controls this contract. The asserted federal right was not denied as a result of the finding of fact; nor are the conclusion in respect of the federal
right and the finding interdependent or so intermingled as
to cause it to be necessary to consider the latter in order
to pass upon the former. That the contract was effective
is a fact equally consistent with the determination of the
federal question either way.

Opinion of the Court.

Second. The argument that the policy was not a Texas
contract proceeds upon two grounds: (a) that the converted policy became effective, if it ever did, when it was
mailed by the company's agent in Tennessee; (b) that
the original policy was clearly a Tennessee or Connecticut
contract, and the converted policy, being executed under
the optional privilege granted by the original contract
and in exact compliance with its terms, is a subsidiary
and not an independent agreement, and the rights and obligations of the parties are controlled by the law of the
original contract.
We proceed at once to the consideration of the second
ground, since if that is well founded it will be unnecessary to consider the first. Whether a subsequent contract
made in pursuance of the provisions of an earlier one is
to be regarded as separate, detached and independent, or
as a continuation and in effect the same, is a matter not
always free from difficulty. The question as applied to
substituted policies of insurance has not heretofore arisen
in this Court and apparently has seldom arisen in the
state courts. In Dannhauserv. Wallenstein, 169 N. Y.
199, 208, where a ten payment life policy provided that
after the payment of two or more equal premiums, notwithstanding default in payment of subsequent premiums, the company would grant a paid-up policy for a
proportionate part of the original amount of the policy,
it was held that such paid-up policy when issued was
not an independent contract. The court said:
"It was simply a continuation of the original contract
under the option which gave the holder thereof the right,
after two or more annual premiums had been paid, to cease
paying the annual premiums and take a paid-up policy in
exchange for the first one. It was a change in the mere
form of the contract expressly provided for by its own
terms. It is true that the first policy, the original evidence of the contract between the insured and the com-

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Opinion of the Court.

266 U. S.

pany, was 'surrendered to the company and canceled'
when the paid-up policy was issued, but this was simply
a part of, and in compliance with, the terms of the original
contract. The contract was continued as it provided that
it might be, in the form of a paid-up policy, such as was
accepted by the defendant. It was not a modification,
but a fulfillment of the original contract."
The facts were held to justify an opposite conclusion in
Gan&v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 214 N. Y. 326. There the
original policy contained a provision to the effect that if
the insured should commit suicide within one year from
the date thereof the policy should be void. It allowed,
among other options, an exchange for another policy bearing the same date upon payment of a sum equal to the
difference between the premiums actually paid and those
which would have been earned by the substituted policy.
The substituted policy, however, bore the date of its issue
and by its terms the suicide provision ran for "one year
from the date hereof." It was contended that, since the
assured might have exercised his option so as to have
made the date of the original policy the date of the substituted policy, the option actually exercised should be
construed to that effect. But the court replied that, the
parties having agreed that the date of the new policy
should be that of its issue and so made it, and the premium
payable being adapted to the kind of policy selected and
to the then insuring age of the assured, it must be held to
be an independent contract to be construed without reference to the options not exercised.
Under different circumstances the same question came
before the Supreme Court of Tennessee, in Silliman.v. International Life Ins. Co., 131 Tenn. 303. There a fiveyear term policy provided that the insured might at any
premium date exchange it for any form of policy then in
use at the premium fixed by his age at the time of the
exchange or at the age in the original policy by paying the

AETNA LIFE INS. CO. v. DUNKEN.
389

Opinion of the Court.

difference in premiums, etc. The policy contained a provision to the effect that in case of suicide within one year
from its date the company should be liable only for the
amount of the premiums paid. Four years later the insured demanded another form of policy and the exchange
was made on the old application and medical examination,
the terms of the second policy being in strict accord with
the obligations of the first policy. The new policy limited the right of recovery in case of suicide "within one
year from the date on which this insurance begins." Six
months after the change of policies, insured committed
suicide. The Tennessee court held that the two policies
were in effect one and the same contract, and that the
insurance began within the meaning of the suicide clause
in the second policy at the time the first policy was issued,
since the dominant purpose of the parties was to carry out
the provisions of the contract contained in that policy.
That time having run before the exchange, the clause was
rejected as surplusage. The Cans Case was distinguished
upon several grounds, and especially upon the ground
that there was nothing to show that the second Tennessee
policy was an independent, complete and isolated contract,
unconnected with the first policy; but on the contrary that
it was expressly shown that they were connected, "and
that the second was issued because of and in compliance
with the requirements of the first." See also, McDonnell
v. Alabama Gold Life Ins. Co., 85 Ala. 401, 412-415; People v. Globe Mutual Life Ins. Co., 15 Abbott's N. 0. 75;
Barry v. Brune, 71 N. Y. 261, 268.
While this Court has not passed upon the precise question here presented, it had before it an analogous question
in New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dodge, 246 U. S. 357, and
Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Liebing, 259 U. S. 209. The
Dodge Case dealt with an insurance policy issued in Missouri to a resident and citizen of Missouri by a New York
corporation with a Missouri license. The policy provided

398

Opinion of the Court.

266 U. S.

that "cash loans can be obtained by the insured on the
sole security of this policy on demand at any time after
this policy has been in force two full years," etc. It was
provided that application for any loan should be in writing and that the loan would be subject to the terms of the
company's loan agreement. Under this provision the insured procured a loan at the home office of the company
in New York City, hypothecating the policy there as security. The loan agreement declared that it was made
and to be performed in New York and under and pursuant to the laws of that State. Upon failure of the insured
to pay a premium the entire reserve of the policy was applied to satisfy the loan and thereupon all obligation ceased
under the provisions of New York law. The insured having died, suit was brought by the beneficiary upon the
policy in reliance upon the Missouri nonforfeiture statute
(Rev. Stats., 1899, § 7897), by the terms of which, unlike
the New York statute, the insurance would have continued in force. This Court held that while the policy
was clearly a Missouri contract the loan agreement was an
independent contract made in New York and subject to
New York law. In the course of the opinion it is said
(p. 373):
"It should be noted that the clause in the policy providing 'cash loans can be obtained by the insured on the
sole security of this policy on demand, etc.,' certainly imposed no obligation upon the company to make such a
loan if the Missouri statute applied and inhibited valid
hypothecation of .the reserve as security therefor as defendant in error maintains. She cannot, therefore, claim
anything upon the theory that the loan contract actually
consummated was one which the company had legally obligated itself to make upon demand."
The decision proceeds upon the theory that the provision in respect of loans did not constitute an absolute
promise to make a loan upon simple demand at all events;

AETNA LIFE INS. CO. v. DUNKEN.
389

Opinion of the Court.

and that the loan contract was'an independent, subsequent agreement made in another State. In the Liebing
Case, subsequently decided, the policy executed in Missouri provided that "the company will . . . loan
amounts within the limits of the cash surrender value,"
etc., and this Court, pointing out that the language of
the policy in the Dodge Case was "cash loans can be obtained," etc., said (pp. 213-214):
"The policy now sued upon contained a positive promise to make the loan if asked, whereas in the one last mentioned [the Dodge Case] it might be held that some discretion was reserved to the company."
In the light of these decisions, then, we inquire whether
the second policy issued to Dunken is to be controlled by
Tennessee or Texas law. The contract contained in the
original policy was a Tennessee contract. The law of
Tennessee entered into it and became a part of it. The
Texas statute was incapable of being constitutionally applied to it since the effect of such application would be to
regulate business outside the State of Texas and control
contracts made by citizens of other States in disregard of
their laws under which penalties and attorney's fees are
not recoverable. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head, 234 U.
S. 149; Overby v. Gordon, 177 U. S.214, 222. The second policy here was issued in pursuance of, and was dependent for its existence and its terms upon, the express
provisions of the contract contained in the first one. By
those provisions, upon the simple application of the insured, the new policy must issue. Nothing was left to
future agreement. The terms of the new policy were
fixed when the original policy was made. In effect, it is
as though the first policy had provided that upon demand
of the insured and payment of the stipulated increase
in premiums that policy should, automatically, become a
twenty payment life commercial policy. It was issued
not as the result of any new negotiation or agreement but

400

Opinion of the Court.

266 U. S.

in discharge of preexisting obligations. It merely fulfilled promises then outstanding; and did not arise from
new or additional promises. The result in legal contemplation was not a novation but the consummation of
an alternative specifically accorded by, and enforceable in
virtue of, the original contract. If the insurance company had refused to issue the second policy upon demand,
the insured could have compelled it by a suit in equity
for specific performance. See Tayloe v. Merchants' Fire
Ins. Co., 9 How. 390, 405.
From these premises it necessarily results that the second policy follows the status of the first for which it was
exchanged, and is not subject. to the Texas statute relating
to penalties and attorney's fees but is controlled by Tennessee law. The judgment below, therefore, in so far as
it gives effect to the Texas statute by imposing a penalty
of twelve per cent. and allowing attorney's fees, is erroneous, in that the Texas statute cannot constitutionally be
applied to a Tennessee contract.
Third. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the third con tention urged as ground for reversal.
The judgment below must be reversed and the cause
remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion.
Reversed.
