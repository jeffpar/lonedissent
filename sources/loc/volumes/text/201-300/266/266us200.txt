COURT OF THE CITY OF ST. LOUIS.
ERROR AND CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE
STATE OF MISSOURI.

No. 89.

Argued October 17, 1924.-Decided November 17, 1924.

1. A judgment of a state Supreme Court denying an application for
a writ of prohibition to prevent a lower court from entertaining
jurisdiction by garnishment over an action against a foreign railroad corporation for damage to an interstate shipment, held a final
judgment, and reviewable in this Court by certiorari, but not by
writ of error. P. 206.
2. A Delaware corporation, having a usual place of business in Missouri, brought an action in a Missouri court against a Texas corporation which operated a railroad in Texas only and had no
place of business, nor had consented to be sued, in Missouri, the
cause of action being damage, done possibly in Missouri, to freight
shipped to that State from Texas, over defendant's line, on a
through bill of lading, and the basis of jurisdiction in Missouri
5 The proceeding before the Commission, which was instituted by
the Manufacturers Association of York, sought an order requiring
the three railroads: (a) to interchange at York all traffic originating
in or destined to that city; (b) to permit common use by all the
carriers of all terminal facilities at York, including the main-line
tracks for a reasonable distance outside the terminals; and (c) to
establish reciprocal switching throughout the city.

being the garnishment of traffic balances due the defendant from
a connecting interstate carrier having a place of business there.
Held:
(a) That the Missouri attachment law, by requiring interstate car.riers to submit to garnishment in such circumstances, did not inreasonably burden interstate commerce. P. 207.
(b) The fact that the cause of action arose under an act of Congress (the Carmack Amendment), and could not be entertained
originally by a federal court in Missouri without personal service on the defendant, was not an obstacle to its enforcement in the
state court by garnishment. P. 207.
3. When Congress creates a right of action and makes no provision
concerning the remedy, the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and the plaintiff choosing a state court is entitled to whatever remedial advantage inheres in the forum. P. 208.

Since service by attachment is not permissible in the
federal courts, and the right of action is based upon a
federal statute, the attachment law of the State cannot
be resorted to. To do so would affect substantive rights
rather than matters of mere procedure. This contrary
ruling is challenged on the ground that it violates both
the due process clause and the commerce clause of the
Federal Constitution, and is contrary to the decisions of

Argument for Respondent.

It is apparent from the foregoing decisions that the
initial carrier, in an action based upon the Carmack
Amendment, cannot be sued in any federal court other
than one in which personal service can be obtained. State
legislatures cannot add to this federal right the further
right that Congress has not seen fit to grant, namely, a

right to sue in a jurisdiction in which defendant is not
doing business. See Charleston,etc., Ry. Co. v. Varnville
Co., supra, 597.
Since the full faith and credit clause does not require
one State to respect the judgment of another State based
upon service by publication, Haddock v. Haddock, 201
U. S.562, it follows that personal service must be a substantive right rather than a mere matter of procedure,
for certainly no court has ever held that full faith and
credit should not be given to the judgment of a foreign
State merely because of the practice and procedure in the
trial of the case which led to the judgment. As to such
matters of practice and procedure the judgment is conclusive, but with respect to such substantive rights as that
of personal service the judgment is not conclusive. Pennoyer v. Neff, supra, 726.

Walter H. Saunders and Mr. Lambert E. Walther were on

Attachment under state statute on a nonresident defendant without personal service will lie upon interstate
shipments when there is no interference with interstate
commerce. Davis v. Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. Ry Co., 217

A proceeding in attachment is only incidental to a
cause of action and is not the cause of action itself. It is
remedial in 'nature. Mo. Rev. Stats. 1919, § 1725; Laborde v.*Ubarrni, 214 U. S. 174.
Garnishment is incidental to a suit in attachment, and,
like attachment, may be brqught in aid of the cause of
action, but is not a cause of action proper. It is remedial,
and not a substantive right. Mo. Rev. Stats. 1919;
§ 1846; Tinsley v. Savage, 50 Mo. 141; McFaddin v.

The construction placed upon an attachment statute
by the Supreme Court of the State is binding on the
federal courts sitting in that State. Rice v. Adler-Goldman Co., supra; Peoples Saving Bank & Trust Co. v.
Batchelder-Egtas Co., 1 Fed. 130.
A foreign corporation, licensed to do business in a State,
and having an agent there, has the same right to bring
suit in such State as a domestic corporation or an individual, and has the constitutional and statutory rights,
both state and federal, of a domestic corporation, relating
to the institution of suits. Sidway v. Land Co., 187 Mo.

Argument for Respondent.

The ruling of the court below giving the shipper the
right to bring suit by attachment is not an interference
with interstate commerce. Distinguishing Charleston,
etc., Ry. Co. v. Varnville'lo., 237 U. S. 604; and New
York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, 244 U. S. 153. In the
case at bar the bringing of the attachment has nothing to
do with the interstate shipment, but is merely an incident
to a suit, being procedural and affecting the remedy.

v. Adler-Goldman Co., 71 Fed. 151; Peoples Saving Bank

Attachment is not an interference with interstate commerce. Discussing and distinguishing, Davis v. Farmers

Co. v. Kentucky, 234 U. S. 579; Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry.
Co. v. Wells, 265 U. S. 101; Davis v. Cleveland, C., C. &
St. L. Ry. Co., 217 U. S. 157.
See Interstate Commerce Act, § 22; § 20, par. 11;
Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Ol Co., 204
U. S.426, 446-7; Adams Express Co. v. Croninger 226
U. S.491, 507-8.
It is clear from the cases last cited that all the rights
and remedies not inconsistent with the provisions of the
Interstate Commerce Act remained in force and effect
after the passage of the Carmack Amendment. Attachment, being merely a statutory form of remedy, would not
be inconsistent with any provision of that act or with any
provision of the Amendment.
If the imposition of an attorney's fee is permissible
under a state statute, Missouri,K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Harris,
234 U. S. 412, certainly the remedy of attachment in the
state court would entail no additional burden and would

Court.

delivered the opinion of the

The American Fruit Growers, Inc., a Delaware corporation with a usual place of business in Missouri, brought
an action against the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico
Railway Company in an inferior court of Missouri. Jurisdiction was asserted solely by reason of the garnishment
of traffic balances due from a connecting interstate carrier having a place of business in Missouri. The Brownsville Company is a Texas corporation; operates its railroad solely in that State; has no place of business in Missouri; and has not consented to be sued there. The cause
of. action sued on consisted of three claims of a consignee
for damages to freight originating in Texas on lines of
the Brownsville Company and shipped on through bills
of lading to points in other States.
The Brownsville Company did not enter an appearance,
general or special. Instead, it instituted in the Supreme
Court of Missouri an application for a writ of prohibition-the proceeding here under review-praying that the
judge of the inferior court be enjoined from taking cognizance of the pending action because he lacked jurisdiction. The highest court of the State denied relief. 298
Mo. 474. The case is here on writ of error; and also on
certiorari, 263 U. S. 696. The suggestion was made, at the
argument, that this Court is without jurisdiction, because
the judgment below was not final. The contrary is settled.
The application for a writ of prohibition is an independent
adversary suit which was finally determined by the judgment under review. Detroit & Mackinac Ry. Co. v. Mich-

Opinion of the Court.

igan Railroad Commission, 240 U. S. 564, 570. The writ
of error must, however, be dismissed for another reason.
See Stadelman v. Miner,246 U. S. 544.
The claim that the inferior court of Missouri lacked
jurisdiction of the action for damages is rested on two
grounds. One contention is that the Missouri attachment
law, as construed and applied, is void under the rule of
Davis v. Farmers Co-operativeEquity Co., 262 U. S. 312,
and Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Wells, 265
U. S. 101. The facts of this case differ vitally from those
involved there. Here, the plaintiff consignee is a resident of Missouri-that is, has a usual place of business
within the State; the shipment out of which the cause of
action arose was of goods deliverable in Missouri; 1 and,
for aught that appears, the negligence complained of occurred within Missouri. To require that, under such circumstances, the foreign carrier shall submit to suit within
a State to whose jurisdiction it would otherwise be amenable by process of attachment does not unreasonably
burden interstate commerce.
The other contention is more strenuously urged. It is
argued that the cause of action on which the consignee
sues is the liability of the initial carrier for a loss occurring through the negligence of a connecting carrier; that
this liability arises out of a federal law, Carmack Amendment, June 29, 1906, c. 3591, § 7, pars. 11, 12, 34 Stat. 584,
595; that the conditions under which the federal right
may be enforced are the same whether the plaintiff proceeds in the state court or the federal court; that original
jurisdiction could not have been obtained by attachment
in a federal court for Missouri, because personal service
could not be made upon the Brownsville Company, Ex
I This is true only of one of the three shipments on account of

which the action was brought. But if the inferior court had jurisdiction as to any one, it was obviously proper to deny the writ of
prohibition.

266 U. S.

parte Railway Co., 103 U. S. 794; Big Vein Coal Co. v.
Read, 229 U. S. 31; and that, therefore, no court of the
State could entertain a suit to enforce the claim.
The argument is unsound. Congress created the right
of action. It might have provided that the right shall
be enforceable only in a federal court. It might have
provided that state courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction only of those cases which, by the applicable federal
law, could, under the same circumstances, have been commenced in a federal court for the particular State. But
Congress did neither of these things. It dealt solely with
the substantive law. As it made no provision concerning
the remedy, the federal and the state courts have concurrent jurisdiction. Galveston, etc., Ry. Co. v. Wallace,
223 U. S. 481, 490. The federal right is enforceable in a
state court whenever its ordinary jurisdiction as prescribed
by local laws is appropriate to the occasion and is invoked
in conformity with those laws. Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 56-7; Claflin v. Houseman, 93
U. S. 130, 136-7.
Missouri conferred jurisdiction over claims of this nature upon the court in which the consignee sued. Under
its law, this jurisdiction may be exercised, to the extent of
applying property attached to the satisfaction of a claim,
even though personal service cannot be made upon the
defendant. That remedy is one which was not available
to the consignee in the federal court for Missouri. But this
fact is not of legal significance. Compare Red Cross Line
v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U. S. 109. The origin of the
right does not affect the manner of administering the
remedy. The grant of concurrent jurisdiction implies
that, in the first instance, the plaintiff shall have the choice
of the court. As an incident, he is entitled to whatever
remedial advantage inheres in the particular forum.

through attachment proceeding, does not enlarge the substantive right.
The practice of obtaining in this way satisfaction of a
claim in personam against an absent defendant is not one
abhorrent to, or uncommon in, federal courts. In admiralty, district courts take original jurisdiction under
such circumstances. Atkins v. Disintegrating Co., 18
Wall. 272. At law, they do so on removal. When the case
is removed, it proceeds to judgment in the federal court
and the judgment is enforced there as against the attached
property with the same effect as if the cause had remained
in the state court. Clark v. Wells, 203 U. S. 164.
