Statement of the Case.

give constructive notice to appellant or the public. It
was not necessary that it should have been. The conveyance made by its authority, embodying the restriction required by the rule, was recorded, and that was enough.
The remainder of appellant's brief under this head resolves itself into a mere challenge of the competency or
relevancy of certain documentary evidence, including the
telegram just mentioned, admitted, over objection, by the
trial court. The assignment of errors contains no suggestion that the erroneous admission of evidence would be
relied upon. The rulings of the court, therefore, admitting
such evidence are not before us.
Decree affirmed.
UNITED STATES v. MOSER.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 99.

Argued October 21, 1924-Decided November 17, 1924.

1. While the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to unmixed questions of law, a fact or right distinctly adjudged cannot be disputed in a subsequent action between the same parties, even upon
another demand and though the original determination was
reached upon an erroneous view or application of the law. P. 241.
2. A determination of the status of an individual upon which his
right to recover depends is as conclusive as a decision upon any
other matter. P. 242.
3. Where a retired naval officer had obtained judgments in the Court
of Claims for installments of increased pay under an Act of March
3, 1899, providing "that any officer of the Navy . . . who
served during the civil war, shall, when retired, be retired with
the rank and three-fourths the sea pay of the next higher grade,"
and sued there again for another installment, held, that the Government was estopped from maintaining that his service during the
civil war as a cadet in the Naval Academy was not service
within the meaning of the statute, that question having been determined against it in the previous litigation. Id.
58 Ct. Clms. 164, affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. MOSER.

Argument for the United States.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Claims upholding the claim of a naval officer for pay.

Mr. Solicitor General Beck, Mr. Merrill E. Otis, Special
Assistant to the Attorney General, and Mr. John G.
Ewing, for the United States, submitted.
The application of the principle of res judicata is erroneous. Board of Commissioners v. Sutliff, 97 Fed. 270.
While parties and subject matter in this case are identical with those in the three former cases, the causes of
action are not identical, but distinct. Dennison v.
United States, 168 U. S. 241; Cromwell v. County of Sac,
94 U. S. 351.
The court below practically assumed the position that
there was a legal presumption that every issue in law had
been tried in the first Moser Case and, therefore, that the
Act of June 29, 1906, had been considered. Yet, at the
same time, the court twice declared that the statute never
was considered by it. The contradiction is evident. See
Bigelow on Estoppel, p. 112.
In a suit between the same parties upon another,
though similar, cause of action, the parties are not precluded from contesting the constitutionality or existence
and force of a statute which was not brought to the attention of the court in the former suit. Boyd v. Alabama,
94 U. S. 645; South Ottawa v. Perkins, 94 U. S. 260; Philadeiphiav. Railway Co., 142 Pa. St. 484; Dobbins v. First
Natl. Bank, 112 Ill. 554; Wentworth v. Racine County,
99 Wis. 26; Nesbit v. Riverside District, 144 U. S. 610;
Bernard v. Hoboken, 27 N. J. L. 412.
The court below erred in holding that service as a cadet
during the Civil War, prior to April 9, 1865, entitled Moser
to be retired with the rank and pay of a rear admiral, for
the reason that Moser "had received at the date of his
retirement an advance of grade," and therefore the provisions of the Act of June 29, 1906, did not then and do
not now apply to him.

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Argument for Appellee.

266 U. S.

Mr. George A. King, with whom Mr. William B. King
and Mr. GeorgeR. Shields were on the brief, for appellee.
The adjudication that Moser was entitled to the pay of
a rear admiral from September 29, 1904, until December
31, 1906, was conclusive in favor of his right to that rate
of pay not only during that period but for the rest of his
life. Act of August 4, 1882, 22 Stat. 286; United States
v. O'Grady, 22 Wall. 641; Bissell v. Spring Valley Township, 124 U. S. 225; Southern Pac. B. R. Co. v. United
States, 168 U. S. 1; Hubbell v. United States, 171 U. S.
203; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., 200
U. S. 273.
But it is said that the court in its original judgment
sustaining the claim for salary for the period September
29, 1904, to December 31, 1906, was ignorant of the existence of the Act of June 29, 1906. "A judgment is a
solemn record. Parties have a right to rely upon it. It
should not lightly be disturbed and never ought to be
overthrown or limited by the oral testimony of a. judge
or juror of what he had in mind at the time of the decision." Fayerweatherv. Ritch, 195 U. S. 276.
Whatever may be true as to the state of mind of the
judges as to knowledge or ignorance of the Act of 1906
when their original judgment was rendered, no such ignorance can be imputed to them when rendering the judgment in the second case, for the Act of 1906 is referred to
in that decision. A second decision and abandonment by
the Government of its appeal therefrom is conclusive
against any argument based upon supposed ignorance of
statute law on the part of the judges in deciding the first
Moser Case. The same is true of the third case from which
there was no appeal.
If, however, this Court concludes to go behind the repeated judgments of the Court of Claims, the judgment is
correct on the merits.

UNITED STATES v. MOSER.
236

Opinion of the Court.

As Moser's retirement took place on the fortieth anniversary of his entrance into the Naval Academy, the forty
years necessary for retirement, (Rev. Stats. § 1443,) had
to include the Academy service. It is in accordance with
the statute in existence at the time of Moser's entrance
into the Academy and with the construction which this
Court has placed upon that very statute. See Act of
July 16, 1862, §§ 1, 11, 15, c. 183, 12 Stat. 583; United
States v. Baker, 125 U. S. 646; United States v. Cook,
128 U. S. 254.
Moser was included within the description "who served
during the civil war." Act March 3, 1899, § 11, 30 Stat.
1007. The provision of § 11 of that act was self-executing
and required no action by any board or officer to give
Moser a higher rank on the retired list. Wood v. United
States, 107 U. S. 414. See Fitzpatrick v. Greene, 181
N. Y. 308.
Moser's right to the higher rank on his retirement September 29, 1904, was not taken away by the Act of 1906.
A statute should never be construed as retroactive
when its terms can be satisfied by giving it a prospective construction. Twenty Per Cent. Cases, 20 Wall.
179; Fisk v. Jefferson Police Jury, 116 U. S. 131; White
v. United States, 191 U. S. 545.
The Act of March 3, 1909, 35 Stat. 753, sets at rest all
question as to the intent of Congress.

MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a suit against the United States to recover the
amount of the difference between the pay of a Captain
and a Rear Admiral in the Navy, based upon § 11 of the
Navy Personnel Act of March 3, 1899, c. 413, 30 Stat.
1004, 1007, as follows: "That any officer of the Navy,
with a creditable record, who served during the civil war,

240

266 U.S.

shall, when retired, be retired with the rank and threefourths the sea pay of the next higher grade."

Claimant, having served forty years from the date of
his entrance into the Naval Academy, was retired under

§ 1443 Rev. Stats., which reads:

"When any officer of

the Navy has been forty years in the service of the United
States he may be retired from active service by the Presi-

dent upon his own application."
The right of the officer turns upon the question whether

his service at the Naval Academy constitutes "service
during the civil war," within the meaning of the provision
first above quoted. Three previous suits for installments
of salary-the right of recovery in each depending upon
this same basic question-were decided by the Court of
Claims in his favor. In each, the contention of the Government was the same as it is here, viz: that service as a
cadet during the civil war was not service within the
meaning of the statute. Between the first and second
of these suits, in another suit brought by a different claimant, the court construed the statute otherwise and denied
that claimant a right of recovery, Jasperv. United States,
43 Ct. Clms. 368; the change of opinion being made to rest
upon a later act, then for the first time called to the
court's attention, which, in terms, excluded the period
of service as a cadet, but with a proviso that it should
not apply to an officer who had received an advance of
grade at or since the date of his retirement. C. 3590, 34
Stat. 553, 554.
In the second and third Moser Cases, however, the
Court of Claims declined to follow the Jasper Case, holding that, by reason of its decision in the first Moser Case,
the question was res judicata. The present suit was decided in Moser's favor upon the same ground; and, in addition, the court reverted to the position taken in the
first Moser Case, abandoning, as unsound, its view as ex-

UNITED STATES v. MOSER.
236

Opinion of the Court.

pressed in the JasperCase, upon the ground that the right
of the officer was saved by the proviso.
We find it unnecessary to consider the latter ruling,
since we are of opinion that the court was clearly right in
its application of the doctrine of res judicata.
The general principles are well settled, and need not be
discussed. The scope of their application depends upon
whether the question arises in a subsequent action between the same parties upon the same claim or demand or
upon a different claim or demand. In the former case a
judgment upon the merits constitutes an absolute bar to
the subsequent action. In the latter case the inquiry is
whether the point or question presented for determination
in the subsequent action is the same as that litigated and
determined in the original action. Cromwell v. County
of Sap, 94 U. S. 351, 352-353. The rule is succinctly stated
in Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, 168 U. S.
1, 48:
"The general principle announced in numerous cases
is that a right, question or fact distinctly put in issue and
directly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,
as a ground of recovery, cannot be disputed in a subsequent suit between the same parties or their privies; and
even if the second suit is for a different cause of action,
the right, question or fact once so determined must, as
between the same parties or their privies, be taken as conclusively established, so long as the judgment in the first
suit remains unmodified."
And in .New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, 167 U. S. 371,
396, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice White, said:
"The estoppel resulting from the thing adjudged does
not depend upon whether there is the same demand in
both cases, but exists, even although there be different
demands, when the question upon which the recovery of
the second demand depends has under identical circumstances and conditions been previously concluded by a

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Opinion of the Court.

266 U. S.

judgment between the palties or their privies." And see
Myers v. InternationalTrust Co., 263 U. S. 64.
The suits here are upon different demands; and the
point at issue is to be determined by applying the second
branch of the rule. The question expressly and definitely
presented in this suit is the same as that definitely and
actually litigated and adjudged in favor of the claimant in
the three preceding suits, viz: whether he occupied the
status of an officer who had served during the civil war.
The contention of the Government seems to be that the
doctrine of res judicata does not apply to questions of
law; and, in a sense, that is true. It does not apply to
unmixed questions of law. Where, for example, a court
in deciding a case has enunciated a rule of law, the parties
in a subsequent action upon a different demand are not
estopped from insisting that the law is otherwise, merely
because the parties are the same in both cases. But a
fact, question or right distinctly adjudged in the original
action cannot be disputed in a subsequent action, even
though the determination was reached upon an erroneous
view or by an erroneous application of the law. That
would be to affirm the principle in respect of the thing
adjudged but, at the same time, deny it all efficacy by
sustaining a challenge to the grounds upon which the judgment was based. See Gunterv. Atlantic Coast Line R. R.
Co., 200 U. S. 273, 291; United States v. California&
Oregon Land Co., 192 U. S. 355, 358; Scotland County v.
Hill, 112 U. S. 183, 187; Southern Minnesota Ry. Ext.
Co. v. St. Paul & S. C. R. Co., 55 Fed. 690, 695-696;
Pittsford v. Chittenden, 58 Vt. 49, 57; Bigelow on Estoppel, 6th ed., p. 112. A determination in respect of the
status of an individual upon which his right to recover
depends is as conclusive as a decision upon any other
matter. Clemens v. Clemens, 37 N. Y. 59, 72; Pittsford
v. Chittenden, supra.
Affirmed.
