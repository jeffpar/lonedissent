â€¢.evidence does not sustain the charges of unlawful restraint of interstate commerce in shoe machinery, and monoply thereof, in the
formation and conduct of the -United Shoe Machinery Company...
In determining whether a combination restrains interstate commerce
-injuriously t' the public, the foremost inquiry is whether the interesta brought together-wre competitive.
Where machines were 11atented .and,' though used collecti~ely'in the
making of a single'product, were so far distinct in their functions.
that.they were practically noncompetitive, a common control over
theirmanufaciure and use', held not obnoxious to the Anti-Trust Act."

Lapse of time, changes of 'condition due to it and to the progress of the

that would follow the attempt tb grant the relief prayed, are matters
to be considered in determining from conflicting evidence whether
a combinatiQn should be dissolved.

Statement of the Case.

or improvement of his own inventions and business, and for the
prevention of patent litigation, and such purchases should not be
adjudged to. have stifled competition unduly upon speculative estimates of the potential competitive power of new and untried inventions.
Upon similar considerations, certain contracts for assignment of future
inventions are also held legitimate.
The charge that the Shoe Machinery Company's power has been oppressively used is not sustained.
The patent law gives the patentee the right to exclude others from the
use of his invention, absolutely or upon terms. The exertion of this
right within the field of the patent law is not an offense against the
Anti-Trust Act.
The principle, anmounced in recent cases, that when a patented article
is sold it passes beyond the patent monopoly, has no application
where there is no conveyance of title buta bonafide lease of the article.
In a suit to set aside leases of patented machines upon the ground that
they exceed the right. of the lessor as patent owner and operate
to produce results obnoxious to the Anti-Trust Act, semble, that the lessees may be necessary paties.
Defendant supplied -its sets *of patented machines to shoe manufacturers on a royalty basis under a system of leases, of a uniforin term
of 17 years, with conditions for use of each machine to full capacity;
for leasing others of lessor as more work became available; for use
to exclusion of, and forbidding use on work coming from, machines
not so leased; requiring lessee to obtain certain supplies from.lesor
only; permitting lessor, for breach of condition in any lease, to
forfeit it and all others, and requiring lessee thereupon to return
machines and pay a charge. Held: (1) Upon the evidence, that the
leases were entered into by the lessees voluntarily and without coercion, and that their legality must be determined apart from a general charge of illegal dominancy by the corporation which the evidence failed to sustain. (2) Upon the evidence, that the purpose of
the system was to make the sets of machinery available to customers
on easy terms and promote their efficient and productive operation, in
'connection with an accessory service furnished by the company, and
insure adequate royalty returns. (3) That the conditions werewithin
the lessor's patent rights, and not violative of the Anti-Trust Act.

conspiracy whereby, through control over the manufacturers of boots and shoes, competition has been prevented,

and, conspirators, and auxiliary machines and accessories
controlled and made subsidiary.
The. charges are met, with denials, with justification
that the conduct which is asserted to be illegal was in promotion of trade, in natural development of business and
in strict compliance with modern trade progress; indeed,
that there was simply the fusion of independent and noncompeting businesses, each differing from the other, and
'the combination of various elementslbf machinery covered
by United States patents and all of it eating to the same*
art and the same school of manufactures. And that the
leases and agreements* were but the exercise of patent
rights, wholly legal and indeed necessary.
These contentions are displayed in a bill which occupies
'46 pages of the record and an answer of equal volume.
. The statute' of limita.tions is also pleaded in defense,
the .greater part of the acts charged being alleged to have
taken place more than 6 years before the filing of the petition.

Attorney General ,were on the briefs, for the United
States.1
Mr. Charles F. Choate, Jr., and Mr. Frederick P. Fish,
with whom Mr. Malcolm Donald was on the briefs, for

Mr. Frank Y. Gladney, by leave of court, filed a brief
on behalf of General Shoe Machinery Co., successor to
Boylston Manufacturing Co., as amicus curia.
MR. JusT cE MccKENNA, after stating the case as above,
delivered the opinion of the court.
The charge of the bill is that defendants, not being satisfied with the monopoly of their patents and determined
to extend it, conceived the idea of acquiring the ownership
or control of all concerns engaged in the manufacture of
all kinds of bhoe machinery. This purpose was achieved,
it is charged, and a monopoly acquired, and commerce,
interstate and foreign, restrained by the union of competing companies and the acquisition of others. And that
leases were exacted which completed and hssured the control and monopoly thus acquired. .
But this charge of comprehensive trade dominance was
modified in the course of the trial. The Government disclaimed the assertion of such extensive culpability and
confined its contention to machinery adapted to the bottoming of shoes (attaching soles to uppers), machines
called clicking machines (cutting:-out machines), and eyeletting ifiachines (sufficiently indicated, by name), and
'Mr. H. La Rue Brown and Mr. Constantine J. Smyth, Special As-.
sistants to the Attorney General, argued the case for the United States

and are too extensive for proper representation here.

declared that -if the bill did noi so limit the actual monopoly counsel would agree so to limit it.
Of course, we agree with the Government that defendants cannot be discharged from all guilt merely because
they leave open soine branches of the business to the enterprise of others, or, as the Government puts it, "that a
limited field 's as yet open to competition." But in view
of the large design attributed to the defendants and the
illustration of what it is contended they accomplished, it
would be interesting if not instructive to be told when
their large scheme was abandoned or broke down, even.
though it may now be said to be an unimportant detail,
since the trial court has decided that neither the greater
4&nr lesser scheme was established by the evidence.
The conclusion, however,.is contested, and in.description
of what is-now contended, the Government says that "the
end which avowedly was sought by the organizers of the
United Company'was 'the control in one corporation, both
in the United States and in foreign countries, of the efficient types of shoe machinery."' -. And, further, after
stating the busii ess of defendants to be that "of supply-.
ing machines used in the manufacture of shoes," and the
restraint of interstate and foreign commerce in certain of
*the machines, it is said: "The subject matter of-the action,
therefore, is the effect of the things done by the defendants
upon the trade between manufacturers of machines- used
in the manufacture of shoes and the manufacturers of
shoes." And in further display of the interest which attaches to the issues, it is said: "Shoes. are made in every
section..of the Union" and "it is obvious that supplying
important machines for such an industry must be an exceedingly, important part of .the interstate trade and commerce of the United States."
And there are contentions as to the dominance achieved.
Indeed, -it is asserted somewhat fervidly that the United.
Company 'is absolute monarch, of the industry" and

UNITED STATES v., UNITED SHOE MACH. CO.. 37

Opinion of the Couit.

that "no competitor can exist unless for its own pleasure
or policy it withholds its destroying hand."
There are opposing conten~tions no less fervidly urged.
There is denial ofthe purpose attributed to the defendants or the possession or exercise of baleful power, and
the insistence that the United Company is a union of noncompeting businesses conducted under letters patent, effecting through the resources thus acquired greater economies
in manufacture and greater efficiency of machinery and
"in other ways perfec".ing the shoe-maker's art"-advantages not engrossed by the company but inuring to
its patrons and through them to the wearers of their product, a finished she.
In'final answer to the charge of the Govermhent the
comprehensive declaration is that the shoe machinery
industry is not one open to everybody on-equal terms.
It is one of patents. And the company's power, if it have
power, is not that of combination but the power of the
superiority of its inventions-the effect and demonstrated
supremacy of its mechanical instrumentalities.
The contentions could not well be more antagonistic,
upon each of which there was conflicting testimony, and
the important fact is to be borne in mind that it was given
in open court.(except as to certain contentions about patents, their scope and validity).' The fact justifies deferDuring the trial a discussion came up. about patents. The preiding Judge intimated that the court did ziot desire to take up the
patents themselves but would send them to an examiner. It was
stated by counsel in the case -that the matter was important. But
the court made a distinction between a "patent question" and a
-"patent controversy"-good faith being an element of the latter-and
stated that the latter would not be included in the hearing before the
examiner, but would be heard *n open court. The court then ordered
the taking of testimony of both parties before-the examiner as to thatsection of the bill which charged an unlawful extension of the patents
to perpetutate their monopoly at the expense of boot and shoe manufaeturers and to use them to acquire a complete monopoly of all kinds

ence to the findings of the trial court. Adamson v. Gilliand, 242 U. S. 350, .353.

There are two accusations against the defendants. One*
is that at the very outset they combined competing companies and subsequently acquired others, Â§ 1 of the Act
of 1890 1being thereby offended. The other is a monopolization of the trade in violation of Â§ 2 of that act. And
.it-ischarged, as we have said, that certain leases and license agreements .are the instruments which consummate
both offenses.
The offense of combination was committed, it is contended, February 7, 189.9, at which time seven shoe maphinery companies were consolidated into the United
Shoe Machinery Company of New Jersey, a corporation
organized, for that purpose. The companies were: Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company, International Goodyear
-Shoe Machinery Company, Consolidated & McKay Lasting Machine Company, McKay Shoe Machinery Company,
Davey Pegging Machine Company, Eppler Welt Machine
of shoe machinery. The examination took place and it was the uiual
battle of experts, and the conflicts are recorded in a volume of more
than eight hundred pages. Their ultimate test, however, and the effect of thh patents is the testimony delivered in open court.

There is apparent confusion in the brief of the Government. In one'
place it is stated that the United Company was the consolidation of the'
businesses and properties of seven companies which were taken over as
going concerns, to-wit: Goodyear Shoe*Machinery Company, International Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company, Consolidated & McKay
Lasting Machine Company, McKay Shoe Machinery OQdmpany,
Davey Pegging Machine Company, Eppler Welt Machine Company,
and International Eppler Welt Machine Company. ,
In another place the organization of the United Company is stated
to' be the merger of four companies--Goodyear Company, Consolidated & McKay Company, Eppler Company and the McKay Shoe
Machinery Company-and resulted in the immediate suppression of
competition between those companies and dominating "to the point
of practical exclusion the important- field of supplying the principal
and essential machines necessary in the manufacture of shoes."
*However, in the conclusion of the Government's brief it contends
that it has established "that there 'existed vigorous competition between three of the companies merged'in the organization of the United
Company, and that the fourth company, which at any moment might
have become a competitor, was taken in for the purpose and with the
effect of furthering the unlawful scheme of the combination thus
brought into being." The fourth company referred to'is no doubt
the McKay Shoe Machinery Company.
The immediate results were, it is contended"(1) The suppression of the actuhl and of the potential competition
in lasting machines theretofore existing, between the Consolidated &
McKay Company'and the Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company. It
created a monopoly in lasting machines.

particular distinction we do not deem it necessay to
make.
The first question is, Were the co mpames in competition?
It confronts us at the outset; all other considerations are
dependent upon it. As an element in the answer to it
we must revert to the admission that the charge of conibination is only as to machinery for bottoming shoesthat is, the uniting of the sole to the upper-an operation
which might be called "simple" if the complexity of this
record did not contradict it and if we were not told that the
letters patent covering the machinery for the operation
are too great in number for explanation or enumeration.
'It is said that on certain classes of shoes over 100 different operations are performed by different machines. And
the Government has taken pains to tell us how far "the
mysteries of the shoemaker's art and the variations between different methods of making shoes" are outside
of the understanding of the purchaser of them. To him,
it is said, "shoes are shoes, except as they differ in appearance, comfort, wearing qualities and price." But to the
manufacturer distinctions multiply and to the production
of a shoe a complete line of machinery is necessary. Indeed, the Government makes the mystery of the art and
the necessity of the instrumentalities, in part, the basis
of its argument.
"(3) The absolute prevention of future competition between the
McKay Shoe Machinery Company, the Goodyear Sho Machinery
Company, the Eppler Welt Machine Company, and the"Consolidated
& McKay Comp,
"(4) The creation ot an absolute and complete monopoly in lasting,
pegging, welting, outsole stitching, heeling and metallic fastening
machines.
"(5) The creation' of an organization with vast resources whose control of many different types of machines necessary to the shoe manufacturing industry gave it a power to extend and intrench its monopoly which none of its constituent companies, however successful, could
approadh."

Opinion of the Coujt..

We are therefore admonished at once of the complexity
of the case and the maze of mechanical technicalities into
which we should be plunged in estimating the evidence
if we had not the guidance of the opinions of the judges
of the trial court. The court found, as we have said, that
the companies were not in competition at the time of their
union in the United Company, and based the finding not
only upon the testimony of witnesses but the uses of the
machines of the respective companies and their methods
of operation. The testimony was conflicting, it is true,
and different judgments might be formed upon it, but
from an examination of the record we~cannotpronounce
that of the trial court to be wrong. Indeed, it seems to
us to be supported bythe better reason. We should risk
misunderstanding and error if we should attempt to pick
out that which makes against it and disregard that which
makes for it and judge of witnesses from their reported
words as against. their living presence, the advantage
which the trial court had.
The Government, however, urges two circumstances
which it contends corroborate its oral testimony and
against which it asserts that "literal denials of specific
intent t6 restrain trade are of no significance." But there
was more than literal denials. There were detailed representation of the condition of the trade and explanation
of the machines convincing, as we have seen, in its strength
and the confirmation it received. Let us, however, consider the instances upon which the Government relies.
The most important of them is a circular letter,' sent by
"Plaintiff's Exhibit 152.
"To the ,Stocllwlders of Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company:

which set forth that great advantages were to be secured
by the control in one corporation of the most efficient
*types of shoe machinery and that the directors and large
stockholders had been in negotiation to accomplish that
end,; and further that the United Company would from

Opinion of the-Court.

The circular and agreement could not, of themselves,
give character to the constituent companies. It is evident, therefore, that both of them need comment to-give'
them sinister significance, alid the innuendo of the Government is that they meant'not only that great competing
companies had been united, 'but that. other companiescompetitors,- it may be-would b acquired. It would
be a stout credulity that could accept this explanation
against the counter considerations. We cannot put out of
mind that according to the Government, in repeated assertions, the United Company in 1899, twelve years before the suit was brought, jumped into the field full-panoplied in monopolistic power and started immediately on
its career of dominance and restraint of trade. But to
preclude the denial of the assertions it is now said that,
in stock circulars -and trade agreements, the company
trumpeted its might, and illegal enterprise to two continents. Deliberate guilt-we say deliberate guilt, for it*
-is not a question of ignorance or imbecility-is usually*
not so bold. It masks its purpose to hide it from prevention and penalty. If it may be asserted that the trade
agreement was in secret, certainly the circular letter to
the stockholders committed the scheme to publicity.
We cannot, therefore, accept the explanation of the
Government. Its implications discredit it. It implies
that there was governmental supineness for a long time
or an extraordinary oversight of conspicuous, indeed
vaunted, criminality. Neither can be accepted. And we
are persuaded that the circular and agreement were not intended nor regarded to be the avowal, as contended by
the Government, of monopoly, achieved or to be achieved,
but simply the business expression and foresight of the
advantages which would result from the concentration in
one management of instrumentalities which, however different, supplement one another in the creation of a shoe.
We have given the explanation of the Government im-

'portancebecause the Government has done so. And we
have only answered in estimation of what the circular
and agreemnent are worth as avowals.of intention. Of
course, if the Government is right, they are unimportant
circumstances; the demonstration of the United Company's prpose is complete without tjiem; for the Government contends that the constituent companies were in
open competition and that their union resulted in the
"immediate suppression of the actual and potential competition" in shoe machinery and the "creation of an organization with vast resources" which "gave it a power
to extend'and intrench its monopoly which none of. its
Constituent companies, however successful, could ap-.
proach." If this were a fact it would not need the confirmation of words:
The second circumstance cited by the Government is
that before the union of the companies their machines had
a fle6ibility in use that the testimony of defendants does
not now ascribe to .them, and that this was declared in
advertisements.. We are not disposed to give much importance tc, the circumstance. It may be that there was
a certain interchangeability in the described machines,
but,. in the opinion of the trial court, there was, notwithstanding, no practical competition .between them. We
can add nothing to what determined- its judgment or to
the detailed comparison aid explanation of the machines
made in its opinions. Indeed, \ve might rest this branch
of the case on those opinions. They were considerate of all
the elements of the Government's contentions and the opposing contentions and tested the machines, their sameness nd difference and respective efficiendy, by the purposes for which they were designed by the inventors and
employed in the trade and by the explanations made of
them.'
In considering the competition of the machines and in
estimating the -defendants' acts -inuniting the companies,

UNITED STATES v. UNITED SHOE MACH. CO. 45

Opinion of the Court.

it is to be observed that the machines were all made "under
letters patent of the United States and other countries,"
were. owned by the companies, and covered. improve.
ments made by the companies from time to time and embodied in the machines, which were so far developed that
they were in 1899 principally in use by shoe manufacturers in the kinds of work to which they were respectively adapted. The patents and the businesses passed
to the new company, but necessarily were the same in its
hand as before. Ili other words, the patents did not lose
their distinction, nor the machines their difference; and
to dwell upon the percentages of manufacture is misleading. Of a like situation we said in United'States v. Winslow, 227 U. S. 202, 217, and said of it in answer to the
charge against the combination here involved, that we
could "see no greater objection to one corporation manufacturing seventy per cent. of three noncompeting groups
of patented machines collectively used for making a single
product than to three corporations making the same
proportion of one group each. Ine disintegration aimed
at by the statufe [Act of 1890] does not extend to reducing all manufacture to isolated units of the lowest degree." Or, as expressed by one of the judges in the court
below, "The combination was not unlawful so far as it
did no more than put the different groups of noncompeting patented machines into one control. . . . It was
not unlawful unless, to an extent injurious to the public
interest, it destroyed competition."
And it was held that competition was not destroyed
to the designated extent. Indeed, the court was repelled,
as it might well have been, by the consquences of so holding on account of the change of conditions, the union of
the companies not'having been questioned by the Government for twelve years and large investments having been
made not only by the company but by the public.
The lapse of tinme, indeed, may not condone the offense

247 U. S.

if offense there was. It, however, may call offense in
question and be an element in the refutation of accusations long deferred, or determine against particular reme-.
dies. It is to be remembered that a dissolution of the offending companies is prayed and that each of them be
*"separated into such parts that no one of them will constitute a nionopoly .
of the shoe machinery business," or that receivers be appointed to take possession
of them and their assees, business and affairs and wind
them up and "bring about conditions in trade and commerce among the States and Â°with foreign nations in harmony with law." If there be need for this the difficulties
-of achieveinent should, not deter; but the difficulties may

situation may -beremediless or to be redressed at a cost

.whicl is extrem6, even in its mildest demands. ve may
ask, what of the investments that have been made during
these years of extension and development of the new
* company's business? What of the machines that have
become obsolete and the new ones that have been developed? What of the patents that have expired and
the new ones that have not yet run out, and how distribute them? And what of their effect when distributed?
Will their monopoly cease, or be regarded as an instrument of illegal purpose and forfeited as a deodand? How
pick Qut from the new conditions the conditions of 1899
and restore them and the art of that time and rehabilitate
the businesses that are alleged to have ceased to exist or to
have become merged in the United Company? How from
the -complexity only thus suggested, not displayed, "bring
about conditions in trade and commerce" in shoe machinery "among the. States and with foreign nations in
harmony with law," which is the.ultimate resource of the
Government for this part of the case? How radical should

Opinion of the Court.

tirety and not in parts? And, if in entirety, will the purchaser get an immunity that the companies did not have?
A sale in entirety would seem to be absolutely necessary
to preserve the works at Beverly. And yet how can that
be done if there be a dissolution of the company and a
distribution of machines? On the other hand, the idea
is repelent that so complete an instrumentality should be
dismantled and its concentration and efficiency lost. It
has been testified that the purpose of the organization was
the consolidating of all the machines in one modern factory
and the standardizing of them. This purpose has been
attained. The -company employs there 4,000 men.
There are, however, certain instances of acquisition
which may be said to give confirmation to the charges of
the Government and justify the demand for redress, at
whatever cost or disaster to the offenders; in other words,
demonstrate the purpose of the original union of the companies, the persistence of that purpose and the extension,
of its dominion having the evil consequences depictbd by
the Government. Upon these instances it would seem unnecessary to dwell, the companies not being competitive
at the time of their union in the United Company. However, they are made so much of by the Government and
are so strongly urged that attention must be given to them;
The most important of them and the one that was given
most prominence in the testimony was that of the plant
and r achinery of the Thomas G. Plant Company, a New
Jersey corporation, a manufacturer of shoes, not of machinery, and of the shoe machinery interest of Thomas
G. Plant.
Plant was an inventor of machines of the shoe-bottoming vaniety and had taken out a number of letters patent
in the United States and foreign countries covering the
same. There was in the testimony and is in the argument of counsel dispute as to the efficiency of the machines

to which they were offered under inducements refused to
accept them. It may be admitted, as the trial court found,
that they had experimental promise, and it was testified
that a number of shoe manufacturers had concerted to.
.buy them; There, were charges of infringements of the
United Company's machines and, Plant was loath to pernt an inspection; indeed for a time refused it. And, be.sides, for their completion into a set for combined operation important machines were necessary which were not
yet developed. As they stood they were undoubtedly
inferior to the machines of the United Company, and in
the state, therefore, in which the United Company took
them they were not found capable of use. Nothing was
in them which affords'reasonable support for the Government's contention that they were "right at the threshold of extensive competition with the United Company."
But, suppose they were. It would only be conjecture to
say that they would cross it or that their strength would
be formidable if they did. It is in the testimony that they
broke down upon trial and were supplanted in the Plant
factory where Plant had installed them by the United
Company's machines. And the substitution was not- at
the dictation of the latter company. The vice president of
the Plant Company and the general manager of its factory
testified that satisfactory work could not be done' with
them on men's shoes; they broke down even in the manufacture of women's shoes to which they were adapted.
It appeared that some of the machines infringed the
United Company's and in some detais the latter infringed the Plant machines, and the complexity of rights
hence resulting, to which we- shall presently refer, had led
to and threatened litigation; to compose which, it was

tdstified, and the trial court found, was a contributory
-inducement of the United Company's purchase from
Plant.
The. Government resists the finding. Its conception
is, and to this a1 of its contentions are addressed, that
the United Company combined and was intended to combine great competing companies and to acquire other competing companies. "The United Company acquired,''
counsel say, "every company then [when the company
was organized] actively putting out or planning to put
out" machinery adapted to bottoming shoes, and that
"in the twelve years before the bringing of this action
no substantial change took place, but rather the monopoly so acquired was in some respects extended and in
many respects strengthened and intrenched." In the
light of this conception and contention the Government
sees and colors all that the United Company has done,all of the acquisitions it has made, and upon whatever motive made, including the prevention of patent troubles or
'the composition of litigation. And it directly says of the
purchase from Plant that it was made at an overvaluation
and by it Plant was tempted to the bargain and the United
Company satisfied by getting rid of a competitor.
We get no solution of the purpose of the parties by the
price the United Company paid.' We must consider
what it was paid for. It is to be remembered that we are
dealing with a transaction which took place eleven years
after the formation of that company and is to be judged
of by its own circumstances, the incentives of that time.
Plant was eager to sell and the overtures came from himindeed, he engaged two intermediaries, to one Qf whom
he paid a large commission. There was necessarily negotiation before the final meeting of minds. To estimate
the bargain to it the United Company insisted upon an

inspection of the machines, that is, to estimate their value,
as it was testified, "to. the advancing of the art of shoemaking. 'Y Plant refused at first, as we have said, but later
,yielded, and after inspection the purchase was consummated. Indeed, there were two inspections. Thd report
on the first was adverse to the purchase. Mr. Winslow,
president of the United Company, took part in the second
and we may quote his testimony, for it is the standpoint
of that company we are now considering. His testimony,
besides, had confirmation. He believed, he testified, that
he had a broader knowledge of shoe machinery than any
one else and he therefore studied the Plant machines "pers6nally as an expert." He considered them, he said, from
the standpoint of their capacity, the value of the inventions and the improvements embodied in them, the companison of their work with the work of the United Company's machines and the mechanical construction of the
latter. He further testified that "Plant had used 'the
Goodyear machines [the United Company's machines] as a
basis for his machines End had made important improve:
ments and developments." He indicated one of the improvements in particular, which he regarded as of the very
greatest practical importance, especially when combined
IMr. Winslow gave the following explanation of his purpose in the
Plant purchase as stated in conversations with Mr. Plant:
"I always declined to have anything to do not only with buying but
considering his propositions without a full and complete right to examine his machinery, determine the value of the inventions-the
patents that he had-and Mr. Plant knew that my position all the
time, at every interview was that I was not interested in what it cost.him to get them up, whether much or little. My entire and only
interest was whether those. patents could be made of benefit to our
customers and the trade. If they could be of benefit, if they were of.
large benefit, and the trade ought to have them, I should be very glad
to buy them and embody them in our machines for what I'thought
they were worth, irrespective of what they had cost him-but I would
not pay a cent more for them."

with a device that the United, Company had just developed and placed in its factories. In a "broad way," he
said, the value was almost incalculable.
But there was 0n interdependency of values. While
the Plant device.had value over that of the United Company's, it was controlled by the latter, or, as the witness
expressed the situation, "in a broad way it was a perfect
deadlock." In other words,, the United Company had
the underlying invention and Plant a patent for a particular form of operation which was necessarily subordinate to the other-a situation familar in patent law and
"contests.
It will be seen, therefore, that there was no other way
out of the deadlock, if the inventions were to be used together--that is, embodied in one machine, without infringement-than by ownership in one hand of all the
patents. That plan was adopted and was the inducement
of the purchase of the Plant inventions by the United
Company. But there was litigation to be composed as
well, *andit was composed.
Another witness testified as to the relation of the Plant
patents and those of the United Company and stated that
the result, if Plant had insisted upon his patent rights and
the company had insisted upon its patent rights, would
have been "a stop in the development of shoe machinery in these lines." -And continuing, he said: "We should
hardly have dared to go ahead with the improvements
in our machines for fear of not succeeding in our patent
litigation, or of conflicting with such improvements as
Plant had patented. On the other hand, Plant, or any
company which he might form, would have hardly dared
to go ahead with the possibility of these infringement
suits.* These infringement suits, or a good many of them,
were then pending, and certainly he 'would have found
very'few customers, I think, for his machines."
This, in outline, was th situation that confronted the

parties and induced their transaction, the incentives of
each being as indicated. And they were justifiable incentives, and we-may accept them as an alternative to
the contention made by the Government that a violation
of law was the impelling motive of the parties. And we
may say that after the United Company had made the Plant
acquisition it proceeded to make improvements on the
Plant patents and developed many of them, giving them
an efficiency they did not -have before.
. There are other acquisitions that are emphasized, among
them, that of the stock of the Goddu Sons Metal Company. It was acquired March, 1899, a month after the
United Company was formed and eleven years before this
suit was brought; and the inducement to the acquisition.
was to settle the patent troubles that came to the United
Company through one of its constituent companies. The
value obtained was in patents. These were for the metallic variety of machines, and, according to a witness for
defendants, "at that time the United Company was putting out commercial machines for doing the work for which
the Goddu Company machines were intended." And,
according to another witness, though not then in a condition to be laced i the hands of manufacturers, "'they
were, in a state of development where some of them could
have been, without extensive changes, made operative."
By this testimony th 'defendants justify the purchase;
the Government condemns it. The defendants say that
it was in composition of an inherited litigation and that
patents of value were obtained by it. To this 'the Government replies ii condemnation that the cost of the settlement of the disputes was excessive, being $150,000, imd
the purpose of getting the patents wa to forestall the competition they threatened and could have accomplished by
their development.

easily or accurately esthin t. It depends upon too many
considerations which axe not reflected in the price paid.
The other.ground of condemnation has strength. As the
Government says, quoting Circuit Judge Putnam in
another case, neither the letter of the law nor its purpose
"distinguishes between strangling of commerce which has
been born and preventing the birth.of a commerce which
does not exist.'" But there is anothei'view. No one can
tell the strength of the competition that may be in a pateit. It may be more than competition; it may be de-"
struction, and the Anti-Trust Act surely does not require
'the acceptance of that or forbid. effort to prevent it. But
even if such extreme does not impend, certainly improvement of business and its efficiency can be striven for without offense to the law. United States v. Winslow, supra.
We may say here of the contention of the Government
as to the acquisitions-and the same comment may be
made of most of its contentions-that they cast us into
speculation for their estimate and urge us to decide between well-sustained conflicting opinions and adjudge the
defendants guilty ofi a violation of law. And this, -too,
against the considered judgment of the trial court.
We. see no illegality in the contract with Gotdu for assignmnent of other inventions he might make, or in like
agreement with others. We content ourselves with this
general declaration. An analysis of the contracts is not
feasible, nor are the covenants measurable. That they
are attempts to subject-the inventive genius of the country to the designs of the defendants is too extreme. They
can be seen to have more particular use and to be justified
in the circumstances of the transaction with which they
were connected. Those whom one employs one gives
opportunity to (this was Goddu's case) and may exact
that it be used for the employer. Those who have conveyed to him special machines may be presumed to have
been compensated by their price, and that in either case

there will be such development and use as to make them
competitive is too speculative to justify a judgment.
It is to be noted that the acquisitions in this case were
not coincident in time nor parts of the same transaction.
They were scattered through a period of years and varied
each from the other, had no dependency, were different
and unrelated steps in the development of the business of
defendants. They must hence be judged separately, not
in accumulation.
The above comment is applicable to other acquisitions,
said to be fifty-six in number. It is impossible to review
them. A description of them and wherein the mchines
acquired were competitive with the machines of the United
Company the Government sets forth in many pages of
its brief, and the defendants reply as circumstantially with
opposing delineation and justification. Their effect is hard
to estimate. The removal in some degree of competition
may be charged against some of them and yet, on the other
hand, the acquisitions may be said to be justified by the
exigencies or conveniences of the situation. Some of -them
were merely of accessorial machines; some in composition
of patent troubles; some not connected with the special
charge of nonopoly to which the Government has limited
itself; some the transfer to defendants of kinds of machines
not possessed by them; some of patented improvements
and inventions, aiding or completing the defendants' machines, tributary therefore to their efficiency. They give
a false impression by their number. They added nothing
of obnoxious powei to the United Company nor in any
practical or large sense removed competitibn.
Defendants charge that the Government not only puts
an exaggerated computation upon the acquisitions by defendants but gives no credit for or account to their resistance of applications to buy other and, it is asserted, more
important concerns. Their number is given as 75, all of
great use and importance. The trial court found that the

UNITED STATES r.- UNITED SHOE MACH. CO. 55

offers refused were more numerous and several of them
were of concerns more important to the scheme of monopoly charged against defendants than any of the specified
acquisitions.. The comment is justified by the evidence.
We pass by the charge of the Government that the
United Company through its president threatened destruction to opponents and the use of his influence in the business world to enforce transfers of competing concerns and
the patents they controlled. The charge and its denial or
explanation were estimated by the trial judges and the
charge was held not to be established, or of no serious
importance. The court said that if the declarations could
be called "threats' in view of all the surrounding circumstances shown, it was not established that any competitor
lost a customer or that anybody was prevented from attempting competition. Besides, they were isolated instances, separated in time, without relation, not co6rdinated acts in a scheme of oppression.
We cannot go into further detail without unduly extending this opinion; It would be repetition, besides, of
what was done carefully and thoroughly in the opinions of
the trial judges. We sum up with a generalization that
the United Company took by its organization "established
"businesses already of great value, possessing great possibilities of development," as said by the trial court. It was
discerned that there was advantage in their concentration,
and the expansion that has hence resulted has been as
much in necessary evolution as by design. At its foundation there were certain basic patents and many auxiliary
ones. Inventors-those connected with and those independent of it-were devising and experimenting, and of
this the company had to keep informed. It had to keep
up with the mechanical march; to fall back would have
been its destruction. There was growth not only in its
business proper but io the accessories to it. When it was
formed in 1899 it had no facilities for furnishing findings

and supplies. It was business enterprise or, it may be,
necessity, to acquire them, and their -acquisition became
what is called in the case the United Company's "general
department," which handles, it is said, between 150 and
200 different kinds of machines. The expansion to this
and in this was like the expansion of the department
store--an accumulation not only of .necessary things, but
of incidental, supplemental things, auxiliary to the completion and finish of a boot or shoe. There is a service
force as well, estimated at 6,000 men, to repair immediately breaks or deterioration without extra charge. And
these men are kept at convenient places to repair machines and replace worn-out parts, and-depots of supplies
are maintained. There are also instructors of operators
as well as furnishing of men in emergency. It is in the
testimony 'that a total of 8,889 operatives were taught
in: the year 1911 alone.
The company, indeed, has magnitude, but it is at once
the result and cause of efficiency, and the charge that it
has been oppressively used is not sustained.. Patrons are
given the benefits of the improvements made by the
company and new machines are substituted for the old
ones without disproportionate charge. There has been
saving as well in the cost of manufacture of shoes. These
are some of the results of the organization of the United
Company. Others are testified to and the means of their
accomplishment; but time will not permit their statement,

attacks them. Complaints, however, may be interested
lament; but, on the other hand, they may be the expression of real grievance and demand redress. And
which they are should be considered.' To the attacks of
the Government the defendants reply that the leases
are the exercise of their right as patentees and if there is
monopoly in them it is the monopoly of the right. It

Opinion of the Court.

must,'indeed, be said that it is the experience of the world
that the utility of an invention entices to its infringement,-but it would be a perversion of things to facilitate the
wrong by a sacrifice of the right in revulsion from the restraint which the right authorizes. But, on the other
hand, we must not over-estimate the right or give it a
sinister effect-permit it to be a means, to use the words
of -the Government, "to the building up and intrenchment" of an "illegal monopoly." We cannot consider
the contentions with the detail that counsel have. We
think that their answer is in the statement of certain
general propositions.
Of course, there is restraint in a patent. Its strength
is in the restraint, the right to exclude others from the use
of.jhe invention, absolutely or on the terms the patentee
chooses to impose. This strength is the comnpensation
which the law*grants for the exercise of invention. Its
exertion within the field covered by the patent law is not
an offense against the Anti-Trust Act. 'In other circum-.
stances it-may be, as in- Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v.
United States, 226 U. S. 20, to which case that at bar has
no resemblance.
The question, then, is, Was the patent right lawfully exerted in the leases? Were they anything more than the
exercise of the patent monopoly? The word is descriptive
and must be used, but it does not imply oppression. The
old instrumentalities exist for all who are content with
them and who care not for the better ones which inventive
genius creates.
The charge of oppression puts out of view many essential things. We must keep in mind the quality of the
right we are considering and that the inventor gets
nothing from the law that he did not have before and that
the only effect of his patent is to restrain others from dealing with or using its device. United States v. Bell Telephone Co., 167 U. S. 224, 239; Paper Bag Patent Case,

Opinion of the Court.

247 U. S.

210 U. S. 405, 424; Motion Picture Co. v. UniversalFilm
Co., 243 U. S. 502, 510. Or to put it another way, the
inventor does not get from the law a right to a use that
he did not have before but he gets the right to an exclusive use. Take this from him and you take all that the
law gives him and to. secure which the public faith is
pledged. Chief Justice Marshall in Grant v. Raymond,
6 Pet. 218, 242.
Indeed, we said in the Paper Bag Patent Case that he
may keep his invention out of use. Therefore, he necessarily has the power-of granting i. to some and withholding it from others, a right of selection of persons and
terms. There is, however,. a limitation upon him; he cannot grant the title and retain the incidents of it. Straus
v. 'Victor Talking Machine Co., .243 U. S. 490; Bauer v.
O'Donnell,_.229 U. S. 1; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal
Film Co., supra.
These cases have received review and application in
Boston Store of Chicago v. American (-raphophone Co.,
246 U. S. 8. The principle. Of them was expressed to be
that where an article has been sold it passes.beyond the
monopoly given by the patent and conditions cannot be
imposed. upon it. Leases are not of this character; they
do not convey the title. It is not contended, nor could it
be, that in this'case they are a disguise for something
else, artifices to convey the machinery and yet keep it
subject to the patent right and its exercise. It therefore
follows that conditions may be imposed by them.
It is not certain that the Government denies, this or
means to assert anything more thaii that the patent
right is exercised in oppression, assisting,' indeed consummating, a scheme of monopoly, begun by the formation of the United Company, prosecuted in the various
ways to which 'we have referred, and completed by the
leases and their clauses.
It is difficult to- represent the contentions of the Gov-

INITED STATES r. UNITED SHOE MACH. CO. 59

Opinion of the Court.

ernment without under-coloring them or over-coloring
them. There is one that the leases are invalid in and of
themselves; there is another that "ultimately, of course,
it- is upon the lease forms themselves and their apparent
and necessary effect *upon competition that the United
States relies." The first contention the Government
leaves very much to assertion, and defendants, charge
that it was not made in the trial .court; the second contention is necessary to: assign to the leases an obnoxious
quality in the hands of the United Company which they
did not have in the hands of the constituent companies.
The distinction would seem to. be not material of itself,
and the important consideration is not what the leases
were in some other relation but what they are in -their
present relation and to what purpose are they being rightfully or wrongfully, or can they be rightfully or wrongfully, used or enforced? To this inquiry we shall now
address ourselves.
The first objection made to the lease is that they are
unchangeable by the lessee--he "has no right," it is
urged, to demand either the cancellation or modification
of an existing one. The objection is not definite or
measurable. It is probably but a representation of whait
is deemed the severity of the leases, for, of course, a contract is a restraint upon option and can be enforced. This
power is its efficacy and indicates its obligatiom And
further it is of no consequence that the leases cover all -of
the machines of the United Company if they are an exercise of the patent rights. Whether they are is the broad
question in the case and its disposition will dispose of all
minor and.dependent ones.
What, then, .do the -leases accomplish? They have
clauses called "tying" clauses, so called because, it is
said, they tie the use of the machine leased to the use of
machines not covered by the particular lease. Their result is, the Government asserts, "to make it in effect a

60

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

247 U. S.

condition of the lease that the lessee shall not use the machines of competitors either to supply a need for additional
machines of the kind leased or for machines of other important though wholly different types;"
And it is-urged: "In addition to those clailses there are
certain other clauses which have a similar effect upon the
freedom of the lessee's choice of machines. They give to
the tying clauses their -maximum effect as destroyers
of the possibility of competition with the defendants."
It is charged that "the objectionable clauses are-inter-related and operate together with cumulative effect"; that
"they are unlawful both as integral and effective parts
of an imlawful whole, and, for the most part, in and of
themselves." And it is further charged that "it is,
however, -in their combined effect as a system of leasing,
used and insisted upon by a corporation dominant in its
field that the full extent 6f their illegality is to be per-'
ceived." This, however, is assertion and relies for its
foundation upon the-assumption of an illegal dominance
by the United Company that has been found not to
exist. This element, therefore, must be put to one side
and the leases regarded in and of themselves and by the
incentives that induced their execution; and to a suit
seeking their dissolution it may well be contended that the
lessees are necessary parties, certainly so far as existing
leases are concerned. But the contention of the Govern_ment goes farther and asserts that its purpose and object
justify the absence of the lessees from the case. Indeed
the Government takes merit to itself in relieving them of
a thraldom. "The rights of the lessees," it is said, "are
not touched except to preserve them.". But a lessee may
like his situation, may have deliberately chosen it and
may' bt care for any interposition, benevolent or otherwise.
Finally the Government, in possible opposition to both
.essor and lessee, asserts that "no one has the right to

Opinion-of the Court.

say that the unlawful conduct of another shall be permitted to continue because he has an interest in it."
Perhaps not. But there may be dispute as to the character of the conduct, and its illegality cannot be conceded
to mere assertion and the consequent assumption of a
destroying power.
.However, let us consider the clauses from the standpoint of the Government's contentions and determine if
they transcend the rights given to patentees. The
clauses are: '(1) One that prescribes a uniform term of
17 years. The result of this is, the Governmenit says, "that
during that long period no replacement of a machine so
leased by a better machine of defendants or others and
no change in the form of the leaseor avoidance of any
of its requirements is open to the lessee except with the
defendants' consent and upon their terms." To this it is replied that the leases of the constituent companies ran for
indefinite periods and, l5esides, new patents were constantly taken out, and to these the criticism of the Government does not apply. Aknd again, the term was as'surance to the lessee as well as lessor, and, as defendants'
'counsel -suggest, there is analogy in the term to that of a
*building lease which may under the hazard of circumstances turn out tobe or not to be advantageous Of this
there are two recent examples in this court. Filene's
Sons Co.v. Weed, 245 U. S. 597, and Gardinerv. Butler &
Co., 245 U. S. *603. Indeed, we may say.of all the clauses,
without a minute analysis and discussion of them, that
they were simply bargains, based on patent rights and
the conditions upon which those rights were granted.
(2)" The 'additional-machines " clause, which provides
that in case the lesshe has more work than can be performed by the, machine leased, he will lease additional
machinery to perform the work and that if the lessee does
not do so the lessor may cancel the lease if he so elect, and
any other lease of machinery of the same kind then'in

force between them. This clause, we shall presently see,
was discontinued in 1907 and was not in use when this
suit was brought. -(3) An "exclusive use" clause requiring the lessee of particular machinery to use it exclusively and the auxiliary machines which aid or supplement it, and for failure to do so, lessor may at his option
terminate forthwith in writing any- or all leases or licenses of the particular machines and accessoilal machines
.and they shall become revested in the lessor. This clause
-only requires an election of use between the United Company's machines and those of other makers. If the election be of the latter, the lessor may terminate the lease
and resume his machines. "(4) A prohibitive clause. This
clause provides that the particular machine leased shall
not be"used in the preparation or manufacture of shoes,
etc., upon which work is done by any machine not held
by the lessee under lease from the lessor. (5) The right to
terminate all leases clause. This clause does not need
much explanation. Its name expresses its purpose. It
gives- the lessor the right, in default of the performaice
of the conditions of the particular lease, not only to .cancel
that lease but all other leases and requires a delivery of
the leased machinery to the lessor at Beverly, Mass., complete andin good order, reasonable wear and tear alone
excepted. '(6) The full-capacity clauge. Its name expresses its purpose. It requires the. leased machinery to
be used to its full capacity upon the work to which it is applicable. This clause was in the lease. of the Consolidated
Company prior to the formation of the United Company.
Its purpose is to secure the royalty which is based on the
am6unt of use of the machine. It does not require the.use
of any particular machine or the use of other machiiie.
It nerely requires. that the particular machine that is
installed shall be used if the lessee have work for it. Without it defendants say that, as lessors, they would have
no assurance of compensation for their machine. (7) A

UNITED STATES v. UNITED SHOE MACH. CO. 63

charge upon the return of the machinery leased is required. This needs no comment or. further.notice.. (8)
The leases of metallic machinery provide for the purchase
from the lessor of certain fastening material. This clause
and the next, which. provides for the payment of royalties, are mere make-weights and not of special materiality.
The evil potency ascribed to the leases (we use the
word as inclusive of the clauses and we do not think it
necessary to distinguish them according to their application to particular machines) by the Government is their
asserted coercion of shoe makers and machinery makers.
They limit the freedom of the first, it is contended, and
by that limitation preclude the competition of the second
with the( defendants. In other words,' the use of the
machines of the United Company is compelled as against
the use of machines of other manufacturers, .resulting in
the restraint of the trade of the latter. To this charge
all other charges are subsidiary, and the restraint is said
to have been the initial conception of the company and
the purpose of its organization. The evidence disproves
this. As we have seen, the leasing of their respective
machines was the practice *of the constituent companies
before their union and they were substantially the same
after union as before-in instances better. There was a
difference as to the prohibitive clause. After the union
it 5 elated to machines of all of the companies. And the
testimony also shows that the advantage of the leases
was and is that manufacturers of not large means were
able to obtain machinery .which they were without capital to buy. They helped, indeed, the big and the little. One manufacturer, -whose output was 5,000 pairs
of shoes a day, testified that if his company had been
compelled to buy outright the machinery necessary
to equip its factory, it could not have developed as
it had.

And sets of machines are necessary to the equipment
of, a factory, and their best results are obtained when'
used in proper relation. This relation, indeed-,the necessary co6rdination of the machines, was shown pictorially by a number of views in the court below, as well as
testified - to by witnesses. And there is great economic
advantage, it was testified, in the accessory service
furnished by theUnited Company for the reason that
"the regularity and continuous operation of the nachincs
-is dependent upon what 'may be termed instantaneous
service. . . . This factor of service is at the very
base of the successful operation of a shoe factory. The
work is planned to travel from one room to another in
fixed quantities.-, So many pair go in in the morning-so
many pair come out at night. The operatives are dependent upon ithat work traveling along regularly to them.
The breaking down of some of these machines will in
many of the factories block the entire flow of the work."
This was the t estimony of the president of the United
Company, and it received corroboration from -a witness
for the United States, who said: "The margin of profit in
making shoes is such that it is very essential that our
machinery should work smoothly and regularly and with
continuity, and economies in the manufacture of shoes
often malke the difference between a successful manufacturer and one who is not successful. One of the most
important economies is to have our machinqmy work with
continuity and with the"highest. efficiency and turn out
our. product with the utmost regularity day after day,
just as we want to get it o that there won't be any hitch
anywhere in the flow of our product through our factory."
The witness gave praise to the excellence of the machines
of -the United Company. This excellence and the described service the leases secured to the lessees and secured
at the same time rights to-the lessors. And the leases are
strictly a reservation of the use of the machines, a right

recognized in Bauer v. O'Donnell; Straus v. Victor Talkitg
Machine Co., and Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film
Co., supra. We must assume they were entered into by
the lessees upon a calculation of their value-the efficiency
of the machines balanced against the restrictions upon and
conditions of their use. The lessees had the alternative
of the choice of other machines for other machines were
sold side by side with those the leases covered. This, we
think, is put out of view.
Let "usguard against confusion and not confound things
which must be kept in distinction. A patentee is given
,rights to.his device, but he is given no power to force it on
the world. If the world buy it or use it the world will do
so upon a-voluntary judgment of its utility, demonstrated,
it may be, at great cost to the patentee. If its price be
too high, whether in dollars or conditions, the world will
refuse it; if it be worth the price, whether of dollars or
conditions, the world will. eek it. To say.that the world
is not recompensed for the price it pays is to attack the
policy of the law, is to defy experience and to declare that
the objects 1f inventive genius all around us have contributed nothing to the advancement of mankind. This
comment is applicable here. We cannot accept, therefore,
the contention of the Government. We see nothing else
in the circumstances of the parties than that which moves
and may move the transactions of men.
We ma:' say further, in answer to the criticism of the
leases, that relaxations of them: were granted by "riders"
and that forms other than the restrictive were open to
the shoe manufacturers, distinguished in the testimony
by the term "independent."
They do not contain the
prohibitive clause but do contain the other clauses and
require an initial payment. Comparison is made of the
independent form and the other forms by witnesses and
various judgments are expressed. The Government sees
nothing in any of them but the restraints upon the freedom

of business, and regards the independent form as only
slightly relaxing what counsel implies is the slavery of
the others. The defendants contend that they are the
simple exercise of a property right, the mutuality of
agreement based on definite and valuable considerations.
And it was testified that the machines in the United Company's general department have always been open to sale
or lease. It is further said that the additional-machine
clauses were removed from all leases of the company as
early as 1907 and they were not in use and did not represent its policy at the time of bringing this suit. But
leases with that clause are outstanding, the Government
replies.
However, we need not dwell further upon the leases.
It approaches declamation to say that the lessees were
coerced to their making. And, as we have said, there was
benefit to the lessee. It is easy to say that the leases are
against the policy of the law. But when one tries to be
definite one comes back to the rights and obligations of
the parties. There is no question in the case of the use of
circumstances to compel or restrain; the leases are simply
bargains, not different from others, moved upon calculated
considerations, and, whether provident or improvident,
are entitled nevertheless to the sanctions of the law. We
have said this, indeed, with iteration, but sometimes
propositions which have become postulates have to be
justified to meet objections, which, if they do not deny
their existence, tend to :bring them into question.
Besides, it is impossible to believe, and the court below
refused to find, that the great business of the United Shoe
Machinery -Company has been built up by the coercion
of its customers and that its machinery has been installed
in most of the large factories of the country by the exercise of power, even that of patents. The installations
could have had no other incentive than the excellence of
the machines and the advantage of their use, the con-

[post, 75] as to the character of the combination here
involved.
There are provisions in the 'so-called leases attacked
in this case which in my view are so clearly .within the
condemnation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, that the
further enforcement of them and the making of new
leases of like character, should ,be enjoined. The farreaching character of a decision sustaining a leasing
system such as the defendant has developed and uses
justifies a statement of the reasons which impel me to this
conclusion.
As to the suggestion that the lessees are not parties to
this proceeding, and, therefore, no decree can be had as to
them, it seems to me this is not a case of want of indispensable or even necessary parties because of their
interest such as should prevent the court from proceeding
to a decree to enjoin the United Shoe Machinery Qompany from the further enforcement of these features of the
leases and the making of similar contracts hereafter. If
these leases are in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act the makers of them may be proceeded against, and
a decree rendered which shall effectually preclude them
from further contracts of this sort, without the presence
of the lessees, if it could be assumed that any of them should
desire to be heard in advo6acy of the retention of these
,prohibitive and restrictive features.
The object of this proceeding is to enjoin in.equity fur-

ther violation of a criminal statute, not to determine title
or property rights of the defendant. It is sufficient as to
the doctrine of indispensable parties to refer to Shields v.
Barrow, 17 How. 130, and the cases collected in the
discussion of the subject in Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana
Bank Co., 215 U. S. 33, 48. There is no reason in this case
why the court may not so shape its relief as to reserve the
rights of persons not before it, if that should be necessary.
The questions involved in the aspect of the case now
under consideration are two-fold. First: Are certain
provisions of these lease agreements of themselves considered within the terms of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act?
Second: Are such agreements to be held immune from
the requirements of the act because of the fact that much,
perhaps all, of the machinery of the United Shoe Machinery
Company is made and leased under letters patent -issued
by the United States? Of these questions in their order.
1. It clearly appears from the record that the United
Shoe Machinery Company dominates the trade in certain
kinds of shoe machinery furnished to manufacturers all
over the country; which machinery is essential to the
successful prosecution of the business of manufacturing
shoes. It has many customers to whom it supplies these
machines under leases, and such customers are required
to accept the terms of these instruments or go without
the machines. The leases are made for a uniform term of
seventeen years, and not now considering the conditions
of payment for the use of the machines and other terms
usual 4ud legal in their nature, they contain certain other
features which may be summarized in the requirements:
(1) The lessee shall not use the machinery, or any part
thereof, in the manufacture or preparation of welted
boots, shoes or other footwear.which has not had certain
operations performed upon it by other machines leased
from the lessor. This is called the prohibitive clause. (2)

:32.

DAT, J., dissenting.

If at any time the lessee shall fail or cease to use exclusiVely lasting machinery held by him under lease from

the lessor, or fail or cease to use exclusively tacking mechanisms and appliances held by him under lease from the
lessor, etc., the lessor may at its option terminate any or
all leases or licenses of lasting machines, etc., then existing between the lessor and the lessee, and the right of
possession shall thereupon vest in the lessor. This is
called the exclusive use clause. (3) In case the lessee
has work of the kind which can be performed by the
machines belonging to the metallic department of the
lessor in excess of the capacity of the metallic machinery
which he has under lease from the lessor, then the lessee
shall either take from the lessor sufficient additional
machinery to perform the work, or failing so to do the
lessor may cancel the lease forthwith, or any other lease
of metallic machinery then in force between the parties.
This is called the additional machines clause. (4) The
lessee shall obtain from the lessor exch'lsively, at such
prices as it may establish, all the fastening material needed
in operating the leased machines. (6) The lessee shall,
at the election of the lessor, suffer a termination of .11
leases which he may have, and the removal of all nachines
leasedi by him from the defendant, in the event of any
violation of any term of any one of the leases.
From familiar decisions of this court it may be said to
be now well settled that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act condemns all combinations and contracts the effect of which
is to unduly-restrain the free and natural flow of interstate
commerce, or which monopolize or tend to monopolize
such trade or commerce in whole or in part. While the
act does not reach normal contracts sanctioned by law
and sustained by usage, it does reach any and all means
and devices by which the purposes of the act to protect the
freedom of interstate commerce may lie thwarted and
monopolies prQmoted and created. United States v. Ameri-

Eastern States Reail Lumber Dealers' Assn. v. United
States, 234 U. S. 600. That these lease restrictions tend
to prevent the free flow of interstate commerce, and the
natural course of its activities, and at least tend to monopolize an important trade in interstate commerce seems
apparent from a mere statement of their terms, having in
mind their natural and necessary effect.
For the seventeen years term for which all the leases
are drawn, the lessees upon failure to use exclusively the
defendant's machines for lasting shoes, or upon failure to
purchase needed additional machines from the lessor,
or to buy certain supplies-from the lessor at prices to be
fixed by it, are subject to the right of the lessor to terminate
all .the leases held by the offending lessee and to take
possession of the machines to the utter destruction of the
lessee's business. The necessary effect of these prohibitive
provisions, in view of the dominating control of-the business by the lessor, is to prevent the lessee from using
other similar machines, however advantageous to him it
may be to do so, unless he is willing to incur the peril of
losing machinery essential to his business. It likewise so
curtails the field of free customers as to keep others from
.manufacturing such machinery." Whenever a new ma'The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, when
considering the Clayton Bill (38 Stat. 730), said of such provisions:
"Where the concern making these contracts is already great and
powerful, such as the United Shoe Machinery Company, . . . the
exclusive or 'tying' contract made with local dealers becomes one of
the greatest agencies and instrumentalities of monopoly ever devised
by the brain of man. It completely shuts out competitors not only
from trade in which they are already engaged but from the opportunities to build up trade in any' community where these great and
powerful conditiofis are appearing under this system and practice. By

chine is acquired by the lessee for the period of seventeen
years (the full life of a patent under the statutes of the
United States) the chain is forged anew which binds him
to the use of the lessor's machines, to the practical dxclusion of all others.
Nor is the situation changed by the fact that so-called
independent leases are offered to manufacturers. These
leases require the payment of considerable additional
charges and embrace terms which lead the shoe manufacturers to choose the prohibitive and restrictive forms
of leases rather than to accept others. Moreover, the
questions in this case are to be tried upon the effect of the
leases actually made, and for years to remain in force.
When it is considered that these results may be obtained

in the conduct of a great business industry by this system
of "tying" contracts, the necessary effect to restrain the
freedom of commerce, and the attempt to effect monopolization, seem to me to be established.
2. The stress of the argument on behalf of the company
is rested upon the fact that it is the owner of letters patent
issued by the United States, and that within the monopoly created by such patents it has the right to make

and enforce such contracts as are herein involved. At an
. monopoly that owns and controls the entire machinery now being
used by all great manufacturing houses of the United States. No independent manufacturer'of shoe machines has the slightest opportunity
to build up any considerable trade in this country while this condition
obtains. If the manufacturer who is using machines of the Shoe
Machinery Company were to purchase and place a machine manufactured by an independent company in his establishment, the Shoe
Machinery Company could, under its contracts, withdraw all their
machinery from the establishment and thereby wreck the business of
the manufacturer." (Report of Committee, p. 13.)

early day this court, speaking by its Chief Justice, declared: "The franchise which the patent grants, consists
altogether in. the right to exclude every one from making,"
using, or vending the thing patented, without the permission of the patentee. This is all that he obtains by the
patent." Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539. The extent and nature of rights secured by letters patent have
been the subject of recent consideration in this court, and
the definition, just quoted, has been approved and applied. Bauer v. O'Donnell, 229 U. S. 1; Straus v. Victor'
Talking Machine Co., 243 U. S. 490; Motion Picture Co. v.
Universal Film Co., 243 U. S. 502; Boston Store of Chicago
v. American Grapnophone Co., 246 U. S. 8.
When this case was tried in the District Court Henry
v. Dick, 224 U. S. 1, was the law of this court. In that
-case a mimeograph, made under letters patent, was sold
for less than its full value, with a- license agreement
limiting its use to certain unpatented articles belonging
to the patentee. Such use was held to be within the exclusive right secured by the lessor's patent. In Moion
Picture Co. v. Uiiversal Film Co., supra, it was sought to
extend the doctrine of that case so as to protect a license
agreement evidenced by notice attached to the machine
so as to limit the purchaser to the use of certain films, and
tb restrict the purchaser to other terms to be fixed by the
owner of the patent at his discretion. But such extended
scope of patent rights was denied and it was again held
that the patentee received from the law. no more than the
exclusive right to make, use, and sell his invention.
It is said, however, that the series of cases beginin' with
Bauer v. O'Donnell, supra, and ending with Boston Store
of Chicago v. American (-raphophone Co., supra, decided
at this term, hold no more than that a patentee may not
sell an article covered by his letters patent, receive his
price therefor, and then undertake to impose a restriction

be made. A reading of those cases shows that the nature.
and extent of the right to grant to others the use of an
invention was fully discussed, and its limitations defined.
In the Motion Picture Case the right of a patentee to
place restrictions upon the use of a patented machine,
and to limit its use by a purchaser, or purchaser's lessee,
to terms stated in the license agreemeit, was considered.
This court held that such limitations as were there involved
upon the use of patented machines were not within the
scope of the patent. It was upbn the expanded right touse an invention that the Button Fastener Case, 77 Fed.
Rep. 288, and Henry v. Dick, were rested; both cases
were overruled in the Motion Picture Case. In the latter
case it was specifically held that while the patentee might
withhold his invention from public use, yet if he consented to its use by himself or others, he was limited to
the use described in the claims of .his patent, and that
,there was nothing in the statute which extended his right
to control the patented invention by prescribing the use
of machines, materials and supplies not covered by the
patent. In view of the full discussion of the question in
the series of cases already referred to, it is unnecessary
to pursue it further.
Under the system of leasing, now before us, the patentee not only undertakes to grant the use of the machines covered by the letters patent, but to dictate the
supplies with which they shall be used; to compel their
surrender if the machine of another is used; to. prevent
their use except with other machinery furnished by the
patentee; to extend the monopoly of the invention beyond
the 17 years allowed by the statute; to lease the use of the
invention only upon terms which permit the lessor to forfeit the patent license, and to terminate, if he chooses, all
similar leases to use the machines of the lessor. And these
extraordinary claims of right are made under the grant
of the patent which gives to the inventor the exclusive

right to make, use, and sell his invention, and nothing
more. In my opinion such extended power and authority
are not consistent with the act as the same has been con:
strued in every case dealing with the subject beginning
with the decision in Bauer v. O'Donnell. To sustain such
provisions it seems to me amounts to an authority to
holders of patented inventions, under the guise of leasing
the use of patented machinery, to exercise the right to
make combinations necessarily and unduly restraining
the freedom of trade, and by virtue of the patent grant
to build up monopolies in direct violation of the Sherman Act.
True it is that there is embraced in the patent grant
the right or privilege to -make licenses and agreements
covering the use of the machines latented so long as
such- agreements are not in themselves unlawful. But
the right to make restrictions is controlled by the general principles of law,. and because he is at liberty to
make them, the patentee may not make contracts in themselves illegal and certainly is not authorized to make contracts in violation of other statutes of the United States.
That rights granted under a patent do not authorize the
rfiaking of contracts in restraint of trade, or monopolizing
or tending to monopolize trade and -commerce in violation of the Sherman Act, was held by this court in Standard
Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, 226 U. S. 20.
In Straus v. American Publishers' Assn., 231 U. S. 222,
contracts, otherwise clearly within the terms of the Sherman Act, were claimed to be justified because of rights
secured under the copyright laws of the United States.
Quoting and following the decision in the Standard Sanitary 'Mfg. Co. Case, this court said: " So, in the present
case, it cannot be successfully contended that. the, monopoly of a copyright is in this respect 'any more extensive than that secured under the patent law. No more
than the patent statute was the copyright act intended

to authorize agreements in unlawful restraint of trade and
tending to monopoly, in violation of the specific terms of
the Sherman Law, which is broadly designed to reach all
combinations in unlawful restraint of trade and tending
because of the agreements or combinations entered into
to build up and perpetuate monopolies.
"
The patent statute and the Sherman Act are each valid
laws of the United States. While a patentee should be
protected in the exercise of rights secured to the inventor
under the patent system enacted into the laws of the
United States, there is nothing in the act which gives the
patentee a license to violate other statutes of the United
States, and certainly not the one now under consideration. In my opinion the restrictive and prohibitive
clauses of these leases are within the Sherman Act, as they
are clearly in restraint of interstate trade and tend to
monopolize in the sense that those terms have been defined
in the decisions of this court. That some of the leases were
in existence when the United Shoe Machinery Company
was formed affords no protection as against the exercise
of the power of Congress in the passage of the Sherman
Act. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottey, 219 U. S.

ment I can make of the reasons other than those stated in
the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Day, which render
it impossible for me to concur in the opinion and judgment of the court in this case.
I fully agree with the customary practice of giving great
weight to the conclusions of -trial judges as to questions
of fact involved when the value of the testimony depends
upon the appearance and manner of the witnesses when
testifying, but the reason for this rule ceases when the
evidence is in writing or consists, chiefly, as it does in this
case, of purchases of property, the significance of which
lies in the fact of the purchase rather than in the manner
of making.it.
Obviously, the attaching of the sole of a shoe to the
upper is the difficult and dominating operation in the manufacture of shoes by machinery, and early in the trial the
charge of the Government in the case, by stipulation in
open court, became, that the consolidation was formed
for the purpose of monopqlizing interstate trade or commerce in machinery adapted to that purpose, the "bottoming of shoes," in violation of both the first and second
sections of the Anti-Trust Act of 1890.
Before the merger the Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company (hereinafter designated the Goodyear Company)
was engaged in manufacturing and leasing to shoe manufacturers two principal and sixteen auxiliary machines,
the latter being used in preparing the materials for the
operation of the former. The two principal machines were
used for sewing the sole to the upper and were known as
the Goodye , welt and turn shoe machine and the Goodyear outsole rapid lock stitch machine. With these machines, the Goodyear Welt, a popular and largely used
shoe, was manufactured. This compan also manufactured a specially designed lasting machine used in
making Goodyear Welt Shoes.
The Consolidated and McKay Lasting Machine Corn-

pany (hereinafter designated as the Consolidated Company) was engaged in manufacturing and leasing lasting
machines of three types.
As the name of the one implies, and as otherwise appears in the record, each of these two companies had resulted from prior consolidations of shoe machine manufacturing companies and they were the largest organizations of their kiad in the country.
The controlling spirit of the Consolidated Company
was S. W. Winslow, and of the Goodyear Company E. P.
Howe, who, the record shows, were keen and masterful
men, and they both testifly that in July, 1898, they began
the negotiations looking to a uniting of the interests of the
two companies, which culminated in the organizaiion of
the United Shoe Machinery Company in February, 1899.
A "harmonious arrangement" or "working agreement"
was at first proposed, but Howe, being a lawyer, would not
agree to this, "because," he says, "I had a sort of indefinite idea that it might be deemed to be a combination
in restraint of trade. . . . I had an indefinite fear that
if the two companies remained separate but, for instance,
had a joint factory and joint branch offices, there might
be something in the way of restraint of trade. I insisted
for that reason that- there should be a complete merger
and consolidation."
This idea that the "harmonious arrangement" was
unlawful was doubtless inspired in the mind of Howe by
the decision in the Trans-MissouriFreight Assn. Case, 166
U. S. 290, rendered in 1897, and he probably shared a
then not uncommon notion that the holding company and
the merger were devices lawfully available for evading
the congressional purpose expressed in the Anti-Trust Act.
But in the Northern &curities Case, 193 U. S. 197, this
court decided in 1904 that the holding company was a
futile device, and in the American Tobacco Co. Case, 221
U. S. 106, it was decided in 1911 that the merger was also

illegal way, the defendants resorted to the merger (later
on, as we shall see, using also the holding company)
and organized the United Shoe Machinery Company,
under the laws of New Jersey, with a capital stock of
$25,000,000.
The scope of the declaration of the purposes for which
this corporation was formed, as stated in its articles of
incoiporation, is of much significance in determining what
the real objective was at which the persons interested
were aiming. It is therein declared that the company is
formed not only "to manufacture, lease and sell shoe machinery," but also, "to manufacture . . . boots, shoes,
and footwear and- all articles . . . of every description that may be produced or manufactured, in whole or
in part, from leather, rubber or any other materials
or fabrics; . . . to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire . . - trade-marks, trade-names, . . . copyrights and patent rights, . . . and, with a view to

of the new company still available for other uses, the t*o
largest manufacturers of lasting machines in the country
were combined and Winslow testifies that, "After the
formation of the United Company it was manufacturing
every single lasting machine that was being put out in the
United States except the Seaver machine; and in 1900 we
acquired the" Seaver Company."
Next, and immediately, although Winslow testifies that
"no word had been spoken to either the McKay people or
the Eppler people when the charter for the United Coipany was obtained," the Company purchased the entire
capital stock of the McKay Shoe Machinery Company for
five and one-half million dollars of stock of the United
Company. This company, Winslow testifies, was engaged in manufacturing metallic fastening machines and
heeling machines, 'was doing a very large business," and
through controlled subsidiaries was "putting out nearly
all the metallic fastening machines and nearly all the heeling machines that were being made in the United States."
Thus, confessedly, by this union of these three companies there were consolidated substantially all of the
manufacturers of lasting machines and of machines for
attaching the soles of boots and shoes to uppers with metallic fastenings and with thread, and in addition to this
the Davey Pegging Machine Company was owned by the
Consolidated Company.
There yet remained only one strong competitor doing
business in this country, the Eppler Welt Machine Company, with an international subsidiary. Besides the
Eppler there was only one other welt machine company
engaged in business, the Globe, an unimportant concern
Nyhich, however, was acquired by the United Company
a little later, in 1901.
Although Winslow and Howe could remember within
a small fraction of a cent just what royalties were paid at
any time for the use of their machines, neither of them

could remember what was paid for the Eppler stock, and
both testified that the records of the company did not
show the amount. But other testimony shows that
payment for it, of between $350,000 and $400,000 in cash,
was made within a few weeks after the organization-of the
United Company, and it was admitted, significantly, that
no inventory was taken at the time of the purchase of
either the McKay or Eppler stock.
That the Goodyear and Eppler machines were sharply
competitive is shown by the testimony of both Winslow
and Howe. Winslow testifies that just -before the consolidation the Eppler Company was "manufacturing a
welting machine, an outsole stitching machine and two
auxiliary machines" and that the Goodyear Company
was making "a welting machine, an outsole stitching machine and auxiliary machines that performed the same
functions that the auxiliary machines of the Eppler Company did, and a number in addition." "Both machines,"
continues Winslow, "were being used in the manufacture
of men's welt shoes," and "the two welting machines that
were being specially pressed on the market at that time
were the Goodyear machine and the Eppler machine."
And Howe testifies, "Those two types of shoes were well
known in the trade. There was the Goodyear welt, made
by the Goodyear welt machines; the Eppler welt, which
was a recognized class of shoe. We didn't know whether
the manufacturers would prefer ...
. Eppler welts
or whether they would prefer Goodyear welts."
What these two, dominating spirits of the enterprise
thought of their work at 'the stage of its development
which we have thus far described, is interesting and Muminating as to .their purpose. Thus, Winslow:
"Immediately after the organization of 'the compaiy
our welting, outsole stitching and lasting machines were
doing about all the welting, outsole stitching and lasting
that was being done in the United States.

"Q. And so with your heeling and metallic fastening
machines?
"A. Not so much the heeling."
And this from Howe, "When the United was formed I
don't remember that any outside concerns were putting
out lasting machines," and he elsewhere says, on crossexamination, that lasting machines of the Goodyear and
Consolidated Companies overlapped in the work which
was done with them and, if this was, true, obviously they
must have been competitors in the market.
To this must be added the statements made in circulars
sent at this time to the smaller stockholders of the companies to induce them to join in the combination. Thus,
to stockholders of the Goodyear Company: "The great
advantages to be secured by the control in one corporation, both in the United States and in foreign countries, of
the efficient types of shoe machinery, have been for several years recognized by the officers of the principal shoemaclinery companies. For more than a year your directors and large shareholders have been in negotiation to
accomplish this end. After a thorough investigation of the
financial condition and the business of the shoe-machinery
companies named below: the organization of a corporation
has been effected under the laws of the State of New
Jersey, to be known as the United Shoe Machinery Company. . . . The United Shoe Machinery Company
has already contracted for more than a majority of the
capital stock of [the companies named other than the
Eppler Company and the Davey Pegging Machine Company] besides stocks in other shoe-machinery companies,
letters patent and other property.
"The United Company will also from time to time acquire other shoe-machinery and properties, either by direct
ownership or purchase of shares of their stock."
I cannot share in estimating this circular as simply a
naive expression of unusual business foresight. It was a

-

confidential circular, boldly phrased, perhaps because its
authors thought that their combination had been given
a character of merger which could withstand Government attack, but which this court has since repeatedly
held is a mere subterfuge of form. The circular is an accurate descripton of what had been accomplished and of
what, as we shall see, the evidence in the record shows,
was intended to be done in the future.
It would seem that men who were not bent upon complete monopoly and control would have been satisfied with
the advantages which, we have thus seen, those in this
enterprise clearly held over any competitors who might
remain or who might appear in the future. But that the
men connected with the United Company were not satisfied, and were determined to make their control as perfect
and permanent as possible, is shown by their further conduct during the first year of the existence of that com-pany, as follows:
Within a month of the organization of the United Company,'on March 1, 1899, for the sum of $74,800 worth of
its' capital stock -itpurchased the control of the Goddu
Company, which was -manufacturing metallic fastening
machines, which competed with those of the absorbed
McKay Company, and the six inventors who owned the
stock were bound by the contract of purchase to transfer
to the United Company all inventions relating to shoe
machinery, which they jointly or severally might make or
have any interest in for a period of ten years; and they were
also bound not to become interested "directly. or indirectly" for a like term "in the business of making and selling any inventions or improvements relating in any way to
shoe machinery," or relating in any way to the manufacture of boots and shoes or useful in connection therewith
"without the consent in writing of the United Company."
On the 16th day of March, 1900, the Company purchased from Winkley and Phillips the exclusive license

to use the inventions and improvements in sole leveling
machines, described in ten letters patent of the United
States and in patents of Great Britain, France and Germany, and bound the inventors to communicate to the
United Company all inventions "which they or either of
them shall hereafter make" in sole leveling machines or
sole pressing machines. Howe testifies that at the time
of this purchase the United Company was making machines of the kind, but of a different type'
On August 26, 1899, for the sum of $72,000 the Company purchased the business of Timothy Bresnahan, together with the enire capital stock of the Boston Shoe
Tool Company. It employed Bresnahan as manager for
two years and bound him by contract not to thereafer
engage in "the manufacture of heel trimming, edge
trinming or edge setting machines and tools
or of any
. .
machines, tools and products now
[then] made by him or by said Boston Shoe Tool Company," and that he would not "directly or indirectly aid,
assist or encourage any competition with said Boston Shoe
Tool Company or its business," but would do "everything
in his power to promote the interests of the United Shoe
Machinery Company."
On October lth of the same year, the Company purchased from one Brewer, for $250 and $5 royalty on each
machine which should be manufactured, his applicationfor letters patent for an improvement in heel breasting machines, the one machine he had manufactured and
the tools with which he had made it, and it took an assignment from Brewer "of any and all inventions he may
hereaftermake relating to machines for breasting heels 'on
the last."'
The attempt made in argument to justify as familiar
business practice such contracts as these, binding inventors from whom patents and other property were purchased to surrender to the United Company all of the

fruits of their inventive genius for many years after the
purchase and often for many years after their employment
had ceased, is disingenuous in the extreme. In a single,
terse sentence this court has made conclusive answer to
such contention, saying, "Even if separate elements
of such a scheme are lawful, when they are bound together by a common intent as parts of an unlawful scheme
to monopolize interstate commerce the plan may make
the parts unlawful." Swift & Co. v. United States, 196
U. S. 375; United States v. Reading Co., 226 U. S. 324.
On January 13, 1900, the Company purchased, for the
sum of $38,000, the business and assets, including twenty
United States and foreign patents and 138 lasting maIchines, of the Seaver Process Lasting Company.
This
was the only independent company putting lasting machines on the market after the combination was formed,
and it removed the last vestige of competition in the
lasting machine business.
These will suffice. They are typical of fifty-seven purchases proved to have been made by the United Company prior to the commencement of this suit; of shoe
machinery manufacturing companies; of boot and shoe
manufacturing companies; of patent rights or applications
for such rights; and of the property and businesses of
partnerships and corporations engaged in manufacturing
appliances "calculated," in the language of the charter
of the company, "directly -or indirectly, to accomplish
the objects, or any of them, of the corporation," and
varying -from sewing machine needles and awls, to tacking machines, to buttons, brushes and sandpaper. Brewer's $250 application for a patent was not too small to be
overlooked, and we shall see 'a six millon dollar purchase was not too great to be made in order to continue,
to extend, and to make secure, the complete control over
the business involved, which was first attained by the
consolidation of the Goodyear and Consolidated Con-

panies and the purchase of the McKay and Eppler Coinpanies in 1899.
The history of the first year of this company would not
be complete without reference to the fact that the combinations and purchases made during that year resulted
in collecting under one control many hundreds of patents
covering every "shadow of a shade" of variation in the
parts of the many machines -used in the manufacture of
shoes, and, it must be noticed, that in the month of
December, 1900, the first of the forms of leases were
developed and brought into use, which came to be known
in the trade as "iron clad," and which have been discussed by Mr. Justice Day in a dissenting opinion in which
I cordially concur.
The boot and shoe trade of the country was so restless
under what was regarded and unhesitatingly denounced
as a monopoly, strongly entrenched, that although the
men engaged in that tiade were now utterly dependent
upon the United Company for the terms on which they
might continue to do business, at least two groups of inportant manufacturers were formed before the commencement of this suit for the purpose of devising, if
possible, some means of freeing themselves from conditions which they regarded, as the record "abundantly
shows, as oppressive and intolerable.
Under the spur of this incentive it came to pass that a
large manufacturer of shoes, one Plant, of, Boston, developed a line of shoe manufacturing machinery so complete in character that on May 1, 1910, he canceled the
leases which he held on many machines owned by the United
Company and removed them from his factory, and advertised his readiness to supply manufacturers with adequate,
and what was termed, "wonder working shoe machinery."
By Winslow's own story, negotiations for the purchase of Plant's shoe machinery manufacturing business
by the United Company were entered upon on June 16th,

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
CIAKE, ..,dissenting.

2-17 U. S.

within two months of the time that he removed their machines from his factory. These negotiations were interrupted on July 5th, and on the 28th of the same month four
suits were commenced by the United Company against
Plant, two more were commenced: on August 11th, two
more on August 13th, and two more on September 3rd.
These suits were -in
part to recover royalties claimed for
the use of the United machines before they were taken
out of Plant's factory and the rest were to enjoii him from
using his own machines, on the ground that they in
fringed patents of the United Company.
Whether as a result of this familiar resort to coercive
measures need not be determined, but on September 22nd,
at.four o'clock in the morning, possibly to anticipate negotiations which were in progress for the purdhase of
Plant's property bya group of wealthy shoemanufacturers,
the United Company purchased Plant's shoe machinery
manufacturing business and patents, and also the control which he owned of the capital stock of a shoe manufacturing company. The United Company paid for these
two properties six millions of dollars, plus $122,000 for the
Stambon property, which Plant insisted must be purchased
as a part of the transaction. This large sum of money,
larger than was paid for either of the original constituent
companies of the consolidation, was not divided in the
contract of sale, but Winslow allots three and one-half
millions to the purchase of the shoe manufacturing company stock and two and one-half millions to the purchase of the shoe machinery manufacturing company
and patents. Even this division, it will be observed, allows two.and one-half millions of dollars to be paid for the
Plant machinery company property and patents, which
it is now argued were of little value and at best were infringements of patents owned by the United Company.
Mr. Winslow, however, thought better of them, for he
says they were "almost invaluable" to his company.

It is impossible for me to understand how the transaction, thus described in Winslow's own words, can fail to
convince any one who reads or hears the description, that
the Plant Company. was a formidable competitor, actual
and potential, of the United Company, and that the great
sum of money paid to control it was paid to stifle and restrict competition. Standing alone it shows the defendant
to be an -unmistakable offender against the Anti-Trust
Law, but when taken together with the origin of the coin-.
pany and with the history of the conduct of it, a small
but typical part of which we have described, it seems to
me a flagrant and an all but confessed offender against
that law, as it has been repeatedly interpreted by this
court, United States v. Amerien Tobacco Co., 221 U. S.

Further details could not add to the effect of the large
outline we have thus presented. This is not a case to be
decided upon the detailed statements of individuals as to
their intentions or upon refined distinctions as to the application of the patent law. The design was a large one,
comprehensively conceived and boldly executed. The
dominating spirits of the enterprise, with the advantage
of knowing precisely what they wished to accomplish, rejected a "harmonious arrangement" of their interests as
unlawful, but to accomplish the same end they adopted
the scheme of merger, since condemned by this court as
a mere "subterfuge of form."
The trade recognized the combination as a monopoly
from the beginning, and for years struggled in vain to free
itself by organizing competing interests; the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, when the Clayton
Bill was under consideration, reported as tlhe result of its
investigations that the company appeared to be "a monopoly that owns and controls the entire machinery now
being used by all great manufacturing houses of the
United States" and with a record before me such as in
outline I have detailed, it is impossible for me to agree
that this now securely entrenched monopoly is an innocent result, of normal business development.
The difficulties of bringing the defendants within the
restraints of the law, which are regarded by the court
as all but insurmountable, seem unimpressive in the presence of the resolut6 manner with which this court dealt
with difficulties quite as 'complex and interests vastly
greater in the Northern Securities,StandardOil [221 U. S. 1]
and American Tobacco Co. Cases, supra. In the last named
of these cases it was found unnecessary "in order to give
effect to the requirements of the statute" to apply the
remedy of restraining the movement of the products of
the combination in interstate commerce, or that of appointing a receiver for the property of the offender, for
