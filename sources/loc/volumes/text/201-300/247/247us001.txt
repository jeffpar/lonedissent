Opinion of the Court.

court differ concerning them: (a) That the appeal in this
cise brings up for review both the causes which were
decided by the court below at the same time and both
therefore will be. controlled by the decree here to be
rendered. (b) That the order allowing an amendment-as
to the form of the appeal and the parties which was previously made without prejudice to the right of the appellees
to object to the same at the hearing on the merits was
rightfully granted and the objection which was at the
hearing on the merits made by the appellees is without
merit. (c), That under the case as made by the pleadings
there is authority to review.
* The approach to thei merits being thus cleared, without any difference on the subject the court is of opinion
that the ,doctrines by which the case is controlled have
been so affirmatively and conclusively settled by a prior
decision of this court as to cause it to be unnecessary as
a matter of- original consideration to restate them. Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679./, And the want of any possible
reason for removing this case from the control of the
â€¢doctrines of the Watson Case is, if needs .be, conclusively
*shown by the many cases referred to by the court below
in its, opinion (222 Fed. Rep. .669) in which the Watson
Case was made controlling and decisive as to coitroversies
not in substance -differing frgm'the. one here presented.
