ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 391.

Argued December 9, 1919.-Decided March 29, 1920.

Decided on the authority of StrathearnS. S. Co. v. Dillon, ante, 348.
P. 363.

258 Fed. Rep. 446, affirmed.

Tim case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. L. deGrove Potter, with whom Mr. John M. Woolsey
was on the brief, for petitioner:
This section is ambiguous and is not expressly applicable to foreign seamen on a foreign vessel. Considering
the purpose as disclosed by the act and its title, it is
quite evident it was not the intention of Congress to
legislate for the welfare of foreign seamen, but for the
welfare of American seamen alone.
As the meaning is doubtful and as adherence to the
strict letter would lead to injustice or contradiction, it
is the duty of the court to give the statute a reasonable
construction consistent with the general principles of law
and comity, and, so far as practicable, to reconcile the
different provisions to make them consistent and harmonious.
As this statute is penal, and in derogation of the common
law, it should be construed strictly. Sandberg v. McDonald, 248 U. S. 185; Neilson v. Rhine Shipping Co.,

harbor of this country, in derogation of contracts made
on foreign soil, and in contravention of the long established rules of comity and the law of nations it would
expressly have provided in the act that it should be so
applicable.
This section, and all the sections of the act, deal with
American seamen and make provisions for their benefit
and safety. Sandberg v. McDonald, 248 U. S. 195.
It is a general rule of law, well recognized in this country
as well as in most other civilized countries, that a con-.
tract valid where made is valid everywhere, and should
be enforced unless against public policy, natural justice
or morality. Story, Conflict of Laws, 8th ed., § 242..
When once the rights and obligations of a particular
transaction are fixed, in accordance with the principles
of law and policy of the place where they become fixed,
it caiinot be admitted that these rights and obligations
are subject to being varied according to the place or
country or -time of their enforcement. This fundamental
principle is attributed to Cicero by Mr. Justice Swayne
in the opinion of this court in the case of Wilson v. Mc.
Namee, 102 U. S. 572, 574. The enforcement by one
sovereign of rights accrued under a valid contract made
in the jurisdiction of another sovereign is part of the
comity and law of nations.
The law of nations is a part of the law of the land and
should be followed by the courts of the United States.

because it is in conflict with the provisions of § 4530 of
the Revised Statutes. Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Babcock, 154 U. S. 190. See Sandberg v. McDonald, 248 U. S.
185, 196.
That class of cases represented by The Kensington,
183 U. S.263, and Union Trust Co. v. Grosman, 245 U. S.
412, on which the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals
in The Strathearn, 239 Fed. Rep. 583, was based, are not
applicable here. They simply affim the well recognized
principle that the courts of this country will not enforce
a foreign contract against public policy. See Cuba R. R.
Co. v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 478. The Seamen's Act,
in so far as it is sought to be invoked in this case, does
not place any limitation on the enforcement of an obligation but creates a pecuniary right and obligation in
contravention of the terms of a valid foreign contract.
It has always been recognized by the courts as well
as the executive branch of the government of this country
that the laws and statutes of any State should not be
given extra-territorial force and effect.
The English rule is laid down in Lloyd v. Guibert, L. R.
1 Q. B. 115, 127; the French rule can be found in The Dio
Adelphi, Nov., 1879, 91 Jour. du Palais, 1880, pp. 603,
609. In The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 362; Mr. Justice Story
said, p. 370: ."The laws of no nation can justly extend
beyond its own territories, except so far as regards its
own citizens." American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co.,
213 U. S,347, 357; United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat.
610, 631.
This court in. the cases that have come before it has
construed the act under consideration as not having any
extra-territorial force. Sandberg v. McDonald, and Neilson
v. Rhine Shipping Co., supra. To the same effect are:
The Italier, 257 Fed. Rep. 712; The Nigretia, 255 Fed.

son v. Bark Eudora, 190 U. S. 169, is not an authority to
the contrary.
The provisions would have ample operation if confined
to contracts of seamen on a foreign vessel when made
while the vessel is in a harbor of the United States, and
then only to contracts of American seamen. See"The
Ixion, 237 Fed. Rep. 142; The Italier, 257 Fed. Rep. 712.
Where a controversy concerns the rights and duties of
the crew to the ship or among themselves and not involving a breach of the peace, on a foreign vessel on the high
seas, or in the port of another country, the law of the
flag of the vessel governs the rights and liabilities of the
parties just as conclusively as though the controversy
had arisen on land within the territorial jurisdiction of
the country whose flag the vessel flies, for a ship has
long been regarded by the courts and by writers on international law as a floating island of the country to which
she belongs. Dicey, Conflict of Laws, 2d ed., §663; Wharton, Conflict of Laws, § 473; Minor, Conflict of Laws, § 195;
Bluntschli, § 317; 1 Calvo Droit International, 4th ed., 552;

Where an act of Congress is passed over opposition of a
minority, as in this case, it is to be considered that the
words of the act represent all the majority deemed it safe
to ask. Lincoln v. United States, 202 U. S. 484.
If the provisions of this section which do not specifically
apply to foreign seamen of foreign vessels are construed by
this court to apply to the case at bar, the effect of such a
construction would be tantamount to holding that Congress may legislate as to contracts made on foreign soil and
affecting only foreigners. Part of the section provides:

362

252 U. S.

"And all stipulations in the contract to the contrary shall
be void." The contract was made at a port of Australia,
and, if the words quoted are held to apply to the contract,
this court will be sanctioning interference by Congress
with the law of a foreign friendly power. That Congress
possesses any such power has been denied by this court.
The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 362.
The Federal Government possesses only those powers
which are expressly or impliedly -conferred on it by the
Constitution. South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S.
437. By no possible stretch of the power to regulate commerce can it be said that Congress possesses the power
to regulate contracts of foreign shipowners and foreign
seamen made in Australia. Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How.
183, 198.
Interference with the liberty to contract on such terms
as may be advisable to the parties to the contract is a deprivation of liberty, without due process of law. Allgeyer
v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578.
It is true that consistently with the Fifth Amendment
Congress may legislate in such a manner as to deprive
persons of the liberty of entering into certain contracts,
but the justification for such legislation has always been
motives of policy based on the exercise of police power.
Pattersonv. Bark Eudora, 190 U. S. 169.
In order to justify any legislation under the police
power it must appear plainly that -it has a tendency to
rectify the conditions which the legislative body sought to
remedy. The courts will look through the form to the
substance. Booth v. Illinois, 184 U. S. 425, 429. The
section does not even attempt to legislate'to the benefit of
the seaman. 'It goes directly-contrary to the ,p6licy cf 'the
early Act of 1898, which was held constitutidnal ih Patterson v. Bark Eudora, supra.

Opinion of the Court.

demand one-half wages under it immediately upon arrival,
and leave the ship at once. Crews axe constantly changing, discipline is impaired, and unnecessary expenses are
incurred.
Although Congress is not prohibited from passing laws
impairing the obligation of contracts, it cannot deprive a
person of property without due process of law. Hepburn
v. Griswold, 8 Wall.. 603, 623; McCracken v. Hayward, 2
How. 608, 612; Sinking-Fund Cases, 99 U. S. 700, 718;
Cooley, Const. Lim., 7th ed., 507. If this act be applicable
to the case at bar, Congress did not merely pass a law
impairing the obligation of a contract, by taking away the
remedy for the enforcement of a contract, but created a
liability on the shipowner in direct contravention of the
terms of a legal, binding contract; and therefore violated
the Constitution by taking property without due process
of law.
Mr. W. J. Waguespack, with whom Mr. Silas B. Axtel
was on the brief, for respondents.
Mi. JusTIcE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.
This case was argued at the same time as Number 373,
just decided, ante, 348. In this case the libellants shipped
as part of the crew of the British Steamer Westmeath
for a voyage not to exceed one year, before the expiration
of which time the vessel arrived in the harbor of New
York, where she loaded and discharged cargo. A demand
was made for one-half wages under § 4 of the Seamen's
Act of 1915. The demand was refused, and an action was
begun for full wages. A defense was set up that the libellants were deserters, and, therefore, not entitled to recover.
The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals held
that the libellants' case was made out under the statute.

Syllabus.

The case is controlled by principles which governed the
disposition of No. 373. The difference being that it appears in this case that demand was made more than five

days after the vessel had arrived in the United States port.
In all other respects as to the constitutionality and construction of the statute our judgment in the former case
is controlling. It follows that the decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals must be affirmed.

APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

Nos. 350, 351.

Argued December 9, 1919.-Decided March 29, 1920.

A judgment of the District Court, in a habeas corpus proceeding
wherein the construction of a treaty is drawn in question, is not appealable directly to this court (Jud. Code, § 238) unless it is final.
P. 365.
It is the duty of this court in every case in which its jurisdiction depends on the finality of the judgment under review, to examine
and determine that question whether raised by the parties or not.

Id.
A judgment in habeas corpus dealing with the detention of the relator
for foreign extradition on three charges, and denying relief as to one
but assuming to order a further hearing by the commissioner as to
the others has not the finality and completeness requisite for an appeal to this court. Pp. 368, 370.
