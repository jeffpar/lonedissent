SIMPSON v. UNITED STATES.
538.

Syllabus.

Such being the ultimate facts of this controversy, we
cannot doubt that the Court of Appeals fell into error in
ruling that the words "Moistair Heating System" must be
"eliminated" from the trade-mark of the applicant as it
had been theretofore used, and that the requirement of
the act of Congress for the registration of trade-marks
would be fully complied with if registration of it were
permitted with an appropriate declaration on*the part of
the applicant that no claim is made to the right to the
exclusive use of the descriptive words except in the Setting
and relation in which they appear in the drawing, description and samples of the trade-mark filed with the
application.

It results that the judgment of the Court of Appeals
must be

Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS dissents.

UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF 'CLAIMS.

In computing succession taxes payable under the War Revenue Act

with trustees for investment and reinvestment, it was lawful for the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assess the legacies by means of
general tables based on approved mortuary tables and on four per

The Solicitor General, with whom Mr. A. F. Myers was

MR. JUSTICE CLARKE delivered the opinion of the
court.

This is a suit to recover the whole, or failing that, a large
part of a succession tax assessed under the Spanish War

Revenue Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, and
paid by the appellants as executors of the will of John G.

Moore, deceased, a citizen of New York, who died in June,
1899.

SIMPSON v. UNITED STATES.
547.

Opinion of the Court.

The assessment was made against the appellants as
persons having in charge or trust, as executors, legacies
arising from personal property, and the contention is that
right to recovery may be derived, either from the Act of
Congress, approved July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240,
directing the Secretary of the Treasury to refund the
amount of any claims which should be satisfactorily shown
to have been "erroneously or illegally" assessed under
warrant of § 29 of the War Revenue Act, or from the Act,
approved June 27, 1902, c. 1160, 32 Stat. 406, which directs
the Secretary of the Treasury to refund to executors so
much of any tax as may have been collected under wvarrant
of that act "on contingent beneficial interests which shall
not have becomie .vested prior to" July 1, 1902.
The decedent in his will directed his executors to convert a large residuary estate into money, to divide the same
into three equal shares, and to transfer two of such shares
to a trustee, to be selected by them, in trust to invest and
reinvest and to pay to each of his two daughters the whole
of the net income of one share so long as she should live.
Pursuant to authority derived from §
31 of the Waz
Revenue Act and Rev. Stats., §§ 321 and 3182. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in order to provide for the
determination of the amount of taxes to be assessed on
legacies such as are here involved, on December 16, 1898,
issued instructions to Collectors of Internal Revenue
throughout the country, which contained tables showing
the present worth of life interests in personal property,
with directions for computing the tax upon the same.
These tables were based on "Actuaries"' or "Combined
Experience Tables," and were used in arriving at the
amounts paid in this case.
On June 30, 1899, letters testamentary were issued to
appellants as executors, and on April 1, 1901, the United
States Commissioner of Internal Revenue, pursuant to the
provisions of § 29 of the Spanish War Revenue Act, as-

sessed a tax of about $12,000 on the share of each daughter,
which was paid on April 15, 1901.
On October 29, 1907, appellants presented to the
Government their claim, which was rejected, for the refund of $21,640.55 of the taxes so paid, o"or such greater
amount thereof as the Commissioner might find to be
refundable, under the Refunding Act of June 27, 1902, or
other remedial statutes."
The judgment of the Court of Claims, dismissing the
amended petition as to the claims for refund of the tax
paid on the legacies of the two daughters, and on three
small legacies which will follow the disposition of these,
and need no further notice, is before us for review.
Of the two claims of error argued, the first is, that the
Court of Claims erred in refusing to hold that it was illegal
to use mortuary tables and to assume four per cent; as the
value of money in computing the tax that was paid, and
that, therefore, the whole amount of it should be refunded.
The objection is not to the jarticular table that was
used but to the use of any such table at all-to the method.
Such tables, indeed the precise table which was made the
basis of the one used by the collector, had been resorted to
for many years prior to 1899 by courts, legislatures and
insutrance companies for the purpose of determining the
present value of future contingent interests in property,
and we take judicial notice of the fact that at the time
this tax was collected four per cent. was very generally
assumed to be the fair value or earning power of money
safely invested. Both the method and the rate adopted in
this case have been assumed by this court, without discussion, as proper in computing the amount of taxes to be
collected under this War Revenue Act in Knowlton v.
Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 44; United States v. Fidelity Trust Co.,
222 U. S. 158; Rand v. United States, 249 U. S. 503, 506,
and in Henry v. United States, 251 U. S. 393. It is much
too late to successfully assail a method so generally ap-

plied, and as to this claim of error the judgment of the
Court of Claims is affirmed.
The facts following are essential to the disposition of the
remaining question. The appellant executors appointed a
trust company trustee for the two daughters of decedent
and prior to July 1, 1902, they paid to it, in trust for each
of them the sum of $426,086.66. After making these payments the executors had in their custody in cash and
securities in excess of-$1,797,000, from which, prior to
March 16, 1906, they made further payments, amounting
approximately to $500,000 to the trust fund for each of the
daughters, thereby making each of them exceed $926,000.
The assessment of each was $665,000 in April, 1901.
The contention is that the excess of the assessment
above the amount which h~d been actually paid to the
trustee prior to July 1, 1902, had not become vested prior
to that date, within the meaning of the Act of June 27,
1902 (32 Stat. 406, § 3), and that it should therefore be
refunded.
The law of New York in force when the estate was in
process of administration, provided (New York Code of
Civil Procedure, 1899, § 2721) that "after the expiration
of one year (from the time of granting letters testamentary) the executors

.

.

.

must discharge the specific

legacies bequeathed by the will and pay general legacies,
if there be assets," and § 2722 gave to legatees the right to
petition in an appropriate court to compel payment of
their legacies after the expiration of such year.
Letters testamentary were granted to the appellants on
June 30, 1899, and we have seen that assets abundantly
sufficient to have increased the trust fund legacies of the
daughters much beyond the amount at which they were
assessed for taxation were in the custody of the executors
prior to July 1, 1902, and therefore under this law of New
York it was their duty to have made such payments prior
to that date unless cause was shown for not so doing.

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
Opinion of the Court.

252 U. S.

The state law also authorized (§ 2718) the executors to
publish a notice once in each week for six months, requiring all creditors to present their claims against the estate,
and provided that in suits brought on any claim not presented within six months from the first publication of such
notice, the executors should not be chargeable for any
assets which they may have paid out in satisfaction of
legacies.
The appellants first published the notice to creditors on
April 25, 1900, and therefore they might safely have made
payment on the daughters' legacies after the 1st of November, 1900, one year and eight months prior to July 1,
1902, unless cause to the contrary was shown.
The only excuse given in the record for not complying
with this state law is that in March, 1902, a stockholders'
suit was commenced against the partnership of Moore &
Schley,
of which the deceased was a member, in which an
accounting
was sought for a large amount of promotion
profits in connection with the organization of the American
Malt Company. As to this the Court of Claims finds that
the evidence does not show the pleadings, issues or the character of the suit, or the amount or merit of the claim, or the
result of the litigation. Obviously, such a showing of such
a suit cannot be considered to have been a genuine obstacle
to settlement of the estate, and the other claims against
it were negligible in comparison with the available assets.
It is thus apparent that for many months prior to July
1, 1902, there were abundant assets with which to make
payments upon these two legacies, in an amount larger
than was necessary to make them equal to, and greater
than, that for which they were assessed for taxation; that
for many months before that date it was the legal duty of
the executors to make such payment; and that for a like
time the legatees had a statutory right to institute suit to
compel payment.
It is obvious that legacies which it was thus the legal

duty of. the executors to pay before July 1, 1902, and for
compelling payment of which a statutory remedy was
given to the legatees before that date, were vested in possession and enjoyment, within the meaning of the Act' of
June 27, 1902, as it was interpreted in Ugited States v.

Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158; McCoach v. Pratt, 236
U. S. 562, 567; and in Henry v. United States, 251 U. S. 393.

than for a refund, if the War Revenue Act had not been

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 281.

Argued March 1, 1920.-Decided April 19, 1920.

The iprivileges and immunities" clause of the Constitution, Art. IV,
§ 2, protects rights which are in their nature fundamental, including
the right of a citizen of one State to institute and maintain actions
in the courts of another; but in that respect the requirement is
satisfied if the non-resident be given access to the courts upon terms
that are reasonable and adequate for enforcing whatever rights he
may have, even though the terms be not the same as are accorded
to resident citizens. P. 562.
The power is in the courts, ultimately in this one, to decide whether
the terms allowed the non-resident are reasonable and adequate.
