Syllabus.

The case is controlled by principles which governed the
disposition of No. 373. The difference being that it appears in this case that demand was made more than five

days after the vessel had arrived in the United States port.
In all other respects as to the constitutionality and construction of the statute our judgment in the former case
is controlling. It follows that the decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals must be affirmed.

Affirmed.

COLLINS v. MILLER, UNITED STATES MARSHAL
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

CARLISLE, BRITISH CONSUL GENERAL v.
COLLINS.
APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

Nos. 350, 351.

Argued December 9, 1919.-Decided March 29, 1920.

A judgment of the District Court, in a habeas corpus proceeding
wherein the construction of a treaty is drawn in question, is not appealable directly to this court (Jud. Code, § 238) unless it is final.
P. 365.
It is the duty of this court in every case in which its jurisdiction depends on the finality of the judgment under review, to examine
and determine that question whether raised by the parties or not.

Id.
A judgment in habeas corpus dealing with the detention of the relator
for foreign extradition on three charges, and denying relief as to one
but assuming to order a further hearing by the commissioner as to
the others has not the finality and completeness requisite for an appeal to this court. Pp. 368, 370.

COLLINS v. MILLER.

Opinion of the Court.

The proper party to appeal from, a judgment in habeas corpus directing
the marshal to release a person held for foreign extradition is the
marshal, not the foreign consul upon whose complaint the extradition proceedings were begun. P. 371.
Appeals dismissed.
THE

case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. J. Zach. Spearing and Mr. Guion Miller, with whom
Mr. J. Kemp Bartlett was on the briefs, for appellant in
No. 350 and appellee in No. 351.

Mr. Donaldson Caffery were on the briefs, for appellee
in No. 350 and appellant in No. 351.
MR. JUSTIcE BRANDEis

delivered the opinion of the

court.
These are appeals from a single judgment entered by
the District Court of. the United States for the Eastern
District of Louisiana on a petition for writs of habeas
corpus and certiorari. The relator had been arrested on
extradition proceedings., Each party asks to have reviewed the construction given below to provisions of
our treaty with Great Britain, proclaimed August 9, 1842
(8 Stat. 572, 576), and of the supplementary treaty proclaimed April 22, 1901 (32 Stat. 1864). The questions
presented are, therefore, of a character which may be
reviewed upon direct appeal under § 238 of the Judicial
Code. Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U. S. 447. But this court has
jurisdiction on writ of error and appeal under that section, as under others, only from final judgments. McLish

is a final one within the meaning, of the rule has suggested
itself to the court; and it must be answered although it
was not raised by either party. Defiance Water Co. v.
Defiance, 191 U. S. 184, 194. In order to answer the
question it is necessary to describe the proceedings before
the committing magistrate as well as those in the District
Court on the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
In October and November, 1918, the British Consul
General at New Orleans filed with the Honorable Rufus
E. Foster, District Judge of the United States for the
Eastern :District of Louisiana, three separate affidavits
each charging that Charles Glen Collins, who was then
within the jurisdiction of that court, had committed at
Bombay, India, the crime therein described as obtaining
property under false pretences, and that he stood charged
therewith in the Chief Presidency Magistrate's Court at
Bombay; and asking that he be committed as a fugitive
from justice for the purpose of having him returned to
India for trial. Warrants of arrest issued and Collins
moved, as to each affidavit, to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, contending that the transactions in question were
commercial dealings in which he had merely failed to
pay debts incurred. Hearings, entitled "In the Matter
of Extradition Proceedings of Charles Glen Collins," were
had before Judge Foster, at which the Consul General
and Collins appeared by counsel. Evidence in support
of each of the three affidavits was introduced by the
Consul General. Then Collins, who was sworn at his
request, admitted his identity and that he had been
present in India at the times the alleged crimes were
committed. As to one of the charges, that of obtaining
a pearl button from Mohamed Alli Zamiel ali Raza, he
was allowed to testify further. But he was not permitted to testify as to matters concerning the other two
which had been consolidated. And he was not permitted
to introduce other witnesses in defense of any of the three

affidavits. After the hearings were concluded Judge
Foster made two orders or judgments signed by him as
Judge of said United' States District Court and entitled
in said court. In these orders he found, as to each of
the affidavits, that he deemed the evidence sufficient to
sustain the charge under the law and the treaty; and as
to each he ordered Collins recommitted to the House of
Detention in the custody of the United States marshal
for that district to await the order of the President of
the United States. The two proceedings (which included
the three affidavits) were then consolidated. Under date
of November 27, 1918, a certificate setting forth his findings together with a copy of the record in all the proceedings was transmitted to the Secretary bf State.
This petition for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari
was filed by 'Collins, in said District Court, on January 8,
1919. It set forth the proceedings before Judge Foster
on the three affidavits, and alleged that his detention was
illegal and in violation of 'rights secured to him by the
treaty; among other reasons because he was refused permission to introduce evidence as above mentioned. District Judge Grubb ordered that the writs issue; and the
marshal made return setting forth in substance the facts
above recited. The case was heard before Judge Grubb
on 'February 21, 1919, the record before Judge Foster
being introduced. On the same day Judge Grubb, without 'delivering an opinion, 'entered an order which declared
that "relator's application for habeas corpus is denied "
so far as concerned the 'charge of obtaining the pearl
bitton from Mohamed Alli Zaimel all Raza, and that
"the vrits ,of 'dbeds corpus :re granted " -so !far 'as 'the

manded to the Honorable Rufus E. Foster, Judge, to
the end that relator be given the opportunity of introducing such evidence as he might offer at a preliminary
examination under the law of Louisiana."
Neither party took any action in respect to such further
proceedings before Judge Foster. On March 3, 1919,
Collins petitioned for leave to appeal, contending that
he should have been discharged on all three affidavits
and his appeal was allowed. This is case No. 350 on the
docket of this court. Later, the British Consul General
petitioned for leave to appeal on the ground that Collins'
application should have been definitely denied also as
to the commitment on the other two affidavits. His appeal, being No. 351 on the docket of this court, was
allowed March 28, 1919.
First: Was the judgment appealed from a final one?
A single petition for a writ of habeas corpus thus sets
forth detention of the relator on three separate affidavits.
As to the commitment on one of these the judgment entered by Judge Grubb directed that the writ be "denied."
Such denial, or more appropriately dismissal, of the
writ would obviously have been a final judgment, if it had
stood alone. McNamara v. Henkel, 226 U. S. 520, 523.
But the judgment appealed from dealt also with the detention on the other two affidavits. It declared that
"the writs of habeas corpus are granted " as to the commitments on the other two affidavit§ and ordered that
the case be remanded for further hearing before Judge
Foster.
What was thus called granting the writ was not a discharge of the prisoner, deferred as in In re Medley, 134
U. S. 160, and in In re Bonner, 151 U. S. 242; or made
conditional as in United States v. Petkos, 214 Fed. Rep.
978; Billings v. Sitner, 228 Fed. Rep. 315, and Ex parte
Romano, 251 Fed. Rep. 762; or coupled with other disposition of him as in In re Gut Lun, 84 Fed. Rep. 323, and

COLLINS v. MILLER.
364.

Opinion of the Court.

Ex parte GytI, 210 Fed. Rep. 918, 924. It more nearly
resembles the kind of an order which an appellate tribunal enters on reversing and remanding the judgment
of a lower court upon finding error in its proceedings.
But the proceeding before a committing inagistrate in
international extradition is not subject to correction by
appeal. See Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S.
698, 714; Sternaman v. Peck, 80 Fed. Rep. 883. Compare
United States v. Ferreira,13 How. 40, 48; United States,
Petitioner, 194 U. S. 194. And it is ordinarily beyond
the scope of the review afforded by a writ of habeas corpus

to correct error in the proceedings. In re Kaine, 14 How.
103, 122; Ex parte Harding, 120 U. S. 782, 784; Charlton
v. Kelly, 229 U. S.447, 457; Henry v. Henkel, 235 U. S.
219, 228. The order resembles, also, that which might
be entered by a district judge after having reviewed the
proceedings taking place before a United States commissioner, under the court's authority to assume control
in the preliminary stages of matters of which it has the
final decision under the law. United States v. Berry, 4
Fed. Rep. 779, 781; In re Chin K. Shue, 199 Fed. Rep.
282, 284; The Mary, 233 Fed. Rep. 121, 124; compare
Todd v. United States, 158 U. S. 278, 282; United States
v. Allred, 155 U. S.591, 594; In re Perkins, 100 Fed. Rep.
950, 954. For an extradition commissioner is an officer
of the court which appoints him. See Grin v. Shine, 187
U. S.181, 187; In re Grin, 112 Fed. Rep. 790, 794. But
here the extradition commissioner had certified his findings to the Secretary of State before the petition for writ
of habeas corpus was filed. Whether, for this reason, the
time had not passed when the court could correct the
action of its commissioner, except upon reopening of the
proceeding before him with the consent of the Executive
(see 6 Ops. Atty: Gen. 91),-or, in other words, whether
in such a case the power of the court is not limited to
ordering the discharge of the prisoner either absolutely

or conditionally except upon a rehqaring before the commissioner with the consent of the President-this question, we are not required to consider at this time. For
the proceeding ordered by Judge Grubb had not been
taken; nor had the power sought to be exercised by him
been challenged. Nor need we consider whether Judge
Grubb, having found that a proper hearing had been
denied by the committing magistrate on the two affidavits, might have heard the case de novo, and have
determined thereon whether the prisoner should be discharged; compare Chin Yow v. United States, 208 U. S. 8,
13; Whitfield v. Hanges, 222 Fed. Rep. 745, 746; United
States v. Williams, 193 Fed. Rep. 228; for Judge Grubb
did not undertake to do so. The prisoner remained
under the authority of the District Court (see Mr. Justice
Nelson 'in. In re Kaine, 14 How. 103, 133-4); and as the
writ of habeas corpus had not been disposed of there so
far as concerned the detention on two of the three affidavits, 'the decision below on that branch of the case was
not final.
Second: A case may not be brought here by appeal
or writ of error in fragments. To be appealable the judgment must be not only final, but complete. United
States v. 'Girault, 11 How. 22, 32; Holcombe v. McKusick,
20 How. 552, 554; Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff, '106 U. S. 3, 4;
Grant v. Phwnix Ins. Co., 106 U. S. 429, 431; Dainese v.
Kendall, 119 U. S. 53; Covington v. Covington First National Bank, 185 U. IS.270, 277; Heike v. United States,
217 U. S. 423, 429; Rexford v. Brunswick-Balke-Collender
Co., 228 U. S. 339, 346. And the rule requires that the
judgmeit ito 'be :Appelbhe 9hotild be !final indt ,orly as to
all the lApYties, 'btit as 'to 'the whdle sdibjedt-matter and
as to all the ,causes 'of ,adion invdlved. Louisiana Navigation Co. v. Oyster'Commission, 226 U. S. 99, 101; Selppy
v. Stevens, 200 Fed. Rep. 946. The seeming -exception 'to
this ,'ile 'by which an adjudicdtion final 'in its nature of

matters distinct from the general subject of the litigation,
like a claim to property presented by intervening petition
in a receivership proceeding, has been treated as final so
as to authorize an appeal without awaiting the termination of the general litigation below, Central Trust Co. v.
Grant Locomotive Works, 135 U. S. 207, 224; Williams v.
Morgan, 111 U. S. 684,,699; Trustees v. Greenough, 105

U. S. 527, has no application here. Nor have cases like
Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 204, and Thomson v. Dean,

7 Wall. 342, 345, where decrees finally disposing of property which the successful party was entitled to have carried into execution immediately, were held appealable,
although certain accounts pursuant to the decree remained
to be settled. Here a single judgment deals with the
detention on three affidavits. Only one branch of the
case has been finally disposed of below, therefore none
of it is ripe for review by this court.
Third: In what has been said we must not be understood as recognizing the British Consul General as the
party entitled to appeal from a decision in Collins' favor.
For the writ of habeas corpus was directed to the United
States marshal who held Collins in custody and the marshal was the party in whom rested the right to appeal,
if Collins prevailed on final judgment. See Charlton v.
Kelly, supra.

Both appeals are
Dismissedfor want ofjurisdiction.
