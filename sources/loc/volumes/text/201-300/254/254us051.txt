JOHNSON v. MARYLAND.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

JOHNSON v. STATE OF MARYLAND.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF FREDERICK

COUNTY,

STATE OF MARYLAND.
No. 289.

Argued October 18, 1920.-Decided November 8, 1920.

A law of a State penalizing those who operate motor trucks on highways
without having obtained licenses based on examination of competency and payment of a fee, can not constitutionally apply to an

employee of the Post Office Department while engaged in driving a
government motor-truck over a post-road in the performance of his

official duty. P. 55.
Reversed.

THIS was a prosecution based on ยง 143 of Art. 56 of
the Code of Public General Laws of Maryland, as amended
by c. 85, Acts of 1918. The opinion states the case.

Mr. W. C. Herron, with whom Mr. Assistant Attorney
General Stewart and Mr. H. S. Ridgely were on the brief,
for plaintiff in error:
To assert that there may be reasonable regulation of a
federal operation or agency by a State acting under its
police power, is to deny the complete sovereignty of the
Federal Government in the discharge of its constitutional
functions. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429,
431, 432, 436; Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U. S. 257, 263;
Henderson v. Mayor, 92 U. S. 259, 271, 272; Weston v.
Charleston, 2 Pet. 448, 467; Society of Savings v.- Coite,
6 Wall. 594, 604; Osborn v. Bank of the United States,
9 Wheat. 738, 867.
If the taxing power of the State may not be exerted over
federal operations and instrumentalities because of the
supremacy of the Federal Government in the field of its
constitutional authority, then obviously and for the same

reason is the State forbidden to exert any regulative control. Ohio v. Thomas, 173 U. S. 276, 283; Flaherty v.
Hanson, 215 U. S. 515; In re Neagle, 135 U. S. 1; Pembina
Minig Co. v. Pennsylvania, 125 U. S. 18!, 186; In re
Waite, 81 Fed. Rep. 359; Farmers & Mechanics Savings
Bank v. Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516, 526; Boske v. Comingore,
177 U. S. 459; Williams v. Talladega, 226 U. S. 404;
United States v. Ansonia Co., 218 U. S. 452; Holmes v.
Jennison, 14 Pet. 540; In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372; Western
Unon Telegraph Co. v. Brown, 234 U. S. 542.
If the State possesses power to determine qualifications
of plaintiff in error, then it likewise possesses power to levy
a tax upon him for revenue or other purposes. McCulloch
v. Maryland, supra, 429; Shaffer v. Carter,252 U. S. 37, 50;
Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 659; In re Rahrer, 140
U. S. 545, 554. The power of taxation is coextensive with
sovereignty, and as the police power can not be more
extensive than sovereignty, the police and taxation powers
must be coequal. From this it necessarily follows that the
absence of power to levy a tax upon a federal employee
or agency as such equally forbids the exercise of the
police power to control the official operations of such employee or agency. Dobbins. v. Erie County, 16 Pet. 435,
447-448; Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, 99 U. S. 273,
279, 283.
The Maryland statute is open to the objection that it
seeks to determine the fitness of, with reserved power to
deny, a means adopted by Congress in executing its
constitutional power to establish post offices and post
roads. McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 413, 414; Fairbank
v. United States, 181 U. S. 283, 287, 288.
While the State possesses the right to make a charge for
the road facilities which it furnishes, its pov;er to regulate
and control the use of such roads can not, by virtue of its
ownership of such roads, be more extensive than its potce
power, for such latter power is as broad as its sovereignty. -

JOHNSON v. MARYLAND.
51.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Hendrick v.-Maryland, 235 U. S. 610; Kane v. New Jeiey,
242 U. S. 160, 168.; It follows that if the State's ownership
of its roads does not deprive Congress of the power to
supplant state regulative laws with respect to the use of
those roads as instruments of interstate commerce., then
upon the same principle the state power must be subordinate to the exercise of any other constitutional power.
In re Rahrer, supra, 555, 556; Second Employers' Liability
Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 54. Were the rule otherwise the constitutional power to establish post offices and post roads,
which of course embraces provisions for the transportation
of the mails, would, to a considerable degree, depend for
its efficient exercise upon the will of the State; for while its
highways are post roads (Western Union Telegraph Co. v.
Richmond, 224 U. -S. 160, 165; Essex v. New England
Telegraph Co., 239 U. S. 313, 321), nevertheless the State
could dictate the terms upon which the mails could be
transported over them. The federal constitutional power
recognizes no such dependence.
Plaintiff in error possessed the right secured to him by
the Constitution and laws of the United States to engage
in the employment here drawn.in issue without compliance
with the laws of Maryland. Slaughter-House Cases,
16 Wall. 36, 79. In Hawker v. New York, 170 U. S. 189,
this court recognized the right of a State to require, as a
condition precedent to the practice of medicine, a demonstration of the qualifications of the applicant. Will it be
contended that a physician may not enter, e. g., the service
of the Federal Army as a physician on duty within the
boundaries of a State until he has first met the requirements of the state law?
The judicial decisions upholding state exertions of police
power affecting interstate commerce can not be used as
authority for the assertion-that the State may exert a like
power with respect to the establishment of post offices
and post roads.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

254 U. S.

Mr. Alexander Armstrong, Attorney General of the-State
of Maryland, and Mr. J. Purdon Wright, with whom Mr.
Lindsay C. Spencer, Assistant Attorney General of the
State of Maryland, was on the brief, for defendant in
error:
The regulation in question is enacted in pursuance of
the police power and its object is to protect the life and
property of persons using the highways of the State by
preventing the operation of automobiles by incompetent
persons.
A person employed by the United States to perform the
service authorized by its laws and in connection with its
property is subject to state control as to the method by
which he shall perform such service in a State. If he is
guilty of wilful misconduct or negligence, while performing such duty, he is liable in damages, for the laws of the
United States do not authorize him to perform his duties
in a negligent manner, and he is liable for all damages that
may result from an unauthorized act. Little v. Barreme,
2 Cranch, 170; Mitchell v. Harmony, 13 How. 115; ComClosson, 229 Massachusetts, 329.
mnwealth
It wouldv.seem
to follow that, if a State may insure
against the improper use upon its highways of a vehicle of
the United States Government, by a prosecution of the
person improperly. using it thereon, it may accomplish the
same object by requiring proof of the competence of such
person to use such vehicle properly upon those highways
as a condition precedent to his being permitted to operate
it thereon. 28 Ops. Atty. Gen. 604.
The State can constitutionally exact the payment of a
license fee such as is required by the law under discussion,
whether such fee is considered as a reasonable fee for the
services of the state officials charged with the issuance of
licenses or as compensation exacted by the State for the
use of its road facilities. 28 Ops. Atty. Gen. 604; Hendrick
v. Maryland, 235 U. S. 610; Searight v. Stokes, 3 How. 151;

JOHNSON v. MARYLAND.

Opinion of the Court.

Dickey v. Maysvile, etc., Co., 7 Dana, 113. [Counsel also
referred to an unreported opinion of the Attorney General,
rendered after the decision in Hendrick v. Maryland, in
disagreement with the view expressed in 28 Ops. Atty.
Gen. 604, upon the power to exact a license fee.]
MR. JusTinc- HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error was an employee of the Post Offic
Departitent of the United States and while driving &,
government motor truck in the transportation of mail
over a post road from Mt. Airy, Maryland, to Washington,
was arrested in Maryland, and was tried, convicted and
fined for so driving without having obtained a license from
the State. He saved his constitutional rights by motion to
quash, by special pleas which were overruled upon df
murrer and by motion in arrest of judgment. The facts
were admitted and the naked question is whether the
State has power to require such an employee to obtain a
license by submitting to an examination concerning his
competence and paying three dollars, before performing
his official duty in obedience to superior command.
The cases upon the regulation of interstate commerce
can not be relied upon as furnishing an answer. They deal
with the conduct of private persons in matters in which the
States as well as the general government have an interest
and which would be wholly under the control of the States
but for the supervening destination and the ultimate
purpose of the acts. Here the question is whether the
State can interrupt the at ts of the general government
itself. With regard to taxat on, no matter how reasonable,
or how universal and undicriminating, the State's iability to interfere has been regarded as established sbice
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316. The decision in
that case was not put upon any consideration of degree
but upon the entire absence of power on the part of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1920.
Opinion of the Court.

254 U. S.

States to touch, in that way at least, the'instrumentalities
of the United States; 4 Wheat. 429, 430; and that is the
law today. Farmers & Mechanics Savings Bank v. Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516, 525, 526. A little later the scope of the
proposition as then understood was indicated in Osborn v.
Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 867. "Can a
contractor for supplying a military post with provisions,
be restrained from making purchases within any State, or
from transporting the provisions to the place at which the
troops were stationed? or could he be fined or taxed for
doing so? We have not yet heard these questions answered in the affirmative." In more recent days the
principle was applied when the governor of a soldiers' home
was convicted for disregard of a state law concerning the
use of oleomargarine, while furnishing it to the inmates of
the home as part of their rations. It was said that the
federal officer was not "subject to the jurisdiction of the
State in regard to those very matters of administration
which are thus approved by Federal authority." Ohio v.
Thomas, 173 U. S. 276, 283. It seems to us that the foregoing decisions establish the law governing this case.
Of course an employee of the United States does not
secure a general immunity from state law while acting in
the course of his employment. That was decided long ago
by Mr. Justice Washington in United States v. Hart, Pet.
C. C. 390. 5 Ops. Atty. Gen. 554. It very well may be
that, when the United States has not spoken, the subjection to local law would extend to general rules that might
affect incidentalfy the mode of carrying out the employment-as, for instance, a statute or ordinance regulating
the mode of turning at the corners of streets. Commonwealth v. Closson, 229 Massachusetts, 329. This might
stand on much the same footing as liability under the
common law of a State to a person injured by the driver's
negligence. But even the most unquestionable and most
universally applicable of state laws, such as those concern-

ing murder, will not be allowed to control the conduct of
a marshal of the United States acting under and in pursuance of the laws of the United States. In re Neagle,
135 U. S. 1.
It seems to us that the immunity of the instruments of
the United States from state control in the performance of
their duties extends to a requirement that they desist from
performance until they satisfy a state officer upon examination that they are competent for a necessary part of
them and pay a fee for permission to go on. Such a reuirement does not merely touch the Government servants
remotely by a general rule of conduct; it lays hold of them
in their specific attempt to obey orders and requires
qualifications in addition to those that the Government
has pronounced sufficient. It is the duty of the Department to employ persons competent for their work and that
duty it must be presumed has been performed. Keim v.
United States,. 177 U. S. 290, 293.
Judgment reversed.
