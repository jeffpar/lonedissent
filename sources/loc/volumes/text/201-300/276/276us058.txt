MARLIN v. LEWALLEN ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 40.

Argued October 18, 1927.-Decided February 20, 1928.

1. The surviving husband of a woman of the Creek blood and tribe,
whether himself of that blood or not, has no estate of curtesy in
land allotted and patented to her in the distribution of the tribal
property under the original and supplemental Creek Agreements,
Acts of March 1, 1901, and June 30, 1902, and of which she died
seized, intestate and leaving issue. Pp. 59, 68.
2. By the Act of June 28, 1898, and prior enactments, tribal laws in
the Indian Territory were displaced and a body of laws adopted
from the statutes of Arkansas was then put in force, for Indians
and whites, except as they might be inapplicable in particular situations or might be superseded as to any of the Five Civilized Tribes
by future agreements. P. 62.
3. Statutes of Arkansas adopted by Act of Congress for the Indian
Territory, carried with them the settled constructions placed upon
them by the Arkansas courts before such adoption. P. 62.
4. Under Chapter 20 of Mansfield's Digest of Arkansas Statutes, as
modified by c. 104, both of which were extended to Indian Territory, curtesy initiate was not recognized and curtesy consummate
was recognized only wheie the wife died seized of the land and
intestate. P. 62.
5. The Creek Agreements, supra, were in the nature of a comprehensive treaty rather than a mere supplement to the fragmentary
legislation that preceded them, were to have full effect regardless
of any inconsistency with that legislation, and are to be construed,

not according to the technical meaning of their words, but according to the sense in which they would naturally be understood by
the Indians. P. 63.
6. These agreements, given their true status as special laws for the
Creeks, withdrew the lands of the Creeks from the adopted Arkansas laws of curtesy. P. 65.
7. The Act of April 28, 1904, relating to the jurisdiction of the Special
Courts of Indian Territory, and providing for the continuance and
extension of the Arkansas laws theretofore put in force there, and
conferring full and complete jurisdiction upon the district courts of
the Territory in the settlement of all estates of decedents, etc., did
not subject the lands of the Creeks to the Arkansas laws of curtesy.

This case presents a controverted claim to an estate
by the curtesy in lands allotted and patented to a Creek
woman in the distribution of the tribal property. The
district court of the county where the lands lay rejected
the claim; but on appeal to the Supreme Court of the
State the claim was upheld, three judges dissenting. 113

ried woman of Creek blood and was enrolled as a member of the tribe. Her husband was a white man without
tribal enrollment or membership. She died intestate November 29, 1904, while seized of the lands, and was survived by her husband, by issue of her marriage with him
and by issue of a former marriage, all of the issue being
Creeks and capable of inheriting the lands.
Two questions are pressed on our attention: Did the
laws then applicable to the Creek lands provide for an
estate by the curtesy? If so, did they extend it to a husband who was not a Creek where there were Creek descendants capable of taking the full title?
For many years the Creeks maintained a government of
their own, with executive, legislative and judicial branches.
They were located in the Indian Territory and occupied a
large district which belonged to the tribe as a community,
not to the members severally or as tenants in common.
The situation was the same with the Cherokees, Choctaws,
Chickasaws and Seminoles, who with the Creeks were
known as the five civilized tribes. All were under the
guardianship of the United States and within territory
over which it had plenary jurisdiction, thus enabling it to
exercise full control over them and their districts whenever it perceived a need therefor.1 In the beginning and
for a long period, during which the districts were widely
separated from white communities, the United States
refrained in the main from exerting its power of control
and left much to the tribal governments. Accordingly
the tribes framed and put in force various laws which they
regarded as adapted to their situations, including laws
purporting to regulate descent and distribution 2 and to
exclude persons who were not members from sharing in

tribal lands or funds.' In time the tribes came, through
advancing settlements, to be surrounded by a large and
increasing white population, many of the whites entering
their districts and living there-some as tenant farmers,
stock growers and merchants, and others as mere adventurers. The United States then perceived a need for
making a larger use of its powers.4 What it did in that
regard has a bearing on the questions before stated.
By an act of March 1, 1889, c. 333, 25 Stat. 783, a special
court was established for the Indian Territory and given
jurisdiction of many offenses against the United States
and of certain civil cases where not wholly between persons of Indian blood. By an act of May 2, 1890, c. 182,
§§ 29-31, 26 Stat. 93, that jurisdiction was enlarged and
several general statutes of the State of Arkansas, published in Mansfield's Digest, were put in force in the Territory so far as not locally inapplicable or in conflict with
laws of Congress; but these provisions were restricted by
others to the effect that the courts of each tribe should
retain exclusive jurisdiction of all cases wholly between
members of the tribe, and that the adopted Arkansas
statutes should not apply to such cases. By an act of
March 3, 1893, c. 209, § 16, 27 Stat. 645, a commission to
the five civilized tribes was created and specially authorized to conduct negotiations with each of the tribes looking
to the allotment of a part of its lands among its members,
to some appropriate disposal of the remaining lands and
to further adjustments preparatory to the dissolution of
the tribe. By an act of June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 83-84,
the special court was given exclusive jurisdiction of all
future cases, civil and criminal, and the laws of the United

States and the State of Arkansas in force in the Territory
were made applicable to "all persons therein, irrespective
of race," but with the qualification that any agreement
negotiated by the commission with any of the five civilized
tribes, when ratified, should supersede as to such tribe any
conflicting provision in the act. By an act of June 28,
1898, c. 517, §§ 26 and 28, 30 Stat. 495, the enforcement
of tribal laws in the special court was forbidden and the
tribal courts were abolished.
Thus the congressional enactments gradually came to
the point where they displaced the tribal laws and put in
force in the Territory a body of laws adopted from the
statutes of Arkansas and intended to reach Indians as
well as white persons, except as they might be inapplicable in particular situations or might be superseded as
to any of the five civilized tribes by future agreements.
Of the adopted Arkansas laws chapters 20, 49 and 104
are all that need be noticed. Chapter 20 made the common law, as far as applicable, the rule of decision where
not changed by statute. Chapter 49 provided for the
descent and distribution of property of intestates. Chapter 104 enabled married women to control, convey and
devise their real property independently of their husbands.
When first enacted chapter 20 was regarded as recognizing
the common-law estate by the curtesy with both its
initiate and consummate gradations. But after the enactment of chapter 104, which was a later statute, chapter 20 was construed by reason thereof as no longer recognizing curtesy initiate, which at common law vested during coverture, and as recognizing curtesy consummate only
where the wife died seized of the land and intestate.

Gidney v. Chappel, 241 U. S. 99, 102.
In 1900 the commission succeeded in negotiating with
representatives of the Creek tribe an agreement such as
was intended by the Acts of March 3, 1893, and June 7,
1897. That agreement-known as the original Creek
agreement-was ratified by Congress March 1, 1901, c.
676, 31 Stat. 861, and became effective May 25, 1901, on
its ratification by the tribal council. 32 Stat. 1971. A
modifying agreement-known as the supplemental Creek
agreement-was then negotiated. It was ratified by Congress June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500, and became
effective August 8, 1902, through its ratification by the
tribal council and the proclamation of that fact by the
President. 32 Stat. 2021.
The agreements, taken together, embodied an elaborate
plan for terminating the tribal relation and converting the
tribal ownership into individual ownership, and also many
incidental provisions controlling descent and distribution,
fixing exemptions from taxation, preventing improvident
alienation and protecting the individual allottees and their
heirs in the enjoyment of the property. It is apparent
from the terms and scope of the agreements that they
were in the nature of a comprehensive treaty rather than
a mere supplement to the fragmentary legislation which
preceded them; and it is apparent from their repealing
provisions-§ 41 of one and § 20 of the other-that they
were to have full effect regardless of any inconsistency
with that legislation, as was contemplated in the Act of
June 7, 1897, which extended the adopted Arkansas laws
to Indians.
The Arkansas law of curtesy was among the laws so
extended. But that did not make it presently applicable
to the Creek lands, they being then in tribal ownership.
Such applicability would come only if' and when indi-

vidual ownership was substituted for tribal ownership.
The agreements provided for such a change, and had they
stopped there that law would have become applicable.
But instead of stopping there they proceeded to deal,
among other things, with the taxation, alienation and
devolution of the lands. Whether these further provisions in effect excluded curtesy under that law is one of
the questions in this case. Of course it is a question of
construction.
In taking up this question it must be remembered th at
the agreements were between the United States and a
dependent Indian tribe then under its guardianship, and
therefore that they must be construed, "not according to
the technical meaning of their words to learned lawyers,
but according to the sense in which they would naturally
'be understood by the Indians." '
Neither agreement contained any mention of curtesy.
But they did provide to whom the land should go on the
owner's death intestate. The original agreement, in §§ 7
-and 28, declared that it should "descend to his heirs"
according to the laws of descent and distribution of the
tribe. Washington v. Miller, 235 U. S. 422, 425. Curtesy
was not recognized in those laws. They were crude and
soon were found to be unsuited to the new situation.
The supplemental agreement, in § 6, put them aside and
substituted chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest, with two
provisos declaring that members of the tribe and their
Creek descendants, where there were such among those
coming within the terms of that chapter, should "take the
descent" to the exclusion of others.' Grayson v. Harris,
5Jones v. Meehan, 175 U. S. 1, 11; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v.
United States, 227 U. S. 355, 366-367; Choctaw Nation v. United
States, 119 U. S. 1, 28; Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S.665, 675.

full section read as follows: "The provisions of the act of

Congress approved March 1, 1901 (31 Stat. L., 861), in so far as
they provide for descent and distribution according to the laws of

MARLIN v. LEWALLEN.
58

Opinion of the Court.

267 U. S. 352. Chapter 20 of Mansfield's Digest, on
which the adopted Arkansas law of curtesy was based, was
not mentioned. Chapter 49, which was particularly called
into play, was the adopted Arkansas law of descent and
distribution. It said nothing about curtesy.
Plainly there was nothing in the agreements which
could have been understood by the Indians-or even by
others--as providing for curtesy; and this is true of the
tribal laws temporarily recognized by the original agreement and of chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest which was
substituted for them by the supplemental agreement.
Did the agreements, rightly construed, exclude curtesy
under chapter 20 of Mansfield's Digest on which the
adopted Arkansas law of curtesy rested? That law was
not a special one for the Creeks; nor was it more than prospectively applicable to their lands. The agreements, on
the other hand, were negotiated and put in force as special
laws for the Creeks. They dealt particularly with the
allotment in severalty, exemption from taxation, alienation and devolution ,of the Creek lands; and their provisions on these subjects were such that the Indians naturally would regard them as complete in themselves and
not affected by other laws not brought into them by
distinct reference. We have seen that the Arkansas law
of curtesy was not thus brought in. Both agreements
provided that on the death of an individual owner the
lands should "descend" to the "heirs" according to particular laws designated as controlling standards--the
the Creek Nation, are hereby repealed and the descent and distribution of land and money provided for by said act shall be in accordance with chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas
now in force in Indian Territory: Provided, That only citizens of the
Creek Nation, male and female, and their Creek descendents shall
inherit lands of the Creek Nation: And provided further, That if
there be no person of Creek citizenship to take the descent and dis-

tribution of said estate, then the inheritance shall go to noncitizen
heirs in the order named in said chapter 49."

tribal laws of descent being designated in the original
agreement and chapter 49 of Vansfield's Digest being
substituted by the supplemental agreement. In the absence of any restricting provision-and there was nonethe Indians naturally would regard that provision as comprehending the full title and intended to effect its transmission to the persons who would be the heirs under the
laws specially designated, and in the relative proportions
there indicated. They further would understand that
those persons were to take the title to the exclusion of
others, and not that they were to take it subject to a life
estate concurrently passing to another under a law which
was not mentioned. We say "concurrently passing" because the restricted form of curtesy recognized by the
Arkansas law did not attach during coverture, but only on
the wife's death and then only where she died seized of
the land and intestate. Neelly V. Lancaster, 47 Ark. 175.
It has been described by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma
as "in the nature of an estate by descent," and as passing
to the surviving husband as an heir. Zimmerman v.
Holmes, 59 Okla. 253, 256-257.
Some reliance is placed on the use of the words "descend" and "heirs" in the provision we are considering;
but there can be little doubt that in the connection in
which they were used the Indians would accept them in
an untechnical and comprehensive sense. The decision
last cited illustrates that their use in a broad sense is not
unusual.
Our construction of that provision has support in another closely related to it. The allotment of the tribal
lands was to be made among the enrolled members, including children born to them up to and including May
25, 1901; and each of these was to receive with other
lands a tract designated as a homestead. Section 16 of

MARLIN v. LEWALLEN.
58

Opinion of the Court.

the supplemental agreement, closely copying a part of § 7
of the original agreement, provided:
"The homestead of each citizen shall remain, after the
death of the allottee, for the use and support of children
born to him after May 25, 1901, but if he have no such
issue then he may dispose of his homestead by will, free
from the limitation herein imposed, and if this be not
done the land embraced in his homestead shall descend
to his heirs, free from such limitation, according to the
laws of descent herein otherwise prescribed."
Of course the homestead of a wife could not remain
after her death for the use and support of children, as
this provision directed it should in certain instances, and
also pass on her death to her husband for his life by way
of curtesy. So it is at least inferable from that direction
that both the United States and the Indians understood
there was to be no curtesy.
These considerations make it apparent, we think, that
the agreements-given their true status as special laws
for the Creeks and rightly construed-excluded curtesy
under the adopted Arkansas law-or, putting it in another
way, withdrew the lands of the Creeks from the operation
of that law.
After the agreements were put in force, Congress included in an act of April 28, 1904, c. 1824, 33 Stat. 573,
relating to the jurisdiction of the special courts for the
Indian Territory, a provision reading as follows:
"All the laws of Arkansas heretofore put in force in
the Indian Territory are hereby continued and extended
in their operation, so as to embrace all persons and estates
in said Territory, whether Indian, freedman, or otherwise,
and full and complete jurisdiction is hereby conferred
upon the district courts in said Territory in the settlements of all estates of decedents, the guardianships of

minors and incompetents, whether Indians, freedmen, or
otherwise."
It is contended that this provision subjected the lands
of the Creeks to the Arkansas law of curtesy and modified
the agreements accordingly. We are of a different opinion. The provision was couched in general terms, did not
refer to the agreements, did not mention curtesy or the
Creek lands, and contained no repealing clause. No
doubt it was intended to extend the operation of the
Arkansas laws in various ways; but it fell far short of
manifesting a purpose to make them effective as against
special laws enacted by Congress for particular Indians,
such as the agreements with the Creeks. We have so
construed it in other cases not distinguishable in principle. Washington v. Miller, 235 U. S. 422, 427; Taylor
v. Parker, 235 U. S. 42, 44. And the Supreme Court
of the State had taken a like view of it even before our
decisions were given. In re Davig' Estate, 32 Okla. 209;
Taylor v. Parker, 33 Okla. 199.
We accordingly hold that at the time of the allottee's
death-November 29, 1904-the laws applicable to the
lands of the Creeks did not provide for an estate by the
curtesy.
The Supreme Court of the State in holding otherwise in
this and other cases cited in its opinion passed in silence
over the status of the agreements as special laws and the
exclusive nature of their provisions, and rested its decision
on the other legislation adopting and extending the
Arkansas laws. In this it departed from applicable decisions of this Court and in effect put aside some of its
own earlier rulings.
As we hold there was no law providing for an estate by
the curtesy, the fact that the surviving husband was not
a Creek becomes immaterial.
Judgment reversed,
