CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 196.

Argued January 19, 1928.-Decided February 20, 1928.

1. The liability of the surety on a bond given by a bank to secure
deposits of county funds in Nebraska is not limited by § 6193,
Comp. Stats. Nebraska, 1922, forbidding any county treasurer to
have such funds on deposit in any bank in excess of 50% of its
paid up capital stock, but extends to deposits made in violation of
the statute, unless otherwise provided in the bond itself. P. 240.
'2. Construction of a state statute by the highest court of the State
accepted by this court, though made subsequently to the decision
here under review. P. 240.
3. The attorney's fees which are directed by § 7811, Nebraska Comp.
Stats., 1922, to be allowed and "taxed as part of the costs," in
actions on guaranty and other specified insurance contracts, are
not costs in the ordinary sense and are not taxable as costs under
Rev. Stats. §§ 823, 824, in actions in federal courts, but are to be
allowed in those courts by inclusion in their judgments. P. 242.
4. For the purpose of fixing a reasonable attorney's fee under the
statute, regard should be had to the amount substantially involved
in the action. P. 244.

Opinion of the Court.

the District Court against the above named surety company for the full amount of a bond given to secure deposits of county funds in a bank, later insolvent, and for
an attorney's fee.
Mr. Charles S. Lobingier, with whom Mr. Edwin D.
Crites was on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Edwin G. Davis, with whom Messrs. Andrew M.
Morrisey, Rush C. Clarke, James G. Mothersead, and
R. T. York were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The respondent, a surety company, as surety, and the
First National Bank of Harrison, Nebraska, a designated
depository for county funds, as principal, gave their bond
to Sioux County, Nebraska, the petitioner, in the sum of
$30,000. The bond, required by statute, was conditioned
on the payment by the bank, on the order of the county
treasurer, of all sums of money deposited with it by the
county. The bank became insolvent and closed its doors
when the county deposits amounted to $35,395.70. The
present suit was brought in the district court of Sioux
County, Nebraska, to recover from the surety the amount
of the bond and a reasonable attorney's fee, under Neb.
Comp. Stat. (1922) § 7811, and was removed to the
United States district court for diversity of citizenship.
The authorized capital of the bank was $50,000, and
the defense relied upon by the surety was a provision of
Neb. Comp. Stat. (1922) § 6193, which forbade the deposit
of county funds by county treasurers in excess of fifty
per cent. of the authorized capital of the depository. The
district court gave judgment for the full amount of the
bond and for an attorney's fee of $3,000. The Court of
Appeals for the eighth circuit reversed the judgment, disallowing the attorney's fee and any recovery on the bond

in excess of $25,000, which was one-half of the authorized
capital of the bank. National Surety Co. v. Lyons, 16
Fed. (2d) 688. This Court granted certiorari. 274
U. S. 729.
The Court of Appeals took the view that the Nebraska
statute, printed in the margin,' as construed by the Supreme Court of Nebraska, operated to limit the liability
on the statutory surety bond to one-half of the authorized
capital of the depository. Cole v. Myers, 100 Neb. 480;
Blaco v. State, 58 Neb. 557; In re State Treasurer'sSettlement, 51 Neb. 116; State ex rel. Davis v. People's State
Bank of Anselmo, 111 Neb. 126.
The correctness of this interpretation of the Nebraska
decisions is questioned here, but all doubts on that point
have been set at rest by a later decision of the state court.
In Scotts Bluff County v. First Nat. Bank, 115 Neb. 273,
decided since the entry of judgment below, the Supreme
Court of Nebraska held that the statute does not have
the effect asserted, and that within the amount of the
bond a county may recover from the surety the full
amount of the deposit even though it exceed fifty per cent
of the authorized capital of the depository.
We accept this construction of the statute.and accordingly set aside the conflicting interpretation of the court
below, even though it antedated the determination by the
state court. Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. Martin, 268
U. S. 458; Bauserman v. Blunt, 147 U. S. 647. If, as the
state court held, the statute is to be construed as not
INeb. Comp. Stat. (1922) § 6193, ". . . The treasurer shall not'
have on deposit in any bank at any time more than the maximum
amount of the bond given by said bank in cases where the bank gives
a guaranty bond, nor in any bank giving a personal bond more than
one-half of the amount of the bond of such bank, and. the amount
so on deposit at any time with any such bank shall not in either case
exceed fifty per cent. of the paid up capital stock of such bank. .. ."

SIOUX COUNTY v. NAT. SURETY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

affecting the obligation of the surety, we think it plain
that the liability on the bond, qua contract, is not affected
by the county treasurer's breach of duty. The bond contains no limitation of the amount which the treasurer
may deposit. The district court was therefore right in
allowing a recovery of the full amount of the bond.
In striking down so much of the judgment as allowed
an attorney's fee the court below was persuaded that
§ 7811, which provides for an attorney's fee, authorized it
only as costs to be taxed in the state court. As costs in
the federal courts are regulated exclusively by R. S. §§ 823
and 824, the court concluded that other costs, authorized
only by a state statute, could not be included in the
judgment. See United States v. Sanborn, 135 U. S. 271,
282; The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377, 388, et seq.; compare Ex
parte Peterson, 253 U. S. 300, 314-319.
Both in an earlier case, Globe Indemnity Co. v. SulphoSaline Bath Co., 299 Fed. 219, certiorari denied 266 U. S.
606; see also Spring Garden Insurance Co. v. Amusement
Syndicate Co., 178 Fed. 519, and in a later case; Business
Men's Assurance Co. v. Campbell, 18 Fed. (2d) 223, the
same court applied the Nebraska statute allowing the
recovery of attorneys' fees in suits upon insurance policies.
When it was argued that no other costs can be taxed in a
court of the United States than those authorized by
federal statute, the Court of Appeals said in the latter case
(p. 224) that the objection "applies only to ordinary
costs, and not to allowances for attorneys' services provided by state statutes."
State statutes allowing the recovery of attorneys' fees in
special classes of actions have been upheld as constitutional by this Court, Farmers'& Merchants' Insurance Co.
v. Dobney, 189 U. S. 301; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry.
v. Harris,234 U. S. 412; Chicago & Northwestern Ry. v.
Nye Schneider Fowler Co., 260 U. S. 35; Fidelity Mutual

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

276 U. S.

Life Ass'n v. Mettler, 185 U. S. 308, and they have been
given effect in suits brought in the federal courts. Fidelity Mutual Life Ass'n v. Mettler, supra; Iowa Life Insurance Co. v. Lewis, 187 U. S.335; Home Life Insurance Co.
v. Fisher, 188 U. S. 726; Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v.
Wilson & Toomer FertilizerCo., 4 Fed. (2d) 835, certiorari
denied 268 U. S. 704.
In these cases the local statutes were in effect treated
as creating a statutory liability in which insurers, by accepting risks after their enactment, had acquiesced, and
for the liability thus assumed a remedy was available in
the federal as well as in the state courts. Fidelity Mutual
Life Ass'n v. Mettler, supra, at 326.
The present statute, printed in the margin, provides
that in the cases specified the court "shall allow the plaintiff a reasonable sum as an attorney's fee in addition to the
amount of his recovery, to be taxed as a part of the costs."
The direction that the added liability be included in the
judgment as costs does no more in substance than the provision upheld and applied in the Mettler case, that the insurance company "shall be liable to pay . . . all
reasonable attorney's fees" or the provision upheld and
applied in Home Life Insurance Co. v. Fisher,supra, that
the attorneys' fees should be added to the judgment.
Such doubt as there may be as to the meaning and effect
of the statute arises from certain decisions of the Supreme
2 Neb. Comp. Stat. (1922)
§ 7811. "In all cases where the beneficiary, or other person entitled thereto, brings an action at law upon
any policy of life, accident, liability, sickness, guaranty, fidelity or
other insurance of a similar nature, or upon any certificate issued by
a fraternal beneficiary association, against any company, person or
association doing business in this state, the court, upon rendering
judgment against such company, person or association, shall allow
the plaintiff a reasonable sum as an attorney's fee in addition to the
amount of his recovery, to be taxed as part of the costs, and if such
cause is appealed the appellate court shall likewise allow a reasonable
sum as an attorney's fee for the appellate proceedings."

SIOUX COUNTY v- NAT. SURETY CO.
238

243

Opinion of the Court.

Court of Nebraska enforcing it in suits upon insurance
contracts entered into before its enactment, in which the
statute, attacked as impairing the obligation of the contract, was characterized as "remedial" or as a " costs"
statute. Nye-Schneider-Fowler Co. v. Bridges, Hoye &
Co., 98 Neb. 27; id., 863; Ward v. Bankers Life Co.,
99 Neb. 812; Reed v. American Bonding Co., 102
Neb. 113. In Nye-Schneider-Fowler Co. v. Bridges,
Hoye & Co., supra, the Supreme Court of Nebraska
said (p. 867):
"If the question that we are considering was now presented for the first time, we would hesitate to say that this
statute does not create and add to the contract a legal
liability which would not exist under the contract prior
to the enactment of this statute. The fact that the attorney's fee is to be taxed as costs in the case is not of itself
decisive of the question."
But the question before the Nebraska court in the cases
cited was not that with which we are now concerned.
Whether this liability for an attorney's fee, assumed by
entering into an insurance contract after the enactment
of the statute providing for the liability, may be enforced
in the federal courts does not depend on any nice distinctions which may be taken between the right created and
the remedy given. Disregarding mere matters of form
it is clear that it is the policy of the state to allow plaintiffs
to recover an attorney's fee in certain cases, and it has
made that policy effective by making the allowance of the
fee mandatory on its courts in those cases. It would be at
least anomalous if this policy could be thwarted and the
right so plainly given destroyed by removal of the cause
to the federal courts.
That the statute directs the allowance, which is made
to plaintiff, to be added to the judgment as costs are added
does not make it costs in the ordinary sense of the traditional, arbitrary and small fees of court officers, attorneys'

docket fees and the like, allowed to counsel by R. S. §§
823, 824.
The present allowance, since it is not costs in the
ordinary sense, is not within the field of costs legislation
covered by R. S. §§ 823, 824. That the particular mode
of enforcing the right provided by the state statute-i. e.,
by taxing the allowance as costs-is not available to the
federal courts under R. S. §§ 823, 824 does not preclude
the recovery. Since the right exists the federal courts may
follow their own appropriate procedure for its enforcement
by including the amount of the fee in the judgment.
R. S. § 914. Compare Mexican Central Ry. v. Pinkney,
149 U. S. 194; Indianapolis& St. Louis R. R. v. Horst, 93
U. S. 291; Manitowoc Malting Co. v. Feuchtwanger, 196
Fed. 506; Boatmen's Bank v. Trower Bros. Co., 181 Fed.
804.
It is said that the fee customarily allowed in Nebraska
is not less than 10% of the amount involved, O'Shea v.
North American Hotel Co., 111 Neb. 582; Wirtele v.
Grand Lodge, 111 Neb. 302; Central Nebraska Millwork
Co. v. Olson & Johnson Co., 111 Neb. 396, and that as
directed by the statute an additional fee should be allowed
here for the appeal in the Court of Appeals and to this
Court. The district court, in allowing $3,000 apparently
assumed that the full amount of the bond, $30,000, was
involved. In a technical sense this was true, since the
defendant, by its pleading put in issue the right to recover
the whole amount. But in point of substance the only
defense was directed to the $5,000 by which the amount
of the bond exceeded one-half the bank's authorized capital. For the purpose of fixing a reasonable sum, regard
should be had for the amount substantially involved.
For that reason we think that the fee to be allowed in all
courts should not exceed $2,000. The judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals will be reversed and the cause

INTERSTATE BUSSES CORPORATION v.
BLODGETT ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT.

No. 197.

Argued January 19, 20, 1928.-Decided February 20, 1928.

1. Where an application for an interlocutory injunction under Jud.
Code, § 266, has been denied by a court of three judges and the
bill is dismissed by that court on final hearing, the case is reviewable by direct appeal to this court. P. 249.
2. A state tax of one cent for each mile of highway traversed in the
State by any motor bus used in interstate commerce, the proceeds
of which are devoted to maintenance of public highways of the
State, is not repugnant to the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, when not unreasonable in amount or discriminatory against
interstate commerce. P. 249.
3. Such a charge, when reasonable in itself, is not to be deemed unreasonable because other taxes are imposed by the State on the
same taxpayer for the use of its highways, if he fails to show that
the aggregate charge is unreasonable. P. 251.
4. In addition to other taxes common to both classes, the owners of
motor buses operated in interstate commerce pay in Connecticut,
a tax of one cent for each mile of state highway traversed by each
vehicle, but the owners of such vehicles engaged in intrastate commerce pay instead a tax on their gross receipts, the proceeds of
both taxes being devoted to maintenance of highways. Held that
a party complaining of the mileage tax does not establish discrimination against interstate commerce by the mere difference of the
