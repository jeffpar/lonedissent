case. Here the letter of credit specified that drafts when
presented should be accompanied by " copy of ocean bill
of lading covering shipment Java to Philadelphia." Obviously such a bill of lading would be impossible unless
the shipment were continuously destined for Philadelphia.
It is true that, for the convenience of the seller, the bank,
at the buyer's direction, later waived physical presentation
of a copy of the ocean bill of lading. But the record does
not show that the bank had any reason to suppose that
the requirement had originally been inserted in the letter
of credit by mere inadvertence; so far as it was aware,
there was still to be an "ocean bill of lading covering shipment Java to Philadelphia," but the seller was to be excused from presenting it. The clause "shipment
from Java by Steamer or Steamers to Philadelphia" was
not waived and its meaning on the date of presentation
of the draft remained the same as when the credit was
issued. The provision in the letter of credit that "conditions embodied in this credit must be adhered to, otherwise
payment will not be effected," only expresses the rule,
with which we all agree, that liability upon a mercantile
contract may be established only by strict compliance with
its conditions. Filley v. Pope, 115 U. S. 213; Norrington

that the defendant has not obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Interstate Commerce Commission, is
not to be held moot because judgment of condemnation has been
entered and the railroad actually constructed over the land in
question, where the line has not been completed or in any part
operated, and could not, physically, be operated in interstate
commerce until completed. P. 478.
2. Where a defendant, with notice of the filing of a bill for an injunction, proceeds to complete the acts sought to be enjoined, the
court may, by mandatory injunction, compel a restoration of the
status quo. P. 479.
3. The Act to Regulate Commerce, § 1, pars. 18 to 22, does not apply
to the building by wholly intrastate carriers of lines to be used
wholly in intrastate commerce. P. 479.
4. A State cannot require a railroad corporation to engage in interstate commerce in violation of any law of the United States. P. 481.
5. A bill seeking to enjoin the construction and operation of a railroad over the plaintiff's land, upon the ground that paragraphs
18 to 20 of § 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce have not been
complied with, may be properly dismissed, without prejudice,
where the line in question is to be a short terminal railroad extending wholly within the State from a private plant to another local
railroad and is to be built and operated by a local corporation
organized for the purpose, and where its use in interstate commerce has not been threatened and could not occur until the line
has been completed. P. 482.

MR.

Opinion of the Court.
JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Under the laws of Texas, Cullinan secured a charter for
the Northside Belt Railway Company with power to build
and operate, as a common carrier, a terminal railway from
a private plant to another local railroad. The line was
to be about five miles long and wholly within that State.
The Northside Company instituted proceedings in a Texas
court to acquire by condemnation a right of way, for a
short distance, over unused land owned by the Texas &
New Orleans Railroad Company, an interstate carrier.
Thereupon, the latter brought, under paragraphs 18 to 22
of § 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended by
Transportation Act, 1920, c. 91, § 402, 41 Stat. 456,
477-478, this suit in the federal court for southern Texas.
The prayer was to enjoin the Northside Company from
continuing the condemnation proceedings and also from
constructing, maintaining or operating the railroad over
the plaintiff's land. This relief was sought solely on the
ground that the defendant had not obtained from the
Interstate Commerce Commission the certificate of public convenience and necessity prescribed in those paragraphs of the Transportation Act.
A restraining order applied for upon the filing of the
bill was denied. No application was made for an interlocutory injunction. The defendant answered that it was
exclusively an intrastate carrier and as such was not subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. The case was fully
heard on the merits by the District Court. It appeared
that, before this suit was begun, judgment had been entered in the condemnation proceedings; that the amount
of the compensation awarded had been paid into court
(as provided by the law of the State); and that the
Northside Company had entered into possession of the

276 U. S.

premises taken. It appears that, before process was
served upon the defendant, the line had been constructed
over the strip of land in question. And it also appeared
that, at the time of the hearing, the line had not yet been
completed; that the defendant had not engaged or offered
to engage in interstate commerce; and that it could not
possibly engage in such commerce until the completion
of its line.
The District Court found and held that the Northside
Company was an intrastate carrier only; that its construction would not burden interstate commerce directly or
indirectly; and that paragraphs 18 to 22 were not applicable to the construction of an intrastate railroad not yet
engaging in interstate commerce. On that ground, the
trial court denied the injunction and ordered the bill dismissed without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff "to
hereafter apply for an injunction against the respondent
if its activities in the future shall bring it properly within
the purview" of those paragraphs. 8 F. (2d) 153.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree of
the District Court, without passing upon the merits of
the case. It held that the cause had become moot, because "the only relief prayed for was action by the court
restraining the doing of things which have been done
since the suit was brought." This conclusion was based
on its own finding that "before the decree appealed from
was entered, a judgment condemning said land was rendered in said condemnation suit, and appellee had constructed its railroad over said land and was operating the
same." 16 F. (2d) 782. This Court granted a writ of
certiorari. 274 U. S. 734.
The finding of fact upon which the Court of Appeals
rested its judgment was clearly erroneous. There is no
basis in the record for the finding that the railroad was
in operation. The part of the railroad over the plaintiff's

Opinion of the Court.

land had been constructed; but the railroad had not been
completed. No part of it had been operated; and apparently it was physically impossible to operate it in interstate commerce until completed. Paragraph 20 of § 402
specifically provides that unauthorized operation as well
as construction may be enjoined. Moreover, the facts
erroneously found would not, if true, have rendered the
case moot. For where a defendant, with notice of the
filing of a bill for an injunction, proceeds to complete
the acts sought to be enjoined, the court may, by mandatory injunction, compel a restoration of the status quo.

493, 506-507.
The decree of the District Court was, however, properly affirmed for the reason indicated by that court. The
purpose of paragraphs 18 to 22 is to prevent interstate
carriers from weakening themselves by constructing or
operating superfluous lines, and to protect them from
being weakened by another carrier's operating in interstate commerce a competing line not required in the
public interest. See Railroad Commission of Wisconsin
v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563;
The Chicago Junction Case, 264 U. S. 258; Railroad
Commission of California v. Southern Pacific Co., 264
U. S.331; Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado &
Santa Fe Ry Co., 270 U. S.266; Alabama & Vicksburg
Ry. Co. v. Jackson & Eastern Ry. Co., 271 U. S. 244.
Compare Colorado v. United States, 271 U. S.153. The
mere fact that a railroad lies wholly within one State and
is to be built by an independent corporation, does not,
of course, prevent the application of paragraphs 18 to 22.
If it undertakes to engage in interstate commerce, its
operation becomes immediately a matter of national concern and it comes within the purview of those para

graphs.' But Congress did not in terms prohibit wholly
intrastate carriers from building lines to be used wholly
in intrastate commerce. As long as the Northside Company confines its operations to intrastate commerce, it
will not violate the federal law. Compare Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co., 258 U. S. 204; Railroad Commission
of Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co., 264 U. S. 79.

The plaintiff admits that operation of the Northside
line has not begun. But it insists that under the laws of
Texas every common carrier not only may, but must, if
requested, engage also in interstate business, and it argues
that this makes the Northside Company subject to the
Interstate Commerce Act. Texas Rev. Stat. 1925, Art.

Northside Company to engage in interstate commerce,
if by doing so it violated any law of the United States.
Compare Cleveland, Cincinnati,Chicago, & St. Louis Ry.
Co. v. UnTited States, 275 U. S. 404. Here, there was as yet
no threat to use the line in interstate commerce; and it
was shown that the line could not possibly be so used
until completed. There was clearly no imminent danger
that irreparable injury would result from its mere construction. Under these circumstances, to deny the injunction and dismiss the bill without prejudice, was, at
least, a permissible exercise of the court's discretion.

MIDLAND VALLEY RAILROAD COMPANY v.

BARKLEY

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS.

No. 375.

Argued March 9, 1928.-Decided April 9, 1928.

A railroad, in a time of coal-car shortage, distributed open-top cars
to tipple mines, which can use only that type, and box cars to
wagon mines. The owner of a wagon mine, shipping interstate,
refused box cars and, relying on § 22 of the Interstate Commerce
Act, sued the railroad in the state court for breach of its duty to
furnish cars under the local law. Held that the action would not
lie, since the question at issue was the reasonableness of the carrier's practice of car distribution, which was an administrative
question for the Interstate Commerce Commission. P. 484.
