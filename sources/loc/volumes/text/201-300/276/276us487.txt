HUMES v. UNITED STATES.

Statement of the Case.

Co. v. Littlefield, 237 U. S. 140, the claim was that the
carrier, knowing of the car shortage, had not only failed
to notify the shipper but had accepted the shipment. In
Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Sonman Shaft Coal Co., 242
U. S. 120, 125-127, the action was for failure to supply
cars in confessedly normal times. Compare Pennsylvania
R. R. Co. v. Stineman Coal Co., 242 U. S. 298, 300-301.
In none of those cases was the reasonableness of the
carrier's practice in controversy.
We have no occasion to consider whether the then existing orders of the Commission required the Midland to
adopt the practice followed. Nor need we determine,
whether by the amendments of the Interstate Commerce
Act made in Transportation Act, 1920, c. 91, § 402, pars.
10-17, 41 Stat. 456, 476, and the Act of September 22,
1922, c. 413, 42 Stat. 1025, Congress evinced the intention
to occupy the field of regulating the distribution of coal
cars, and thereby abrogated the preexisting limited right
to sue in a state court for failure to supply cars.
Reversed.

Argument for Petitioners.

276 U. S.

Mr. A. L. Humes, with whom Mr. Milward W. Martin
was on the brief, for petitioners.
The will bequeathed approximately twelve million dollars to charity, the bequests to be defeated if a fifteenyear-old unmarried girl should live to be forty or should
die leaving issue. It is obvious that the fact that the
bequests were subject to be defeated by the subsequent
event reduced their present value, but did not prevent
them from being "bequests" or from having present
value.
It is impossible to foretell definitely what value any
future interest, even a life estate, will turn out to have,
but the present value of such an interest is legally determinable if the probabilities involved are all shown by the
standard mortality and probability tables.
The charities received a vested interest in a contingent
estate, and such an interest is a present property right
having present value. Chaplin on Suspension of the
Power of Alienation (2d Ed.), p. 87; 2 Washburn, Real
Property (6th Ed.), p. 527, § 1557; Clarke v. Fay, 205

Park Bank v. Billings, 144 N. Y. App. Div. 536.
The present value of a property right that is dependent
upon some future event may be determined by the use
of standard mortality and experience tables, and by the
calculations and testimony of actuaries. Dugan v. Miles,
292 Fed. 131; United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., 222
U. S. 158; Simpson v. United States, 252 U. S. 547.
The present value of a bequest that is subject to be
defeated by some subsequent event, may well involve
identically the same probabilities as the present value of
a bequest that is absolutely vested and hence the attempt
to distinguish between them is unjustifiable. Cushman

Bowers, 9 F. (2d) 1018, distinguished.

Argument for the United States.

It has been adjudicated in other cases that the value of
bequests identical with the charitable bequests in the
present case is, for legal purposes, determinable from the
standard experience tables. Heath v. Widgeon, (1907)
2 Ch. D. 270; Clarke v. Fay, 205 Mass. 288; Ex parte
Thistlewood, 19 Vesey, Jr., 236. See Shover v. Myrick,
4 Ind. App. 7.
In the following cases, to prove the present value of
some future interest, the opinion and calculations of an
expert actuary were admitted in evidence and accepted
as reliable. Thayer v. Denver, etc. Co., 21 New Mex. 330;
Fort Worth, etc. Ry. Co. v. Spear, 107 S. W. 613; St.
Louis, etc. Ry. Co. v. Hall, 106 S. W. 194; Galveston, etc.
Ry. Co. v. Cooper, 2 Tex. Civ. App. 42; Clark County
Cement Co. v. Wright, 16 Ind. App. 630.
In the following cases, it was held that the value of
such interests could be shown from standard mortality
tables, and the values thus shown were accepted as reliable: Simpson v. United States, 252 U. S..547; United
States v. Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158; Pierce v. Tennessee, etc. Co., 173 U. S. 1; Vicksburg Ry. Co. v. Putnam, 118 U. S. 545. See also Western Assurance Co. v.
Mohlman, 83 Fed. 811, certiorari denied, 168 U. S. 710.
The deduction must be taken now, for if the executors
should wait until the contingency happens, and then, if
the charities receive the property, claim a refund, the
claim for refund would be barred by the statute of limitations. The purpose of Congress in allowing the deduction of charitable bequests, was to encourage such bequests. That purpose shows that the statute should be
broadly applied. Edwards v. Slocum, 264 U. S. 61.

charitable bequests here are not ascertainable, and not
presently deductible. Kahn v. Bowers, 9 F. (2d) 1018;

The use of mortality tables to determine values of life
estates has been approved in tax cases. United States v.
Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158; Simpson v. United
States, 252 U. S. 547.
There has been no provision in the Revenue Acts expressly to the effect that readjustment of estate taxes may
be made at any time in the distant future on which,
through the happening of future events, uncertainties of
the kind here involved are removed. The statutes of
limitation provide that claims for refund must be filed
within a limited time. It is the practice of the Treasury
Department, however, if a claim for refund is filed within
the prescribed time and is denied on the conditions as
they stand, to allow the taxpayer to have the claim reopened and reconsidered at any time in the future on the
production of new evidence or developments; and so in
this case, although the application for. refund has necessarily been denied because the value of the bequest to
charity is not now ascertainable, the way may be open in
the future, if the developments justify it, to apply for a
reconsideration of the claim and then obtain a readjustment. T. D. 8240, Vol. 23, Treasury Decisions (Internal
Revenue) p. 830.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.

This action was brought in the Court of Claims by the
executors of Dellora R. Gates to recover $120,508.50, a
part of the estate tax alleged to have been illegally exacted
under the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, § 403, 40 Stat. 1057,

Opinion of the Court.

1098. The basis of the claim is that a sum of $482,034,
which was disallowed in ascertaining the net estate taxable, should have been deducted from the gross amount of
$11,783,072.30 disposed of by Article Fifty-first of the will.
The sum disallowed represents the alleged present value
of certain contingent bequests to charities made by that
article. The question for decision is whether the alleged
present value of such contingent bequests is deductible
under § 403, par. (a), sub-par. 3, of the Revenue Act. The
Court of Claims held that the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue was right in refusing to allow the deduction.
63 Ct. Cl. 613. This Court granted a writ of certiorari.
275 U. S. 515.
The governing provision of the Act is: "That for the
purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be
determined-(a) In the case of a resident, by deducting
from the value of the gross estate-- . . . (3) The
amount of all bequests . . . to or for the use of any
corporation organized and operated exclusively for . . .
charitable . . . purposes." Allowance of the deduction was denied pursuant to Treasury Department Regulations 37, Article 56, which declared: "Conditional Bequests.-Where the bequest, legacy, devise, or gift is dependent upon the performance of some act, or the happening of some event, in order to become effective it is necessary that the performance of the act or the occurrence of
the event shall have taken place before the deduction can
be allowed. Where by the terms of the bequest, devise or
gift, it is subject to be defeated by a subsequent act or
event, no deduction will be allowed."
Article Fifty-first of the will gives one-half of the residuary estate to the testatrix's trustees in trust for her niece;
Dellora F. Angell, portions of the principal to be paid to
her upon her attaining the ages of thirty and thirty-five
years, the balance to be paid to her upon her attaining the
age of forty, the income to be paid to her in the meantime.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

276 U. S.

In the event that the niece should die without issue before
attaining the age of forty, the amount of the principal not
paid to her was given to charities. The remaining half of
the residue was to be held in trust for the testatrix's
brother during his life, the principal to be disposed of on
his death in like manner as the half first mentioned. The
testatrix died in 1918. Dellora F. Angell was then living,
was fifteen years old and was unmarried. The contention
of the executors is that the bequests gave the charities
a present property right in the estate; that the present
value of a property right which is dependent upon some
future event may be determined by the use of standard
mortality and experience tables and by the calculations
and testimony of actuaries; that the value so determined
of the contingency that the whole or a part of the gift
would go to charities is at least $482,034; that the deduction must be taken now, for if the executors should wait
until the contingency happens and then, if the charities
receive the property, claim a refund, the claim for refund
would be barred by the Statute of Limitations; and that,
because it was the purpose of Congress to encourage bequests for charitable purposes, the act should be construed
so as to allow such a deduction.
The Court of Claims did not find that the present value
of the contingent bequests to the charities can be determined by the calculations of actuaries based upon experience tables. No basis is laid in the record for supplementing the findings in this respect. But the executors urge
that we may take judicial notice that such tables exist;
and that, by the use of them, actuaries are able to determine that in 1918 the possibility that the residuary gift
of $11,783,072.30, or a part thereof, would ultimately go
to the charities was worth at least $482,034; or in other
words, 4.0909 per cent of the amount of that residue.
The figure, $482,034, we are told, is reached, through the
actuarial art, by some combination and adjustment of the

HUMES v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

standard experience table of mortality long in use (see
Simpson v. United States, 252 U. S. 547, 550) with two
other tables which are relatively little known and which
do not appear to have ever been used in America in
legal proceedings. One of these is supposed to show what
the probability is that a woman dying at a given age will
die unmarried; the other to show what the probability is
that if she marries, she will die childless.
If all the facts stated had been embodied in findings, no
legal basis would be laid for the deduction claimed. The
volume and character of the experience upon which the
conclusions drawn from these two tables are based, differ
from the volume and character of the experience embodied in standard mortality tables, almost as widely as
possibility from certainty. Both of these tables, axe
based on data contained in volumes of Lodge's Peerage.
The first table, which may be found in the Transactions
of the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland, Vol. 1, pp. 278279, and is called Lees' Female Peerage Tables, was constructed by M. Mackensie Lees. It deals with 4,440 lives,
of whom 2,010 died during the period of observation.
The second of the tables, which may be found in an
article entitled "On the Probability that a Marriage entered into by a Man of any Age, will be Fruitful," in the
Journal of the Institute of Actuaries of Great Britain,
Vol. 27, pp. 212-213, was constructed by Dr. Thomas
Bond Sprague. It deals with the experience of 1,522
male members of the Scotch peerage and purports to
.show the probability that a marriage will be childless
both as respects men married as peer or heir apparent and
men who did not marry as peer or heir apparent. In
order to apply the latter table to females certain assumptions and adjustments are necessarily made. It was on
such data that the petitioners sought to set a money
value on the probability that this Texas girl of fifteen will
not marry, or if she does, will die without issue before the

age of thirty, or thirty-five, or forty. Obviously, the
calculation that the contingent interest of the charities
was equal to 4.0909 per cent of the residue, was mere
speculation bearing the delusive appearance of accuracy.
. One may guess, or gamble on, or even insure against,
any future event. The Solicitor General tells us that
Lloyds of London will insure against having twins. But
the fundamental question in the case at bar, is not
whether this contingent interest can be insured against
or its value guessed at, but what construction shall be
given to a statute. Did Congress in providing for the
determination of the net estate taxable, intend that a
deduction should be made for a contingency, the actual
value of which cannot be determined from any known
data? Neither taxpayer, nor revenue officer--even if
equipped with all the aid which the actuarial art can

supply-could do more than guess at the value of this
contingency. It is clear that Congress did not intend
that a deduction should be made for a contingent gift of
that character. Compare Edwards v. Slocum, 264 U. S.
61, 63.
