sell to Osborn was valid or invalid in the circumstances
in which it was made, and whether by reason of its partial
performance while Greyhair was living Osborn became an
assignee in such a sense that the contract legally and
equitably might be enforced as against the heirs. These
questions inhered in the suit and necessarily were resolved
against the heirs by the decree for enforcement. No effort
was made to have the decree reviewed or vacated in any
direct proceeding. The attack made on it in the present
suit was collateral. Certainly there was no federal right
to have it reexamined or vacated on such an attack.
Judgment affirmed.
UNTERMYER, EXECUTRIX, ET AL. v. ANDERSON,
COLLECTOR.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 221.

Argued February 27, 1928.-Decided April 9, 1928.

I. The gift tax provisions of the Revenue Act, approved June 2, 1924
(see Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142), must be construed as
applying to gifts made at any time during that calendar year.
P. 445.
2. So far as applicable to bona fide gifts not made in anticipation of
death, and fully consummated prior to June 2, 1924, those provisions are arbitrary and invalid under the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment. Id.
3. The mere fact that a gift was made while the bill containing the
questioned provisions was in the last stage of progress through
Congress is not enough to differentiate this cause from the former
one and to relieve the legislation of its arbitrary character. P. 445.
18 F. (2d) 1023, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 274 U. S. 730, to a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals which affirmed a judgment of the District Court in favor of the Collector, in an action against
him to recover an amount collected as a gift tax.

UNTERMYER v. ANDERSON.

Argument for Petitioners.

Mr. Louis Marshall for petitioners.
A gift made during the calendar year 1924 and prior to
June 2, 1924, when the Act of 1924 became law, was not
made taxable by that Act; but if intended that it should
be, the Act, in so far as it related to a gift so made, was
void because in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

Trust Co. v. Wardell, 258 U. S. 537; Levy v. Wardell, 258
U. S. 542; Knox v. McElligott, 258 U. S. 546; Reynolds v.
McArthur, 2 Pet. 417; United States v. Field, 255 U. S.
257; Smietanka v. First Trust & Savings Bank, 257 U. S.
602; Llewellyn v. Frick, 268 U. S. 238; Nichols v. Coolidge,
274 U. S. 531.
The tax violates the Fifth Amendment in that it deprives the donor of his property without due process of
law. Wynehamer v. People, 13 N. Y. 396; Sherman v.
Elder, 24 N. Y. 381; Chicago etc. R. R. Co. v. Englewood
Ry. Co., 115 Ill. 375; Jaynes v. Omaha Street Ry. Co.,
53 Neb. 631; Smith v. Campbell, 10 N. C. 595; Eaton v.
B. C. & M. R. R., 51 N. H. 504; Buchanan v. Warley,
245 U. S. 60.
The rules which appertain to a testamentary disposition
of property, or to a right of inheritance, or to a so-called
estate tax, have no relation to a gift inter vivos not made
in contemplation of death. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S.
41; Magoun v. Illinois Savings & Trust Co., 170 U. S. 281;
Blackstone v. Miller, 188 U. S. 200.
Section 319 is in no manner based upon the theory that
the gift tax is imposed for the purpose of preventing the
donor from evading the estate tax imposed by the
Revenue Act of 1924, or by any predecessor acts based
upon that theory.
If the gift was made in contemplation of death, the
subject-matter, under the conditions specified in § 302
(c), (d), would be treated as a part of the estate of the

decedent, and, thus, taxable. The tax upon a gift inter
vivos and not in contemplation of death may not come
within the scope of these provisions. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 230.
The gift tax is not payable by the donee, but by the
donor, and is, therefore, clearly not a succession, estate or
inheritance tax or a death duty, but a tax upon the exercise of the constitutional right of the donor to give away
his property.
Nor is this tax similar to a stamp tax imposed upon the
transfer of shares in a corporation. The latter is a creature of government. The transfer of its shares is necessarily made with the sanction of government. Hence the
imposition of a stamp duty is based upon the idea that
a privilege is conferred upon the transferror. People ex
rel. Hatch v. Reardon, 184 N. Y. 431, aff'd 204 U. S. 152;
Thomas v. United States, 192 U. S. 363.
Nor can it be sustained as a tax within the rule laid
down in Nicol v. Ames, 173 U. S. 509, which related to a
tax imposed upon the sale of property pursuant to transactions at an exchange or board of trade.
The tax imposed is a direct tax and void because not
apportioned as required by Article I, § 2, Clause 3, of
the Constitution.
Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell and Mr.
Robert P. Reeder, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, were on the brief, for respondent.
The case of Blodgett v. Holden did not decide that the
gift tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1924 were not
retroactive, or that its application to all gifts made prior
to June 2, 1924, was unconstitutional.
To tax the gift here involved is not to make the law
so arbitrary as to be unconstitutional. The provision had
been under discussion in Congress for three months, had

UNTERMYER v. ANDERSON.

Argument ior Respondent.

been passed by both Houses, had been sent to conference,
and the conference had reported the bill containing the
provisions. It was not until then that Mr. Untermyer
made the gift. It is not an unfair inference that he had
knowledge of these facts and that it was his intention to
avoid the tax, if possible, before the bill should become
law by the approval of the President. He had an undoubted right to seek to avoid payment of the tax by
making the gift before the Act took effect. The only
question is, was it arbitrary and capricious and confiscatory to tax a gift thus made? It would not be so regarded
in England. Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 27, p. 182,
§ 352; Hume v. Haig, (1799) 8 Bro. Parl. Cas. 196; Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913 (3 Geo. 5, c. 3).
See also Vol. 24, p..537, Halsbury's Laws of England.
This case is not like that of Nichols v. Coolidge, 274
U. S. 531. There the Act of Congress reached back and
dealt with a transfer which took place a dozen years before
the law was passed and attributed to the property its
,value long after the transfer.
Neither federal nor state legislation is unconstitutional
because it is retroactive. Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386; The
Peggy, 1 Cranch, 103; Prize Cases, 2 Black 635; Johannessen v. United States, 225 U. S. 227; Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380; Curtis v. Whitney, 13 Wall. 68; Kentucky Union Co. v. Kentucky, 219 U. S. 140.
This Court has sustained state tax laws which were
retroactive in scope. Carpenterv. Pennsylvania,17 How.
456; Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278; Locke v. New Orleans,
4 Wall. 172; Seattle v. Kelleher, 195 U. S. 351; State v.
Bell, 61 N. C. 76.
It has sustained similar federal taxes. Stockdale v.
Insurance Companies, 20 Wall. 323, followed in Railroad
Co. v. Rose, 95 U. S. 78. See Billings v. United States,

A tax upon transfers of property by gift is not a direct
tax, but an excise. Apparently the only legal equivalent
of a tax on the general ownership of property is a tax on
the income from such property.
Mr. Ira Jewell Williams filed a brief as amicus curiae
by special leave of Court.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
By the original action commenced in the United States
District Court, Southern District of New York, Isaac
Untermyer sought to recover of the U. S. Collector of
Internal Revenue the tax exacted of him, under the Act
of June 2, 1924,-§§ 319, et seq.,--on account of a gift
which he made May 23, 1924. After his death the cause
was revived in the name of the executors-petitioners
herein-and was then heard upon an agreed statement of
facts. Both sides moved for a directed verdict. Judgment went for the Collector and was affirmed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals.
The questions now presented for consideration are
similar to those involved in Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S.
1.42.
The two causes differ in this: Blodgett's gifts were
made during January, 1924, before the provisions for
taxing such transfers were presented for the consideration of Congress; Untermyer made his gift May 23,
1924, some three months after those provisions were first
presented and while the conference report upon the bill
was pending. This report went to the Senate May 22,
1924, and three days thereafter the bill had finally passed

UNTERMYER v. ANDERSON.

Opinion of the Court.

both houses. The President approved it on June 2,
1924.
Unless the difference in circumstances stated is material, the same rule of law must govern both cases.
Two opinions were announced in Blodgett v. Holden.
The one prepared by the present writer, expressed the
views of four of the eight Justices who participated in
the consideration of the cause. After quoting the pertinent provisions of the statute, etc., the opinion declared:
"So far as the Revenue Act of 1924 undertakes to impose
a tax because of the gifts made during January, 1924, it
is arbitrary and invalid under the due process clause of
the Fifth Amendment." We need not now further repeat what was there set out.
In the light of arguments advanced by counsel in the
present cause, the matter has been considered by all
members of the Court, and a majority of them are of
opinion that the gift tax provisions of the Act of 1924
here challenged must be construed as applicable to gifts
made during the entire calendar year 1924. And, further,
that so far as applicable to bona fide gifts not made in
anticipation of death and fully consummated prior to
June 2, 1924, those provisions are arbitrary and invalid
under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.
The mere fact that a gift was made while the bill containing the questioned provisions was in the last stage
of progress through Congress we think is not enough to
differentiate this cause from the former one and to relieve
the legislation of the arbitrary character there ascribed
to it. To accept the contrary view would produce insuperable difficulties touching interpretation and practical
application of the statute, and render impossible proper
understanding of the burden intended to be imposed.
The taxpayer may justly demand to know when and
how he becomes liable for taxes-he cannot foresee and

ought not to be required to guess the outcome of pending measures. The future of every bill while before Congress is necessarily uncertain. The will of the lawmakers

concurs in the result.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, dissenting.
As I think the construction of the Act of June 2, 1924,
c. 234, § 319, adopted by four of us in Blodgett v. Holden,
275 U. S. 142, the proper one, I shall not go into the
question of constitutionality beyond saying that I find
it hard to state to nAyself articulately the ground for
denying the power of Congress to lay the tax. We all
know that we shall get a tax bill every year. I suppose
that the taxing act may be passed in the middle as lawfully as at the beginning of the year. A tax may be
levied for past privileges and protection as well as for
those to come. Wagner v. Baltimore, 239 U. S. 207, 216.
Billings v. United States, 232 U. S. 261, 282. Seattle v.
Kelleher, 195 U. S. 351. Stockdale v. Atlantic Insurance
Co., 20 Wall. 323. I do not imagine that the authority
of Congress to tax the exercise of the legal power to make
a gift will be doubted any more than its authority to tax
a sale. Apart from its bearing upon construction and
constitutionality I am not at liberty to consider the justice
of the Act.

during the calendar year. Then it holds the Act void as
applied to a gift made during the ten-day period between
the submission of the Conference Report to Congress and
the approval of the Act by the President. It holds the
Act void because the action of the law-making body is,
in its opinion, unreasonable. Tested by the standard of
reasonableness commonly adopted by man-use and
wont-that action appears to be reasonable. Tested by
a still higher standard to which all Americans must bowlong continued practice of Congress repeatedly sanctioned
by this Court after full argument-its validity would have
seemed unquestionable, but for views recently expressed.
No other standard has been suggested.
For more than half a century, it has been settled that
a law of Congress imposing a tax may be retroactive in
its operation. Stockdale v. Insurance Companies, 20
Wall. 323, 331; Railroad Co. v. Rose, 95 U. S. 78, 80;
Railroad Co. v. United States, 101 U. S. 543, 549; Flint
v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107; Billings v. United
States, 232 U. S. 261, 282; Brushaber v. Union Pacific
R. R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 20; Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S.
339, 343; Hecht v. Malley, 265 U. S. 144, 164. Each of
the fiftcen income tax acts adopted from time to time
during the last sixty-seven years has been retroactive,
in that it applied to income earned, prior to the passage
of the act, during the calendar year.' The Act of October
The Act of August 5, 1861, c. 45, 12 Stat. 292, 309, applied to all
incomes for the calendar year next preceding January 1, 1862. The
Act of July 1, 1862, c. 119, 12 Stat. 432, 473, enacted higher rates,
applicable to incomes for the year ending December 31, 1862. The
Joint Resolution of July 4, 1864, No. 77, 13 Stat. 417, imposed an
additional tax of 5% on incomes for 1863 which had already been
taxed at the rates established by the Act of 1862. The Act of June
30, 1864, c. 173, 13 Stat. 223, 281, applied to incomes for the then
current calendar year. The Act of March 3, 1865, c. 78, 13 Stat. 469,
479, which again raised the rates, applied to income for the year end-

3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166, which taxed all incomes
received after March 1, 1913, was specifically upheld in
Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 20, and
in Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S. 339, 343. Some of the acts
have taxed income earned in an earlier year. The Joint
Resolution of July 4, 1864, No. 77, 13 Stat. 417, imposed
an additional tax on incomes earned during the calendar
year 1863, this additional tax being imposed after the
taxes for the year had been paid. In Stockdale v. Insurance Companies, 20 Wall. 323, 331, Mr. Justice Miller
said: "No one doubted the validity of the tax or attempted to resist it." The Act of February 24, 1919, c.
18, Title II, 40 Stat. 1057, 1058-1088, which taxed incomes for the calendar year 1918, was applied, without
question as to its constitutionality, in United States v.
Robbins, 269 U. S. 315, and numerous other cases.
The Corporation Tax Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, § 38,
36 Stat. 11, 112, applying to all net income for the calendar year, was sustained in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220
ing December 31, 1865. The Act of March 2, 1867, c. 169, 14 Stat.
471, 477, also applied to income for the current calendar year. The
Act of July 14, 1870, c. 255, 16 Stat. 256, 257, taxed incomes for the
year commencing January 1, 1870, though the Acts of June 30, 1864,
c. 173, 13 Stat. 223, 283, of July 13, 1866, c. 184, 14 Stat. 98, 138, and
of March 2, 1867, c. 169, 14 Stat. 471, 480, had provided that income
arising after January 1, 1870, was to be free from tax. The Act of
August 27, 1894, e. 349, 28 Stat. 509, 553, applied to incomes in the
calendar year ending December 31, 1894. The Act of October 3, 1913,
c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166, applied to incomes received subsequent to
March 1, 1913. The Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756,
applied to all income of that year. The increased rates established
by the Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, applied to incomes
received during the calendar year commencing January 1, 1917. The
Revenue Act of 1918, February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1058,
applied to incomes for the year 1918. Later Revenue Acts have been
similarly retroactive with respect to the inedme tax: Act of November
23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227; Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat.

U. S. 107. The Acts of March 3, 1917, c. 159, 39 Stat.
1000, and of October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 302, imposing excess profits taxes on the profits earned during
the calendar year, were so applied in LaBelle Iron Works
v. United States, 256 U. S. 377, in GreenportBasin & Construction Co. v. United States, 260 U. S. 512, and in other
cases. The validity of the Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18,
Title III, 40 Stat. 1057, 1088, taxing excess profits earned
during the calendar year 1918, has never been questioned.
Compare Willcuts v. Milton Dairy Co., 275 U. S. 215;
Blair v. Oesterlein Machinery Co., 275 U. S. 220; Porto
Rico Coal Co. v. Edwards, 275 Fed. 104; National Paper
& Type Co. v. Edwards, 292 Fed. 633. The Munition
Manufacturer's Tax, imposed by the Act of September 8,
1916, c. 463, Title III, 39 Stat. 756, 780, applied to the
twelve months ending December 31, 1916. Compare Carbon Steel Co. v. Lewellyn, 251 U. S. 501; United States v.
Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 435. The Act of February 24,
1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1126, which materially increased
the capital stock tax, made the increase retroactive to
July 1, 1918. In Hecht v. Malley, 265 U. S. 144, 164,
these retroactive provisions were held to validate taxes
erroneously assessed under an earlier act and paid before
the passage of the Act of 1919.
Except for the peculiar tax involved in Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, no federal revenue measure has ever
been held invalid on the score of retroactivity. The need
of the Government for revenue has hitherto been deemed
a sufficient justification for making a tax measure retroactive whenever the imposition seemed consonant with
justice and the conditions were not such as would ordinarily involve hardship. On this broad ground rest the
cases in which a special assessment upon real estate has
been upheld although the benefit resulting from the improvement had been enjoyed and the cost thereof had
been paid prior to any legislation attempting to authorize

the assessment, Wagner v. Baltimore, 239 U. S. 207; also
the cases in which special assessments upon real estate
have been upheld although the benefit had been conferred
and the cost thereof had been paid before there was a
valid authorization either of the improvement or of the
assessment. Compare Charlotte Harbor & Northern Ry.
Co. v. Welles, 260 U. S. 8. Such retroactive legislation
has been sustained, although the validating statute was
not enacted until after the property benefited had passed
to a bona fide purchaser without notice of any claim that
it had been, or might be, assessed for a benefit. Seattle v.
Kelleher, 195 U. S. 351. Compare Citizens NationalBank
v. Kentucky, 217 U. S.443, 454. The right of the Philippine Government to retain import and export duties laid
and collected without authority, was sustained where
thereafter Congress by retroactive legislation confirmed
the unlawful action in collecting the duties. United
States v. Heinszen & Co., 206 U. S. 370; Rafferty v. Smith,
Bell & Co., 257 U. S.226. Liability for taxes under retroactive legislation has been "one of the notorious incidents
of social life." Seattle v. Kelleher, 195 U. S. 351, 360.
Recently this Court recognized broadly that "a tax may
be imposed in respect of past benefits." Forbes Boat
Line v. Board of Commissioners, 258 U. S. 338, 339.
The Act with which we are here concerned had, however, a special justification for retroactive features. The
gift tax was imposed largely to prevent evasion of the
estate tax by gifts inter vivos, and evasion of the income
tax by the splitting up of fortunes and the consequent
diminution of surtaxes. If, as is thought by the Court,
Congress intended the gift tax to apply to all gifts during
the calendar year, its purpose may well have been to prevent evasion of the gift tax itself, by the making of gifts
after its introduction and prior to its passage. Is Congress powerless to prevent such evasion by the vigilant

UNTERMYER v. ANDERSON.

J., dissenting.

and ingenious? This Court has often recognized that a
measure may be valid as a necessary adjunct to a matter
that lies within legislative power, even though, standing
alone, its constitutionality might have been subject to
doubt. Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192; Ruppert v. Caffey, 251 U. S. 264, 289; Everard's Breweries y.
Day, 265 U. S. 545, 560. If the legislature may prohibit
the sale of confessedly innocent articles in order to insure
the effective prohibition of others, I see no reason why it
may not spread a tax over a period in advance of its enactment sufficiently long to insure that the tax will not be
evaded by anticipating the passage of the act. Compare
United States v. Doremus, 249 U. S. 86, 94. In taxation,
as well as in other matters, "the law allows a penumbra
to be embraced that goes beyond the outline of its object
in order that the object may be secured." See Mr. Justice
Holmes, in Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 230, 241.
Under the rule now applied, even a measure framed to
prevent evasion of a tax from a date when it is practically
certain that the act will become law, is deemed unreasonable and arbitrary.
The problem of preventing loss of revenue by transactions intervening between the date when legislation is
introduced and its final enactment, is not a new one; nor
is it one peculiar to the gift tax. Other nations have met
it by a method similar to that which the Court holds to
be denied to Congress. England long ago adopted the
practice of making customs and excise duties retroactive
to the beginning of the fiscal year or to the date when the
government's resolutions were agreed to by the House of
2
Commons sitting as a Committee of Ways and Means
practice applies not only to tariff and excise measures, but
to all kinds of impositions. For examples of the practice, compare:

A similar practice prevails in Ireland,' in all lhe selfgoverning Dominions,' and to some extent in France and
Italy.5 In the United States, retroactive operation of
the tariff has been repeatedly recommended by the Tariff
Commission and by the Secretary of Commerce.' Legislation to that end was reported by the Committee on Ways
and Means of the House of Representatives." No suggestion seems to have been made that such legislation
would by its retroactive feature violate the due process

The proposed taxes are provisionally collected from the date of the
resolution of the House of Commons. As to customs and excises this
is said to have rested on ancient usage. Highmore, The Customs
Laws, 3d ed., 61; May, Parliamentary Practice, 11th ed., 589. In
Bowles v. Bank of England, [1913] 1 Ch. 57, it was held that until
the passage of the Finance Act a tax-payer was under no legal obligation to pay the sum provisionally assessed as income tax by the
Treasury. By the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 3 Geo. 5, c. 3,
a resolution of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of
Commons relative to the imposition of any tax and declaring it to be
in the public interest that the resolution should have statutory effect,
is given the same force as an act of Parliament, provisional on the
final enactment of the tax.

J., dissenting.

For nearly a century after the adoption of the Constitution, this Court approached with great reluctance the
exercise of its high prerogative of declaring invalid an act
of Congress. In Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 270,
it said with respect to a state statute: "It is but a decent
respect due to the wisdom, the integrity, and the patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed,
to presume in favour of its validity, until its violation
of the constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt."
In the Sinking Fund Cases, 99 U. S. 700, 718, this Court
May 19, 1926; (c) as to Australia, amendment to the tariff effective
provisionally on November 25, 1927, and not yet finally approved;
(d) as to New Zealand, Act of October 25, 1927, giving the force of
law to all resolutions purporting to impose customs duties passed by
the House of Representatives on or after September 13, 1927; (e) as
to the Union of South Africa, motion of the Minister of Finance,
April 5, 1926, "that, subject to an Act to be passed during the present
session of Parliament, and to such rebates or remissions of duty as
may be provided for therein, the customs duties on the articles as
set forth in the accompanying Schedule be increased to the extent

shown therein." This motion was embodied in Act No. 34, published
in the Union Gazette Extraordinary of June 9, 1926.

the House of Representatives, April 16, 1917. The recommendation
has been repeated in the Annual Reports of the Commission: First

Annual Report, 1920, p. 6; Sixth Annual Report, 1922, p. 8. The
Secretary of Commerce made a similar recommendation in a letter of
May 10, 1921, to the Chaiman of the Ways and Means Committee.

said with respect to an act of Congress: "Every possible
presumption is in favor of the validity of a statute, and

this continues until the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt. One branch of the government cannot
encroach on the domain of another without danger. The
safety of our institutions depends in no small degree on
a strict observance of this salutary rule." The presumption in favor of the validity of an act of Congress, often
adverted to, has been acted upon as recently as The
Assigned Car Cases, 274 U. S. 564; and Hampton, Jr., &
Co. v. United States, ante, p. 394. The presumption should
be particularly strong where, as here, the objection to an
act arises not from a specific limitation or prohibition on
Congressional power but only out of the "vague contours
of the Fifth Amendment, prohibiting the depriving any
person of liberty or property without due process of law,"
MR. 'JUSTICE HOLMES, in Adkins v. Children's Hospital,
261 U. S. 525, 568. I find no reason for thinking that
the presumption has been overcome.

NINTH CIRCUIT.

Nos. 146 and 173.

Argued January 6, 1928.-Decided April 9, 1928.

In fine, clear weather, on a smooth, open sea, the Newport, an iron
passenger steamer, proceeding eastward at nine knots, rammed the
port side of the Svea, a wooden steam schooner, steaming northward at eight knots. They had been approaching each other in
full view for more than half an hour. Twenty minutes before the
collision, the master of the Newport quitted the bridge, leaving an
