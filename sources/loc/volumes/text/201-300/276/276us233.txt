HELLMICH v. HELLMAN.
226

Syllabus.

person in charge of the vehicle is convicted of the unlawful
possession incidental to the transportation, as well as
where he is convicted of the unlawful transportation itself.
Therefore, under the doctrine of the Port Gardner Co.
case, the disposition of the car under § 26 becoming
mandatory after Campbell's conviction "and being inconsistent with the disposition under § 3450, necessarily precluded resort to a proceeding under the latter section."
This renders it unnecessary to consider whether, if
Campbell had not been convicted of the unlawful possession, the Government's voluntary dismissal of the charge
of unlawful transportation, before trial, would likewise
have precluded a resort to § 3450.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed;
and the cause will be remanded to the District Court with
instructions to dismiss the libel.
Reversed.

MR. JUSTICE SANFORD

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The two Hellmans brought these suits against the Collector to recover additional income taxes assessed against
them for the year 1919, under Title II of the Revenue
Act of 1918,1 and paid under protest. They recovered
judgments in the District Court, which were affirmed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals. 18 F. (2d) 239 and 244.
The question here is whether the gains realized by
stockholders from the amounts distributed in the liquidation of the assets of a dissolved corporation, out of its
earnings or profits accumulated since February 28, 1913,
were taxable to them as other "gains or profits," or
whether the amounts so distributed were "dividends"
exempt from the normal tax.
Sec. 201 (a) of the Act defined the term "dividend" as
"any distribution made by a corporation . . to its shareholders . . , whether in cash or in other property . . ,
out of its earnings or profits accumulated since February
28, 1913 . . " Sec. 201 (c) provided that: "Amounts dis140 Stat. 1057, 1058, c. 18.

Opinion of the Court.

tributed in the liquidation of a corporation shall be treated
as payments in exchange for stock or shares, and any gain
or profit realized thereby shall be taxed to the distributee
as other gains or profits." Sec. 216(a) provided that for
the purpose of determining the "normal tax" upon the
net income of an individual (§ 210), there should be allowed as a credit the "amount received as dividends from
a corporation which is taxable . .upon its net income."
Treasury Regulations 45, which were promulgated under the Act, stated on the one hand, in Art. 1541, that for
the purpose of the statute "dividends" comprise distributions made by a corporation to its stockholders "in the
ordinary course of business, even though extraordinary in
amount;" and, on the other hand, in Art. 1548, that: "Socalled liquidation or dissolution dividends are not dividends within the meaning of the statute, and amounts so
distributed, whether or not including any surplus earned
since February 28, 1913, are to be regarded as payments
for the stock of the dissolved corporations. Any excess so
received over the cost of his stock to the stockholder, or
over its fair market value as of March 1, 1913, if acquired
prior thereto, is a taxable profit. A distribution in liquidation of the assets and business of a corporation, which
is a return to the stockholder of the value of his stock
upon a surrender of his interest in the corporation, is distinguishable from a dividend paid by a going corporation
out of current earnings or accumulated surplus when declared by the directors in their discretion, which is in the
nature of a recurrent return upon the stock." 2

These

Regulations, with a change made in 1921 as to the second
sentence of Art. 1548,8are still in effect so far as distributions in liquidation under the Act are concerned.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

276 U. S.

Each of the Hellmans owned one-half of the capital
stock of a corporation which had a net surplus of $46,466.27, of which at least $31,545.58 consisted of earnings
and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913. In
1919, the corporation was dissolved and liquidated and its
assets were distributed to the stockholders. In this liquidation each of the Hellmans realized a gain of $15,004.55
in the distribution made out of the earnings and profits
accumulated since February 28, 1913. Each in his income tax return claimed that this was a "dividend"
which under § 216(a) was to be credited on his net income
for the purpose of the normal tax. The Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, ruling these were gains subject to the
normal tax, disallowed the claims and made the additional
assessments here involved.
The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case

is in direct conflict with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Langstaff v. Lucas (C. C. A.)
13 F. (2d) 1022.
The controlling question is whether the amounts distributed to the stockholders out of the earnings and profits
accumulated by the corporation since February 28, 1913,
were to be treated under § 201(a) as "dividends," which
were exempt from the normal tax; or, under § 201(c) as
payments made by the corporation in exchange for its
stock, which were taxable "as other gains or profits."
It is true that if § 201(a) stood alone its broad definition of the term "dividend" would apparently include
distributions made to stockholders in the liquidation of a
However, if such stock was acquired prior to March 1, 1913, and the
fair market value as of such date was greater than the cost but less
than the amount so distributed, the taxable income is the excess over
such fair market value of the amount received, but no gain is recognized if the amount received, although more than cost, is less than
the fair market value of the stock on March 1, 1913." 23 Treas. Dec.
Int. Rev., 763, 769.

corporation-although this term, as generally understood
and used, refers to the recurrent return upon stock paid
to stockholders by a going corporation in the ordinary
course of business, which does not reduce their stock holdings and leaves them in a position to enjoy future returns
upon the same stock. See Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S.
339, 344-346; and Langstaff v. Lucas (D. C.) 9 F. (2d)
691, 694.
However, when § 201(a) and § 201(c) are read together,
under the long-established rule that the intention of the
lawmaker is to be deduced from a view of every material
part of the statute, Kohlsaat v. Murphy, 96 U. S. 153, 159,
we think it clear that the general definition of a dividend
in § 201(a) was not intended to apply to distributions
made to stockholders in the liquidation of a corporation,
but that it was intended that such distributions should be
governed by § 201(c), which, dealing specifically with
such liquidation, provided that the amounts distributed
should "be treated as payments in exchange for stock"
and that any gain realized thereby should be taxed to the
stockholders "as other gains or profits." This brings the
two sections into entire harmony, and gives to each its
natural meaning and due effect. The Treasury Regulafions correctly interpreted the Act as making § 201(a)
applicable to a distribution made by a going corporation
to its stockholders in the ordinary course of business, and
§ 201(c) applicable to a distribution made to stockholders
in liquidation of the corporation. And this is in accord
with the rulings of the Board of Tax Appeals. Appeal of
Greenwood, 1 B. T. A. 291, 295; Appeal of Chandler,
3 B. T. A. 146, 149.
, The gains realized by the stockholders from the distribution of the assets in liquidation were subject to the normal
tax in like manner as if they had sold their stock to third
persons. The objection that this results in double taxation of the accumulated earnings and profits is no more

available in the one case than it would have been in the
other. See Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanki, 255 U. S.

Congress has clearly expressed its intention, the statute
must be sustained even though double taxation results.
