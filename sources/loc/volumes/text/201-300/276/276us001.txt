SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
DELAWARE, LACKAWANNA AND WESTERN
RAILROAD COMPANY v. RELLSTAB.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 141.

Argued January 5, 1928.-Decided January 16, 1928.

1. The power of the District Court to set aside its judgment because
of perjured testimony ends with the term in which the judgment
was entered. P. 4.
2. The Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction, by mandamus, to
require the reinstatement of a judgment of the District Court which
it has affirmed and which the District Court, without jurisdiction,
has afterwards assumed to set aside for perjury. P. 5.
3. Mandamus to enforce a judgment should not be refused on the
ground of injustice, where the judgment has become unassailable
and the injustice depends on a speculation as to which of three conflicting statements of a witness-a confessed perjurer-was true.
P. 5.
15 F. (2d) 137, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 273 U. S. 685, to a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals which refused to grant a writ of mandamus requiring the District Court to reinstate a judgment which it had assumed to set aside. The judgment
was one recovered by the above named petitioner as
defendant in an action for personal injuries, etc. See
also 296 Fed. 439.

Argument for Respondent.

276 U. S.

Mr. M. M. Stallman, with whom Mr. FredericB. Scott
was on the brief, for petitioner.
The District Court had no power to set aside the judgment more than four terms after it was entered. Cameron
v. McRoberts, 3 Wheat. 591; Bronson v. Schulten, 104
U. S. 410; Phillips v. Negley, 117 U. S. 665; In re Metropolitan Trust Co., 218 U. S. 312. See also 11 Rose's Notes,
U. S. Reports, 551, et seq.; Wetmore v. Karrick, 205 U. S.
141.
The acts for which a court will, on account of fraud,
annul a judgment between the same parties after the term
is ended, have relation to frauds extrinsic or collateral to
the matter tried, and not to a fraud in the matter upon
which the judgment was rendered. United States v.
Throckmorton, 98 U. S. 61; Vance v. Burbank, 101 U. S.
514; Nelson v. Meehan, 155 Fed. 1.
Mandamus was the appropriate remedy. Ex Parte
Crane, 5 Pet. 190; McClelland v. Carland,217 U. S. 268;
United States v. Mayer, 235 U. S. 55; Life Ins. Co. v. Wilson, 8 Pet. 291; Ex Parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364; In re
Pollitz, 206 U. S. 323; Ex Parte Nebraska, 209 U. S. 436;
In re' Winn, 213 U. S. 458; In re Metropolitan Trust Co.,
218 U. S. 312.
The Circuit Court of Appeals had appellate jurisdiction
to issue a mandamus because the lower court's action was
an interference with its mandate. Southard et al. v. Russell, 16 How. 547; In re Potts, 166 U. S. 263; McClelland
v. Carland,217 U. S. 268; Spiller v. Atchison, T. & S. F.
Ry. Co., 253 U. S. 117. See also Simmons Co. v. Grier
Bros. Co., 258 U. S. 82.
Mr. Harry Kalisch for respondent.
The writ of mandamus cannot be used as a writ of
error. Ex Parte Loring, 94 U. S. 165; Ex Parte Railway
Co., 103 U. S. 794; Ex Parte Hoard, 105 U. S. 578; Ameri-

can Con. Co. v. Jacksonville Co., 148 U. S. 379; 25 C. J.
860.
The Circuit Court of Appeals is a statutory court and
its authority to grant writs must be found in the statute,
if it exists. Mandamus in this case was not necessary for
the exercise of that court's jurisdiction, which is only
appellate.
The Circuit Court of Appeals can only review final
decisions. Ft. Dodge Cement Corp'n v. Monk, 276 Fed.
113. See also 11 Cyc. p. 941; Kingman & Co. v. Western
Mfg. Co., 170 U. S. 675; Bostwich v. Brinkerhoif, 106
U. S. 73; Gibbons v. Ogden, 6 Wheat. 448; Mayberry v.
Thompson, 5 How. 121.
Mandamus should not issue unless there has been a
definite, unqualified refusal to act by the inferior court,
after request. Mesler v. Jackson, 188 Mich. 195; Hitch
cock v. Wayne, 97 Mich. 614;, Freud v. Wayne, 131 Mich.
109; Bennett v. Kalamazoo, 181 Mich. 700; Short on
Mandamus, p. 247, 267; 38 C. J., p. 592.
The granting or refusing of the writ is discretionary.
Duncan Townsite Co. v. Lane, 245 U. S. 308; U. S. v.
Cargill, 258 Fed. 467; U. S. v. Burleson, 258 Fed. 282;
Arant v. Lane, 249 U. S. 367; Wood v. Assessors, 137 N. Y.
203.
The fraud or perjury is a conceded fact in the case.
Mandamus should not be allowed to promote a manifest
injustice.
It was discretionary with the Circuit Court of Appeals
to require the petitioner to have the order of the District
Court reviewed by a writ of error or an appeal, rather
than by writ of mandamus. Brictson Mfg. Co. v. Munger, 20 F. (2d) 793.
The basis of petitioner's application in the Circuit
Court of Appeals was not the protection of the mandate
of that court, but the granting of a new trial after the
term at which it was rendered had expired.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

276 U. S.

MR. JusTice. HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case one Ginsberg, in December, 1921, recovered
judgment in the District Court against the petitioner for
injuries to himself and a minor son and for the death
of another son, caused by a collision, at a crossing, between
the plaintiff's truck and one of the petitioner's trains.
The judgment afterwards was set aside on the evidence of
two important witnesses, husband and wife, that they had
committed perjury at the trial. A new trial was had
which resulted in a judgment for the defendant, the present petitioner. The judgment was entered on June 21,
1923. It was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals on
writ of error and on March 21, 1924, a mandate from that
court affirmed the judgment with costs. See 296 Fed. 439.
The witnesses who had testified for the plaintiff at the
first trial testified for the defendant at the second, and
fter the term of the District Court in which the foregoing
steps had been taken had expired without being extended
in any form, the husband made an affidavit showing that
his testimony at both trials was false and that in fact
he knew nothing about the matter. The trial Judge. was
applied to, and after hearing testimony in open court he
made an order on May 9, 1925, purporting to set aside
the judgment that had been affirmed by the Circuit Court
of Appeals during a previous unextended term. The petitioner thereupon applied to the Circuit Court of Appeals
for a writ of mandamus to reinstate the judgment, but
the Circuit Court of Appeals held that .it had no jurisdiction to grant the writ, 15 F. (2d) 137. A writ of certiorari
was granted by this Court. 273 U. S. 685.
However strong may have been the convictions of the
District Judge that injustice would be done by enforcing
the judgment, he could not set it aside on the ground that
the testimony of admitted perjurers was perjured also at

D., L. & W. R. R. v. RELLSTAB.

Opinion of the Court.

the second trial. The power of the Court to set aside its
judgment on this ground ended with the term. In re
Metropolitan Trust Co., 218 U. S. 312, 320. As the Court
was without jurisdiction to vacate the judgment, mandamus is the appropriate remedy unless to grant that writ is
beyond the power of the Circuit Court of Appeals. In re
Metropolitan Trust Co., 218 U. S. 312, 321. We perceive
no reason to doubt the power of that Court. It had
affirmed the judgment of the Court below. Brown v.
Alton Water Co., 222 U. S. 325, 332. Like other appellate
courts (In re Potts, 166 U. S. 263,) the Circuit Court of
Appeals has power to require its judgment to be enforced
as against any obstruction that the lower Court, exceeding its jurisdiction, may interpose. McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268. The issue of a mandamus is closely
enough connected with the appellate power.
But it is said that the granting of the writ of mandamus
is discretionary and it is implied that if we are of opinion
that the Circuit Court of Appeals was mistaken in denying its power to grant the writ, that court still might
deny it on the ground that injustice would be done if the
judgment were allowed to stand. But neither Court
would be warranted in declaring the judgment unjust after
it had become unassailable--certainly not on a speculation as to which of three statements is true, when it was
known at the trial that the witness was perjured, either at
the first trial, as he said, or then-not to speak of the further difficulties that the plaintiff might encounter in the
recent decision of Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Goodman,
275 U. S. 66. It certainly would be unjust to leave the
case in the air, because the District Court had made an
unwarranted attempt to set aside a judgment that it had
no jurisdiction to touch.
It follows that the writ should issue.
Judgment reversed.
