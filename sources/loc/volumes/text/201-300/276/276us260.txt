Arms, supra, 494. For if it be assumed that we can weigh
and measure degrees of negligence and that a public service company may not by contract alone limit its liability
for gross negligence, so-called, nevertheless we may not
disregard a lawful exercise of the regulatory power which
has made no distinction between degrees of negligence,
nor may we, upon any theory of public policy, annex to
the rate as made conditions affecting its uniformity and
equality.

TRUSTEES.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS.

No. 144.

Argued January 5, 6, 1928.-Decided February 20, 1928.

1. A decision of a state court applying a state statute over the ambiguous objection that it is "unconstitutional" is reviewable here
in so far as that court interpreted the objection as based on the
Federal Constitution, and, in its opinion, sustained the statute
under that instrument. P. 267.
2. By Massachusetts Acts of 1909, c. 527, § 8, a transfer of property
passing to anyone through the failure of any person to exercise a
power of appointment, is made taxable under an Act of 1907, which
as amended, 1916, taxes property passing by gift made or intended
to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the
donor. A trust, established before the dates of these acts, when
interests piassing to children were not subject to transfer tax, gave

the income, after the settlor's death, to his children (with gifts
over), but reserved to him while living the power, with consent of
one trustee, to alter or terminate the trust. The settlor having
died while these acts were in force, without having exercised the
power, the entire interest passing to the children was held taxable
as of the date of his decease. Held:
(1) That the state court's construction of the taxing Acts as
imposing a succession tax, and of the trust instrument as creating a
power of appointment within the Act of 1909, would be accepted
by this Court. P. 269.
(2) Imposition of the tax under the statute of 1909 was consistent with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
the tax being laid, not on the donor, but on the beneficiaries, the
gifts taxed having never passed to them until after the donor's
death subsequent to the enactment of the statute, and the basis of
the tax being the value of the gifts at that operative moment.

exercised, it may be reached by a tax. P. 271.

ERROR to a judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts instructing trustees that interests of beneficiaries under a trust were subject to succession taxes.
The beneficiaries, having prayed a contrary ruling in
answer to the trustees' petition, sued out this writ of error
against their co-respondent, James Jackson, Treasurer
and Receiver General of the State, and the trustees. The
opinion below is reported sub nom. Saltonstall v. Treasurer & Receiver General.

Mr. Thomas Hunt for plaintiffs in error.
A tax which retroactively imposes a burden upon rights

already vested, as this one does, is not a reasonable form
of excise, but an arbitrary one. A "vested" interest in
remainder is one which is always ready, from its beginning

to its end, to come into possession the moment the prior
estates may determine.

These life interests were "vested" interests, which had
passed to the beneficiaries, and vested in them immediately upon the delivery of the trust deed and the trust
property. Welch v. Treasurer, 217 Mass. 348.
Besides, it is to be remembered that, by the amendment
of October 24, 1919, Peter C. Brooks' rights in the income
were terminated, finally and completely. There was no
right or interest whatever left to pass to the beneficiaries
upon his death.
All the conveyances took place prior to September 1,
1907, the date when the first tax on direct inheritances
became effective. Long before that date these Trustees
and these respondents had present vested rights to receive
certain property upon the death of certain persons.
These taxing acts, as construed by the Massachusetts
courts, now deprive them of their right to receive some
of that property, namely, the amount held to be payable
as a tax. They are deprived of that'right on the ground
that the State can impose an excise tax for its aid and
sanction in making such a transfer valid. See Keeney v.
New York, 222 U. S. 525. But if that aid had already
been freely given, without being subject to an excise,
or any other tax, at the time when the grantor and
grantees, relying upon the law as it then existed, entered into the transaction, for the legislature years afterward to attempt retroactively to exact an excise for this
"commodity" seems as unreasonable (and, therefore,
as unconstitutional) as the action of the' Florida Legislature in the case of Forbes Power Boat Line v. Board
of Commissioners, 258 U. S. 338. The weight of authority is clear to that effect. Matter of Pell, 171 N. Y.

it is open to this Court to say that the purpose of this
legislation was not sufficiently different from that of the
taxing act under consideration in Levy v. Wardell, 258
U. S. 542, to make the reasoning of the latter case
inapplicably.
In Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, the statute which,
in Levy v. Wardell, supra,had been open to two constructions, had been made, by amendment, definitely rettoactive (Act of February 24,.1919, § 402 (c)), and this Court,
consistently with its former opinion, held it unconstitutional.
It is submitted that Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142,
taken in connection with Nichols v. Coolidge, supra, is
conclusive of the present case.
Even if, by doing violence to the language of the
statute (which says--"All property . . . which shall
pass . . . by deed, grant or gift . . . shall be subject to
a tax "), it can be held that the tax is not on property, but
on that shadowy conception "the vesting of the property
in possession and enjoyment," called a "commodity,"
still the tax cannot be supported as an excise, for two
reasons:
(1) It would be the same sort of proceeding which
was held unreasonable in Frick v. Pennsylvania,268 U. S.
473, and in Nichols v. Coolidge, supra,--because "it would
open the way for easily doing indirectly what is forbidden to be done directly."
,(2) The definitions of the term "excise," which are
collected in Pattonv. Brady, 148 U. S. 608, are all similar
to Blackstone's, there quoted, which is, "An inland imposition, paid sometimes upon the consumption of the
commodity . . ."

The beneficiaries acquired, when the original transfers
were made, the right not only to the property, but also to
immediate possession and enjoyment upon the death of
Mr. Brooks; and, after that, the only thing left for the
State to tax was the actual use and enjoyment of their
own property-of what already belonged to them. Such
a tax would be, like the tax upon the income from property,-a direct tax on the property itself. Pollock v.
Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429; Houston's
Estate, 276 Pa. 330.
The State cannot, under the guise of an excise, exact a
tax for the mere physical possession or enjoyment of one's
own property when this is nothing but the exercise of a
right which the State had already given long before.
Frew v. Bowers, 12 F. (2d) 625.
One person cannot, by a will or a deed, transfer "enjoyment" or "possession" to another. Deeds and wills
deal with, and "pass" and convey, rights-legal rights,
not physical conditions.
The Massachusetts court itself has held that this excise
is a tax, not on "possession " or "enjoyment," or "coning into possession and enjoyment," but upon the right
to receive property, "the privilege of passing title."

In any event, Massachusetts has no right or power to
impose the tax, because it is not the State from which
is derived the privilege by virtue of which this property,
or an interest in this property, was acquired.
These taxing acts and taxes deny to the plaintiffs in
error the equal protection of the laws. Southern Ry. v.

466; Stebbins v. Riley, 268 U. S. 137. It will therefore
accept the decision of that court that these statutes impose an excise upon the privilege of succession, and that
such privilege of succession is not fully exercised until the
gift takes effect in possession and enjoyment. Crocker v,

enjoyment at Mr. Brooks' death on January 27, 1920,
within the meaning of St. 1916, c. 268, § 1. Even if
that question were open, it is settled adversely to plaintiffs in error. New England Trust Co. v. Abbott, 205

It is also not open to question that the trust deed confers a power of appointment, or that the partial failure
to exercise it contributed to the taking in possession and
enjoyment, and so constituted a taxable disposition. Minot
v. Treasurer,etc., 207 Mass. 588; Burnham v. Treasurer,
etc., 212 Mass. 165; Lines Estate, 155 Pa. St. 378; Manning v. Board of Comm'rs, 46 R. I. 400. See also Bullen
v. Wisconsin, 240 U. S. 625.
It is settled that a State may impose an excise upon the
privilege of the donee to succeed to the property in
possession and enjoyment upon the death of the grantor,
as well as upon the privilege of the grantor so to transfer
it. Stebbins v. Riley, 268 U. S. 137.
Moreover, the privilege of succession may be exercised
in respect to a gift by deed as well as in respect to a gift
by will. Hence a statute which imposes an excise upon
the privilege of succession before that privilege is fully
exercised by taking in enjoyment, does not impair the
obligation of contract, whether the succession takes place
by will or by deed. Carpenter v. Penna., 17 How. 456;
Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278; Chanlerv. Kelsey, 205 U. S.
466; Moffitt v. Kelly, 218 U. S. 400; Nickel v. Cole, 256
U. S. 222. See also, Corry v. Mayor etc. of Baltimore, 196
U. S. 466.
So also a statute imposing a succession tax, which is
passed before the privilege of succession is fully exercised
by taking in enjoyment at the grantor's death, does not
take the donee's property without due process of law or
deny to the donee the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. Orr v. Gilman,
183 U. S. 278; Cahen v. Brewster, 203 U. S. 543; Chanler

MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Plaintiffs in error are beneficiaries of a trust created by
deed of Peter C. Brooks. After the death of the settlor
the trustees, who, with certain Massachusetts tax officials,
are defendants in error, filed in the Supreme Judicial
Court of Massachusetts a petition for instructions which
joined the beneficiaries of the trust and the officials as
respondents, and asked a determination that the Massachusetts statutes taxing inheritances did not affect the
property passing to the beneficiaries under the trust, or,
if applicable, were "unconstitutional." The beneficiaries
joined in the prayer of the bill and it was opposed by the
state officials. The Supreme Judicial Court held the taxing acts applicable and valid. We may disregard the
ambiguity of the trustees' contention below that the statutes were "unconstitutional," in so far as the state court
understood that the federal Constitution was the basis for
the objection and in its opinion sustained the statutes*
under that instrument. Cissna v. Tennessee, 246 U. S.

289; compare Miedreich v. Lauenstein, 232 U. S. 236. To
that extent the case is properly here on writ of error.
Jud. Code § 237(a).
In brief and argument here plaintiffs in error have
stated various constitutional objections to the taxing acts.
But as on the record none of them before the Supreme
Judicial Court appear to have been based on the federal
Constitution, we consider only the single objection discussed as a federal question by that court in its opinion,
viz., that the statutes as applied deprive plaintiffs in error
of their property without due process of law because retroactive as to them.
On various dates between 1905 and 1907, Peter C.
Brooks by indenture transferred to the trustees, defendants in error, or their predecessors, certain property upon
trust, to pay the income to him for life or, at his option,
to allow it to accumulate, and upon the death of himself
and his wife to pay the income to his children, the plaintiffs in error, without any liability for their debts and
without power of alienation or anticipation; with gifts
over.
The trust instrument provided that its terms might be
changed and the trust terminated in whole or in part by
Peter C. Brooks, with the concurrence of one trustee. Before his death, on January 27, 1920, the trust was in fact
thrice altered, the last time in 1919 by providing that
during the life of Peter C. Brooks the income should be
accumulated and added to the principal, so that from that
date his interest in the trust was terminated, except for
the power with one trustee to alter or terminate it.
At the time of the several transfers there were no
Massachusetts statutes imposing an inheritance or transfer tax upon property passing to children, but before the
death of Peter C. Brooks the statutes now assailed were
enacted. By Mass. Acts 1909, c. 527, .§ 8, printed in the

SALTONSTALL v. SALTONSTALL.

Opinion of the Court.

margin,' the transfer of property passing to anyone on
the exercise of a power of appointment or the failure to
exercise it is made taxable as though a disposition or transfer of property taxable under the provisions of the statute
taxing inheritances, Mass. Acts 1907, c. 563.
Mass. Acts 1916, c. 268, § 1, amending Mass. Acts 1907,
c. 563, § 1, as amended, imposes a tax on all property passing by will, intestate succession, or gift "made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the
death of the grantor or donor." By § 4 of this act the
tax is made applicable only to property or interests therein
"passing or accruing upon the death of persons who die
subsequently to the passage hereof."
In this and earlier cases the Massachusetts court has
held that the tax authorized by these statutes is a tax upon
"succession" which includes the "privileges enjoyed by
the beneficiary of succeeding to the possession and enjoyment of property." See Attorney General v. Stone,
209 Mass. 186, 190; Minot v. Winthrop, 162 Mass. 113,
124; Crocker v. Shaw, 174 Mass. 266, 267. It has held
"Section 8. Whenever any person shall exercise a power of appointment derived from any disposition of property made prior to
September first, nineteen hundred and seven, such appointment when
made shall be deemed to be a disposition of property by the person
exercising such power, taxable under the provisions of chapter five
hundred and sixty-three of the acts of the year nineteen hundred and
seven, and of all acts in amendment thereof and in addition thereto,
in the same manner as though the property to which such appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of such power, and had
been bequeathed or devised by the donee by will; and whenever any
person possessing such a power of appointment so derived shall omit
or fail to exercise the same within the time provided therefor, in
whole or in part, a disposition of property taxable under the provisions of chapter five hundred and sixty-three of the acts of the year
nineteen hundred and seven and all acts in amendment thereof and
in addition thereto shall be deemed to take place to the extent of such
omission or failure

also that the provisions of the trust instrument for change
or termination of the trust by Peter C. Brooks with the
consent of one trustee created a power of appointment
within the meaning of Mass. Acts 1909, c. 527, § 8, and
that the nonexercise of the reserved power in Brooks' lifetime as well as the fact that the interest of the beneficiaries took effect "in possession or enjoyment" after his
death within the meaning of Mass. Acts 1916, c. 268, § 1,
required the imposition of the tax as of the date of his
death upon the entire interest in the trust passing to the
plaintiffs in error. This construction of the statutes by
the state court we accept, Stebbins v. Riley, 268 U. S.
137; Chanler v. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466, 477, as we do its
construction of the trust deed. Nickel v. Cole, 256 U. S.
222, 225; Moffitt v. Kelly, 218 U. S. 400.
The plaintiffs in error contend that as interpreted the
statutes deprive them of property without due process
because they are taxed on an interest they had already
received before the enactment of the taxing acts. It is
said that they had vested interests or remainders subject
only to being divested by the exercise of the reserved
power, which never happened; that as their remainders
vested before the enactment of the taxing statutes these
cannot constitutionally be applied to them under the rule
laid down by this Court in Nichols v. Coolidge, 274
U. S. 531.
In Nichols v. Coolidge it was held that under the estate
tax sections of the Revenue Act of 1919-which tax the
privilege of transmission, Nichols v. Coolidge, supra; New
York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345-property of
which a donor had made an outright conveyance several
years before the enactment of the statute could not, on his
death after its enactment, be included as part of his taxable gross estate at its value at the time of his death. But
we are here concerned, not with a tax on the privilege of

SALTONSTALL v. SALTONSTALL.
260

Opinion of the Court.

transmission, not with an attempt to tax a donor's estate
for an absolute gift made when no tax was thought of,
and to do so at the probably appreciated valu6 which the
gift now bears, but with a tax on the privilege of succession, which also may constitutionally be subjected to a
tax by the state whether occasioned by death, Stebbins
v. Riley, supra,or effected by deed, Keeney v. New York,
222 U. S. 525; Chanler v. Kelsey, supra; Nickel v. Cole,
supra. The present tax is not laid on the donor, but on
the beneficiary; the gift taxed is not one long since completed, but one which never passed to the beneficiaries
beyond recall until the death of the donor; and the value
of the gift at that operative moment, rather than at some
later date, is the basis of the tax.
So long as the privilege of succession has not been
fully exercised it may be reached by the tax. See Cahen
v. Brewster, 203 U. S. 543; Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278;
Chanler v. Kelsey, supra; Moffitt v. Kelly, supra; Nickel
v. Cole, supra. And in determining whether it has been
so exercised technical distinctions between vested remainders and other interests are of little avail, for the
shifting of the economic benefits and burdens of property,
which is the subject of a succession tax, may even in the
case of a vested remainder be restricted or suspended by
other legal devices. A power of appointment reserved by
the donor leaves the transfer, as to him, incomplete and
subject to tax. Bullen v. Wisconsin, 240 U. S. 625. The
beneficiary's acquisition of the property is equally incomplete whether the power be reserved to the donor or
another. And so the property passing to the beneficiaries
here was acquired only because of default in the exercise
of the power during the donor's life and thus was on his
death subject to the state's power to tax as an inheritance.
Without considering the other statutes involved, we
need not go further than to say that the statute of 1909,

272

imposing the tax because of the failure to exercise the
power of appointment, does not deprive plaintiffs in error
of their property without due process of law.
Affirmed.
MILLER ET AL. v. SCHOENE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA.

No. 199. Argued January 20, 1928.-Decided February 20, 1928.
1. An Act of Virginia provides, compulsorily, for the cutting down of
red cedar trees 'within two miles of any apple orchard when found
upon official investigation to be the source or "host plant" of the
communicable plant disease called cedar rust and to " constitute
a menace to the health of any apple orchard in said locality" The
owner is allowed a judicial review of the order of the State Entomologist directing such cutting, and may use the trees when cut,
but no compensation is allowed him for their value standing or for
decrease in market value of the realty caused by their destruction.
The evidence shows that the life cycle of the parasite has two
phases, passed alternately on the cedar and the apple; that it is
without effect on the value of the cedar, but destructive of the
leaves and fruit of the apple; that it is communicable by spores
from the cedar to the apple over a radius of at least two miles;
that the only practicable method of controlling it is destruction of
all red cedar trees within that distance of apple orchards; and
that the economic value of cedars in Virginia is small as compared
with that of the apple orchards.
Held, that the Act is consistent with the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 277.
2. When forced to make the choice, the State does not exceed its
constitutional powers by deciding upon the destruction of one class
of property in order to save another which, in the judgment of the
legislature, is of greater value to the public. P. 279.
3. Preferment of the public interest, even to the extent of destroying
property interests of the individual, is one of the distinguishing
characteristics of every exercise of the police power which affects
property. P. 280.
