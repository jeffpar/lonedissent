tion of the restricted period. There were also allotments
on behalf of allottees dying before allotment which in
the hands of their heirs were unrestricted. See Tiger v.
Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286. It cannot be
assumed that Congress at a time when it was withdrawing allotted lands from their former exemption in order
that Indian citizens might assume the just burdens of
state taxation, intended to extend a tax exemption by
implication. In any case the Secretary of the Interior
has never, by rule or regulation or other action, purported to exempt such lands from state taxation. No
such action is to be implied from his authorized action in
restricting the power of the Indian grantee to alienate
the land. See United States v. Ransom, supra; 'United

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 341. Argued March 7, 1928.-Decided April 9, 1928.
1. Under the Revenue Act of 1918, § 215, (a), 5, the devotion of a
house theretofore purchased and used as the taxpayer's residence,
exclusively to the production of taxable income in the form of
rentals, is a "transaction entered into for profit" as of the date
when the change was made; and when such change occurred
before March 1, 1913, and the new use continued until the property was sold at a loss after the date of the Act, the amount of
loss deductible in computing net income is the difference between
the sale price and the value of the property on the date of the
change, or, if that value be larger than the March 1, 1913, value,
then the difference between the sale price and the value on March
1, 1913. P. 585.

CERTIORARI, 275 U. S. 514, to a

judgment of the Circuit

Court of Appeals, which reversed a judgment for the
Collector in an action to recover money paid as income
taxes.
Mr. Gardner P. Lloyd, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell was
on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. James Walton, with whom Mr. Clarence A. Miller was on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

Before 1892 the late Philander C. Knox built a dwelling
house in Pittsburgh, at a total cost for land and buildings
of $172,000. He occupied the house as a residence until
1901 when, circumstances requiring his residence elsewhere, he leased the property at a stipulated rental. He
continued so to lease it from October 1st in that year
until 1920, when it was sold for $73,000. The fair market
value of the property on March 1, 1913, was $120,000.
Its value in 1901 does not appear. In his income tax
return for 1920 he deducted from gross income the difference between the selling price of the property and its
March 1, 1913, value, less depreciation from that date to
the date of sale. The commissioner disallowed the deduction and assessed a correspondingly increased tax,
which was paid under protest. The present suit was
brought in the district court for western Pennsylvania to
recover the additional tax assessed. The trial was to
the court, a jury having been waived by written stipulation. Judgment was given for the collector, 17 F. (2d)
522, which was reversed by the circuit court of appeals
for the third circuit. 18 F. (2d) 452.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

276 U.S.

The tax was assessed under the Revenue Act of 1918, c.
18, 40 Stat. 1057. Section 214 specifies deductions which
may be made from gross income in computing the tax
and sub-section (a) 5 permits the deduction of "losses
sustained during the taxable year and not compensated
for by insurance or otherwise, if incurred in any transaction entered into for profit, though not connected with
the trade or business." Section 215 provides that "in
computing net income no deduction shall in any case
be allowed in respect of (a) personal, living, or family
expenses." Treasury Regulations 45, promulgated April
17, 1919, and in force during 1920, provide: "Art.
141 . . . A loss in the sale of an individual's residence is not deductible." This was amended on January
28, 1921, to read: "
.
A loss in the sale of residential property is not deductible unless the property
was purchased or constructed by the taxpayer with a
view to its subsequent sale for pecuniary. profit." This
regulation has remained unchanged under the Revenue
Acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926. See Art. 141 of Regulations 62, Regulations 65 and Regulations 69.
That the exchange value of a dwelling house may increase or diminish is a consideration not usually overlooked by one who purchases it for residential purposes,
but the quoted Regulations appear to assume that the
acquisition of such property cannot be a transaction for
profit within the meaning of sub-section (a)5 of § 214,
if the dominating purpose of it is the use of the property
for a home. The correctness of that view is not before
us, for there is no finding that the taxpayer built his
dwelling with any hope or expectation of profit. See
Appeal of D'Oench, 3 B. T. A. 24.
But the findings amply support the view of the court
of appeals that the purpose to use the property as a residence of the taxpayer came to an end when it was leased

Opinion of the Court.

in 1901, and that from that date until it was sold nineteen
years later it was devoted exclusively to the production
of a profit in the form of net rentals. It is not questioned
that if in 1901 the property had been purchased for that
use or inherited and so used the loss might have been deducted, but it is said, as the district court held, that the
only transaction entered into with respect to the property
was the purchase of the land and the erection of the
house, regardless of the use which might afterwards be
made of it, and that these acts did not appear to be a
transaction entered into for profit.
But the words "any transaction" as used in sub-section (a) 5 are not a technical phrase or one of art. They
must therefore be taken in their usual sense and, so taken,
they are, we think, broad enough to embrace at least any
action or business operation, such as that with which we
are now concerned, by which property previously acquired is devoted exclusively to the production of taxable
income. We can perceive no reason why they should not
be so taken unless that construction is inconsistent with
the purpose or with particular provisions of the Act.
Section 214, read as a whole, discloses plainly a general
purpose to permit deductions of capital losses wherever
the capital investment is used to produce taxable income, and the inclusion of the present deduction in those
described in sub-section (a)5 would seem to be entirely
harmonious with that purpose.
But it is pointed out that § 202 of the Revenue Act of
1918, prescribing the method of computing gain or loss
upon the sale of property, makes value as of March 1,
1913, or cost if acquired later, the basis of the computation. It is said that this is inconsistent with the use of
the market value of the property at the date of rental as
the basis of the computation, which would be necessary if
the construction contended for were given to sub-section

(a)5, and that in any case a computation on that basis
would involve administrative difficulties in determining
the value, which should lead to a different interpretation.
But it is obvious that § 202 is not all inclusive. The
same and no greater inconsistency and difficulty arise in
the case of property acquired by gift, bequest or devise,
when market value at the time of acquisition by the
donee and not cost is necessarily the basis of computing
the tax. That in such cases the difference between the
sale price and market value at the date of acquisition, if
after March 1, 1913, is deductible under sub-section (a)5,
is not questioned. The ascertainment of market value
of the property at that date would not seem to involve
any greater administrative difficulty than the ascertainment of market value on March 1, 1913. Section 202
itself provides that in the case of exchange the property
shall be taken at this fair market value, and under the
Act of 1918 this was likewise provided for in the case
of property acquired by gift, devise or bequest, by Regulations 45, Art. 1562, which was incorporated in the later
acts. Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, § 202
(a)2; Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, § 204
(a)2; Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, § 204 (a)2.
For the purpose of computing the loss resulting from
this particular transaction we think it must stand on the
same footing as losses resulting from a similar use of
property acquired by gift or devise and that whenever
needful the fair value of the property at the time when
the transaction for profit was entered into may be taken
as the basis for computing the loss.
Article 141 of the Regulations presents no necessary
inconsistency with the construction of § 214(a) 5, contended for by the respondent. The article both in its
original and in its amended form obviously refers to the

Opinion of the Court.

sale of residential property of the taxpayer, that is to
say, property used by him as a residence up to the time
of the sale. Only if that is its meaning can it be reconciled with the Treasury rulings that losses on the sale of
residential property acquired by gift, devise or bequest
and devoted to rental purposes may be deducted. The
loss here has resulted from the sale of property not used
for residential purposes by the taxpayer, and the transaction entered into for profit and resulting in the loss was
not the purchase of the property but its appropriation
to rental purposes. The article of the Regulations by its
terms has no application to a loss so incurred.
The findings show that the property was sold for less
than its cost and the loss deducted was the difference
between its March 1, 1913, value and the sale price.
The only loss deductible here under sub-section (a)5 is
one incurred in a transaction entered into for profit, later
than the date of purchase. For all that appears from
the findings the loss which had occurred between the
date of purchase and March 1, 1913, may have occurred
before the property was devoted to rental purposes. For
that reason the findings do not support the judgment.
The cause should be remanded for a new trial so that
the value of the property as of October 1, 1901, when
rented, may be found. If that value is larger than the
value of March 1, 1913, the deduction made below should
be allowed; if less, only the difference, if any, between
'its then value and the sale price should be allowed. See
United States v. Flannery, 268 U. S. 98; McCaughn v.
Ludington, 268 U. S. 106.
