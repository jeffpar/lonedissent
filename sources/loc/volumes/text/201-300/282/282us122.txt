HOPKINS v. BACON.
122

Argument for Bacon.

Under the laws and judicial decisions of the State of
Texas, the husband's interest in the community income
during coverture is such that he should properly be required to report the entire amount in his return; the
wife's interest is not such that she should be permitted
to report one-half of the community income in her return.

Messrs. .Harry C. Weeks and Palmer Hutcheson, with
whom Messrs. Rhodes S. Baker and R. C. Fulbright were
on the brief, for Bacon.
Under the constitution and laws of Texas and the decisions of its highest courts, community income belongs
jointly and equally to husband and wife, All acquisitions of either husband or wife during marriage, whenever
or however derived, are .the common and equal property
of both of them, except such acquisitions as came through

"gift, devise or descent," and except the '"increase" of
lands so derived (that is, derived through "gift, devis.e or
descent ") and increase of lands owned at marriage or acqilired subsequent to marriage through "gift, devise or
descent." Texas Stats., Arts. 4613, 4614, 4619; Arnold
v. Leonard, 114 Tex. 535.
It is obvious that neither husband nor wife can have
any incomes other than their community incomes, except
such rare gains as are "increase" of lands. Legislative
attempts to enlarge the wife's separate income have been
held unconstitutional by the highest courts of Texas. Arnold v. Leonard, supra; Northern Texas Traction Co. v.
Hill, 297 S. W. 778; Teague v. Fairchild,*15 S. W. (2d)
585.
The wife has in the community income such ownership
and ,substantial rights as authorize her under the Revenue Act, separately to return and be taxed upon her
share thereof. Texas Stats., Arts. 2578, 2579, 4613, 4614,

MR. JusncE ROBFTS delivered the "opinion of the
Court.
This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. It ifivolves the
same questions witl, respect to community income under
Texas law as are involved in Poe v. Seaborn, ante, p. 101,
and Goodell v. Koch, ante, p. 118, under the law of Arizona
and Washington.
Respondent was assessed additional income tax for 1927,
because he and his wife had made separate returns and
had each returned one-half of the community income,
whereas the Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserted
that the respondent must return the whole thereof. Respondent paid under protest, brought suit in the District
Court (27 Fed. (2d) 140) and recovered judgment. The
collector appealed and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. (38 Fed. (2d) 651.)
In view of our decision in Poe v. Seaborn, supra, the
only matter to be examined here is whether under the
community property system of Texas the wife has a mere
expectancy, as she would under the law of California (ef.
United States v. Robbins, 269 U. S. 315), or on the contrary has a proprietary vested interest in the community

property such as makes her an owner of one-half of the
community income.
The statutes .contain sweeping provisions as to what
shall be included in community property. They provide
that each spouse shall have testamentary power over his
or her respective interest in the community property. In
the event of failure to exercise such testamentary power
they provide that the property shall go in the first instance
to the descendants of the deceased spouse. They provide,
as is usual in States having the community system, that
the husband shall have power of management and control
such that he may deal with community property very
much as if it were his own. In spite of this, however, it
is settled that in Texas the wife has a present vested interest in such property (Arnold v. Leonard, 114 Tex. 535).
Her interest is said to be equal to the husband's (Wright
v. Hays' Administrator,10 Tex. 130). It is held that the
spouses' rights of property in the effects of the community
are perfectly equivalent to each other (Arnold v. Leonard,
supra). These expressions as to the wife's interest are
confirmed by the authorities holding that if the husband,
as agent of the community, acts in fraud of the wife's
rights, she is not without remedy in the courts. (Stramler
v. Coe, 15 Tex. 211; Martinv. Moran, 32 S.W. 904; Watson v. Harris, 130 S. W. 237; Davis v. Davis, 186 S. W.
775.)
The applicable statutory provisions- are noted in the
margin.*
In view of what has been said in Poe v. Seaborn, supra,
it remains only to say that the interest of a wife in community property in Texas is properly characterized as a
