the provision in question is reasonable is made more probable by the fact that it had been adopted and sustained
not only in Texas but in other States. Grayburg Oil

ALABAMA, v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 82. Argued January 29,, 1931.-Decided February 24, 1931.
A suit against the United States by a State to recover the amotnt of
a privilege tax, with interest. and penalty, the tax being based on
a sale by the United States of surplus power generated at its hydroelectric plant in the State, held not within the jurisdiction conferred
on the Court of Claims by Jud. Code, § 145, over claims foundedupon the Constitution, upon any contract, express or implied, with
the Government, or for damages arising in cases not sounding in
tort. P. 506.
69 Ct. Cls- 340; 38 F. (2d) 897, reversed.
* CERTIORARI, 281' U. S. 718, to review a judgment dismissing on the merits a claim which, the opinion holds,
should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

Messrs. Thomas E. Knight, Jr., Attorney General of
Alabama, and Oscar W. Underwood, Jr., with whom
Messrs. A. A. Evans and Charlie C. McCall, Assistant
Attorneys General, and H. C. Kilpatrick were on the brief,
for petitioner.
In the exercise of granted powers by the Federal Government and of reserved powers by a State, the two

U. S. 514, 521; Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725.
Whenever the Federal Government engages in a business which is of a private nature, that business is not
withdrawn from the taxing power of the State within
which the business is carried on. South Carolina v.
United States, 199 U. S. 437; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.,
220 U. S. 107, 157; Bank of North Dakota v. Olson, 33
F. (2d) 848.
Particularly is this true where the levying of the tax
will not hamper or cripple the Federal Government in the,
direct and immediate performance of an essential governmental function. Osbornv. U. S. Bank, 9 Wheat. 740,
860, 866-7, 868; NationalBank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall.
353, 362; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, 522, 523-4.
The State is entitled to recover upon the basis of an
implied contract. There is a strong analogy in the cases
riquiring the United States, under an implied contract,
to pay for private property which it takes for public use.
United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445; United States v.
Great FallsMfg. Co., 112 U. S. 645, 656.
If it should be found that the State has the right to
tax 'the United States for manufacturing and selling
hydro-electric power, a cause of action, springing from the
constitutional duty, of'the United States to pay the tax
to the State, and based upon implied contract and within
the terms of the Judicial Code, could logically be found,
even though the contractual element were as slight as it
was in the cases cited.
Under United States v. Louisiana, 123 U. S. 32, the
Court of Claims is open to the States. It seems proper
that .they should be allowed to come in with the causes
of action which are peculiar to them, as well as with those
which are common with citizens., provided their peculiar
causes are of the general tyies found within § 145 of the
Judicial Code.

Argument for the United States.

282 U. S.

In essence the present claim is of the same character
as claims by private, citizens which have been sustained
by this Court. United States v. Palmer, 128 U. S. 262,
269; United States v. BerdaA Firearms Co., 156 U. S.
552, 567, 568.
We are not asserting a contract implied in law, but a
contract implied in fact; namely, implied from the facts
that the United States manufactured and sold the power
knowing the meaning of -the Constitution, and therefore:
expecting to pay the tax, and that the State.permitted the
manufacture and sale exp6cting to collect the'tax.
Two additional bases for recovery seem to be provided:
(1) "-Claims for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in
cases not sounding in tort." Dooley v. Uiited States, 182
U. S. 222, 224; United States v. Cornell Steamboat Co.,
202 U. 'S. 184; United States v. Morgan, -99 Fed., 570;
Chappellv. UnitedStates, 34 Fed. 673. The word "damages" is one of the broadest possible definition. T2) The
claim is one

'

founded upon the Constitution of the United

States." This provision covers, claims under the Tenth
Amendment to the Constitution as well as those under the
Fifth Amendment. By the Tenth Amendmeni the inherent sovereign power of the State to collect taxes is reserved and is acknowledged, as clearly as if that' power
were specifically mentioned in the Amendment; so the
power of the State to collect taxes is as muchja, part of the
Constitution as is the Fifth Amendment. Cf. Justice
Brown's concurring opinion in United States v. Lynah, 188
U. S. 445, 474-477; Phelps v. Udiited States, 274 U. S.
341.
Solicitor General Thacher, with whom Assistant Attorney General Rugg and Messrs. Bradley B. Gilman and
Erwin N. Griswoldwere on the brief, for the United States.
A- tax is not the result of agreement. As stated in
Russell v. United States, 182 U. S. 516, 530, to give the

ALABAMA v. UNITED STATES.
502

Opinion of the Court.

Court of Claims jurisdiction, the demand sued on must be
founded" on a convention between the parties--" a coming
together of minds."
A tax obligation is sometimes loosely spoken of as a
debt, but it is not a debt based upon any contractual relationship. Cooley, Taxation (4th ed., 1924), 1§ 22; Camden
v. Allen, 26 N. J. L. 398; Perryv. Washburn, 20 Cal. 318;
Carondelet v. Picot, 38 Mo. 125; Nebraska City v. Gas
Company, 9 Neb. 339; Pierce v. Boston, 3 Metc. (Mass.)
520; Peter v. Parkinson,83 Oh. St. 36; Lane County v.
Oregon, 7 Wall. 71; Meriwether v. Garrett, 102 U. S. 472,
513; Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Johnson Shipyards Corp., 6
F. (2d) 752; St. Joseph Land Co. v. MacLean, 32 F. (2d)
984; United States v. MinnesotaInvestment Co., 271 U. S.
212, 217.
An implied' cntract, in order to give the Court of Claims
or a District Court under the Tucker Act jurisdiction to
give judgment against the Government, must be one-implied in fact and not one based merely on equitable considerations and implied in law. To the same effect are:
Merritt v. United States,,267 U. S. 338, 340; Sutton v.
United States, 256 U. S. 575, 581; Tempel v. United
States, 248 V. S. 121.'
It is true that'an action of debt or assumpsit may, under
many circumstances, be brought for the recovery of a tax
from a private party. See United States v. Chamberlin,
219 U. S. 250. But the fact that a private individual
would-be liable, under the same circumstances, in an action
.of assumpsit, does not'bring the case within the jurisdic-,
tion of the Court of Claims.' Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
v. United States, 276 U. S. 287, 293.
MR. JusTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a suit brought in the Court of Claims by the
State of Alabama to recover from the United States a

tax imposed by the law of the State upon the privilege of
manufacturing and selling hydro-electric power, together
with interest at eight per cent. and a penalty of fifteen
per cent. for, failure to pay the tax when due. The claim
is based upon a sale by the United States of the surplus
power generated by it at its dam at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, under the Act of, June 3' 1916, c. 134, § 124; 39
Stat. 166, 215. The Government demurred on the ground
that the petition does not set forth a cause of action
within the jurisdiction of the Court. The demurrer was
sustained and the petition dismissed upon its merits. A
writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. 281 U. S.

718.
We are of opinion that the petition should be dismissed, not upon the merits, which would import jurisdiction to deal with them, but for want of jurisdiction under
the Act establishing the powers of the Court of Claims.
Judicial Code, § 145, U. S. Code, Title 28,'§ 250. That
jurisdiction extends to "all 'claims (except pensions)
founded upon the Constitution of the United States or
any law of Congress, upon any regulation of an Executive Department, upon any contract, express or implied,
with the Government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding
in toft, in respect of which claims the party would be
entitled to redress against the United States either in a
court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States
were suable; Provided"'etc.
The contract to be recovered upon under § 145 Jud.
Code must be an actual one, and, if implied, must be implied in fact, not merely implied by fiction, or as it is said,
by law. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States, 261
U. S.592, 597. There is no ground for asserting an actual
contract here. The State suggests that cases of property

ALABAMA v. UNITED STATES.
502

Opinion of the Court.

taken by eminent domain furnish an analogy. But in
those cases where there is a recovery the United States
admits the title' that it takes and in view of the Constitution reasonably is understood to promise the compensation that in such circumstances it is bound to pay. Phelps
v. United States, 274 U. S. 341, 343. International
Paper Co. v. United States, ante, p. 399. But here the
United States has not admitted and does not admit the
right of the State to tax it for its sales, and therefore does
not by selling import a promise to pay for what, so far as
appears, it does under a claim of right. Levying a tax
does not create a contract. It is a unilateral act of superior power, not depending for its effect upon concurrence of the party taxed.
We do not see how the claim of the State can be said to
be founded upon the Constitution. If the claim is valid,
which we are far from implying, it is under the State's
original powers as"such, and the only bearing of the Constitution is that it-did not take the power away. Neither
do we -regard the claim as one for damages in a case not
sounding in tort within the meaning of the Act. There
are few cases of this sort that cannot be brought under
the head of a contract implied in law; and, it being established that such contracts are not within the jurisdiction
of the Court of Claims,.we think that this phrase cannot
be extended to a controversy concerning the boundary between the two sovereign powers. The claim is not techni. cally one for damages as was the claim in assumpsit. It
is a claim for a tax that the United States never has
promised to pay and for a penalty. It does not fall within
the Act as it has been construed for many years.
Judgment reversed.
Petition to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
