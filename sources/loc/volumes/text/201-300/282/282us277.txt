sioner. The parties cannot have intended to -have the
amount of the tax ascertained and to leave the taxpayer
free to pay it or not. They clearly cohtemplated the
entire procedure necessary to determination and collection
of the tax. This does not mean that the distinctions
between assessment and collection were to be disregarded,
but merely that the employment of a single term comprehended both steps.
In November, 1922, both parties understood that the
tax would be assessed and collected after a proper consideration of the taxpayer's objections to any additional
assessment. To secure sufficient time fqr this purpose,
the so-called waiver was executed. The failure to insert
in the written consent words expressly waiving the statutory limitation upon collection, is explained by the belief
prevailing prior to the decision in Bowers v. N. Y. & Al-,
bany Lighterage Company, 273 U. S. 346, that distraint,
the common method for coercing payment, was possible
even when the statutory period for collection by suit had
expired. That the parties at the time may have believed
that collection was possible independent of any waiver,
does not make less effective the instrument given for the
purpose of tolling the limitation on the ultimate determination and collection of the tax. It must be assumed
that an effective and not a futile act was intended.

Opinion of the Court.

the Commissioner made a jeopardy assessment which,
upon a claim for abatement, he reduced, on October 7,
1926. Aiken thereupon appealed to the Board- of.Tax
Appeals on the grounds that the jeopardy assessment had
been erroneously computed, and that both assessment and
collection were barred by the statute of limitations. TheCommissioner's determination was affirmed by the Board,
10 13. T. A. 553; and its decision was affirmed bythe Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 35 F. (2d)
620. This Court granted a petition for certiorari, the
argument to be." limited to the questions concerning the
validity and effect of the waivers," 281 U. S. 713.
The Revenue Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136; § 250
(d), 42 Stat. 227, 265, provides a five-year period of limitation for the assessment and collection" of income and
excess profits taxes under earlier revenue acts. The five
years from the filing of the return expired March 30, 1923.
11 order to sustain the validity of the assessment and the
right of collection, it was necessary to establish a waiver
effective March 12, 1925, the date of the jeopardy assessment. Several waivers had been given. The first, which
was executed by the taxpayer on February 5, 1921, and
filed with the Bureau two days later, was not executed
by the Commissioner until after the enactment of the
1921 Revenue Act. That wiiver expired April'l, 1924.'
Before that-date, a second waiver had been duly executed,
which, by its terms, was to remain in effect for "one year
after the expiration of
. .
the statutory period of
limitation as extended by any waivers already on file with
the Bureau, within which assessments of taxes may be
made.,-. . ." Thus the jeopardy assessment was made'
shortly before April ,1, 1925, the expiration period of the
first waiver as extended by the second; and in order that
this tax may be collected, both waivers must be valid.
'It was unlimited .in time, but expired under a, departmental
ruling, promulgated April 11, 1923, by which all such waivers were
to terminate April 1, 1924. Mim. 3085, L RJCum. Bull. II-1, p. 174.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U. S.

First. It is contended that the waiver of February 5,
1921, is invalid because it was executed prior to the enactment of :250 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 which was
the first of the revenue acts to provide in- terms for the
giving of waivers. The argument is that prior to the
enactment of that section the CommissioneF lacked
authority to accept waivers of the limitation on the period
within which assessment might be made under the Acts
of 1916 and 1917.2

This contention is not sound.

The

limitation periods on assessment could be waived by the
taxpayer in the same fashion as other statutes of limitations are waived. No reason appears why the Cominissioner could not accept such a waiver prior to the Act of
1921. Although the Government might at that time still
have brought suit even though the period for assessment
had expired, it was thought desirable to follow the normal
and simpler course of assessment and collection by distraint proceedings because of the advantages afforded.'
The Commissioner requested the taxpayer to execute a
2

Section 9 (a) of the Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, 3g Stat.

756, 763, provided that where a false [erroneous] return had been
filed, the Commissioner had three years in which to discover the
error and to make an additional assessment. Section 3 of the Act
of October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 301, incorporated these provisions by reference. Compare, as to the 1909 and 1913 Acts,
Eliot National Bank v. Gill, 218 Fed. 600; National Bank of Commerce v. Allen, 223 Fed. 472; Woods v. Lewellyn, 252 Fed. 106; and
see Reg. 33 (1914) Arts. 25, 177; id. (Rev. ed. 1918) Arts. 38, 233;
W. P. Brown & Sons Lumber Co. v. Burnet, decided this day, post,
p. 286, note 2.
3 Compare Article 233 of Regulations 33 (Rev. ed. 1918) which
stated in this connection: "While the Government is fully authorized
to recover such taxes by suit, it is desirable, in order to obviate
needless expense and annoyance to the taxpayer and the Government,
that -the collection, be made as a.xesult of a formal assessment." See
also ,id., Art. 38.

waiver in cases where prolonged reexamination of the
return seemed necessary. If authority was needed for the
acceptance of such waivers, it may be found in the general broad administrative provisions of the respective
acts.' Even after the Act of 1921, a so-called waiver was
not a contract. The requirement in § 250 (d)'of that
Act that the Commissioner sign, the consent was inserted
to .meet exigencies of administration, and not as a grant
of authority to contract for waivers. See Stange v. United
States, decided this day, ante, p. 270; FlorsheimiBros. v.
United States, 280 U. S.453, 466.
Second. It is contended that the first waiver should
not be construed as waiving a limitation prescribed by a
statute thereafter enacted. The argument is that § 250
(d)of the Act of 1921 superseded this waiver and required
a new consent executed subsequent to its enactment and
in accordance with its terms. While § 250 (d) first specified that a waiver be in writing and signed by the Commissioner, there was nothing in that section which invalidated waivers made prior to its enactment or -limited the
effect of such instruments on the limitations therein imposed. Compare. Florsheim Bros. v. United States, 280
U. S. 453, 467. The first waiver; by its express terms,
embraced "any and all statutory limitations " upon the
assessment of these 1917 taxes. We see no reason for
'Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 325, § 1001,
provides: "That . . . every peron . . . liable to any tax
imposed by this Act, or for the collection thereof . . . shall com-

ply witM such regulations as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may from time
to time prescribe." This was followed by § 1309 of the Revenue Act
of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1143, which authorized "all needful
rules and regulations for the enforcement of the provisions of this
Act.' Compare Revenue Act of March 3, 1917, c. 159, 39 Stat. 1000,
1002, § 207.

restricting this language so as to exclude the limitations
subsequently imposed by § 250 (d) of the Act of 1921.
Third. It-is contended that the first waiver, even if
valid, did not operate to extend the period for the assessment of war-profits as distinguished from income taxes.
The argument is based on the reference in the waiver,
which was prepared by the Commissioner, to "call Federal
taxes imposed by the Act of' Congress, approved Septem-.
ber 8, .1916, as amended by the Act of Congress, approved
October 3, -19171" and it is contended that the war-profits
tax was a separate enactment, not an amendment to the
1916 Act, and hence not included within the waiver.- It
is clear that this waiver was intended to embrace all liability under the 1917 return then pending. Moreover, the
only statute approved October 3, 1917, was the Revenue
Act of that year, Chapter 63, the general object of which
was to increase for war- purposes the taxes levied by
the Ad of 1916.
Fourth. "The petitioner has argued alsd that the first
waiver did not purport to extend the time for collection.
'This waiver is' identical with that before us hi Stange v.
UnitedStates; decided this day, ante, p. 270, which we held
was intended to embrace all the steps necessary for the
ultimate collection of the tax. The second waiver ekpressly included "determination, assessment, and collection." Consequently, as the assessment of March 12, 1925,
was timely, the right, of collection is within § 278 (d)and
§ 280 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c; 234, Tit. II., 43 Stat.
253,. 300,. 301, 'which gives six years from the making of
the assessment. Florsheim Bros. v. United States, 280
