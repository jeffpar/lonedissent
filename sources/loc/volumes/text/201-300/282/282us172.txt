WAMPLER v. LECOMPTE, STATE GAME
WARDEN, mT AL.
APPEL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAM.

No. 402:

Argued November 25, 1930.-Decided December 8, 1930.

1. A state law for the conservation of water fowl and for the protec.tion of pdrsons engaged in shooting them, which provides that duck
blinds in the public. waters shall be at least 500 yards apart and
gives the riparlan.owner a preferential rightto select the position for
a blind, but whi'f forbids him to place one within 250 yards of the
land of an adjoining oner without the latter's consent, does not
violate the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as a
discrimination in favor of persons owning a water frontage of more
than 500 yards and against those who own less. P. 174.
2. That the law does not apply uniformly to all the waters of the
State, .inthat for some the minimum distance between blinds is
250 yards and for others there are special exemptions, is not a
groundfor declaring it invalid, in the absence of facts proving the
classification unreasonable. Id.
159F"Md. 222, affirmed.

ArPEAL from a judgment of the Court of AppeaN of
Maryland which upheld the validity under the Federal
Constitution of a state statute regulating the erection and
maintenance of duck blinds in the waters of the State.
'Tlie court affirmed a, decree of the trial court denying an
injunction and dismissing the bill in a suit to restrain
state officers acting under authority of the statute.

WAMPLER v. LECOMPTE.

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. Robert H. Archer and William L..Marbury,Jr.,
Assistant Attorneys General of Maryland, were on the
brief for appellees.
MR. JusTicE BRANDFs delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The game laws of Maryland provide for granting annual licenses for the erection and maintenance of duck
blinds in the waters of the State. No blind may be placed
at a greater distance from the natural shore than 300
yards; and blinds must be at least 500 yards apart. A
preferential right to select the-position for a blind isconferred upon the riparian owner; but he may not place a
blind "within 250 yards of the dividing line of any property owned by him and the adjoining property bordering
on said waters . . . unless with the consent of the adjoining landowner." For certain waters the limitations
prescribed are different from those above stated. In
some, permission to erect a blind is wholly denied. For
others, existing licenses are made renewable without condition. Code of Public General Laws of Maryland (Supp:
1929), Article 99, §§ 40-47.
Wampler, a resident of Charles County, owns lahd
bordering on the Potomac River for a distance of less
than 44 feet. Claiming to act under a license issued to
him in June, 1929, he erected a duck blind at a point
within 250 yards of the dividing line of his land and that
of the adjoining owners on both the north and the south.
Game wardens, acting pursuant to the statutes, destroyed
Wampler's blind as being an illegal structure; and they
threatened to destroy any other blind which he might
erect under like conditions. To enjoin such action Wampler brought this suit against them in a state court. He
conceded that the State has power to prohibit altogether
the erection of blinds or to regulate their erection and

maintenance.' Ilis sole claim is that this statute violates
the-equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because- it discriminates in favor of riparian owners with a
frontage of more than' 500 yards; and also because it
does not apply uniformly" to all the waters of the State.
The hearing was on bill and answer. The trial court dismissed the bill on the merits. Its decree was affirmed by
the hi ghest court of the State. 150 Atl. 455.
No fict is shown on which to base the contention that
the. State's power of classification has been exercised unreasonably. .The purpose of the legislation is, as the
court fbund, "the conservation of water fowl and the
protection and safety of those engaged in shooting them.
The necessity for such regulation is apparent, for if
blinds could be erected in broad waters at any distance
from the shore, without regard to the distance separating
them it would not only be conducive to the destruction
and annihilation of ducks and other water fowl, but extremely dangerous to those shooting them." 150 Atl.
457. The provision which prohibits placing a blind within
250 yards of the land of an adjoining owner without securing his consent, is a necessary incident of the prdferential right conferred upon riparian owners. See Sheehy
v. Thomas, 155 Md. 688. There was obviously no intention to discriminate in favor of persons having, a large
water frontage; for the consent provision enables owners
of small frontages to join in erecting blinds spaced the
requisite distance apart.
Nor is the equality clause violated by the special provisions that in certain inland waters blinds need not be
placed farther apart than 250 yards. The state cou'rt,
relying upon Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220
Compare Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71; McCready v. Virginia, 94 'U.S. 391; Manchester v. Massachusetts, 139 U. S.240;

Syllabus.

U. S. 61, 78, said: "Why these provisions were inserted
in the statute we are not informed, but we may assume,
until the contrary is shown, taat a state of facts in respect thereto existed which warranted 'the legislature
in so legislating." 150 Atl. 458. This long-settled rule
disposes also of the alleged discrimination created by the
special exemptions applicable to certain other waters of
the State.2
