.States of New York and Massachusett do appear here
as amici curiae in defense of the tax.'
The history of income tax legislation is persuasive, if
not controlling, upon the question of practical effect.
Plummer v. Coler,supra,(pp. 137,138). Before the pdwer
of the Congress to lay the excise tax in question can be
denied in the view that it imposes a burden upon the
States' borrowing power, it must appear that the burden
is real, not imaginary; substantial, not negligible. We
find no basis for that conclusion, nor. any warrant for
implying a constitutional restriction to defeat the tax.
Judgment reversed.

COMPANY, INCORPORATED, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 32. Argued December 8i 1930.-Decided January 5, 1931.

Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, which, in connection with
the Employers' Liability- Act, gives an action at common law to,

Undoubtedly each of these States has in view the circumstance
that it subjects to its own income taxation the gains derived from
'the sale of federal securities, and it does not desire, in the absence
of an applicable legislative restriction, t6 be'depri, ed of that source
of revenue as-a corollary of a decision against the power of the Federal
Government to tax the gains derived from the sale of state s6curities.
The State of New York disavows any claim that "the tax in ques-.
tion has any appreciable tendency to burden its fiscal operations" or
those of its municipalities. The State of Massachusetts contends
that: "1. The non-discriminitory taxation of all gains derived from
the use of business knowledge and of human ingenuity in dealings
in intangible property can have no material effect to impair the
ability of a government to issue its bonds and obligations, even if
gains from the sale of such bonds are subjected to the tax. 2. The
history of the exemption of state instrumentalities from Federal
- taxation and of the exemption of Federal instrumentalities from state
taxation reveals that the doctrine of exemption has protected governmental obligations only from taxation of :the principal amount of
such obligations and of the stated interest upon such obligations."

Neither the Merchant Marine Act itself nor the decisions of this Court which interpret it indicate that the
right of a longshoreman to recoyer against his employer is
dependent on the registry of the vessel on which the accident takes place. InternationalStevedoring Co. v. Haverty, 272 U. S. 50; Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, 264

Section733 of the Act is designed to'affect the relationship'bf employer and employee. It does not affect vessels
as such.

If a longshoreman becomes a seaman because he does
the'work formerly done bymembers of the crew, International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, 272 U. S. 50, there. can
be no doubt that § 33, like § 20 of the Act of 1915, must
be limited to seamen at work upon domestic vessels.

The weight of authority is that § 33'is inapplicable in
the case of a longshoreman injured or killed on a foreign
vessel lying in domestic waters. Plamals v. Pinar del

Mr. George deForest Lord, by special leave of Court,
filed a brief on behalf of The Cunard Steam Ship CoMpany, Limited, as amicus curiae.
MR. JusTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is -an action that was brought in a court of the
State of New York and tried before a jury. At the close
of the plaintiff's case the complaint was dismissed upon
the merits and the decision was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals, 252 N. Y. 530, on the authority of Resigno v.
F. Jarka Co., 248 N. Y. 225. A writ of certiorari was
granted by this Court, 281 U. S. 708, because there is involved an important question as to the applicability of
the Jones Act of 1915, c. 153, as amended by the At of
June 5, 1920, c. 250, § 33, 41 Stat. 988, 1007; U. S. Code,
Title 46, § 688.
The action was for causing the death- of the plaintiff's

in work as a stevedore by the F. Jarka Company, a Delaware corporation. The suit against the other defendantnamed was discontinued., At the time of receiving the
injury that caused his death, July 13, 1926, Uravic was
helping to unload a vessel flying the German flag, in the
harbor of New York. He was on the vessel at the time
and we are to take it that he was hurt by the negligence
of a fellow servant. That fact was no defence if the
above-mentioned § 33 governed, because it is not one in
the case of railway employees; Act of April 22, 1908, c.
149, § 1, 35 Stat. 65; U. S. Code, Tit. 45, § 51; and this
§ 33, giving an action at common law to the personal representative of any seaman suffering death in the course of
his employment, makes applicable all statutes of the
United States conferring or regulating such right of action
in the case of railway employees. It is decided that stevedores come within the benefits conferred by § 33. International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, 272 U. S. 50. But
the question is raised whether the statute applies to a
stevedore working on a vessel that we assumne to have
been German, since she flew the German flag.
The language of the statute is general. The right is
given to "-any seaman," including, as we,have said, stevedores. The jurisdiction and the authority of Congress
to deal with the matter are unquestionable and unquestioned. Cunard Steamship Co. v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 100,
124, et-seq. The conduct regulated is of universal concern. The rights of a citizen within the territorial limits
of the country are more extensively determined by the
scope of actions for torts than even by the law of crimes.
strong reason for giving the same pr6tection to
There -is
the person of those who work in our harbors when they
are working upon a Gerrnn ship that they would receive
when working upon an American ship in the next dock,
as is especially obvious in the case of stevedores who may

Opinion of the Court.

be employed in unloading vessels of half a dozen different
flags in turn.
But it is said that stevedores only get their rights by
somewhat artificial extension of the word "seaman," and
it is argued that a seaman upon a German vessel clearly
would not be given the rights claimed. It is said that the
word is defined by R. S. § 4612, U. S. Code, Tit. 46, § 713.
But that section merely provides that for the purposes of
the chapter "seaman" shall include persons who otherwise might be deemed not to be seamen. It is directed to
extension not to restriction, as remarked by Judge Ciane
in Resigno v. F. Jarka Co., 248 N. Y. 225, 242. Then it
is argued that the grant of jurisdiction to the Court of the
District in which the defendant employer resides or has
his principal office, without granting a proceeding in rem
in the case of tramp steamers from abroad, shows that
seamen on a foreign vessel were not contemplated. But
the question is not whether they were thought of for the
purpose of inclusion, but whether they were intentionally
excluded from a description that on its face includes them.
The express mention of them in sections as to the payment of wages does not help the respondent since that is
a domestic matter of contract that, unless mentioned,
might be left to the parties concerned. See Jackson v.
S. S. Archimedes, 275 U. S. 463, 467.
Perhaps it would be a sufficient answer to the objections that, while the § 33 is construed to give the rights
of seamen to stevedores, it does not say or mean that
stevedores are to be regarded'as seamen on the particular
vessel upon which for the moment they happen to be at
work. They simply are given the rights of seamen and,
,s they are American workmen, they have the rights of
American seamen as well on German as on American ships.
But we may go further. Here we axe dealing with the
conduct of persons within the jurisdiction affecting the

safety of other persons within it. If the rule is wise there
is no reason why it should not be universal. Wise or not,
it is law and the question is why general words should not
be generally applied. What would be the alternative?
Hardly-that the German law should be adopted. It always is the law of the United States that governs within
the jurisdiction of the United States, even when for some
special occasion this country adopts a foreign law as its
own, The Exchange, 7 Cranch 115, 136. The Luttawanna, 21 Wall. 658, 571, 572. The Western Maid, 257
U. S. 419, 432. Cunard-S.S.. Co. v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 100,
124. There hardly seems to be a reason why it should
adopt a different rule for people subject to its authority
because they are upon a private vessel registered abroad.
They are not within the exception as to public armed vessels of a foreign sovereign, whatever its extent. The Exchange, 7 Cranch 115, 143. Crimes committed upon such
private vessels may be punished by the territorial jurisdiction. Wildenhus's Case, 120 U. S. 1. Patterson v.
Bark Eudora,.190 U. S. 169, 177. We see no reason for
limiting the liability for torts committed there, when they
go beyond the scope of discipline and private matters
that do not interest the territorial power. But in these
latter cases the local authority might abstain from interfering simply because it did not care to interfere. It
would be extraordinary to apply German law to Americans momentarily on board of a private German ship in
New York.
At the argument it was suggested that the case should
be governed by the general maritime law. This means,
as we 'have indicated, by the law of the United States,
with the provisions of § 33 left out. It is assumed that by
the law, so qualified, a master would not be liable to a
servant for an injury caused by the negligence of a fellow
-ervant. But that doctrine is of relatively recent appear-

ance in admiralty, "following the common law. The City
of Alexandria, 17 Fed. Rep. 390. And, as we believe, it
was introduced into the common law almost within the
memory of men still living, upon a principle of policy.
Labatt, Master & Servant, §§ 471, et seq., § 484; 2d ed.
§§ 1394, 1408. It would be somewhat hard to maintain
that principle as still the policy of the law in this case
after the doctrine has been abolished 'for railroad employees and seamen. See InternationalStevedoring Co.
v. Haverty, 272 U. S. 50, 52.
*If it should appear that, by valid contract or special
circumstances, seamen on a foreign ship should not be
protected by the statute, it will be time enough to consider the exception when it is presented. But the purport
of the words is plain and there is no reason to deny stevedores the benefit of them, even if exceptions to the rule
for seamen may be found upon peculiar facts.
