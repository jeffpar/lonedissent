Argument for Koch.

General Counsel, and T. H. Lewis, Jr., Special Attorney,
Bureau of Internal Revenue, were on the brief, for Goodell,
Collector of Internal Revenue.
Under the laws and judicial decisions of the State of
Arizona, the husband's interest in the community income
is such that he should properly be required to report the
entire amount in his return; the wife's interest is not su'fh
that she should be permitted to report one-half of the
community income .inher return. Arizona Rev. Stats..
§§ 403, 405, 2061, 3850, 3852, 3854, 3855, 3862, 3866, 3869,.

Messrs. Clifton Mathews and Rhodes S. Baker argued
the cause, and Messrs. Samuel L. Pattee,James R. Moore,
Blaine B. Shimmel, and K. Berry Peterson, Attorney
General of Arizona, were on the brief, for Koch.
The wife, in Arizona, has a present vested title in community property equal in all respects to that of the husband, and community income vests equally between them
as it accrues. Arizona Rev. Stat., § 3850.
The powers of the husband over community property
are in recognition, not of a superior interest or title, but
of the necessity of subordinating the exercise of property
rights to the family function. See Warburton v. White,
176 3. S. 484, and La Tourette v. La Tourette, 15 Ariz.
200.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U.S.

The interest of each spouse in one-half of the property
is a vested legal one, the same-as the interest of any other
partner in partnership property.' La Tourette v. La
Tourette, supra; Pendleton v. Brown, 25 Ariz. 604; Cosper.v. Valley Bank, '28 Ariz. 373; Hall v. Weatherford, 32
Ariz. .370; Forsythe v. Paschal, 34 Ariz. 380; Schofield v.
G61d, 26 Ariz. 296.
Each spouse has unlimited testamentary power over
his or her half of the property; and in the absence of
testamentary disposition, the property passes to the descendants of the deceased spouse. Arizona Rev. Stat.,
§ 1100; Pauley v. Hadlock, 21 Ariz. .340; Wilson v. Sullivan, 24 Ariz. 124.
ME. JusTicE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This pause presents the same question as respects the
return for taxation of community income of a husband
and wife, citizens of Arizona, as was presented in Poe v.
Seaborn, ante, p. 101, affecting spouses-who are citizens
of the State of Washington.
Here Koch and his wife fried separate returns for 1927
each returning one-half of the community income; the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency
on the theory that Koch alone should have returned the
entire income; Koch paid under protest, and brought suit
against the Collector in the District Court to recover the
sum so paid. The Collector demurred. Judgment went
for plaintiff. The Collector appealed to the Circuit Court
of Appeals, which certified questions to us. This Court
ordered the entire record sent up.
What we said in Poe v. Seaborn, supra, applies here,
if under the law of Arizona, the wife's interest in comnmunity property is, in legal effect, the same as m
Washington.

GOODELL v. KOCH.
118

Opinion of the Court.

The collector asserts that the Arizona law of community
property closely resembles that of California (cf. U. S. v.
Robbins, 269 U. S. 315); but concedes that in many
respects its provisions are similar to those of the law of
Washington;
We have examined the statutes* and authorities cited,
and have concluded that they present no significant differences from the Washington system. In La Tourette v.
La Tourette, 15 Ariz. 200, 205, it was said: "The law
makes no distinction between the husband and wife in
respect to the right each has in the community property.
It gives the husband no higher or better title than it gives
the wife. It recognizes a marital community wherein both
are equal." As in Washington, each spouse has unlimited
testamentary power over his or her interest in the community, and upon failure to exercise it, such interest
passes to the descendants of the decedent.
The Arizona Supreme Court has likened the community
to a partnership. Forsythe v. Paschal,34 Ariz. 380. The
husband as agent .may not act in fraud of his wife's rights,
and if he atempts to do so, she has a remedy in the courts.
Gristy v. Hudgens, 23 Ariz, 339.
Enough has been said to show that our conclusion in
Poe v. Seaborn, supra, holds here, and that the wife has
such equal interest in community income as to entitle her
to treat one-half thereof as her income, and file a separate
return therefor under sections 210 (a) and 211 (a) of the
Rev(c.ue Act of 1926.
Perhaps we ought also to note that what is said in Poe
v' Seaborn with respect to executive construction and
legislative history applies in this case.
. *The applicable provisions (cited from the Revised Statutes of
1913 which were in force in 1927) are: Title 6, §§ 403-405, 865-869,
1102;. Title 8, §§ 2058-2062; Title 32, §§ 3848-3856, 3865-3869,
3881-3886; Act of February 10, 1921, Ariz. Session Laws, Regular,
p. 6; Act of March 17, 1919, Arizona Session Laws, Regular, p. 98.
