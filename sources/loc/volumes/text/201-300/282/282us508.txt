CERTIORARI, post, p. 817, tb review a judgment of the
.Court of Claims disallowing interest in a suit against the
United States for unlicensed use of a patent.
Messrs. 0. Ellery Edwards and Hyman M. Goldstein
were on the brief for petitioner.
Solicitor General Thacher, Assistant Attorney General
Rugg, and Mr. H. BrianHolland were on the brief for the
United States. They conceded that interest should have
been allowed..

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a suit under the Act of July 1, 1918, c. 114, 40
Stat. 704, 705; U. S. Code, Title 35, ยง 68, to recover for
the unlicensed use of a patented invention. The liability
of the United States is established by the findings of the
Court of Claims nd is not disputed. Neither is there any
dispute that the profits that the plaintiff would have
made are a proper measure of the damages suffered. The
Court of Claims, however, ruled that interest should not
be allowed upon the amount so fixed, and a writ of certiorari was granted by this.Court upon that question.
The Government, without formally confessing error,
states its. belief that interest should -have been allowed.

ALWARD v. JOHNSON.
Syllabus.

508

The statute grants 'recovery of his reasonable and entire
compensation for such use.' We are of opinion that interest should be allowed in order to make the compensation 'entire.' In addition to the purpose of the word,
adverted to in Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United
States, 275 U. S. 331, 343, we cannot doubt that it was
intended to accomplish complete justice as between the
plaintiff and the United States. See Seaboard Air Line
Ry. Co. v United States, 261. U. S. 299. Brooks-Scanlon "
Corp. v. United States, 265 U. S. 106. Liggett & Myers

United States, 274 U. S. 341.
Judgment reversed.
ALWARD v. JOHNSON, TREASURER OF
CALIFORNIA.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 41.

Argued January 8, 1931.-Decided February 24, 1931.

1. A State, upon reasonable grounds, may classify property and lay an
appropriate tax upon each class. P. 513,
2. A tax on automotive vehicles that are used in operating a stage line
and make constant and unusual use of the highways, may be measured by gross receipts and be assessed at a higher rate than taxes
on property not so employed. So held where the tax was exclusive
of all other taxation of the property, and its proceeds were assigned
to the maintenance of roads. P. 513.
3. The taxpayer was engaged in operating an automotive stage line
between points in California under a mail carrier's contract. The
gross income, for the year in question, was over four times the
market value of the property employed, and considerably more than
half of it came from the mail contract, the rest from freight and
passengers. The line could not have been run profitably without
the mail contract. Under ยง 15, Art. XIII, California Constitution,
the State laid a tax on the property, in lieu of other taxes, equal
to 4 % of the gross receipts. The rate on other property assessed
ad valorem in the vicinity, did not exceed 3%. Hdd: .
