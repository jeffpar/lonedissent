and
applicable thereto shall be considered an "overpaymeiit"
shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer, if claim therefor
is duly filed. Section 611 enacts a qualification by providing' that
in stated circumstances the payment of the tax shall not be considered an overpayment under the provisions of § 607. These
circumstances are (a) an assessment of the tax within the time
applicable thereto and before June 2, 1924, (b) the filing of a
claim in abatement, (c) the stay of the collection of any part
of the 'tax, and (d) the payment of such part of the tax before,
or within one year after, the enactment of the Act of 1928. This
legislation was occasioned by the fact that applications to abate
assessments, and the Treasury Department's mistaken view that
the time limit on collection did not apply to collection by distraint, had led in many cases to delays of collection beyond the
statutory period, and it was the general purpose of Congress that
large amounts so collected, in the circumstances described in
§ 611, should not be refunded. Held:
(1) Section 611 *applies retroactively to claims for refunds filed
before the enactment of the statute. P. 418.
(2) Section 611 applies tb involuntary, as well as to voluntary,
payments by taxpayers. P. 420.
(3) The "stay" of collection contemplated by § 611 includes
a postponement not required by statute or judicial order but
voluntary on the part of the Treasury. "P. 421.
(4) The fact that a claim in abatement was rejected before
the period of limitation on collection had expired, did not remove
the case from the purview of § 611. P. 422.
(5) Sections 607 and 611 do not relate solely to administrative
action, and the latter section prevents refunds, in the circumstances therein stated, whether the claim therefor be asserted
before the Department or in the courts. P. 423.
(6) Section 611 cannot be construed as inapplicable to a tax
payment merely because a suit to recover it was pending when
the statute' was enacted. There is no distinction in this resp ect
between suits pending against the Collector and those pending
against the United States. P. 424.
(7) This section applies where the tax was paid by crediting
an overpayment for another taxable year. P. 424.
(8) The general rule that it is inconsistent with due process
to take away by statute, from a private party, a right to recover
an amount due when the statute is passed, does not apply to the
cases covered by § 611. P. 426.

GRAHAM & FOSTER v. GOODCELL.

Statement of the Case.

(9) Where a private right to recover money from the Government is without substantial equity and arose out of a mistake of
government officers in administering the law, a statute curing the
defect of administration, and thereby destroying the cause of
action, is not unconstitutional. P. 427.
(10) Section 611 is not arbitrary or capricious in its classification. P. 431.
(11) The section precludes recovery of interest, as well as
principal.' P. 432.
2. Section 3220, Rev. Stats., which authorized the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue to remit and refund taxes erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected, etc., having been amended by the
Revenue Act of 1926 so as to except cases provided for by parts
of that Act which placed limitations on credits and refunds,, was
amended by the Revenue Act of 1928, § 619 (b), by strildng out
this exception and inserting in lieu thereof " except as otherwise
provided by law in the case of income, war-profits, estate and
gift taxes." Another Act (May 29, 1928, c. 901, 45 Stat. 883),
amending § 3220, Rev. Stats., and omitting -this exception, was
,approved on the same day as the Revenue Act of 1928. Held:
(1) That there was no repeal by implication of § 611 of the
Revenue Act of 1928, dealing with refunds, which established a
special rule for a particular situation in pursuance of a policy
deliberately adopted by Congress. P. 424.
(2) The principle that repeal of one statutory provision by
another will not be implied unless there is- positive repugnancy
between them applies especially to rbvenue laws; and the presumption against such repeal is strongest when the two Acts were
passed at the same session and on the same day. P.425.

No. 36, Graham et al. v. Goodcell, is typical of this
group of cases. On March 22, 1918, petitioners filed their
partnership income and excess-profits tax returns for the
year 1917 and paid the taxes thereby 'shown to, be due.
Additional taxes were assessed by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue in January, 1920. The petitioners filed
a claim for the abatement of this assessment on February
11, 1920, and the Commissioner rejected the claim on
December 27, 1922. Under section 250 (d) of the
Revenue Act of 1921 (c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265), the fiveyear period for the collection of the taxes for 1917 expired.
-on March 22, 1923. The Collector served notice and
demand for payment on November 19, 1924, threatening
distraint, and on November 29, 1924, and December 3,
1924, the petitioners paid the additional taxes under protest. "On September 25, 1925, they filed a claim for
refund upon the ground that the taxes were collected after
the statute of limitations had run. The claim wad
These sections are as follows:

or addition to such tax) assessed or paid (whether before or after

limitation properly applicable thereto shall be considered an overpayment and shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer if claim
therefor is filed within the period of limitation for filing such claim."
"Sec. 611. Collections Stayed by Claim in Abatement. If any
internal-revenue tax (or any interest, penalty, additional amount,
or addition to such tax) was, within the period of limitation properly
applicable thereto, assessed prior to June 2, 1924, ^and if a claim
in abatement was filed, with or without bond, and if the collection
of any part thereof was stayed, then the payment of such part (made
.before or.within one year after the enactment of this Act) shall not
be considered as an overpayment under the provisions of section
607, relating to payments made after the expiration of the period
of limitation on 'ssessment and collection."

rejected by the Commissioner on January 13, 1926, and
this suit to recover the money paid was brought on
December 23, 1927, in the District Court of the United
States for the Southern District of California. 'The judgment entered in favor of the petitioners by the District
Court was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit, 35 Fed. (2d) 586. This Court granted
a writ of certiorari, 281 U. S. 708.
There are variations in the other cases, but the determining features are the same. A claim in abatement was
filed and collection was delayed; the collection was made
after the statute of limitations had run, and before the
enactment of the Act of 1928. In some of the cases, the
suit to zecover the amount paid was brought after, and
in other cases before, the Act of 1928 became a law, on
May 29, 1928. The suits were either in the Court of
Claims against the United States, or in the District Courts
of the United States against the Collector, either individually or officially, or in both capacities. In all these

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U.S.

The contentions presented are, in substance, that sections
607 and 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928 do not apply
retroactively; that their provisions are not applicable to
payments made under duress; that the stay contemplated
by section 611 is not a mere voluntary delay in collecting
the tax; that these sectibns were intended to control-ad
ministrative action only and not to affect judicial proceedings; that section 611 should not be construed to
apply to a personal action against the Collector to recover taxes illegally collected; that section 611 was
repealed by. the Act of May, 29, 1928, c. 901, sec. 3, 45
Stat. 986, 996; that section 250 (d) of the Revenue Act
of 1921 extinguished the liability for taxes upon the
expiration of the five-year period specified; that the Congress having extinguished the liability had no power under
the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution to revive it;
and that, if section 611 is construed to authorize the collectioni of the tax in the'circumstances shown, it further
violates the Fifth Amendment because the statute is
unreasonable and arbitrary.
First. As to the construction of the statute. Section
607 provides thAt a tax assessed or paid after the expiration of the period of limitation applicable thereto shall be
considered an "overpayment" and shall be credited or
refunded to the taxpayer, if claim therefor is duly filed.
Section 611 enacts a qualification by providing that in
stated circumstances the payment of the tax shall not be
considered an overpayment under the provisions of section
607. These circumstances are (a) an assessment of the
tax within the time applicable thereto and before June 2,
1924, (b) the filing of a claim in abatement, (c) the stay
of the collection of any part of the tax, and (d) the payment of such part of the tax before, or within one year
after, the enactment of the Act of 1928.
The occasion for this legislation, and the general purpose of the Congress in enacting it, are apparent. The

Opinion of the Court.

Revenue Act of 1918, by section 250 (d) (c. 18, 40 Stat.
1057, 1083) provided that "no suit or proceeding" for the
collection of taxes should be begun "after the expiration
of five years after the date when the return was due or
was made." This provision applied only to taxes assessed
under that Act. Section 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of
1921 (c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265) prescribed the same period
of limitation for collection by suit or proceeding, and
the provision was made applicable to the collection of
taxes both under that Act and under prior income, excessprofits, or war-profits tax Acts, the fiv6 years running
from the date of the filing of the return. The Treasury
Dejartment. ruled that this limitation applied only to
judicial proceedings and not to collection by distraint,
the common method of enforcing payment.4 Section
1106. (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (c. 27, 44 Stat. 9,
113) provided that the statute of limitations sholld "not
only operate to bar the remedy" but should" extinguish
the liability," but that "no credit or refund in respect of
such tax" should be allowed unless the taxpayer had
"overpaid the tax." In Bowers v. New York & Albany
Lighterage Company, 273 U. S. 346 (decided February
21, 1927), this Court held that the period of limitation
fixed by section 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 did
apply to collection by distraint proceedings. It thus
appeared that many of the collections theretofore made
had been barred by the statute,. and suits were brought
to recover the moneys paid.' In many cases claims in
abatement had been filed and proceedings for collection
had been delayed until the claims had been acted upon,
and thereupon the taxes bad been collected despite the
fact that the statute of .limitations had run. Large

amounts ;had been paid into the Treasury in this way,
and it was the purpose of the. Congress that payments
made'in the circumstances, described in section 611 of the
Revenue Act of 1928 should not bo refunded.'.
The petitioners urge that section 611, read in its relation to section 607, was intended to apply only prospectively, that is, to action to be taken by the Treasury Department on refund claiis filed after the enactment of
the Act. Stress is laid upon the language of section 607
that a payment made after the expiration of the period
of limitation "shall be considered" an overpayment and
"shall, be credited or refunded" 'if claim therefor "is
filed." But section 611 was manifestly intended to operate retroactively according to its terms. That is, it
expressly applied to internal revenue taxes which had
been assessed prior to June 2, 1924, and within the period
of limitation applicable to the assessment. The sectior
"Section 611 as it appeared in The bill introduced in the House
of Representatives provided not only for the retention of the moneys
paid, but also that, in similar circumstances, amounts not yet paid
might be collected within a year after the new enactment. The
Committee on Ways and Means in its report on the bill stated:
"Sec. 611. Collections in Cases in which Claims in Abatement were
filed. Prior to the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1924 it was
the administrdtive practice to assess immediately additional taxes
"determined to be due. Upon the assessment, taxpayers were fre.quently' permitted to file claims in abatement with the collector
and thus delay the collection until the claim in abatement could
be acted upon. If this practice had not been followed, undue hardship undoubted would have been imposed upon the taxpayer. It
was supposed that there was no limitation upon the collection by
distraint of the amount ultimately determined to be due. However,
.the Supreme Court has recently held in a case in which the period
for assessment expired prior to the enactment of the 1924 Act, that
the- period- -for-collection- was limited to -five years from the-date
on which the return was filed. -Decisions upon claims in abatement

Opinion of the Court.

applied to taxes, so assessed, which had been paid before
the enactment of the Act of 1928, as well as to those which
would be paid within one year theireafter. The provision

was applicable to such payments although the period of
limitation on assessment and collection had expired when
the payments were made; and the provision of section 611
related to such payments only when a claim in abatement

had been filed and collection had been stayed. The words
of section 607 did apply to future action as to credits and
refunds by requiring recognition of the right of the taxpayer, as stated in the section, to have a return of the
moneys paid, but that right, under section 611, was not to
exist when the payments had been made in the circumstances there described. It was the circumstances in
which the tax had been paid, and not the tim of filing
the claim for a refund of the money, that section 611 made
determinative; and it would be inconsistent with the plain
have run. Exceptionally large amounts are involved. Accordingly,
it is of utmost importance to provide that the payments already
made should not be refunded. In order to prevent inequality, it is
also provided' that the amounts not yet paid may be collected within,
a year after.the enactment of the new Act. Your Committee appreciates the fact that this provision will probably be subjected to
severe criticism by some of the taxpayers affected. However, it
must be borne in mind that the provision authorizes the retention
and collection only of amounts properly due, and merely withdraws
the defense of the statute of limitations. If it is determined that the
amount paid is in excess of the proper.tax liability, computed. without regard to the statute of limitations, such excess will constitute
an overpayment which may be refunded or credited as in the case
of any other overpayment." (70th Cong., 1st Sess., H. R. Rep. No. 2,
p. 34.)
The Finance Committee of the Senate opposed the provision of,
section 611 (70th Cong., 1st Sess., Sen. Rep. 960, p. 42). In conference, an amendment was adopted (70th Cong., 1st Sess., H. -R.
Rep. No. 1882, pp. 6, 7, 22, 23), with the result that section 611
was enacted in its present form, that is, with the provision eliminated
as to the collection of amounts not yet paid.

intendment of that section to say that taxpayers should
be denied a refund in those circumstances only where their
claims for refund were made after the enactment, but not
if they had been made'before. The words of section 607,
if a claim for refund "is filed within the period of limitation for 'filing such. claiih," established the appropriate
condition that a claim for refund should be duly filed, but
do not require the construction that the sbheme of the
statute, which embraced the important prohibition of
section 611, should be limited to those cases where claims
for refund should be filed after the statute was enacted.
We are also of the opinion 'that the statute embrces
involuntary payments. The argument of the petitioners
points to the provision of section 611 which made it applicable not only to payments before the enactment but to
those within one year thereafter. It is said that the
latter must be voluntary payments, and that the Treasury.
Department so consitrued the statute, as the statute did
not piUfl6rt to authorize collections after the period of
limitation had expired. " But the statute also applied to
payments which had been made in the past. -The concern of the Congress lay with the fact that payments had
been made after the statute of limitations had run and
with the particular situation of taxpayers where claims
in abatement haa been filed 'and the collection stayed.
"Seation.611 was to prevent refunding the money if collec-"
tion hmd thus been postponed. That situation existed
where, fter the expiration of the period of limitation,
payment ha~d been compelled, and the statute made no
exception of such payments. The practice of collecting
taxes by 'distraint, and the mistaken view of the law that
the statute of limitations had not barred colletion in
that manner, had exposed the Treasury to demands which
it-was the intention ofthe legislation to defeat.

GRAIAM & FOSTER v. GOODCELL.
409

421

Opinion of the Court.

Petitioners contend that the stay to which section 611
referred was not simply a voluntary delay in enforcing
payment. "Stay" is said to be a term of art, with a
meaning opposed to a mere voluntary postponement of
action. There would be much force in the point, if the
word could be taken out of its particular setting. A
"stay"
compelled, rather than voluntarily granted,
would be either under a judicial order or by virtue of
statutory compulsion. Section 3224 of. the Revised Statutes (U. S. C., Tit. 26, sec. 154) provides that "no suit
for the .purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court." See
Graham v. du Pont, 262 U. S. 234, 254, 255. Statutory
provisions for stay of collection were limited in application. See Revenue.Act of 1918, sec. 214 (a) (12) (a);.
sec. 234 (a) (14) (a). United States v. John Barth Co.,
279 Uo S. 370 There was no mandatory stay that is,
in the absence of agreement, without bond. But section
611 xpressly applies where a claim in abatement was
filed "with or without bond." The word "stay" cannot
therefore be taken 'to be limited to a mandatory stay.
It is said, however, that the words "without bond" were
inserted in order to include those cases where there was
a contractual stay, as in cases where the Government had
been protected by a deposit of money in escrow, or by a
deposit in bank as a guarantee of payment, or by other
forms of binding agreements, where bonds were not filed.
Such cases wero exceptional, and to confine the statute
to such instances would be to limit it so narrowly as to
ignore its apparent purpose. In the case of'a taxpayer,
believed to be solvent, who had filed a claim in abatement, the postponement of collection would normally

take place without agreement. It is urged that if the
statute is applied to voluntary delays, the clause as to
stay is surplusage. If so, such a construction would be
preferable to one that? would make the statute virtually
inoperative. But the clause is not inappropriate, as it
is descriptive of the situation which followed the filing
of the claim in abatement. It is .true that the statutes
and regulations relating to the filing of such claims did
not require that there must be a postponement of:collection pending decision. The collector was still put tohis
duty of due diligence, but he-had authority to postpone
the collection pending the determination of the claim,
unless he believed that such action would jeopardize the
ultimate recovery.? Such postponement, on the assumption that the statute or regulations did&not bar proceedings for collection by distraint, created 'the situation to
which section 611 was- directed. The',view thit the word.
"stay." .was intended to embrape this' yoluntary delay
is supported by the statements in the reports of the committees ini
the House of Representatives and the Senate."0
In-most of the cases now under review, it appears that
the claim in abatement was -rejected .after the expiration
of the period of limitation for collection: In No, 36,
Graha. v. Goodcell, however, the :claim in abatement was
rejected in December, 1922, and the period of limitation
did not expire until March, 1923. It is urged that, for
Sthis reason, that case falls outside the.purview of section
611. * The, statute"makes no such exception, and we are
not warranted in implying one. The claim in .abatement
had .been filed and was pending for nearly three years.

Opinion of the. Court. "

There is room-for the inference that, had it not been for
this delay, the tax would have been collected before the
statute ran. The tax was collected later and the statute,
by its terms, is applicable.
It is further insisted on behalf of the petitioners- that
sections 607 and 611 relate solely to administrative action
and not to judicial proceedings. In suppoyt of this argument, an elaborate analysis of the revenue acts is presented in order to establish the meaning of the statutory
words "credit and refunds ' and "overpayment" ,and
the aptness of their reference to adminigtrative proceedings. It is not necessary to review this analysis, for there
can be no doubt that these words do have appropriate
reference to action in the course of administration. But
it does not follow that by the use of these words the
statute is limited to such action. There is no basis for.
the suggestion that there were questions involved of such
a character as to make it appropriate to submit them to
the exclusive judgment of the Commissioner." -The
question was not as to the merits of the tax but simply
as to the existence of certain facts of time and procedure..
These facts were matters of record, easily ascertained
and definite in character. It would be anomalous that
the right of the taxpayer to obtain a refund from the
Department, to which he was under obligation to resort
(R. S. 3226, U. S. C: Tit. 26, sec. 156), should be denied,
while the right to recover by suit the same amount under
exactly the same circumstances should remain unaffected.
In the attempt to explain this anomaly, it is said that the
provision was inserted because of a distrust of administrative refunds.' But section 611 contains no exception

as to judicial proceedings, and its prohibition is one which
can be enforced 'appropriately by the courts when the
taxpayer demands relief by suit. We are brought back
to the fundamental purpose of the statute, and we are
unable to conclude that it established one rule for the
Department and another for the courts. We think that it
was intended to prevent refunds in the circumstances
stated and not merely a particular way of getting the
money from the .Treasury; that the effect of' the pro,vision was to deny a right to recover the amount paid'
and that the provision governs equally wherever the right
is 'asserted.
In this view, it is not material whether the suit was
brought, by the taxpayer before or after section 611 was
enacted. The validity of the statute with respect to its
.effect upon existing causes of action is a distinct question.
So far as theconstruction of the statute is concerned, it
is apparent that the mere pendency of the suit was not
made a criterion of the right to recover. Nor is there
any warrant for making a: distinction dn this respect
between suits which had been brought agdinst the collector individually and those pending against the United
States.
There is also. a contention that section 611-does not
apply when-the tax was paid by the dredit of the amount
of ant overpayment for another taxable year. But the
-application of a credit against an assessment at a time
when collection was barred must be regarded as an
erroneous collection,*and we-see no reason for taking such
a'case out of the statute.
Second. As to the question of repeal. It is insisted
that section 611 was repealed on the same-day that it was
enacted.' This effect is ascribed to section 3 of the Act
of May 29, 1928, c. 901, 45 Stat. -986, 996. That section
amended section 3220 of the Revised Statutes which contained provisions as to the refunding of taxes erroneously
or illegally collected. Section 3220 had. been amended

Opinion of-the Court.

by section 1111 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44. Stat. 115)
so as to except the cases provided for in sections 284 and
319 of the latter Act, which placed limitations on credits
and refunds. Section 619 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1928
(45 Stat. 878) amended section 3220 by striking out this
exception and inserting in lieu thereof "except as otherwise provided by law in the case of income, war-profits,
excess-profits, estate and gift taxes.". The amendment
made by section 3 of chapter 901, Act of May 29, 1928
(45 Stat. 996), omitted this exception, and hence, it is
contended, repealed section 611 of the Revenue Act of
1928. The Revende Act was approved May 29, 1928, 8
A. M. (45 Stat. 883). The hour of the approval of chapter 901 of the same date does not appear. Section 3 of
the latter Act does not expressly repeal section 611 of the
Revenue Act of 1928, and the question is whether there
is repeal by implication. The familiar principle that repeal will not be implied unless there is a positive repugnancy between the provisions of the new law and those of
the old, has most appropriate application, as stated by
Mr. Justice Story, to the interpretation of laws for the
collection of revenue (Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342,
363), and the presumption against such an intention to
repeal is strongest when the two acts are passed not only
at the same session but on the same day. Beals v. Hale,

conflict between the two provisions. Section 611 established a special rule for a particular situation in order to
embody a policy deliberately adopted by the Congress,
and there is no ground for concluding that -contemporaneously with that enactment the policy was abandoned-and
the enactment repealed. Rodgers v. UnitedStates, supra;
Washingtonv. Miller,235 U. S. 422, 428.
Third. As to the validity of section 611. This is not
a case of an attempt retroactively to create a liability in
relation to a transaction as to which no. liability had previously attached." 1 There ds no question here as to the
original liability of the taxpayers. The tax was a valid
one, and the fact that the taxpayers had been indebted
to the Government for the amount which was subsequently collected is not now open to dispute.' Delay in
collection had followed upon the taxpayers' request for
a-consideration of their claim that the tax should be
abated,- and, in the mistaken belief on the part of. the
administrative authorities that the statute of limitations
did not bar collection- by the appropriate proceeding of
distraint, the delay had been continued until after the
stintute had run. On the discovery of the mistake, as
pointed out by the decision of this Court, the Congress
sought to prevent a refund of the amiiount thus collected.
The question, is whether these circumstances remove the
case from the operation of the general rule that it is not
consistent with due process to take away froni a private
party a right to recover the amount that is due when the
act is passed. Steamship'Company v. Joliffe, 2 Wall.

Opinion of the Court.

This rule is well illustrated by the case of Forbes Boat
Line v. Board of Commissioners, supra, where the suit was
brought to recover tolls unlawfully collected for bassage
through the lock of a State canal. The passage was free.
under the law as it stood at the time, and the subsequent
legislation of the State which attempted to validate the
illegal collection was held to be in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court said that the legislature
in 1919 could not compel plaintiff to pay- for a passage
made in 1917 without promise of reward "any more effectively than it could have made a man pay a baker foi a
gratuitous deposit of rolls." But while the legislature
could not in such a case retroactively create a liability, the
court recognized 'that there is a class of cases in which
defects .in the administration of the law may be cured by
subsequent legislation without encroaching upon constitutional right, although existing causes of action may thus
be defeated.
In United States v. Heinszen & Company, 206 U. S.
370, it appeared that after the Philippine Islands had.
come under the military control of the United- States, the
President had issued an order establishing a system of
tariff duties which were levied on goods coming into the
Islands whether from the United States or other countries.
The tariff was in force when the treaty of peace whs ratified and was subsequently continued, with modifications.
The President, as commander-in-chief, had authority 'to
impose tariff duties prior to the ratification of the treaty,
but not thereafter. 5 Accordingly, those who had been
compelled to pay such duties after the ratification, and
before the Congress established the tariff, were entitled
to recover the amounts paid." Subsequently, the*Con15 See De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 1; Dooley v. United States,

gress passed an act purporting to ratify and confirm the
collection of such duties. This Court upheld the statute,
as against the claim under the Fifth Amendment, stating that the contention ignored the fact that when the
goods were brought into the Philippine Islands, there was
a tariff in existence under which duties were exacted in
the name of the United States, and that Congress had
power to ratify the collectioi. With respect to the effect
of the act of Congress upon existing causes of action, the
Court observed '(id. p. 387) that "the- mere commencement of the suit did not change the nature of the right"
or. "operate to deprive the government of the power to
enact curative statutes, which, if the actions had not been
brought, would have-been unquestionably valid."
Another illustration is found in Tiaco v. Forbes, 228
U. S. 549. Suits had been brought to make the Governor
General of the Philippine Islands .personally answerable
in damages for the deportation of a Chinese person resident in the Philippines, and after the bringing of the suit
'the Philippine legislature had passed an act purporting
to ratify the Governor General's action. Referring to
the doubt that naturally would occur whether, if a right
of 'action had vested previously, it. could bW taken away
by suich a statute, the court said that "it generally is recognized that in cases like the present, where the act originally purports to be done in the name and by the authority
of the state, a defect in that authority may be cured by
* a subsequent adoption of the act."
The doctrine of the Heinszen case, supra, vas leftunquestioned in MacLeod v. United States, 229 U. S.
416, 434, 435 (where the application of the Act of Congress with respect to Philippine duties was limited so as
to catry out its true intent) and was definitely applied in
the case of Rafferty v. Smith, Bell & Company, Limited,
257 U. S. 226, 232. Taxes on the value of exports from
the Philippine Islands had -been collected under a Philip-

GRAHAM & FOSTER V. GOODCELL.

Opinion of the Court.

pine act while duties on such exports were forbidden by
an act of Congress. The taxpayers had recbvered judgments for restitution in March, 1920. The Congress,-by
Act of June 5, 1920 (c. 253, 41 Stat. 1015, 1025), confimed the collections. The Court held that the enactment was within the power of Congress, and the fact that
the taxpayers had recovered judgments for the am ouiats
collected gave them no higher rights than those possessed
by the taxpayers in the Heinszen case. See also, Charlotte Harbor & Northern Railway Company v. Welles,
260 U. S. 8, 11, 12; Hodges v. Snyder, 261 U. S. 600, 603,
604. In Forbes Boat Line v. Board of Commissioners,
supra, the Heinszen and Rafferty cases were invoked without success; the court expressed the view that "a tax may
-be imposed in respect of past benefits" and that in those
cases the principle of ratification was not necessarily
involved, citing Wagner v. Baltimore, 239 U. S. 207, 216,
217, and Stockdale v. Atlantic Insurance Company, 20
Wall. 323.
It is apparent, as the result of the decisions, that a
distinction is made between a bare attempt of the legislature retroactively to create liabilities for transactions
which, fully consummated in the past, are deemed to leave
no ground for legislative intervention, and the case of a
curative statute aptly designed to remedy mistakes and
defects in the administration of government where the
remedy can be applied without injustice. Where the asserted vested right, not being linked to any substantial
equity, arises from the mistake of officers purporting to
administer the law in the name of the Governmeiit, the
legislature is not prevented from curing the defect in
administration simply because the effect may be to destroy
causes of action which would otherwise exist.17 "The
'7 In United States v. Heinszen & Co., 206 U. S. 370, 386, 387, this
Court said: "But if it be conceded that the claim to a return of
the moneys paid in discharge of the exacted duties was in a sense a
vested right, it in principle, as we have already observed, would be

power is necessary, that government may-not be defeated
by omissions or inaccuracies in the exercise of functions
necessary to its administration." Charlotte Harbor &
Northern Railway Company v. Welles, supra. This principle covers the present case. The petitioners had been
indebted'to the Government for the amount which was
subsequently collected.' They had asked for a review
of the assessment and collection was postponed. The
Treasury Department had mistakenly assumed tiat the
statute of limitations did not apply to distraint proceedings and before the -mistake was discovered the period of
limitation had expired. The Congress could correct this
defect in administration without violating any substantial equity, and this was accomplished by section 611 of
the Rev'nue Act of 1928.
Having reached this conclusion, it is not necessary to
consider the authority of the Congress to withdraw the
consent of the United States to be sued. See United
States v. Heinszen & Company, supra, at p. 391. The
argument of the Government-in this respect is not adequate to, dispose of the controversy. Some of the present
suits were brought against the collector individually and
were based upon the right to recover as against him by
reason of'his illegal acts. Such an ation is personal and
not against the United States. Sage v, United States,
250 U. S. 33, 37; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel- Company,
but the character of right referred to by Kent in his Commentaries,
wheie, in treating of the validity of statutes Tetroactively operating-

on certain classes of rights, it is said (Vol. 2, pp: 415, 416): 'The
legal rights affected in those cases by"the statutes were deemed to
'have been vested subject to the,"equity existing against them, and
which the statutes recognized and enforced. Goshen v. tonington,
4 Connecticut 209; Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Peters, 62 7 Langdon v.

257 U. S. 1, 4, 5.18 If the Congress did not have the
authority to deal by a curative statute with the taxpayers' asserted substantive right, in the circumstances
described, it could not be concluded that the Congress
could accomplish the same result. by denying to the taxpayers all remedy both as against the United States and
also as against the one who committed the wrong. See
Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings Company v. Hill, 281'
U. S. 673, 679, 680.
The objection to section 611 upon the ground that it is
arbitrary and capricious in its classification, and hence'
offends, the Fifth Amendment, is without merit. The
broad discretion of the Congress in the exercise of its -constitutional power as to -taxation (Brushaber v. Union
Pacific Railroad Company, 240 U. S. 1,.24-.26; Evans v.,
Gore, 253 U. S. 245, 256; Barclay & Coipany v. Edwards

personally for duties mistakenly collected, if the person charged gave
notice, at the time, of his intention to sue, and warning not to pay
over the amount to the Treasury. Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137.
But, after an act of Congress had required collectors to pay over such
monies, it was held, against the dissent of Mr. Justice Story, that
the personal liability was gone. Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236. Later
statutes however recognize suits against collectors in such cases, and
the plaintiff contends that they should be construed to create a Ifew
statutory liability attached to the office and passing to succssors,
as was held in this case, the formal defendant being saved from harm
by the United States. This however is not the language of the
statutes and hardly can be reconciled with the decision of this Court
in Sage v. United States, 250 U. S. 33, and other cases to which we
shall refer.

of supervision and control of -the processes of enforcement. It cannot be deemed to be unreasonable that the
Congress in the present instance provided for cases in
which a'claim in abatement had been filed and the collection stayed. In its selection the Congress dealt *ith
an appropriate class and was not bound to include others.
Nor is the statute rendered invalid by the provision as to
payments made within a year after its enactment. As
already stated, the Treasury Department did not construe
section 611 as authorizing collections in the future, after
the expiration of the period of limitation;'II and if the
Congress saw fit to make the statute applicable to future
voluntary payments, it was clearly entitled to fix a limit
of time within which it might be so applied.
In some of. the cases under review, it is insisted that
section 611 does not preclude the recovery of interest,
upon the ground that the interest had not been assessed
and therefore lay outside -the prohibition -of the statute.
But it does not appear that there was any statutory
requirement that interest as such should be assessed, and
the valid denial of the right to recover the principal should
be deemed to apply also to the interest,
