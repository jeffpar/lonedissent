It- is said that included in the decree of forfeiture is an
isimd not "bonded" or used as a means of ingress or
egress to, but entirely separate from, the distilling premises. Our attention, however, is called to nothing in *the
record which appears to verify these statements. ' No instructions to the jury were asked or given on the subject,
nor was it considered by the court below or referred to in
the application for certiorari. In these circumstances it
is unreasonable to expect us to consider the question.
,We iave not overlooked other contentions made by petitioner, but, in so far as they are not met by what already
has beensaid, we find it unnecessary to consider them for
lack of substance.
Judgment affirmed.
COOLIDGE wr AL., TRUSTEES, v. LONG,:COMMISSTONER OF CORPORATIONS AND TAXATIO$
OF MASSACHUSETTS.
APRPEAL FROM THE PROBATE COURT OF NORFOLK COUNTY,
-MASSACHUSETTS.

NoiS.33 and 34. Argued December 8, 1930.-Decided February 24,
1931.
By voluntary deeds of trust, a husband and wife transferred real and
personal property, owned by them severally in certain proportion§,
to trustees, in trust to pay the income in those proportions to the
settlors during their joint lives and then the entire income to the
survivor of them, and, upon the death of the survivor to divide the
principal equally,among the settlors' five sons, provided that, if any
of the sons should predecease the survivor of the settlors, the share
of that son should go to those entitled to take his intestate property
under the statute of distribution in force at the death of such survivor. The deeds reserved no power of revocation, modification or
termination prior to the death of the survivor of the settlors. After
both settlors had died, the State imposed succession taxes upon the
remainder interests of the sons, under a statute passed before the
deaths of the settlors but after the creation of the trusts (Gen. Iaws

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

Syllabus.

Mass., 1921, c. 65, § 1,) which provides that all property within the
jurisdiction of the State which shall pass by deed, grant or gift,
(except in cases of bona fide purchase for full consideration in money
or money's worth,) made or intended to take effect in possession or
enjoyment after the death of the grantor, to any person, absolutely
or in trust,'shall be subject to a tax. The court below decided that
the tax was valid as an excise on the succession. Held:
1. The trust deeds are contracts within the meaning of the Federal Constitution. The State can not by subsequent legislation alter
their effect or impair or destroy rights that had vested under them.
P. 595.
2. Under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
a gift can not be taxed by a State under a law that was enacted
after the gift was fully consummated. P. 595.
3. When the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked to determine
whether a state law impairs the rights of the litigant under a prior
contract, or whether the State is depriving him of his property
without due process of law and the question turns upon the existence
and terms of a contract, this Court is bound to determine for itself
whether there is a contract and to ascertain its true meaning and
effect. P. 597.
4. The succession of each son was complete when the trust deeds
took effect, and the enforcement of the statute imposing the excise
would be repugnant to the contract clause of the Constitution and
the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 597--605.
By the deed of each grantor one-fifth of the remainder was vested in
each of the sons, subject to be divested only by his death before
the death of the survivor of the settlors. It was a grant in
praesenti,to be possessed and enjoyed by the sons upon the death
of such survivor. The provision for the payment of income to the
settlors during their lives did not oprate to postpone the vesting
in the sons of the right of possession or enjoyment. The deaths of
the settlors were not a generating source of any right in the
remaindermen; nothing moved from them, or.either of them, or
from their estates, when either of thenr died. The succession, when
the time came, did not depend upon any permission or grant of the
State. While the sons, if occasion should arise, might by suit require the trustees to account, the property was never in the custody
of the law or of any court, and the State was powerless to condition
the possession or enjoyment of what had been conveyed to them by
the deeds. The fact that each son was liable to be divested of the

remainder ty his own death before that of the survivor of the
grantors, does not render the succession incomplete. The vesting
of actual possession and enjoyment depended upon an event that
must inevitably happen by the effiux of time, and nothing but his
failure to survive the settlors could prevent it. Succession is
effected as completely by a transfer of a life estate to one and
remainder over to another, as by a transfer in fee. No Act of
Congress has been held by this Court to impose a tax upon possession and enjoyment, the right to which had fully vested prior to
the enactment, nor has this Court sustained any state law imposing
an excise upon mere entry into possession and enjoyment of prop,erty, where the right to such possession and enjoyment upon the
happening of a. specified event had fully vested before the enactment.

APPEALs from final decrees sustaining inheritance taxes.
The decrees were entered by the Probate Court upon rescripts from the Supreme Judicial Court.
Mr. Robert G. Dodge, with whom Mr. Harold S. Davis
was on the brief, for appellants.
If rights granted by a deed are so vested that interference with them impairs the obligation of the contract
embodied in the deed, it necessarily follows that such interference deprives the grantee of his property without due
process of law. The converse is equally true. Unless the
tax can be sustained as an excise, it must fail altogether;
if the statute were construed as imposing a property tax,
it would be repugnant to the Constitution of Massachus~tts. Minot v. Winthrop, 162 Mass. 113.
The case presents, a situation which has arisen many
times in. different state courts and as to which the decisions, other than that. now under review, are all to the
effect that the attempt to impose an excise constitutes an
unwarranted interference with vested rights. Hunt v.
Wicht, 174 Cal. 205; Lacey v. State Treasurer,152 Iowa

affirmed 181 N. Y. 551; Houston'sEstate, 276 Pa. St. 330;
Commonwealth v. Wellford, 114 Va. 372.
As is pointed out in these cases, the vital question is as
to when the succession to the property takes place, because
the succession is the subject of the tax. If the succession
is complete before the tax law is enacted, the effect of the
law, if construed as applying to such a case, is to impose an
excise with respect to a past transaction and this, it is very
clear, cannot be done. Untermyerv. Anderson, 276 U. S.
440; Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142; Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531.
A comprehensive statement of the principle is found in
the opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Chanler v. Kelsey,
205 U. S. 466, at p. 480.
If the owner of property conveys it to trustees to pay
the income to himself for life and on his death to distribute
the principal among specified individuals, these individuals succeed to the property upon the execution of the
trust instrument. It is the shifting of the power to con'trol the devolution of the property, and not the change in
actual possession or enjoyment, that constitutes the essence of " succession." Chase Nat. Bank v. United States-,
278 U. S. 327; Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U. S.
339; May v. Heiner,281 U. S. 238.
Hence, as is held in Hunt v. Wicht, 174 Cal. 205, .and
the other cases in the group cited above, an excise with
respect to the succession cannot be imposed by an act
passed after the trust instrument is delivered. It was not
suggested that the statute, as applied to the present situation, could be sustained on the theory that it was designed
to prevent evasion of the tax upon testamentary dispositions, since there was-no such tax-at the time when the
trust was established. Neither was it "attempted to up-"
hold the tax on the ground that the transfer was in contemplation of death; the facts furnish no foundation for
any such contention. Since the settlors retained no right

282 T.S.

of revocation and no power to control the devolution of
the property in any way; there was no basis for distinction
in that respect. Emphasis was, however, laid on the fact
that the interest of each son, while vested, was subject to
be divested in favor of his next of kin if he should die
before the survivor of the settlors and it was said that the
succession therefore took place when the survivor of the
settlors died.
The same facts in substance were presented, however,
in several of the cases cited by appellants from-other States
and the element of defeasibility was expressly held immaterial. Matter of Pell, supra;Matter of Craig,supra;
Lacey v. State Treasurer,supra; In re Houston's Estate,
supra. Distinguishing Carter v. Blgbee, 92 N. J. L. 390;
People v. Carpenter,264 Ill. 400.
The significance of such a weight of authority was
remarked upon in Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562, at
p. 585.
The conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals of
New York and by the other courts which have taken the
same view is the only one consistent with the opinions of
this Court. Indeed, the recent decision in May v. Heiner,
281 U. S. 238, is in itself almost enough to settle the whole
matter. As was recognized in that case, succession ex vi
termini is a bilateral affair. ' There can be a succession in
ownership only as one person succeeds to another as
owner. In a case like the present the beneficiaries succeed
to the settlors at the execution of the trust instrument;
the respective rights of the settlors and beneficiaries in
the property are irrevocably fixed at that time. The only
persons to whom the ions could be said on any theory to
have succeeded on the death of the surviving settlor were
their respective next of kin but it is obvious that there
was no succession here' the title was vested in the sons
and the mere fading out of the contingent rights of the
next of kin (who had no power in any way to deprive the

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

Argument for Appellants.

sons of their titlb) no more constituted "succession?" by
the sons than would, for example, the lapsing-of an attachment through the entry of judgment for the defendant
constitute a succession by the owner of the attached prop-.
erty to the attaching creditor. 'The vital element of a
relinquishment of rights by one persona in favor of another
was altogether lacking.
An analysis of the grounds upon which succession taxes
have been upheld by this Court confirms this conclusion.
Such a tax is valid, if at all, because it relates to the exercise of some privilege which the State may grant or
withhold at pleasure. This was settled long ago'as to,
property passingby will or by the laws of intestate succession. United States v. Perkins,163 U. S. 625, 628; Mager
v. Grima,8 Iow. 490, 494.
A tax upon transfers by deed or otherwise inter vivos
may sometimes be justified as a means of preventing
evasion of the tax on testamentary dispositions. Again,
the settlor may in connection with such a transfer reserve
for his 'life a right to revoke the grant or to affect the
devolution of the trust property in some other way; hi
such a case the instrument is really a species of will, so
that the basis for imposing a tax at the settlor's death is
the same as that for imposing such a tax at the death of a
testator. Apart Irom these considerations, neither of
which, as shown above, is relevant to the present cases,
the only sufficient basis of -an excise tax with respect to the
ripening of interests created by deed is the fact that the
creation of future interests is not one of the rights inherent
inevery property owner but is, like the creation of rights
by will, a privilege which the State may withhold or confer
as it sees fit. Keeney v. New York, 222 U. S. 525, 533.
If.may be conceded that, when the present trust instrument was executed, the settlors, in creating the various
interests for which it provides, and the beneficiaries in
acquiring these interests, were exercising a .privilege

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Argument for Appellants.

282 U. S.

granted by the State and that, as a condition of the
exercise of this privilege, the State might have provided
that a tax be paid when the survivor of the settlors should
die. But having granted without restriction the privilege
of creating and acquiring these interests, it was not
competent for the State afterwards to attach conditions.
After the remainders were once vested, the State had no
more power to disturb them than it would have had to
disturb an estate in actual possession. If, after the present trust was created, the legislature had assumed to pass
an act which in any way interfered with the deed's taking
effect according to its tenor, or prevented the beneficiaries
from coming into the enjoyment of all the privileges
which it purported to confer upon them, the invalidity of
the act would have been too plain for argument. Aetna
Life Ins. Co. v. Hoppin, 214 Fed. 928; Gilpin v. Williams,
25 Oh. St. 283; Bright v. Supreme Councit 'of Catholic
Knights, 183 Ky. 388; Albertson v. Landon, 42 Conn. 209.
Rights like those of tie sons now inquestion are far less
tenuous than an estate by curtesy initiate, which, as is
well settled, cannot be impaired by legislation. Jackson
v. Jackson, 144 Ill. 274; Rose v. Rose, 104 Ky. 48; Clay
v. Mayr, 144 Mo. 376; Wyatt v. Smith, 25 W. Va. 813.
These principles are fully recognized in Massachusetts;
it has been held, for example, that the common law interest of a husband fn a remainder in personal property
bequeathed to his wife upon the contingency of her surviving the life tenant, cannot be impaired by a statute
passed before the happening of the contingency. Dunn
v. Sargent, 101 Mass. 336.
The present tax must rest on the assumption that whenever anything happens to the advantage of an individual,
even though it comes to pass through circumstances over
which neither he nor anybody else has control, this may
be made the subject of an excise. The limitless field thus
opened for the imposition of excises is manifest.

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

Argument for Appellee.

The Supreme Judicial -Court maintains, indeed, that
this anomalous theory is sanctioned by this Court, but an
examination of the four cases cited in the opinion shows
otherwise. Distinguishing Cahen, v. Brewster, 203 U. S.
543; Chanlerv. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466; Nickel v. Cole, 256
U. S. 222; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. .260. Cf.
State v. Brooks, decided September 26, 1930, by the Supreme Court of Minnesota.
The statute as construed below denies to petitioners and
those claiming under them the equal protection of the
laws.
Mr. James S. Eastham, Special Assistant Attorney General of Massachusetts, with whom Mr. Joseph E. Warner,
Attorney General, was on the brief, for appellee.
The statute, as construed below, is valid as a succession
tax upon the exercise of the privilege of receiving in 1925
property passing dependently upon the death of the settlors under a trust created in 1907. Saltonstal v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260, is clearly decisive of the validity of the
excise.
Since the excise is on the succession to property by the
beneficiaries, it makes no difference when the trust was
executed under which the succession takes place. As long
as the statute imposing the excise is enacted prior to the
receipt by the beneficiaries of the property, a valid excise
may be imposed upon such receipt. Cf. Magee v. Commissioner of Corporations,256 Mass. 512.
The excises are not imposed on the transfers of 1907 or
1917, prior to the enactment of the 1920 taxing statute,
but on the receipt of the property in 1925, five years after
the enactment of the 1920 statute. They are by no means
retroactive taxes. Further, the remainders over were not
independent of, but clearly dependent upon, the deaths -of
the settlors. And this is true although there was no power
of revocation reserved in the original trust instrument.

282 U. S.

and although in April, 1917, the settlors gave up their
rights to the income.
The tax is valid even .though, after the 1917 assignment, and therefore at the time of the deaths of the settlors in 1921 and 1925, respectively, the trust might fairly
be said to be a trust to trustees to pay the income to the
children during the lives of the settlors, and the survivor,
and then to the childien absolutely; with the provision
that "if any of the Coolidge children should die before the
time for distribution the heirs of any deceased child
should take the parent's share."
The dependence of the interest of the remaindermen
upon the deaths of the settlors was clearly shown when
this trust was before the Massachusetts court in Coolidge
v. Loring, 235 Mass. 220, where a demand on the trustees
for an immediate distribution of the fund was refused by
reason of the "possible claim of a contingent interest on
behalf of wives and children of sons predeceasing" the
settlors. The Massachusetts court refused to reform the
instrument.
A succession tax is validly imposed where the property
does not pass independently of the death of the orizinal
settlor.
The language of the Massachusetts cases shows that the
time of passage is not so important as the nature of the
passage. It is not necessary that .the property pass immediately in point of time upon the death of the settlor.
It is only necessary that the passage of the property have
a depeimdent relation to the death of the grantor.
The deaths of te settlors were the "generating source"
from which the authority to impose the excises came into
being.
The imposition of such an excise here does not deny to
appellants the equal protection of the laws nor deprive
them of property without due process of law nor imrpair

the obligation of a contract under the Constitution of the
United States. Crocker v. Shaw, 174 Mass. 266.
The succession to property by reason of death has-been
recognized for many years by the. Massachusetts court as
a commodity which rightly may be made subject to an
excise. [Citing many Massachusetts cases.]
A State may impose an excise upon the privilege of the
donee to succeed to property in possession and enjoyment
upon the death of the grantor, as well as upon the privilege
of the grantor so to transfer it, whether occasioned by
death-Stebbins v. Riley, 268 U. S. 137--or effected by
deed, Keeney v. New York, 222 U. S. 525; Chanler v.
Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466; Nickel v. Cole, 256 U. S. '222;

567, 573; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260.
The principle that an excise may be imposed upon the
privilege of succession at any time before that privilege
is fully exercised extends to an excise imposed by an act
passed after the interest has vested in law but before it has taken effect in possession and enjoyment. Carpenter.

339.
This Court, in the Reinecke and Coolidge cases was
dealing, with the federal estate tax, a tax upon the right
to transfer. In the consideration of such a tax it is of
the utmost importance to determine whether or not the
power of control is left with the transferor. This distinction between the underlying theories of the federal and
Massachusetts taxes was made plain in Saltonstall v.

282 U.S.

Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260. See also, Chase Nat. Bank v.
United States, 278 U. S. 327.
We are here concerned with taxes upon the right to
receive. If the property which was received by the
children on November 10, 1925, came from the seftlors
originally, and if the beneficiaries, upon the death of the
settlors, received something, then the Massachusetts §uccession taxes are properly and constitutionally imposed.
It is not essential to a succession tax that the transferor
shall have retained any interest or the power to control.
It is essential only that the beneficiaries shall have received something which came originally from the settlors
in connection with whose death the tax is assessed.
Transfer taxes rather than succession taxes were involved in many of the decisions cited in the brief of appellants, including among others: May v. Heiner, 281
U. S. 238; Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U. S. 339;
Chase Nat. Bank v. United States, 278 U. S. 327; Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S. 440; Blodgett v. Holden, 275
U. S. 142; Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531. Such cases
are not in point here, where a succession tax has been
imposed.
The theory of the appellants seems to be that, except
where there is an attempted evasion of the tax'or except
where there is a power to revoke, the only basis for an
excise tax on property passing under a deed is that the
creation of future interests is a privilege which the State
may withhold or confer as it sees fit. The appellee does
not accept that theory. Something more is involved than
the mere creation of future interests. The. appellee's
theory of a death excise.is that it can constitutionmlly be
imposed as long as the property passing by reason of the
death has not reached its final resting place.
The taxes are not discriminatory, and do not deny equal
protection of the laws.

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

Opinion of the Court.

MR.JusTIcE BuTrER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Each of these appeals brings here for review a decree
of the probate court of Norfolk county, Massachusetts,
entered in accordance with a rescript from the supreme
judicial court of the Commonwealth. 268 Mass. 443; 167
N. E. 757. In each appellants presented to the probate
couit an application0for the abatement of an inheritance
tax assessed under § fzec. - 65, General Laws. There was
drawn in question the validity of the statute on "theground
of its being repugnant to the contract clause of the Federal
Constitution and the. due process and equal protection
clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The probate
court reserved for the consideration of the supreme judicial court all questions of law and the matter of what
decrees should be entered. That court held the statute
valid and sustained the taxes.
The opinion states the facts as follows:
"The petitioners [appellants here] are trustees, under
a deed and declaration of trust executed on July 29, 1907,
by J.Randolph Coolidge and Julia Coolidge and the petitioners.
"By that deed a large amount of real and personal
estate was transferred to the trustees by the settlors voluntarily and not as a bona fide purchase for full consideration in money or in money's worth. The trustees were
given extensive powers of management, investment and
reinvestment with the right to determine finally what
receipts and payments should be credited to income or
principal. The part of the trust fund furnished by J.
Randolph Coolidge was four-sevenths, and the part furnished by Julia Coolidge was three-sevenths.
"By the terms of the trust the income was to be paid in
these proportions to each o;f the settlors during their joint
lives and then the entire income to the survivor, and,
2211V"-31-------38

282 U. S.

upon the death of the survivor, the principal was to be
divided equally among their five sons, provided that, if
any of the sons should predecease the survivor of the
settlors, his share should go to those entitled to take his
intestate property, under the statute of distributions in

force at the death of such survivor, with a further provision to the effect that in no event should a widow of such
deceased son take as distributee more than half of such
share.
"There was in the declaration of trust no power
of
revocation or modification or termination prior to the
death of the survivor of the settlors. Coolidge v. Loring,
235 Mass. 220.
"By instrument executed on April 6, 1917, the settlors
assigned their interest in the trust to the five sons, all of
whom eventually survived the termination of the trust.
"Julia Coolidge died in January, 1921, and J. Randolph Coolidge on November 10, 1925, both being residents of this Commonwealth.
"The defendant determined that the petitioners were
subject to excise taxes under G. L. c. 65, § 1, as amended,
upon the four-sevenths and upon the three-sevenths of
the trust estate furnished- respectively by each settlor as.
of November 10, 1925."
When the declaration of trust was executed, no statute
was in effect under which the succession to the trust property could have been subjected to this tax. The statutes
then in force provided for the imposition of an excise only
where the succession was to collateral relatives and strangers. The first relevant statute was approved June 27,
1907 (St. 1907, c. 563) and took effect September 1, about
five weeks after the date. of the'declaration of the trust.
It did not apply to -property passing by deed, grant, sale
or gift made prior to its effective date. But by § 3, c.
678, St. 1912, it was made applicable "to all property
passing by deed, grant or gift . . .made or intended to

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

Opimion of the Court.

take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of
the grantor or donor, if such death occurs subsequent to
the passage hereof." And see § 1, c. 563, St. 1914.
Chapter 65, General Laws, effective since January 1,
1921, provides:
§ 1. "All property within the -jurisdiction of the commonwealth . . . which shall pass by'. . deed, grant or
gift, except in cases of a bona fide purchase for full consideration in money or money's worth . . . made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after his
[grantor's] death . . to any person, absolutely or in
trust, . . . shall be subject to a tax. ..."
§ 36. " This chapter shall apply only to property or
interests therein passing or accruing upon the death of
persons dying on or after May fourth, nineteen hundred
and twenty
The supreme judicial court sustained the exaction as
an excise. It held that possession or enjoyment upon the
death of the survivor of the settlors was a taxable commodity under.the statute enacted after the creation of the

trust.
The trust deeds are contracts within the meaning of the
contract clause of the Federal Constitution. They were
fully executed before the taking effect of the state law
under which the excise is claimed. The Commonwealth
was without authority by subsequent 'legislation; whether
enacted under the guise of its power to tax or otherwise,
to alter their effect or to impair or destroy rights which
had vested under them. Appleby v. City of New York,

gifts fully consummated before its provisions came before

Congress (Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142) or before its
passage (Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S. 440) was arbitrary and repugnant to the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment. In Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 "U.S. 531, we
considered the trust deed of Mrs. Coolidge that is now

value of the property so conveyed prior to the enactment
should be included in her estate for the purpose of ascertaining the federal estate tax thereon. We said (p. 542):

178 U. S. 41, 77. And we must conclude that section 402
(c) of the statute here under consideration, in so far as it
requires that there shall be included in the gross estate
the value of property transferred by a decedent prior to
its passage merely because the conveyance was intended
to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after
his death, is arbitrary, capricious and amounts to confiscation."
See Levy v. Wardell, 258 U. S. 542, 544. The States
are similarly restrained by the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
In its opinion, the state court suggests that the federal
estate tax was upon property of the deceased transferred
at his death and that it was levied upon a subject "quite
different from the succession to property by a beneficiary,
which is the subject of the present excise." Undoubtedly
the State has power to lay such an excise upon property
so passing after the taking effect of the taxing Act. The
fundamental question here is whether rights had so vested
prior to the taking effect of the tax statute that there was
thereafter no occasion in respect of which the excise might
constitutionally be imposed. The state court held that

the succession was not complete until the death of the
survivor of the grantors and that therefore the tax is
valid. It is well understood that, when the jurisdiction
of this court is invoked to determine whether a state law
impairs the rights of the litigant under a prior contract,
or whether the State is depriving him of his property
without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the question turns upon the existence or terms of a conttact, this court is bound to determine for itself whether there is a contract and to ascertain its true meaning and effect. That rule is necessary
in order that this court may properly enforce these provisions of the Constitution. Railroad Commission v.
Eastern Texas R. Co., 264 U. S. 79, 86, and cases cited.
By the deed of each grantor one-fifth of the remainder
was immediately vested in each of the sons subject to be
divested only by his death before the death of the survivor of the settlors. It was a grant in praesenti to be
possessed and enjoyed by the sons upon the death of such
survivor. Blanchardv. Blanchard, 1 Allen 223. Clarke
v: Fay, 205 Mass. 228. McArthur v. Scott, 113 U. S.340,
379; and cases cited. And see United States v. Fidelity
Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158. Henry v. United States, 251
U. S. 393. The provisioii for the payment of income to
the settlors during their lives did not operate to postpone
the vesting in the sons of the right of possession br enjoyment. The settlors divested themselves of all control
over the principal; they had no power to, revoke or
modify the trust. Coolidge v. Loring, supra, 223. Upon
the happening of the event specified without more, the
trustees were bound to hand -over the property to the
beneficaries. Neither the death of Mrs. Coolidge nor of
her husband was a generating source of any right in the
remaindermen. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 56.

then. The rights of the remaindermen, including possession- and enjoyment upon the termination of the trusts,
were derived solely from the deeds. The situation would
have been precisely the same if the possibility of divestment had been made to cease upon the death of a third
person instead of upon the death of the survivor of the'
settlors. The succession, when the time came, did not
depend upon any permission or grant of the Commonwealth. While the sons if occasion should arise might by
appropriate suit require the trustees to account, it is to
be borne in mind that the property was never in the
custody of the'law or of any court. Regort might be had
to the'law to enforce the rights that had vested. But the
Commonwealth was powerless to condition possession or
enjoyment of what hald..been conveyed to*them by the
deeds. Barnitz v. Beverly; 163 U. S. 118, and cases cited..
The fact that each son was liable to be divested of the
remainder by his own death before that of the survivor
of the grantors does not render the succession incomplete.
The vesting of actual possession and enjoyment depended
upon an event which must inevitably happen by the effilux"
of time, and nothing but his failure to survive the settlors
could prevent it. Blanchardv. Blanchard,supra. Moore
v. Lyons, 25 Wend. 119, 144. Succession is effected, as
cpmpletely- by a transfer of a life estate to one and remainder over to, another as by a transfer in fee. Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U. S. 339, 347-348. The
recent case 'of Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260,
furnishes a good illustration, of incomplete succession.
There the remainder was liable at any time during the
settlor's life to be divested&through the exertion of the
power of alteration and revocation that was reserved in
the instrument creating the trust. The. decision sustaining a transfer tax went Lipon thb ground that "the gift
taxed is. ., . one which never passed to the beneficiaries
beyond recall until the death of the donor. ...

.power of appointment reserved by the donor leaves the

The beneficiary's acquisition of the property is equally incomplete whether the power be reserved to the donor or
another." P. 271. See also Chase Nat. Bank v. United
States, 278 U. S. 327, 335, 338.
No Act of Congress has been held by this court
to
impose a tax upon possession and enjoyment, the right
to which had fully vested prior to the enactment.
Tyler v. United States, 281 T.. S. 497, held constitutional §§ 201 and 202 of the Revenue Acts of 1916, 39 Stat.
756, 777-778; and of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 277-278, which
included in the gross estate the value of an interest held
by decedent and any other person as tenaits by the entirety. In each case, the estate was created after the
passage of the applicable Act; and none of the property
constituting it had prior to its creation ever belonged to
the surviving spouse. The -court held that the Acts did
not impose a direct tax because, putting aside a common
law fiction and having regard to substance, the death of
one of the parties- was in fact the generating source of
important and definite accessions to the property rights
of the other. It held that the provisions were intended
to prevent an avoidanc; of the estate tax by the creation
of such tenancies and were obviously neither arbitrary-nor
capricious and so not violative of the Fifth Amendment.
Clapp v. Mason,. 94 U. S. 589, and Mason v. Sargent,
104 U. S. 689, arose under the succession tax Act of June
30, 1864, §§ 124 et seq., 13 Stat. 285. Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, and Hertz v. Woodman, 21S U. S.
205, arose under a similar Act of June 13, 1898, §§ 29
and 30, 30 Stat. 464. In all these cases, the property
vested in interest after the Acts took effect, and the-decisions went on the ground that the right to impose the
excises did not -accrue until the subsequent vesting in
possession and enjoyment. Under these Acts, the mere

passage of title was not sufficient; possession and enjoyment were also required. Wright v. Blakeslee, 101 U. S.
174, 177, went upon the ground that, up to the moment
of the life tenant's death, "her children had no interest
in the'land except a bare contingent remainder expectant
upon her death and their surviving her. At her death,
it came to them as an estate in fee in possession absolute."
This court has not sustained any state law imposing
an excise upon mere entry into possession and enjoyment
of property, where the right to such possession and enjoyment upon the happening of a specified event had fully
vested before the enactment.
In Cahenr v. Brewster, 203 U. S. 543, the testator died
May 26, 1904, the will was probated May 30, and a special
inheritance tax law was passed June 28. It' imposed a
tax upon all inheritances and legacies, and 'provided that
the tax should not be enforced when the property had
borne its just proportion of taxes prior to the time of
the inheritance and that the tax should be collected on
all successions not finally closed. The enactment was
assailed as repugnant to the due process and equal pro-'
tection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. This
court held that the State, without unconstitutional deprivation, could exercise its power to impose inheritance
taxes at any tine while it holds the property from the
legatee, p. 551 ; and, dealing with- the contention that
taxing successions not closed and exempting those that
had been closed operated to deny equal protection, the
court said (p. 552): "It was certainly not improper classification to make the tax depend upon a fact without which
it would not have been valid." As the court said in
U*?ted States v. Jones, 236 U. S. 106, 112, "It hardly
needs statement that personal property does not pass
directly from a decedent to legatees or distributees, but
goes primarily to the eecutor or administrator, who is

of the deceased and expenses of administration, and is
then to pass the residue, if any, to legatees or distributees."

in Moffitt v. Kelly, 218 U: S. 400, Moffitt married in
California in 1863 and resided there with his wife until
his death in 1906. By his will, he gave to her and their
children as if he had died intestate. A state law passed
in 1905 imposed a tax upon property so descending. The
state court sustained the tax upon the wife's share in the
community property. This court held that the nature
and character of her right was a,local question and that
the tax was not violative of the contract clause of the
Constitution or the due process or equal protection clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. In United States v. Robbins, 269 U. S. 315, this court considered the character
of the wife's estate during the existence of the community,
and said (p. 326): "We can see no sufficient reason to
doubt that the settled opinion of the Supreme Court of
California, at least with reference to the time before the
later statutes, is that the wife had a mere expectancy
while living with her husband. The latest decision 'that
we have seen dealing directly with the matter explicitly
takes that view, says that 'it is a rule of property that has
been settled f6r more thW sixty years . . ."

Chanler v. Kelsey, 205 V. . 466, arose under the New
York inheritance tax law of 1897. Prior to its enactment,
a father Conveyed property to trustees to pay the income
to his daughter for life with remainder to her issue in
fe or in default of issue to her heirs in fee, and gave her
power by 'wil to appoint the remainder among her issue
or heirs in such manner and proportions* as she might
tloefmie. She died in 1902 and by her will exercised the
power. The-tax law deemed such appointment a transfer
ana made it tixable. It was attacked as repugnant to the

602

Opinion of the Court.

282 U. S.

due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the
contract clause. This court held that without such appointment the estates in remainder would have gone to
all in the class named in the deeds; that, by the exercise
of the power, some were divested of their estates and the
same were vested in others, and that it was only on the
exercise of the power that the estates of the appointees
became -complete. And it sustained the tax. Justices
Holmes and Moody, dissenting, insisted that the succession was complete when the father's deeds took effect,
and that "the execution of the power did not depend in
any way upon the continued co~peration of the laws of
New York by way of permission or grant." P. 481.
The overwhelming weight 'of authority sustains the
conclusion that the succession in the present case was
complete when the deed took effect.
In Matter of Pell, 171 N. Y. 48, the testator's will gave
a life estate in his property to his widow with remainders
over at her death to his nephews and nieces and the issue
of any deceased nephew or niece together with a share
to his sister. He died in 1863. The life tenant died December 20, 1899, and at that time all the estates in remainder came into actual possession and enjoyment of
the beneficiaries. The Act of March 10, 1899 (c. 76, Laws
of that year) provided:
"All estates upon remainder . . .*vhich vested prior.

to June 30th, 1885, but which will not come into actual
-possession or enjoyment of the person

. . .

beneficially

interested therein until after the passage of this act, shall
be appraised and taxed as soon as the person . . . bene-

ficially interested therein 'shall be' entitled to the actual
posgessioni or enjoyment thereof."
The court said (p. 55):
"This court and the Supreme Court of the United
States have held in numerous cases that the transfer tax
is not imposed upon property, but upon the right of sue-

cession. It, therefore, follows that where there was a
complete vesting of a residuary estate before the enactment of the transfer tax statute, it cannot be reached by
that form of taxation. In the case before us it is an undisputed fact that these remainders had vested in 1863,
and the only contingency leading to their divesting was
the death of a remainderman in the lifetime of the life
tenant, in which event the children of the one so dying
would be substituted. If these estates in remainder were
vested prior to the enactment of the Transfer Tax Act
there could be in no legal sense a transfer of the property
at the time of possession and enjoyment. This being so,
to impose a tax based on the succession would be to
diminish the value of these vested estates, to impair the
obligation of a contract and take private property for
* public use without compensation."
Matter of Craig, 97 App. Div. 289 (affirmed, 181 N. Y.
•551), involved a similar state of facts. The court said
(p. 29C):
"The underlying principle which supports the tax is
that such right [the right of succession] is not a natural
one but is in fact, a privilege only, and that the authority
conferring the privilege may impose conditions upon its
exercise. But when the privilege has ripened into a right
it is too late to impose conditions of the character in
question, and when the right is conferred by a lawfully
executed'grant or contract it is property and not privilege,
and as such is protected from legislative encroachment
by constitutional guaranties."
In Hunt v. Wicht, 174 Cal. 205, the court held that a
deed delivered by grantor to a third person in escrow to
be delivered to grantee on the death of the grantor passed
a present title to the grantee, the grantor retaining only
a life estate; and. that the legislature was without power
subsequently to impose a succession tax accruing at the
termination of the grantor's life estate, simply because the

grantee was during the intervening life estate without
immediate possession of the property conveyed. The
court said (p. 209): "It is the vesting in interest that
constitutes the succession, and the question of liability
to such a tax must be determined by the law in force at
that time. . .
What We have said appears perfectly
clear on principle, and is sustained by practically all of
the authorities in other states where the question has
arisen."
In Lacey v. ,tate Treasurer, 152 Iowa 477, a contract
created a vested interest in .real- estate subject only to
postponement of the right of possession and enjoyment
until the death of the grantor. The court held that there
was a transfer of a present interest and that its character
was not affected by a condition therein, that might subsequently reduce the share of each grantee. It was also
held (pp. 483-484):
"Even though the remainder is so far conditional that
it may have to be opened up to let in afterborn children, and, on the other hand, may be divested by death
without iSsue of the person named, nevertheless it constitutes a vested interest, not subject to a subsequent
collateral inheritance tax statute, passed before the termination of the life estate. In re Seaman, 147 N. Y. 69.
Any attempted legislation imposing a collateral inheritance tax upon interests in remainder, which have become
vested by the taking effect of the will creating them,
would be unconstitutional.' In re Pell, 171 N. Y. 48.!
In Houston's Estate, 276 Pa 330, a deed irrevocably
conveyed property' in trust- to pay income to .the settlor

intended to 4ke effect in possession or enjoyment at or

of legislation which increased the rate to ten per cent.

taxable at five pepcent an4 9ta , Jhe higher rate fixed
by the later statute. The opinion of the Orphans'
Court, adopted by the Supremd-C.ourt, said (p. 331):
"Nor can it be successfullj argued that the tax is not
on the transfer of title to the property, but on the transfer
of enjoyment, for, as it seems to us, the act means by this
the right of enjoyment, and this was vested under th6
deed. If the tax is imposed when enjoyment is perfected
by actual.possession, and this theory is carried to its logical conclusion, it would seem that if, during the administration of an estate, delays occur, as they necessarily must,
and if, before actual distribution is made, the rate of taxation is changed, a legacy would be taxed at the changed
rate, which would appear to be a reductio ad absurdum."
In State ex rel. Tozer v. Probate Court, 102 Minn. 268,
an owner of much property organized a corporation and,
his wife joining, conveyed practically all to the corporation. It issued its shares to him and hb gave one-third
to her. Then they transferred the stock to their four
children who leased two-thirds to the father for his life
and one-third to the mother for her life. The father died
in 1905 after the taking effect of an inheritance tax law
enacted in that year. The court held that, the leases
vested in each parent a life estate in the stock and reserved to the children estates in reversion which were
beyond the control of the life tenants; and that the interests of the children vested when, the leases were made,
came into possession upon the termination of the life
estates and that the inheritance tax could not be collected
thereon. See also Commonwealth v Wellford, 114 Va.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS,

dissenting.

The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has construed and applied the statute as one taxing the taking
of possession of property by a remainderman whose interest, acquired before the death of the donor, vested in
possession and enjoyment, and free of a contingent gift
over, on the donor's 'death. That court said:
"The . . . statute . . . is' designed to include within
its sweep all methods of succession to property to take
effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the
grantor or donor . . . Whenever property is conveyed
upon such limitation that it will vest in interest, possession or enjoyment by reason of the death of the grantor
or donor, such succession falls within the descriptive
words. of the statute. The succession to any of these
attributes of property occurring as the result of the death
of, the grantor or donor constitutes the taxgble commodity."
And also said:
' The tax authorized by the statutes is a tax upon
'succession,' which includes the 'privileges enjoyed by
the beneficiary of spicceeding to the possession and enjoyment of property.' .
"The present tax is n 6 t laid on the donor, but on the
beneficiary; the gift taxed is not one long since completed,
but one which never passed to the beneficiaries beyond
recall until the death of the donor-. . . So long as the
privilege of. succession -has not been fully 'exercised it may
be reached by the tax."

203 U. S. 543; Sltonstall v. Saltonstal, supra.
The application of the statute, thus defined, is held by
this Court to be a denial of due process, and an impairment of the obligation of a contract, on the sole ground
that the remainder vested before the adoption of the taxing statute, although the enjoyment in possession of the
property, and the termination of the possibility of the
contingent gift over, both followed its enactmentU
The impiortance of the question is shown by the fact that fortyone states and territories have statutes containing provisions substantially similar to those of the Massachusetts acts involved in this

This is to deny to the Commonwealth the power to distinguish, in laying its tax, between the vesting of a defeasible future interest which,.carries. to the beneficiary
no assurance of future possessibn;or enjoyment, and the
later vesting of that interest by death in possession and
enjoyment of the tangible .property, without possibility
of being divested. It is to assert that the succession is
so complete upon the riee creation of the future interest
that the State must tax the future estate when that interest comes ifito being, or thereafter abstain entirely
from taxing it.
This position seems to,meqhntenable. It is founded on
the premise that the only privilege enjoyed by the holder
of a future interest in property is the dry legal abstraction of owning that particular interest-that if it vested
years ago, to tax the owner later, on, tdlocasion of his
coming into- actual possession, control and enjoyment of
the property, is in fact to tax himjlresently fo. the exercise of a privilege long since ejoyed.
In weighing the argument it is essential that; the tiathire
of the challenged ta* be kept clearly in mind.
Excises laid in respect of the prvilVge 'of transmitting
property rights at death, and those laid on the correlative
privilege of acquiring the same rights, are common. The
phrases "transfer," "estate" and "succession" taxes, and
"death duties," are somewhat indiscriminately used to
designate the two wholly different forms of tax. It will
tend to clarity to employ the more usual phraseology and
refer hereafter to the excise on the privilege of transmission as a transfer tax, and that on the privilege of
reception as a succession tax.'

Since no one has the natural right either to own property or to transfer it to others at his death, but derives
the power so to do solely from the State, the sovereign
may tax the owner for the privilege of transmission conferred by law. United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625,
628. The right, to receive and enjoy that which was
formerly owned by another is similarly derived, and upon

privilege accorded. Mager v. Grima, 8 How. 490, 494;

death. Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, 537; Edwards

death of its former owner. Keeney v. New York, 222

possession; -that was in the trustees. He could neither

In 1917 the parents conveyed their life estates to the
Ilidren. The latter, conceiving that this entitled them,
as sole owners, to the possession and enjoyment of the
property, demanded of the tiustees delivery of the corpus.
This was refused. The settlors then filed a bill to refofm
the trust instr.ument so that it should provide that by sur
render of the parents' life interests to the children the
trust should terminate. They alleged that it was the true
:ntent of .he parties that the contingent remainders in
the next of kin of the children. should not vest if the interestof the. settlors was released previous to the death of
'the survivor, and that appropriate language to express
&i.intent had by mistake been ormitted froin the deed.

The-appellants, nevertheless,:assert that while the children. may have required the State's aid at the time of the

needed to do nothing more 'to become possessed of and

of Massachusetts for the right of possession or enjoy'ment; and that consequently an alleged taxing of the

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

RoBERTS, J., dissenting.

succession on the occasion of their acquiring such possession and enjoyment is but a thinly veiled attempt retroactively to tax the acquisition of an interest which vested
in 1907.
But it is obvious that the children did rely on the law
of Massachusetts for their right to receive the trust property from the trustees; and it might well have been they
would have had to resort to her courts to obtain possession. All the law applicable to the administration of
trusts, regulating the acts of trustees, giving remedies
for trustees' defaults, providing for their compensation,
and requiring the full execution of their fiduciary duties,
was available to appellants. Without it their future interest, by way of remainder, might have been the merest
shadow.
In spite of this, it is said that the succession is one and
entire; that it must be taxed at its inception 6r not at
all; that it is wholly out of the ordinary to tax it on the
occasion of its fruition in possession; and that this Court
has held the attempt so to do violative of the Constitution. The converse of these propositions is true. This
Court has repeatedly approved the selection of the event
of possession and enjoyment as the proper occasion for
the imposition of an excise; and every applicable decision of the Court sustains the validity of the tax and
supports the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court
of Massachusetts.
First.'In laying succession taxes the United States
has chosen as the occasion therefor not the acquirement
of a mere technical legal interest in property, but the
coming into-actual possession and enjoyment; and this
fact has been recognized by this Court.
By the act of June 30, 1864, § 124, a tax was imposed
on legacies and distributive shares' arising from personal
property ". . . passing, after the passage of this act,
from any person possessed of such property, either- by

will or by the intestate laws ... or any personal property or interest therein, transferred by deed, grant, bargdIn, sale or gift, made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment'after the death of the grantor or
bargainor . . .
Section 127 provided that "every past or future dis-.
.,position of real estate by will, deed, or laws of descent,
-by reason whereof any person shall become beneficially
entitled, in possession or expeatancy, to any real estate,
or the income thereof, upon. the death.of any person dying
after the passage of this act," should constitute the person
so taking a successor and make him liable to a tax.
In Clapp -V.
Mason, 94 U. S. 589, a testator, who died
in. 1867, devised real estate to his widow for life, with
remaindar to her, children. She died, in 1872, and the
children's interests then took effect in enjoyment. The
tax was assessed in 1873. It was paid under protest be-.
cause the act of June 30, 1864, had been repealed -by aot
of Jily 14; 1870, on all legacies and successions after
August 1, 1870, In an action against the collector to
recover the amount paid, he defended on the gtound
that the tax accrued on creation of the remainder in
1867. The devisees in remainder contended that it did
not accrue until they came into possession, which was
subsequent to the repeal of the taxing act. This Court
held that the occasion of the tax was not the vesting of
the remainder, but the coming into possession by the successor. The corollary seems clear enough that if a renainderman'had died during the! life estate the statute
would not have justified a.tax upon him measured by the
clear value of the property in which he owned only a
future interest.
The case was followed in Mason v. Sargent, 104 U. S.
689, which involved 'a trust of personal property created
by the same will. Testator's daughter was entitled to
the'income of the trust for'life, and on her death the

ROBERTS, J., dissenting.

principal was to be paid to her children. It was held
that no tax was due until the termination of the life
trust, for until then the children had neither possession
nor enjoyment.'
By act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, § 29 (30 Stat. 448, 464)
an excise was imposed relating first to legacies or distributive shares passing by death and arising from personal property, and secondly to any personal property or
interest therein transferred by deed, grant, bargain, sale
or'gift to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the
death of the grantor or bargainor, in fav6r of any person
or persons, in trust or otherwise. In Vanderbilt v. Bidman, 196 U..S. 480, 492, this Court said:
"As to this second class, the statute specificalI*- makes
the liability for taxation depend, not upon the mere vesting in a technical sense of title to the gift, but upon the
actual possession or enjoyment thereof. - By any'fair construction the limitation as to possession or enjoyment expressed as to one class must be applied to the other, unless
it be found that the statute, whilst treating the two as
one and the same for the purpose of the imposition of
the death duty, has yet subjected them to different rules."
After analyzing the words of the statute in order to
arrive at its intent, the Court said [p. 495]:
"In view of the express provisions of the stitute as to
possession or enjoyment and beneficial interest and clear
value, and of the absence of any express language exhibiting an intention to tax a mere technically vested interest in a case where the right to possession or enjoyment was subordinated to an uncertain contingency, it
would, we think, be doing violence to the statute to construe it as taxing such an interest before the period when
possession or enjoyment had attached."

Rankin, 8 Fed. 872.

282 U. S.

While there was no question of retroactivity in that
case, for the reason that the statute antedated the creation of the trust, there was an attempt to tax vested
interests subject to be diensted prior to the time when it
could be ascertained whether they would ever take effect
in actual possession or enjoyment, and this the Court
held could not be done in view of the language of the
statute.'
'In Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, Vanderbilt v.
Ridman was followed. There a repealing act had been
passed between the time of a decedent's death and the
time for payment of -alegacy under his will in accordance
with the rules of administration. The Court held that
as the legatee had become fully entitled to possession
prior to the passage of the repealer he was liable for the
tax. The dissenting justices, while -not differing from
the m'ajority in the view that the tax was lafd upon thecoming into beneficial enjoyment and possession, were
of opinion that until actual payment of the legacy the
tax was 'not due, and therefore the repealing act had
abolished it prior to the time fixed for its incidence upon
the succession..
The foregoing'cases are cited, not because they involve
:any constitutional questions, but because they answer in
no uncertain. terms the appellants' insistent argument
that here the succession consists of but a single item,-the
creation of a future interest,-and that upon the coming
*into being of that interest the succession is so cpmplete
as to prohibit the sovereign's imposing its excise as of
the occasion of enjoyment and possession by the successor.
Th6y constitute a complete demonstration of the fallacy
of the argument that a piivilege tax which ignores the
creation of the mere technical future interest and reaches

the possession and enjoyment of property pursuant to
such interest is unheard of or in any wise out of the
ordinary.
Second. The sanction of this Court has been given to
the collection of a like excise by the United States, under
a statute similar to that here in question, and in circumstances like those in the case at bar.
A testator who died in 1846 devised real estate to his
daughter for life, with remainder in fee to her son should
he survive her. The daughter died in 1865. The collector's demand that the remainderman make return of his
remainder for taxation under the act of 1864, above cited,
was refused.. The tax was assessed with penalty; payment was made under protest; and suit brought to recover the amount paid. Judgment for the collector was
affirmed as to the tax,; but, on grounds here immaterial,
was reversed as to the, penalty. - Wright v. Blake'slee, 101
U. S. 174.6
The remainder was contingent, but it was urged that
it was a form of future estate known to the law, which
had vested in the son in 1846 and must be taxed, if at all,
as of that date. But this Court was clear that the tax was
laid on the event which occurred in 1865, quoting the
words of the act to show that there was a "past" "disposition of real estate by will" "by reason whereof" the
life tenant's children became "beneficially entitled, in
possession" to the property devised "upon the death of
[a] person dying after the passag& of this act." The brief
for appellant shows he argued that the phrase "past disposition" must be construed only to cover the case of a
deed or will executed prior to the passage of the law, but
legally operative thereafter, in order to avoid a retroactive effect of the statute and interference with vested

McCartney, 4 Clifford 101, where apparently no attack was made on

rights. He also insisted that the construction placed upon
the act by the collector brought about an arbitrary result.
So little did this Court regard the argument that it does
-not even notice it in its opinion. The Fifth Amendment
obviously applied in that case, if the Fourteenth applies
in the present.
. Third, In cases involving the application of state laws
.imposing succession taxes, in circumstances such as are
,here found, this Court has overruled the contentions here
nade, and sustained the tax. The facts involved in some
of these cases were more favorable to the appellants' cont~ntionsthan those in the case at bar.
In Cahena v. Brewster, 203 U. S. 543, the decedent, a
resident of Louisiana, died May 26, 1904.; his will was
probated May 30; a final accounting was made and
tableau of distribution submitted to the Probate Court
on August 3. These were approved and distribution
ordered by a judgment of August 16. On October 16,
the universal legatees petitioned the Probate Court for
the delivery of the residuary estate to them. The executors answered that a"tax was due on the legacies which
they were bound to withhold. On June 28, 1904, a
ktatute had been passed which imposed a tax applicable
to all successions not finally closed at th; date of its
passage and all that should thereafter be opened. There
were no forced heirs, and under the statutes of Louisiana
the universal legatees were vested by law at the momernt,
of death with full title to the property without taking any
'step whatever to-put themselves into possession, without
demanding delivery, or signifying their assent to accept
tHe prolierty b.queathed. The statutes are quoted in
the margin, 20311. S. 549.
The' petitioners argued that the taxing act 'as applied
to them was violative of the Fourteenth Amendment bedause retroactive and arbitrary. The Supreme Court of
Louisiana sustained the tax. This Court affirmed, hold-

ROBERiS, J., dissenting.

ing that the State was at liberty to decide at what point
it would impose the tax, provided such imposition was
prior to the legatees' actual possession of the property.7
Appellants' attempt to distinguish this case is uncon-.
vincing. They say that it merely decided that the State
had the power to lay the tax so long as the property was
under the control of its courts for administration. They
overlook the fact that in the instant case the possession
of the trustees of the Coolidge trust did not cease until
the death of the survivor of.the settlors. During all that
time the trust property was under the control of the
Massachusetts courts. Not until those trustees had
settled their trust and made distribution in accordance
with the law of Massachusetts could the remaindermen,
come ito possession and enjoyment of the property. And
obviously the operation of the law of Massachusetts as

to credits for expenses and commissions, and as to the
duties of the trustees, and as to delivery of the trust property, might all be invoked before the beneficiaries could
get actual possession and enjoyment. It is certainly an
immaterial difference thht in the one case the fiduciaries
were called executors and in the other trustees. Both were
subject to the law of the State, which defined and protected the. rights of beneficiaries in both cases. The Coolidge children could not obtain possession or control of the
corpus despite their parents' release of all interest in it.
The trustees still.had duties to perform.- Coolidge v.
Loring, supra. Cahen v. Brewster presents a more extreme case than this, because it involved no such. contingency of divestment as is here involved; the executors
7Carpenterv. Pennsylvania, 17 How. 456 dealt with a similar situation and the tax was sustained. It was decided prior to the adoption
of the Fourteenth Amendment; but in Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278,
286, it was said that the grounds on which it went were pertinent
under the amendment.

there having completed their administration, the act of
physical delivery only remained to be performed by them.,
In Chanlerv. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466, one Astor, in 1844,
1848, 1849 and 1865, made deeds to trustees, which provided that the income should go to his daughter Laura
for life, with remainder to her issue in fee, or in default
thereof, to her heirs in fee, with power of appointment
amongst her issue in such amounts and proportions as
she should,-by instrument in its nature testamentary,
to be acknowledged by her as a deed in the presence of
two witnesses, or published by her as a will,-appoint.
She died in 1902 and by will exercised the power. An
act of 1897 imposed a succession tax, and under its provisions the authorities sought to collect, from the appointees under the daughter's will. The argument made
on behalf of the beneficiaries was that the gift was completed when Astor made his deeds. It will b6 noted that
the remainders were in that case vested, subject to be
divested by the daughter's exercise of the power. The
argument was strongly pressed that in the case of a power
of appointment title passes under the creating instrument, and does not pass from the donee by virt'ie of his
act of appointment. That this is sound law is undisputed. On this doctrine the beneficiaries founded their
argument, that to tax the succession upon the occasion
of their coming into possession and enjoyment was to ta'x
something which had in fact occurred years before at
the date of the delivery of the deeds by ,Astor. This is
the same argument appellants now urge upon facts
which present no significant legal difference from those
in the Chanler case. The Court of Appeals of New York

In Stauffer's Succession, 119 La. 66, it was held that where, the

statute would be to give it a retroactive effect; and reference was
made to the Cahen case.

ROBERTs, J., dissenting.

held the tax not offensive to any constitutional principle.
This Court affirmed. In so doing, it disiegarded the
technical situation and looked to the substance of the
matter.' At p. 473 it used the following language:
"However technically correct it may be to say that
the estate came from the donor and not from the donee
of the power, it is self-evident that it was only upon the
exercise of the power that the estate in the plaintiffs -in
error became complete. Without the exercise of the
power of appointment the estates in remainder would
have gone to all in the class named in the deeds of William B. Astor. By the exercise of this power some were
divested of their 6states and the same were vested in
others. It "may be that the donee had no interest in
the estate .as owner, but it took her act of appointment
to finally transfer the estate to som6 of the class and take
it from others."
'-

"See also, to the same effect, Orr v. Gilman, supra.
Taxes have been sustained where a statute passed after the
creation of a future interest imposed a tax on the occasion of the
acquisition of possession and enjoyment due to the failure to exercise
a power of appointment, the exercise of which w6uld have divested
such future interest. Saltonstall v. Satonstall, 276 U. S. 260, infra;
Minot v. Treasurer,207 Mass. 588; Manning v. Board,46 R. I. 400;
Montague v. State, 163 Wis. 58; State v. Brooks, (Minn.), 232 N. W.
Rep. 331. Such cases are authority against appellants' contention..
The "estate" or "interest" of the beneficiary is just as truly vested
in such a case as here; it is equally true that he has to do nothing but
,vait to come into possession and enjoyment. In both instances some
future event, either a voluntary act of the donor or the holder of the
power, or an event certain to happen but uncertain as to the time of
its happening, may deprive him of the possibility of possession and
enjoyment. See contra, Re Lansing, 182 N. Y. 238; Re Chapman,
117 N. Y. S. 679. The courts of New York thus hold that possession
and- enjoyment due to the exercise of a power of. appointment is
taxable though the legal estate springs from the original instrument
which antedated the taxing statute, while that due to non-exercise of
the power is not.

In Moffitt v. Kelly, 218 U. S. 400, the facts were these:
Moffitt married in California in 1863 and resided there
with his wife until his death in 1906. By his will he gave
his estate to his wife and children as if he had died intestate. The probate court held that his widow's interest
in the marital community was within the provisions of a
law passed, in 1905 taxing all devolutions of property by
will or intestacy. The question was, therefore, whether
a surviving wife was liable for a tax, which, as applied,
could only be incident to her coming into untrammeled
possession and enjoyment of what she had technically
owned prior to the passage of the taxing statute. The
Supreme Court of California held the tax valid against
her insistence that this was a violation of the contract
clause, the due process clause, and the equal protection
clause of the Federal Constitution. This Court sustained
the judgment, and.said [p. 403]:
But in every conceivable aspect this proposition must
rest upon on6 or both of two theories, either that the nature and character of the right or interest was such that
the State could not tax it without violating the Constitution of the United States, or that if it could be generically
taxed without violating that instrument, for some particular reason the 6therwise -valid state power of taxation
could not be exerted without violating the Constitution of
the United States. The first conception is at once disposed of by saying that it is elementary that the Constitution of the United States does not, generally speaking,
control the power of the States to select and classify subjects of taxation, and hence, even although the .vife's right
in the community property was a vested right which could
not be impaired by subsequent legislation, it was, nevertheless, within the power of the State, without violating the
Constitution of the United States, in selecting objects
of taxation, to select the vesting in complete possession and enjoyment by wives of their shares in community

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

ROBERTS,

property consequent upon the death of their husbands,
and the resulting cessation of their power t6 control the
same and enjoy the fruits thereof. And this also disposes
of the second conception, since if the State-had the power
so far as the Constitution of the United States was concerned, to select the vesting of such right to possession
and efijoyment as a subject of taxation, dearly the mere
fact that the wife had a preexisting right to the property
created no exemption from taxation if the selection for
taxation would be otherwise legal. It follows, therefore,
that the mere statement of the contention demonstrates
the mistaken conception upon which, in the nature of
things, it rests.
"It is said, however, that the reasoning just stated,
while it may be abstractly sound, is here inapplicable,
because the thing complained of in this case is that the
State of California has imposed an inheritance tax upon
the share of the wife in the community and thereby taxed
her as an heir of her husband, when if the laws existing
at the time of the celebration of the marriage be properly
construed and be held to be contractual she took her
share of the property on her husband's death, not as an
heir to property of which he was the owner, but by virtue
of a right of ownership vested in her prior to the death
of the husband, although the right to possess and efijoy
such property was deferred and arose only on his death.,
But for the purpose of enforcing the Constitution of the
United States we are not concerned with the mere desig-..
nation affixed to the tax which the court below upheld,
or whether- the thing or subject taxed may or may not
have been mistakenly brought within the state taxing
law. We say so because in determining whether the
imposition of the tax complained of, violated the Constitution of the United States, we are solely confined to
considering whether the State had the lawful power, without violating the Constitution of the 'United States , to

282 U. S.

levy a tax upon the subject or thing taxed. This being
true, as it clearly results from what we have said that
the vesting of the wife's right of possession and enjoyment arising upon the death of her husband was subject
to be taxed by the State, so far as the Constitution of
the United States was concerned, it follows that whether
the tax imposed was designated or levied as an inheritance tax or, any other is a matter with which we have
no concern.'

'Whatever may be said of the nature of the wife's interest in community property, this decision assumes the
wife's vested interest in her half thereof; and that its free
and unencumbered enjoyment only was postponed to the
husband's death. There can be no difference in legal
effect between that situation and one presented by the
division of the total interests in a given property into a
life tenancy and a remainder.
The authority of the eases just noted has not heretof6re been questioned in this court, and for years they
have stood unqualified in the vindication of the constitutional validity of just such a tax as is now under attack.
Fourth. In all its decisions touching death duties,
whether on successions or on transfers, this Court has
enunciated principles which sustain the validity of the
tax.
The most recent expression with respect to a succession
tax concerned the very laws of Massachusetts the application of which-is here called in question.
In Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260, one Brooks,
on. various dates between 1905 and 1907, executed deeds
to trustees, which provided that the 'income should be
paid to the settlor for life, or, if he elected, should be accumulated, and that upon his and his wife's deaths the
income should be paid to his children in spenidthrift trust,
with gifts over. The instruments reserved to the grantor

ROBERTS, J., dissenting.

certain powers of management of the trust and also provided that their terms might be changed by him with the
concurrence of one trustee. Brooks died in 1920, having
three times changed the trusts,-the last time in 1919.
At the time the deeds were executed there was no statute
taxing the succession to children of a decedent. But prior
to Brooks' death the act of 1907, which: is 'involved in
the present case, had been passed, and had been amended
by an act of 1909 taxing the acquisition of possession and'
enjoyment of property by virtue of the exercise of a power
of appointment or by reason of the failure to exercise it.
The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that
the power of revocation reserved to Brooks was equivalent to the creation of a power of appointment in him,
and that since the beneficiaries could not be certain of
taking until his death, the gift was one made or intended
to take effect in possession or enjoyment after his death;
and that the tax was on the succession, which includes
the "privileges enjoyed by the beneficiary of succeeding
to the possession and enjoyment of property." There as
here it was claimed that the beneficiaries had vested interests subject to be divested by a future event (in that case,
the exercise of the power), which never happened, and they
argued that the tax law was retroactive in its operation
if applied to their interests, and hence violated the due
process clause, the equal protection clause, and probably
Art. I, § 10 of the Constitution. There as here it was
insisted that the remaindermen needed nothing'from the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts subsequent to the vesting of their remainders.
After pointing out that the excise was not on the privilege of transmission, as was the Federal estate tax dealt
with in Nichols v. Coolidge, but was upon the privilege,
of succession, which might constitutionally be subjected
to a tax by the State, whether occasioned by death or

effected by deed, and after calling attention to the fact
that the tax was imposed not on the donor, but on the
beneficiary, this Court said [p. 271]:
the gift taxed is not one long since completed,
but one which "never passed to the beneficiaries beyond
recall until the death of the donor; and the value of the
gift at that operative moment, rather than at some later
date, is the basis of the tax."
The Court further stated that,
"'So long as the privilege of succession has not been
fully exercised it may be reached by the tax."
Again the Court said [p. 271]:
"I. ,. in determining whether it has- been -so exercised technical distinctions between vested remainders
and other ihterests are of little avail, for the shifting of
the economi& benefits and burdens of property, which is
the subject of a succession tax, may even in the case of
a v.__ed remiinder be restricted Ol&suspended by other
legal devices."
One of such other "legal devices" is a provision "divesting" a remainder which is "vested."
As the above quotation shows, the essential question
in all such cases is whether the succession has become
complete by actual possession and enjoyment, prior to
the passage of the taxing act.
Notwithstanding the distinction between a transfer tax
and a succession tax, the decisions under the Federal
estate tax statutes (transfer tax laws) are convincing
on the matter of substantiality as against technicality.
The Court has uniformly disregarded the technical aspect
of a transfer and looked at the reality and substance of
the transaction. There is, in this aspect, no logical distinction 'between the two kinds of excise.
In Chase National Bank v. United States, 278 U. S.
327, where the beneficiaries' interests were admittedly
vested, the Court reiterated the principle stated in Salton-

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

ROBERTS,

J., dissenting.

stall v. Saltonstall; that the test of constitutionality is
the incidence of the tax on the shifting of economic benefit, and not on the passage of a mere technical legal title.
Thus it said [p. 338:
"Termination of the power of control at the time of
death inures to the benefit of him who owns the property
subject to the power and thus brings about, at death, the
completion of that shifting of the economic benefits of
property which is the real subject of the tax, just as
effectively as would its exercise, which latter may be subjected to a privilege tax, Chanler v. Kelsey, 205 U. S.
466."
In Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S. 497, the Court considered the estate tax provisions of the Revenue Acts of
1916 and 1921. Both acts contained a provision that
upon the death of one of two tenants by the entireties
there should be included in the amount of the decedent's
estate, for the purpose of measuring the tax, the value of
the joint estate property, "except such part thereof as
may be shown to have originally belonged to" the surviving joint tenant, "and never to have belonged to the
decedent." Under this provision the United States assessed 9, tax against the estates of Pennsylvania and
Maryland decedents. Collection was resisted., on the
ground that, by the common law of those States, tenants
by the entireties are seised of the whole and of every part
of the joint.estate, and that the survivor had a vested
estate long prior to the passage of the acts.
It was conceded that at the death of one, nothing descends to the survivor; the latter. has in the eye of the
law, no more and no less than he or she had beforetechnitally speaking there is no succession.
But Congress expressed a purpose to .tax the passage
of something from the decedent at death; just as here te
Massachu~etts legislature showed its intent to tax the

acquisition of something which accrued to the beneficiaries at the death of the settlor. In the instant case the
so-called vested estate of the beneficiaries was subject to
be divested by their death prior to that of the survivor
of the grantors. In the Tyler case the estate was absolutely vested; not only so, but it was in law as large qua
the survivor after the death of his co-tenant as it had
been when both were alive; it could not be divested by
the act of either party; it could not be taken in execution
of a judgment against either party; the survivor needed
to iiiake no demand upon anyone for possession.
The taxpayers argued in the Tyler case, on precisely the
same ground as appellants now urge, that the survivor's
interest had vested long prior to the adoption of the
Revenue Acts; that no transfer of title or interest in
property occurred on the death of one of the tenants by
the entireties, and consequently the .tax was arbitrary and
in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because the subject
or event on which the tax must be predicated was wanting. But the Court had no difficulty in holding that what
happened at the death of one of the tenants was a transfer from the decedent of something which was the legitimate subject of an excise. The Court said (p. 503) :
"The question here, then, is,not -whether there has
been, in the strict sense of that word, a 'transfer' of the
property by the death of the decedent, or a receipt of it
by right of succession, but whether the death has brought
into being or ripened for the survivor, property rights of
such character as to make appropriate the imposition
of a tax upon that result (which Congress may call a
transfer tax, a death duty or anything else it sees fit),
to be measured, in whole or in part, by the value of
such rights."
Language more closely descriptive of the situation presented in the present case could not be employed. Again
the Court said (pp. 503-504):

COOLIDGE v. LONG.

ROBERTS,

J., dissenting.

"According to the amiable fiction of the common law,
adhered to in Pennsylvania and Maryland, husband and
wife are but one person, and the point made is, that by
the death of one party to this unit no interest in property held by them as tenants by the entirety passes to
the other. This view, when applied to a taxing act,
seems quite unsubstantial. The power of taxation is a
fundamental and imperious necessity of all government,
not to be restricted by mere legal fictions. Whether that
power has been properly exercised in the present instance
must be determined by the actual results brought about
by the death, rather than by a consideration of the artificial rules which delimit the title, rights and powers of
tenaits by the entirety at -common law. :See Nicol v.
Ames, 173 U. S. 509, 516; Saltonstallv. Saltonstall,supra,
p. 271.
"Taxation, as it many times has been said, is eminently
practical, and a practical mind, considering results, would
have some difficulty in accepting the conclusion that the
death of one of the tenants in each of these cases did not
have the effect 6f passing to the survivor substantial
rights, in respect of the property, theretofore never enjoyed
by such survivor. Before the death of the husband (to
take the Tyler case, No. 428,) the wife had the right
to possess and use the whole property, but so, also, had
her husband; she could not dispose of the property except
with her husband's concurrence; her rights were hedged
about at all points by the equal rights of her husband.
At his death, however, and because of it, she, for the
first time, became entitled to exclusive possession, use
and enjoyment; she ceased to hold the property subject
to qualifications imposed by the law relating to tenancy
by the entirety, and became entitled to hold and enjoy
it absolutely as her own; and then, and then only, she
acquired the power, not theretofore possessed, of disposing of the property by an exercise of her sole will. Thus

628

ROBERTS,

282 U.S.

the death of one of the parties to the tenancy became the
' genelating source' of important and definite accessions
to the property rights of the other. These circumstances,
together with the fact, the existence of which the statute
requires, that no part of the property originally had belonged to the wife, are sufficient, in our opinio, to make
valid the inclusion of the property in the gross estate
which forms the primary base for the measurement of
the tax. And in that view the resulting tax attributable
to such property is plainly indirect."
Every word of the above quotation applies with as
great force to the beneficiaries of the Coolidge trust as it
applied in that case to the surviting tenant.
In Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U. S. 339, a
testator who died in 1922 had, in the period between
1903 and 1919, while not in contemplation of death,
executed seven trust indentures. Two of these provided
that the income. should. be paid to the settlor for life;
and after his death to named persons, with remaindets
over. These deeds reserved a power of revocation to the
settlor alone. The remaining five provided for life in-,
comes to certain persons, terminable five years after the
settlor's death, or upon the death of the life tenants,
whichever should first happen, with remainders over'
Powers of amendment were reserved in these, not to
the settlor alone, but jointly to the settlor -and certain
beneficiaries. One of the seven trusts was modified in
a matter immaterial to the decision and the others were
not modified or revoked. In calculating the amount of
the Federal estate tax the United States sought to include the property embraced in all seven of the trusts.
It was held that as to the two trusts in which the settlor
had unrestricted power, of revocation the transfer was
not complete until his death. As to the five trusts in
which the settlor did not have such power in himself
alone, but had power of amendment jointly with bene-

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

ROBERTS,

J., dissenting.

ficiaries, it was decided that the property had for all
practical purposes passed completely from his control.
It was pointed out that the reservation of powers of
management in the settlor, as distinguished from the right
to revoke or change the beneficiaries of the trust, was
insignificant, and that the essential test was the passage
of the economic benefit or enjoyment of the property.
Thus it was said [p. 346]:
"Nor did, the reserved powers of management of the
trusts save to decedent any control over the economic
benefits or the enjoyment of the property. He would
equally have reserved all these powers and others had
he made himself the trustee, but the transfer would
not for that reason have been incomplete. The shifting
of the economic interest in the trust property which was
the subject of the tax was thus complete as soon as the
trust was made. His power to recall the property and
of control over it for his own benefit then ceased and as
the trusts were not made in contemplation of death, the
reserved powers do not serve to distinguish them from
any other gift inter vivos not subject to the tax."
Repeatedly throughout the opinion the passage of the
control, possession and enjoyment of the property is
referred to as the touchstone of the incidence of the tax.
If that be the test when the privilege of the transferor
is under investigation, no reason is apparent Why the
same yardstick should not be used when we are considering acquisition of rights by the beneficiary.
Thus the Reinecke case is a full authority for the disregard of mere legal interests as distinguished from substantial rights of control or enjoyment. Technically
speaking, the remainders to the beneficiaries in that case
were vested subject only to be divested by the exercise
of a power of revocation reserved to the grantor. It has
been argued in the instant case that the vested estates
created by the deed of 1907 never were divested; that

630

ROBERTS, J1., dissenting.

282 U.S.

the event which could work a divestiture never occurred.
That was equally true in the Reinecke case.
It might well have been argued in the Reinecke case
that the right of revocation reserved by the grantor did
not constitute an interest in the property; was not a
property right, and therefore the grantor having parted
with all legal interest his estate could not be taxed as
upon the transfer of any property or any interest recognized by the law. Such an argument would have been
technically sound under Jones v. Clifton, 101 U. S. 225,
230, where it was said of such a power:
"The title to the land and policies passed by the deeds;a power only was reserved. That power is not an interest
in the property which can be transferred to another, or
Nor is the
sold on execution, or. devised by will ....
power a chose in action."
The reasoning in the Reinecke case shows that such
an argument would have been of no avail. No more
ought the argument of appellants, based upon the socalled vesting of the future interest at the execution of
the deed, prevail in this case.
It is said that the death of the settlors has no necessary
relation to the benefits received by the remaindermen;
that any other event might as well have been chosen as
the occasion for the commutation of the children's future
interests into interests in fee simple in possession; and
that this in itself makes the tax arbitrary and unreasonable because the incident which occasions its imposition
is irrelevant. This Court has negatived this contention..
In Keeney v. New York, supra,it was said [p. 5361:
"There can be no arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination. But when there is a difference it need not be
great or conspicuous in order to warrant classification.
In the present instance, and so far as the Fourteenth
Amendment is concerned, the State could put transfers
intended to take effect at the death of the grantor in a

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
682

RoBERTs, J., dissenting.

class with transfers by descent, will or gifts in contemplation of the death of the donor, without, at the same time,
taxing transfers intended to take effect on the death of
some person other than the grantor, or on the happening
of a certain or contingent event."
And in the same case it was said [p. 535]:
"Where the grantor makes a transfer of property to
take effect on the death of a third person, it might . . . be
taxed as a devolution or succession." 11
And in Chase National Bank v. United States, supra,

the same'principle was announced at page

338.12

Appellants rely on Nichols v. Coolidge, supra; Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142; Untermyer v. Anderson,
276 U. S. 440; Chase National Bank v. United States,
supra; and Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., supra, as in
principle supporting their position. The Reinecke case
and the Chase National Bank case have already been
alialysed. It is evident from what has been said that
appellants can derive no comfort from those decisions.
Of course the test to be applied in cases arising under
the Federal estate tax law is whether the transferor has
parted with every vestige of control over the beneficial enjoyment and possession of the property, and not whether
the beneficiary has received it. Nichols v. Coolidge dealt,
n See also BakIe v. McCartney, 4 Clifford, 101, where under a

bequest in trust effective in 1847, two successive life estates were
created, the second of which took effect in possession in 1867, and it
was held the beneficiary was liable for tax tnder the act of 1864.
The court said: "The argument for the plaintiff is, that the tax can
only be imposed by virtue of the section in question, where the death
of the predecessor is the cause of the successor's being entitled to
possession of the real estate, and not where it is merely the occasion,
as in this case; but the proposition finds no support in the language of
the provision, and the rule in the Exchequer Court of England is well
settled, the other way."

under the Federal estate tax law, with the same trust
invblved in this case, and the inquiry there necessarily
was whether prior to the passage of the estate tax act the
grantors had so fully .divested themselves of all right
of control and enjoyment of the property that nothing
remained to pass out 5f them at death. The facts were
held to make an affirmative answer imperative. Here,
on the other hand, we inquire, not whether the grantor
has parted with title, control and enjoyment, but whether
the grantee has fully acquired them prior to the passage
of the law.
In Blodgett v. Holden and Untermyer v. Anderson the
Court had under consideration a transfer tax laid on
the donor in respect of gifts made inter vivos. The gifts
in those cases were complete prior to the passage of the
taxing statute, and, as in Michols v. Coolidge, technical
title, power to recall, and beneficial use and enjoyment
had all passed from the donor prior to the legislative
attempt to -tax the gift. These circumstances demonstrate that neither case is an authority for holding a succession tax invalid if levied on the occasion of the acqui-'
sition of possession and enjoyment of property by the
donee.
Finally, appellants cite Matter of Pell, 171 N. Y. 48,
and certain cases in state courts which have followed it.
That case adopts he -views urged by appellan-J. It was
followed in Hunt v. Wicht, 174 Cal. 205.
Houston's Estate, 276 Pa. 330, involved no constitutional question. The statute in that case was construed
to apply only to interests thereafter created.'
In Lacey v. State Treasurer,152 Ia. 477, and Common.wealth v Wellford, 114 Va. 372, the statutes were construed as affecting only interests thereafter arising, -fhough
in both there were dicta to the effect that a contrary construction would render them unconstitutional. 'The dic'

turn in the Lacey case is repugnant to the later decision
in Brown v. Gulliford, 181 Ia. 897.
State v. Probate Court, 102 Minn. 268, is not only distinguishable on its facts, as later held by the same court
(State v. Brooks, 232 N. W. 331, 334), but the constitutional question here raised was not discussed.
In a well considered case, involving precisely the same
question as Cahen v. Brewster, supra, the tax was sustained. Gelsthorpe v. Furnell, 20 Mont. 299.
It cannot, therefore, be said, as -appellants contend, that
there is any considerable body of state decisions in their
favor.
The reasoning of the state court cases which have held
the tax invalid is flatly contrary to the*decisions of this
Court in the cases abore discussed; and, in view of that
fact, it should not prevail here.
The Massachusetts court described the tax as one on
the succession, and we have dealt with it on that basis;
but it is neither necessary to sustain it nor permissible
to defeat it by applying to it any particular descriptive
language. See Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, 279 U. S.
620, 625, 626; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, ante,
p. 379. Moffitt v. Kelly, supra; Tyler v. United States,
supra. A State's power to tax property is plenary. The
power to tax it as a whole necessarily embraces the power
to tax any of its incidents, or the use or enjoyment of
them,-provided only that the taxable occasion does not
antedate the taxing statute so as to render it invalid because retroactive. If the property itself may constitutionally be taxed, obviously it is competent to tax the
use of it, Billings v. United States, 232 U. S. 261; Hylton
v. United States, 3 Dall. 171; or a sale of it, Thomas v.
United States, 192 U. S. 363, 370; Nicol v. Ames, 173
U. S. 509; or the gift of it, Bromley v. McCaughn, 280
U. S. 124. And if the gift of it may be taxed, it is difficult

282 U.S.

to see upon what constitutional grounds the power to tax
the receipt of it, whether as the result of inheritance or
otherwise, may be denied to a State, whatever name may
be given the tax, and even though the right to receive it,
as distinguished from its actual receipt at a future date,
antedated the statute. Receipt in possession and enjoyment is as much a taxable occasion as the enjoyment of
any other incident of property. A levy upon the taking
possession of property acquired by inheritance is one of
the most ancient forms of tax known to the law. It existed on the European continent and in England prior
to the adoption of our Constitution."
A tax laid upon the succession after the future interest
has been created and the right accrued, but before the
actual enjoyment in possession of the property, is no
more a denial of due process than a tax laid upon income
accrued prior to the adoption of -he taxing statute but
received after its passage. The constitutionality of the
latter form of tax is now beyond question, Brushaber v.
Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 20; Lynch v. Hornby,
247 U. S.'339, 343; Taft v. Bowers, 278 U. S. 470, 483,
484; Cooper v. United States, 280 U. S. 409, 411.
The contention that taxation of a property right or
an incident of ownership previously created by a. deed
or contract impairs the obligation of the contract is not
new. But it must be denied both on reason 'and on.
authority. The present tax has no reference to the contract or its obligation save to recognize and observe the
existence of both. It would serve no useful purpose at
this late day to elaborate the doctrine, long since settled,
that"to be obnoxious t the contract clause, a statute must

act upon the contract so as to interfere with the right of
enforcement. All of the cases cited as supporting the
conclusion of the Court deal with such a situation. None
of them even remotely bears on the question here raised
whether a tax levied in respect of the future enjoyment of
property which chanced to be acquired under an earlier
contract impairs the contract. That question, often
raised, has always been' answered here in the negative.
In Orr v. Gilman, supra, it was claimed that a succession tax law enacted after the original deed granting a
power of appointment, and construed as taxing the beneficiary of the power, violated Art. I, § 10 of the Constitution. The argument was rejected.
A similar contention made in Chanlerv.Kelsey, supra,
was disposed of in these words [p. 478]:
"Nor do we perceive that the effect has been to violate
any contract right of the parties. It is said that this is
so, because instead of disposing of the entire estate,
ninety-five per cerit of the property included in the power
has been transferred and five per cent taken by the State;
but as there was a valid exercise of the taxing power of
the State, we think the imposition of such a tax violated
no contract because it resulted in the reduction of the
estate."
Justice White, in Moffitt v. Kelly, supra, said of a
similar contention:
"1. The alleged violation of the contract clause.-Considered merely subjectively, the contention is that the
rights vested in the wife as a partner in the community
existing by virtue of the constitution and laws of the
State of California governing at the time of the marriage
were contractual rights of such a character that -theycould
not be essentially changed or modified by subsequent
legislation without impairing the obligations of the contract, and thereby violating the Constitution of the United
States. But even although this theoretical proposition be

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
ROBERTS, J., dissenting.

282 U.S.

fully conceded, for the sake of the argument, it is apparent
that it is here a mere abstraction, .nd is therefore irrelevant to the case to be decided. We say this because there
is no assertion of the giving effect to any law enacted
subsequent to the contracting of the marriage which purports to essentially modify the rights of the wife in and
to the community, as those rights existed at the time the
marriage was celebrated. This is so because the state law,
the enforcement of which it is asserted will impair the obligation of the contract, is merely a law imposing a tax."
(218 U. S., pp. 402-403.)
The foregoing cases constitute only one application of
a principle which has been repeatedly applied not only
to rights derived under deeds in their aspect as contracts,
but to rights derived pursuant to all sorts of contracts.
It was said in North Missouri R. Co. v. Maguire, 20
Wall. 46, 61:
"Authorities from numerous sources are cited by the
plaintiffs, but none of them show that a lawful tax on a
new subject, or an increased tax on an old one, interferes
'with .,a contract or impairs its obligation, within the
meaning of the Constitution, even though such taxation
may affect particular contracts, as it may increase the
debt of one person and lessen the security of another, or
may impose additional burdens upon one class and release
the burdens of another, still the tax must be paid unless
prohibited by the Constitution, nor can it be said that
it impairs the obligation of any existing contract in its
true legal sense."
With respect to deeds and grants, this Court said in
Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 562:
"Land, for example, has, in many, perhaps in all the
states, been granted by government since the adoption
of the constitution. This grant is a contract, the object
of which is that the profits issuing from it shall enure
to the benefit of the grantee. Yet the power of taxation

COOLIDGE v. LONG.
582

ROBERTS,

J., dissenting.

may be carried so far as to absorb these profits. Does
this impair the obligation of the contract? The idea is
rejected by all; and the Proposition appears so extravagant, that it is difficult to admit any resemblance in
the cases."
In Kehrer v. Stewart, 197 U. S. 60, it was contended
that a statute levying a tax upon all agents of packing
houses doing business in the State, of $200, in each county
where such*business was carried on, impaired the obligation of the contract which an agent had entered, into with
a packing house. With respect to this contention this
Court said [p. 70]:
"The argument that the tax impairs the obligation of
a contract between the petitioner and Nelson Morris &
Company is hardly worthy of serious consideration. The
power of taxation overrides any agreeldent of an employe
to serve for a specific sum."
With respect to a tax upon income, it was said in
Murray v. Charleston,96 U. S. 432, 446:
"A tax on income derived from contracts, if it does
not prevent the receipt of the income, cannot be said to
vary or lessen the debtor's obligation imposed by the
contracts."
In Clement National Bank v. Vermont, 231 U. S. 120,
the claim was that a state statute which levied a tax on
bank deposits collectible from the depositor, and which
had to be deducted by the bank from the interest paid
to the depositor, impaired the obligations of the prior
contracts of depositors with the bank. This Court overruled the objection, saying [p. 143]:
"But this is clearly untenable. The statute did not
act upon such" contracts; it imposed a tax uhpor the property of depositors in the exercise of a power subject to
which the deposits -were.made."
In Lake Superior Mines v. Lord, 271 U. S. 577, the
obligation of an outstanding contract for the receipt of

638

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Syllabus.

282 U.S.

royalties on minerals mined was held not to be impaired
by a later state statute taxing the proceeds of the contract. The Court said [p. 581]:
"Titles to all the lands and leases were obtained subject to the State's power to tax. If the statute now in
controversy is within that' power, it cannot impair the
obligation of appellants' contracts; if beyond, it is, of
course, invalid. Accordingly, there is no occasion further
to discuss the application of Article I, Section 10."
In short, it is evident from the authorities cited, and
many more which might be. quoted, that the power to
tax property, or a right, or a status, or a privilege, acquired or enjoyed by virtue of a contract, is in no wise hindered or impeded by the fact of the existence- of the
contract whether it antedates or follows the effective date
of the taxing act. No exercise of a governmental power,
whether it be that of taxation, police, or eminent domain,
though it make less valuable the fruits of a private contract, can be said to impair the obligation thereof.
I think the judgment should be affirmed.
