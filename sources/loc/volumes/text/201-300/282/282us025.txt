SHERMAN ET AL. v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 14.

Argued October 30, 1930.-Decided November 24, 1930.

1. The penalties of the Safety Appliance Acts are imposed upon the
carrier only and cannot be enforced by action against the carrier's
officers and agents. P. 29.
2. The State Belt Railroad, a water-front line in the City of San
Francisco connecting many industrial plants and the line of. the
Southern Pacific Railhoad with wharves belonging to the State of
California and,'through the wharves, with other common carriers
engaged in interstate commerce by railroad, belongs to the State
and is operated by it through the Board of State Harbor Commissioners, without profit, for the purpose of facilitating the
commerce of the port. Charges for haulage are collected by the
State and go to expense of operation and to the credit of the San
Francisco Harbor Improvement Fund. In a prosecution of the
individual members of the Board for alleged breaches of the Federal
Safety Appliance Act, as amended, in the operation of the line,
held that the action could not be maintained, since, assuming that
the work done by the line was interstate commerce, the statute,
if it applied to any one, could apply only to the State and not the
defendants, who were merely its agents. It was therefore unnecessary to decide whether the statute shold be construed to embrace
the State. P. 30.
District Court reversed.

Court of Appeals upon consideration of a judgment of
the District Court inflicting penalties under the Safety
Appliance Act. The whole record was brought up here

James Maxwell Fassett and William G. Davis, Special
Assistants to Attorney General, and Paul D. Miller were
on the brief, for the United States.
The State Belt Railroad is a common-carrier engaged in
intlerstate commerce within the meaning of the Safety
Appliance Act and the supplemental Act of April 14,
1910. Belt Ry. Co. v. United States, 168 Fed. 542;
United States v. Union Stock Yards, 226 U. S. 286, 305;
Western Oil Refining Co. v. Lipscomb, 244 U. S. 346, 349;
South Carolinav. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 454, 455;
Georgiav. Chattanooga;264 U. S.472,481; Mathewes v.
Port Utilities Comm., 32 F. (2d) 913; McCallum v.
United States, 298 Fed. 373, certiorari denied, 266 U. S.
606.
The suit is not .against the State. Appellants, as. the
operators of the railroad, are liable for violations of the
Act. Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.123, 150, 155; Truax v:
Raich, 239 U. S.33, 37; Reagan v. Farmers Loan & Tf.
Co., 154 U. S. 362, 390-391; Johnson v. Lankford, 245
U. S.541; Hopkins v. Clemson College, 221 U. S. 636, 643;
Belknap v. Schild, 161 U. S. 10, 18; McCallum v. United
States, 298 Fed. 373, certiorari denied, 266 U. S. 606;
Tilden v. United States, 21 F. (2d) 967. Distinguishing:
Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66; In re Ayers, 123 U. S.
443; Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S.436.
Appellants are within the term "common carrier" as
used in the Safety Appliance Act. United States v.
Nixon, 235 U. S.-231.
There seems no valid distinction here between a receiver, who operates the property of a railroad company
through appropriate agents, and appellants, who operated
the property of the railroad through a superintendent appointed by them and under their supervision and control.
Appellants can be held liable for violations which occurred without their personal knowledge, against their
consent and contrary to their orders and instructions.

Argument for the United States.

Robertson v. Sichel, 127 U. S. 507, is inapplicable because
the Act imposes an absolute liability upon the carrier,
which is not dependent on the common law rule of reasonable care or the common law rule of liability of the principal for the acts of his agent. St. Louis & L M. Ry. v.
Taylor, 210 U. S. 281, 294; Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. v. United
States, 220 U. S. 559.
The exemption of state agencies .and instrumentalities"
from national taxation is limited to those which are
strictly of a governmental character, and does not extend
to those used by the State in carrying on an ordinary
private business. South Carolina v. United States, 199
U. S. 437.
If the Federal Government may tax state agencies and
officers who are engaged in ordinary private business, it
would seem to follow that, under its commerce power, it
may fine or penalize state officers when they are engaged
in interstate commerce. Mathewes v. Port' Utilities
Comm., 32 F. (2d) 913.
There is no evidence, and it is not suggested, that to
require the railroad to comply with the Act would interfere with the appellants in performing their functions, or
hinder the efficient exercise of any governmental function of the State.
There is no reason to suppose that Congress, in enacting thb Safety Appliance Act, was less solicitous of the
safety of employees of a common carrier owned and operated by a State than it was of the employees of a carrier
privately operated, or that it intended to withhold from
the former the protection which it gave the latter.
Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., 196 U. S. 1, 17; Chesapeake & 0. Ry. Co. v. United States, 249 Fed. 805, certiorari denied, 248 U. S. 580.
Assuming that this is a suit against the State, the Act
applies to the operations of the railroad and gives the
United States District Court jurisdiction. Distinguish-

ing: GuaranteeTitle & T. Co. v. Title Guaranty& S. Co.,
224 U. S. 152; United States v. Hlerron, 20 Wall. 251; In
re Fowble, 213 Fed. 677; Sullivan v. School District, 179
Wis. 502. Each of these cas~es involved the application
of a statute against the enacting sovereign. United
States v. Herron, supra, and Dollar Savings Bank v.
United States, 19 Wall. 227, point out that the historical
basis for the principle relied upon by appellants is to be
found in the English practice, where the Crown is held to
be unaffected by legislation not specifically directed
against it.
The Act applies to "any common carrier" engaged in
interstate commerce, and a common carrier owned and
operated by a State is therefore within its express terms.
No rule of statutory construction calls for a different
result. Considerations of the purpose of Congress in enacting this l6gislation, and of the liberal construction to
be given it, also lead to the conclusion that the Act applies
to the operators of this railroad.
.Even if the suit is against the State, the United States
District Court had jurisdiction. Const., Art. III, § 2,
ci. 2; Ames v. Kansas, 11 U. S.449.
MR.JusTICE HoLmus delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case comes here on a certificate of questions of la*
from the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the,
Ninth Circuit.. Subsequently the entire reoord was brought
up, but the facts sufficiently appear in the certificate and
both they and the questions may be abbreviated here.
The suit is brought by the United States against the appellants by name, described as 'constituting the Board
of State Harbor Commissioners of the State of California,
operating The State Belt Railroad,' to recover penalties
for alleged breaches of the Safety Appliance,Acts. March
2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531; April 1, 1896, c. 87, 29 Stat.

Opinion of the Court.

160, 36 Stat. 298. U. S. Code, Tit. 45, §§ 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 12,
13, 16. The penalties are imposed upon : any common
carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad,' and
the broad question is whether the defendants are liable
under the Acts.
The matters complained of occurred upon what is
known as the State Belt Railroad. The road is about five
miles long, within the City of San Francisco, runs nearly
parallel with the water front of the harbor, and connects
many industrial plants and the line of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company with wharves belonging to the
State and through the wharves with other common carriers engaged in interstate commerce by railroad. It may
be assumed that the work done upon the Belt Line was
interstate commerce. But the line belongs to and is operated by the State; the work is done without profit for
the purpose of facilitating the commerce of the port, and
the funds received after paying expenses go to the Treasury
of the State to the credit of the San Francisco Harbor
Improvement Fund. California has not gone into business generally as a common carrier, but simply has constructed the Belt Line as an incident of its control of the
harbor-a State prerogative. Cal.. Political Code, § 2524.
The defendants are officers of the State charged with the
administration of the Harbor of San Francisco and of the
State Belt Railroad in connection therewith. They had
no hand in or knowledge of the alleged violations of law,
the immediate supervision being the duty of an inspector appointed by them, and his subordinates being Civil
Service employees of the State.
On these facts in our opinion the statute, if it applies to
anyone, can apply only to the State. The suit is not to
recover damages for a tort, which, if a wrong on the part
of the master, is at least equally a wrong on the part of the
servant who personally is guilty of the act or omission
that caused the harm. Here the suit is for a penalty attached to an offence-and the only party on whom the

liability is imposed is the common carrier. The'statute is
not like the Hours of Service Act of March 4, 1907, c. 2939,
§ 3, 34 Stat. 1415; Code, 'Title 45, § 63; that in terms extends the liability to officers and agents. It seems to us
plain that as between the Board of Harbor Commissioners
and California the carrier here is the State, by which it
is agreed that the Road was owned and operated, which
received such pay as was required for the work that was
done, and which did the work for the purpose of facilitating the commerce of its principal port. The principal and
its agents cannot both be the' common carriers aimed at.
One is and the other is not subjected to the penalty. One
is superior, the other inferior. The superior is the one
that operated the road and the one whose commands the
others were bound to obey.
The suit is brought against the appellants individually.
This is conceded by the Government and sufficiently appears from the declaration and from the judgment against
them by name, entered"after they had ceased to be members of the Board. Manifestly if we are right in what we
have said the judgment is wrong and we are relieved from
the duty of considering whether the Safety Appliance Act
should be construed to embrace the State.
An answer to other questions proposed is unnecessary
because of our conclusion that the judgment against the
defendants cannot be sustained.
Judgment reversed.
