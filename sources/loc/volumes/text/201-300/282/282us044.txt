In order to establish violation of the Sherman Act it
is not necessary to show that the challenged arrangement suppresses all competition between the parties or
that the parties themselves are discontented with the
arrangement. The interest of the public in the preservation of competition is the primary consideration;
The
prohibitions of the statute cannot ". . . be evaded by
good motives, The law is its own measure of right and
wrong, of what it permits, or forbids, and the judgment
of the courts cannot be set up against it in a supposed
accommodation of its policy with the good intention of
parties; and it may be, of some good results." Standard,

UNITED STATES v. FIRST NATIONAL PICTURES,
INCORPORATED, ET AL.
APPEAL -FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OFt THE UNITED STATES
-FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

'No. 95. Argued October 27, 28, 1930.-Decided November 24, 1930.
Ten*competing corporations, which controlled 60% of the business of
supplying the motion picture films used by theatres throughout the,
Union and had agreed amongst themselves 'upon a standard form
of licensing contract for dealing with exhibitors (see Paramount
Corporationv. United States, ante, p. 30;) thereafter combined with
other distributors, who with themselves controlled 98% of the film
distribution, in establishing certain rules. Under these, whenever a
theatre changed hands, the credit and business arrangements of the
new proprietor were inquired into, partly through an elaborate
questionnaire addressed to him, special attention being given to his
willingness and agreement to assume contracts for film service exist-

ing between his predecessor and any of the distributors; and no

contract for the delivery and display of a picture, other than one
for delivery in the immediate future, could be made by any distributor with any new proprietor who had not assumed such outstanding contracts, unless he furnished cash security to the distributor, fixed as provided in the rules. The effect in such cases was
to prevent the exhibitor who would not assume such obligations of
his predecessor, from meeting the seasonal demands of his theatre
by bookings for future deliveries of film through contracts made in
advance, such as were customary and necessary in this business.
The rules were sought to be justified as reasonable protection
against a practice of evading film service contracts by transferring
the theatres to which they related. Held that the arrangement con-

flicts with the Sherman Act. F. 55.

Assistant to the Attorney General O'Brian., with whom
Attorney General Mitchell and Messrs. Claude R. Branch
and CharlesH. Weston, Special Assistants to the Attorney
General, were on the brief, for the United States.
The distributors of motion pictures, who together have
a substantial monopoly of the business of distributing
motion pictures, have agreed to coerce purchasers and
lessees of motion picture theaters to assume the outstanding exhibition contracts of the former owners or operators.
This coercion has been exercised by agreement or concerted action by the distributors through their representatives on the local film boards, not to make exhibition
contracts with the new owner of a transferred theater
unless he assumes his predecessor's exhibition contracts
or deposits on each new contract whatever security, up to
$1,000, is listed by the credit committee composed of three
members of the local film board. Although the agreement permits a new owner to obtain pictures by "spot

booking " without assuming contracts or putting up security, regular operation of a theater through - "spot booking" is not practicable.
We submit that this case is governed by the numerous
decisions of this Court condemning, as an illegal restraint
of trade, any agreement not to deal, or even ank concerted action by members of a trade having such a purpose and effect. This Court has also said that such an
agreement is equall, invalid where the restraint may be
removed by complying with the conditions fixed by those
imposing the restraint. And it, is no justification of an
illegal combination in restraint of trade that the primaryobject of the parties to the agreement is to protect themselves against trade. conditions which they consider inimical. Eastern States Lumber Assn. v. United States, 234
U. S. 600; Anderson v. Shipowners Assn., 272 U. S. 359;
Montague & Co. v. Lowry, 193 U. S. 38; Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274, 294; Binderup v. PatheExchange, 263
U. S. 291.
This Court has held that exchange of information between members of a trade association, which merely
permits the individual members to conduct their business
more closely in accord with conditions in the trade, is
not illegal provided there b fto express or implied agreement to act in concert on the basis of such information.
-Maple Mooring Assn. v. United States, 26§ U. S. 563';
Cement Mfrs. Assn. v. United States, 268 U. S. 588. There
is a clear intimation in these opinions that an agreement
to act in concert upon the basis of the' information exchanged constitutes a combination 'n illegal restraint of
trade. We submit that, in this dase, the illegality of
appellees' agreement is manifested by the fact that they
did not even purport to furnish their members with
information which would enable them inidividually to
carry on their birsiness more intelligently, but simply
gave them the information -necessary to enforce collec-

tively the decisions of their local agencies. Eastern

The view of.the court below was that the restraint imposed by appellees was justified by their common interest
in preserving the integrity of contractual obligations.
This, we submit, is a doctrine which would sweep aside
all limitations upon collective action by trade groups.
Such "common interest" of the individual distributors
is to be found in the fact that each enters into similar
contracts with exhibitors and desires to have those contracts fulfilled. But the making of similar contracts, and
an interest in enforcing one's own contracts, are not
conditions peculiar to the motion picture industry. Even
if members of an industry can under any circumstances
combine to set up extra-legal machinery for enforcing
contracts, certainly such a combination should not be
sanctioned, where, as in this case, monopolistic power is
exerted to require third persons to assume contracts for
which they are not morally or legally liable.

with whom Messrs. Henry W. Taft, Paxton Blair,Arthur
L. Fisk, Jr., and Gabriel L. Hess*were on the brief, for

Fraudulent transfers had become a widespread evil and
were causing the distributors heavy losses annually.
The effect of the credit rules has been to diminish the
number of fraudulent transfers; the rules have beneited
the industry and improved its ethics. They are normal
and reasonable trade regulations. Chicago Board of
Trade v. United States, 246 U. S. 231, 238; Cement Mfrs.

V. King, 229 Fed 275, 278; United States v. Fur Dressers
Assn., 5 F. (2d) 869, 873.
The credit rules are directed against transfers made for
the purpose of avoiding uncompleted contracts, to persons
who are almost certainly in collusion with the transferors.
The transferees at whom the rules are aimed may not have
defaulted on their own contracts, but they are aiders and
abettors of those who have.
The principle that concerted action against delinquent
debtors is not actionable and that, as a result, to include
a man's name on a circulated list of such persons may
not be made the basis of an action for libel if he is in fact
delinquent, was sustained in the following cases: Putnal
v. Inman, 76 Fla. 553,, 556; Brewster v. Miller's Sons Co.,
'101 Ky. 368, 381; Reynolds v. Plumbers' ProtectiveAssn.,
30 Misc. (N: Y.) 709, 712, 63 N. Y. Supp. 303; Delz v.
Winfree, 6 Tex. Civ. App. 11; Woodhouse v. Powles, 43
Wash. 617, 621.
Reasonable measures against losses by fraudulent
debtors are forms of credit protection.
The ten-day period of investigation during which the
new owner may "spot book" pictures prevents aily unreasonable inconvenience to him.
The actual application and effect of the credit rules,
and the absence of complaints, show the rules to be fair
and reasonable.
The real burden. of the Government's contention seems
to be that the distributors should have permitted fraudulent transfers to continue unabated with consequent.
heavy losses to themselves. We submit that when those
commonly interested are faced with financial losses due
to a definite evil, they may combine to require reasonable
security for their fragile and valuable property before
placing it in the hands of those who have shown their"
willingness to be parties to a fraud.

Opinion of the Court.

MA. JUSTICE

MVCREYNOLDs

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The court below denied the relief sought by the Unit d
States. The parties are the same as those in Paramount
Famous Lasky Corporationv. United States, just decided,
ante, p. 30, and the opinion there contains sufficient description of them, their business and operations.
In 1926 the Appellee Distributors caused each of the
thirty-two Film Boards of Trade to adopt written rules
for establishment and operation of a local credit cora.mittee. These Committees were promptly organized and
have continued to function as required. The prescribed
rules provideThat to correct abuses and unfair practices the president shall appoint a credit committee of three members
to investigate and report the names of all persons who
have acquired, by purchase or transfer, theatres in the
territory within which the Film Board operates. The
secretary of 'the Film Board shall be secretary of the
committee and to him sales and transfers of theatres shall
be promptly reported. • These shall be placed upon a
"Credit information list" and copies furnished to all
members of the Film Board for their confidential information. Upon receipt of such list each member shall advise
the secretary concerning its existing contracts for exhibition of pictures at the listed theatre and shall state
whether the transfer provided that the new owner should
assume and complete outstanding contracts.
That immediately upon receiving information of the
transfer of a theatre the secretary shall request the new
owner to furnish within five days references concerning
his credit standing, etc., and to secure this information
a prescribed form of questionnaire shall be sent out. The
credit committee shall meet weekly to examine and report
22110°'-31--4

50

Opinion of the Court.

282 US.

upon the credit standing of new owners and furnish a
copy of their report to members as confidential information. If a new owner fails to respond to the questionnaire, this fact shall be noted upon the credit information list. Also the credit committee shall indicate on the
list every sale or transfer of a theatre which upon investigation it concludes was made by the previous owner for
the purpose of avoiding or being relieved of uncompleted
contracts for exhibiting pictures at such theatre. There
shall also be indicated opposite the name of each theatre
listed (excepting those whose new owners have agreed to
assume and complete all existing contracts entered into
by the prior owners, and of which agreement notice has
been given to or received by the credit committee) the
amount of cash security, not exceeding $1,000, which in
the judgment of the committee is a reasonable sum that
members shall Yequire to be deposited as security for the
full and complete performance of each contract thereafter
made and .entered into for the exhibition of pictures at
such theatre.
That no member of the Film Board shall enter into
a contract for the exhibition of pictures at any theatre
listed on the credit information list for a period of ten
days from the date of the first appearance of such theatre
upon the list nor thereafter unless the new owner or
lessee of such theatre shall have paid in cash to such member with whom such owner or lessee desires to contract
for pictures the amount of security specified on the credit
information list. Certain contracts for "spot-booking,"
that is for a picture to be delivered in the immediate
future, may be made within the ten day period and prior
to the committee's report. The credit committee may
from time to time remove from the credit information
list the name of any theatre owned or operated by a new
owner and thereafter members of the Film Board may
contract with him.

Opinion of the Court.

That members upon demand of the credit committee
shall furnish desired information, permit examination of

A member of the Film Board who violates any of these
rules shall be subject to suspension or expulsion.

Opinion of the Court.

282 U.S.

Ten Producers and Distributors of films, controlling
60% of the business, agreed to contract with Exhibitors
only according to a Standard Form and then combined
through thirty-two local Film Boards of Trade with other
Distributors, who with themselves control 98% of the entird business. The Film Boards appoint Credit Committees and.these operate under the Rules above outlined.
The obvious purpose of the arrangement is-to restrict the
liberty of those who have representatives on the Film
Boards and secure their concerted action for the purpose of coercing certain purchasers of theatres by excluding them from the opportunity to deal in a free and untrammeled market.

EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 24. Argued October 31, 1930.-Decided November 24, 1930.
1. Section 402 of the Revenue Act of 1918 provides that the value of
the gross estate of a decedent shall be determined by including
the value at the time of his death of all propprty "(a) To the
extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his
death which after his death is subject to the payment of the
charges against his estate and the expenses of its administration
and is subject to distribution as part of his estate." Held that the
requirements that a property interest, to be included, shall be subject to the payment of the charges against the estate and the expenses of administration must be taken, as they are expressed, in
the conjunctive; that charges against the estate and expenses of
administration are different and distinct things, and that when, by
the state law, an interest in real estate, though subject to the
former, is not subject to the latter, it forms no part of the gross
estate for the purpose of the federal estate tax. United States v.
Field, 255 U. S. 257. P. 58.

leading to absurd results, the absurdity must be so gross as to
shock the general moral or common sense; there must be something to make plain the in'tent of Congress that the letter shall
