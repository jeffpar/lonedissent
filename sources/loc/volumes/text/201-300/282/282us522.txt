of the requirement is solely to prevent rebates or unjust
discrimination and to ensure observance of the tariff rates.
Compare Chicago & North Western Ry. Co. v. Lindell,
281 U. S. 14, 16. The Interstate Commerce Act does not
in terms prescribe that the charges shall be paid in
money; that is, in coin or currency. There is no reason
for denying to the parties the convenience and safety incident to making payment, in accordance with the prevailing usage of business, by means of a check payable on
demand drawn on a going bank in which the drawer has
an ample deposit.
Whether in the case at bar the defendant is liable depends, not upon any provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, but upon the rules of law generally applicable
to payment by check. These, and other questions which
have been argued, need not be considered by us.

In this suit, brought in the federal court for northern

1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, the Atlanta, Birmingham &
Coast Railroad Company seeks by supplemental bill to
enjoin and annul an alleged order of the Interstate Commerce Commission dated October 9, 1929. No formal
order was made. Reorganizationand Control of Atlanta,

action challenged as an illegal order is the following passage of the. Commission's report of that date concerning entries in the carrier's books of account:
"Upon consideration of the record, as supplemented,
we find and conclude that the amount to be included in
the balance sheet statement of the new company representing investment in road and equipment as of January
1, 1927, may not exceed $9,261,043.87. The company
will be expected to adjust its accounts in accordance with
this -finding within 60 days from service of this report."
The United States and the Commission contended that
the -bill should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction,
among other rea! 'ins, because the action complained of
is not an order within the meaning of the Urgent Deficiencies Act. The District Court, three judges sitting,
overruled that objection; heard the case on the merits;
and entered a final decree which declared that the action
of the Commission "in so far as the same fixes the amount
at which the Complainant is to return its capital stock and
its investment in road and equipment, be set aside . . .
and that the supplemental application of the complainant on which said order was entered by the Interstate
Commerce Commission stand for further hearing before
said commission. ' 37 F. (2d) 401. The defendants
appealed to this Court.
The Atlanta, Birmingham & Coast Railroad Company
was incorporated in 1926 by the bondholders of the Atlanta., Birmingham & Atlantic Railway Company to take
over upon foreclosure the property of the latter, consisting of 640 miles of line in Alabama and Georgia.
The enterprise had been peculiarly disastrous to investors.
Following long years of receivership with annual operating deficits there had been in 1915 a reorganization in
which $35,000,000 in stocks and $14,500,000 in bonds were
wiped out. Compare Valuation of Atlanta, Birmingham

Opinion of the Court.

& Atlantic R. Co., 75 I. C. C. 645, 703. By the reorganization of 1926, $30,000,000 more of stock was wiped
out and the holders of the $8,600,000 bonds then outstanding received' for them only 60 per cent of their face
value in 5 per cent preferred stock of the new company.
The 1926 reorganization was effected pursuant 'to an
agreement between the bondholders' committee, and thd
Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, under which the cbmmittee
purchased at foreclosure sale all the property; transferred
the same to the new company in exchange for all of its
stock, being $5,180,344.07 redeemable preferred and
150,000 shares no-par common; transferred the common
stock to the Atlantic Coast Line in consideration f its
extinguishing the prior liens on the property, aggregating
$4,080,699.80, and guaranteeing the preferred stock; -and
distributed the preferred stock among the bondholders.
Thus, the Atlantic Coast Line acquired for $4,080,699.80
in cash and its guaranty of the preferred stock, complete
ownership of the property subject only to the $5,180,344.07 redeemable preferred stock. These. two sums
aggregate $9,261,043.87.-the sum set forth in the passage
of the report of October 9, 1929, which is challenged as
an order.
The order of the Commission dated December 21, 1926,
which authorized the new company to issue the preferred'
and common stock (117 I. C. C. 181, 439, 443), and thus
made possible the 1926 reorganization, contained this
provisiont:
"Provided, however, that authority to issue said stock
is granted upon the express condition, that, for the
purposes of the accounting, as provided in the classification of investment in road and equipment in the text of
account 41, 'Cost of road purchased,' the cash value of
the preferred stock issued must, in stating the transactions
in the accounts, be reckoned on a basis not in excess of its

282 U.S.

par value; and that the cash value of the common stock
issued must be reckoned on a basis not in excess of the
amount received therefor."' 117 I. C. C. 443.
When the books of the new company were being
opened, its accountants sought to set up in its balance
sheet as "Investment in road and equipment" the sum
of $29,271,859 instead of the $9,261,043.87 above shown.
The larger entry was contended for on the grounds that
this amount (with adjustments) had, on July 20, 1923,
been determined by the Commission, pursuant to ยง 19a
of the Act of March 1, "1913, c. 92, 37 Stat. 701, to be
the value of the property for rate-making purposes, estimated on the basis of 1914 reproduction costs. 75 1. C. C.
645. The Director of the Bureau of Accounts refused to
permit the company to set up the investment of road and
equipment as being $29,271,859. Treating the preferred
stock as having been paid for at par, he directed that the
value of the 150,000 shares of common stock should be
set up at $4,080,699.80, that being the sum of money
iThe classification of primary, accounts referred to as Account 41,
"Cost of Road Purchased" prescribes:
"This account shall include the cash cost of any road or portion
thereof purchased. Where the contract of purchase includes not
only road, but also equipment, securities, and other assets, the appraised value of such equipment, securities, and other assets shall
be deducted from the total cash cost, and the remainder of the cash
cost shall be charged to this account. Where the consideration given
for the property purchased is other than cash, such consideration shall
be. valued on a current cash basis.. . 2' See "Classification of Investment in road and Equipment of Steam Roads prescribpd by
Interstate Commerce Commission in accordance with Section 20 of
the Act to Regulate Commerce," July 1, 1914, p. 29.
See also "Classification of Income, Profit and Loss and Gefieral
Balance Sheet Accounts," id., July 1, 1914, p. 50, as amended August

or receipts have no par value they shall be included in this account

which the Atlantic Coast Line had disbursed in extinguishing the prior liens upon the property.
The new company then filed an application with the
Commission requesting a hearing in support of 'its contention that the above quoted proviso in the order of
December 21, 1926, authorized such entry of 829,271,859;
and requested that oral argument be permitted. Without hearing oral argument, the Commission denied the
application on April 9, 1928. The original bill in this
suit was then brought to set that order aside. The court
granted the relief and directed that the company's application "stand for further hearing before said commission." Atlanta, Birmingham & Coast R.- Co. v. United
States, 28 F. (2d) 885. The Commission granted the
further .hearing and thereupon, on October 9, 1929, filed
the report first cited. In it, the Commission stated that
the value of the property for rate-making purposes fixed
in 1923, pursuant to ยง 19a, is not "pertinent or material
evidence in the determination of investment, as that
term is used in our abcounting regulations." The report
concluded with the passage quoted which appellee contends amounts to an order. 158 I. C. C. 6, 14.
First. The jurisdiction conferred upon distfict courts
under the Urgent Deficiencies Act is that formerly exercised by the Commerce Court over "cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any
order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.". Act of
June 18, 1910, c. 309, ยง1, 36 Stat. 539. The action here
complained of is not in form an order. It is a part of a
report-an opinion as distinguished from a mandate.
The distinction between a. report and an order has been
observed in the practice of the Commission ever since its
organization-and for compelling reasons. Its functions
are manifold in character. In some matters its duty"is
merely to investigate and to report facts. See United
States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co.; 273 U. S. 299,
310. In others, to make determinations. See Great

Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, 277 U. S. 172. In
some, it acts in an advisory capacity. Compare Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Peorga & Pekin Union By.
Co., 270 U. S. 580, 584-5. In others in a supervisory.
Even in the regulation of rates, as to which the Commission possesses mandatory power, it frequently qeeks to secure the desired action without issuing a command. In
such cases it customarily points out in its report what the
carriers are expected to do.2 Such actiQn is directory as
distinguished from mandatory. No case has been found
in which matter embodied in a report and not followed by
a formal order has been held to be subject to judicial review.3 In Kansas City Southern Ry. v. United States,
S2 See Advances in Rates, Western Case, 20 I. C. C. 307, 379; Goldenberg v. Clyde S. S. Co., 20 I. C. C. 527, 529; Pacific Coast Biscuit
Co. v. S. P. & S. Ry. Cq., 20 1. C. C. 546, 549; Proposed Schedules of
Rates on Lumber, 20 1. C. C. 575. When the car service rule discussed in United States v. New River Co., 265 U. S. 533, was first
before the Commission, its report finding the rule unreasonable concluded with the statement: " We have not required that car service
rules be filed as tariff schedule. We will not in this proceeding direct
that the rules which we herein find to be reasonable be so filed. We
shall expect, however, that defendants will promptly amend their
car service rules so as to conform with our findings and evidence
same by filing copies thereof with us." Referring to thii statement,
this Court said (p. 540-1): "The Commission refrained from making
an brder that the rule be filed as a tariff schedule, but announced
that it expected the carriers promptly to amend their car seivice
rules to conform with its findings." Compare Colorado Fuel & Iron
Co. v. Southern Pacific R. Co., 6 I. C. C. 488,,518, 587; Milk Products
Protective Assn. v. Delaware L. & W. R. Co., 7 I. C. C. 92, 175;

Opinion of the Court.

231 U. S. 423, the accounting regulations which were challenged had been adopted by formal order of the Commissien.' Compare Interstate Commerce Comm. v. ,Goodrich Transit Co., 224 U. S. 194. There are many cases in
which action of the Commission, although -embodied in
the form of an order, has been held by this Court not to
be reviewable under the Urgent Deficiencies Act.'
As the District Court said in passing upon the original
bill now- relied upon: "Independently of the Commission's power under section 20, subsection 1 and subsection
5, to establish uniformity in and prescribe the forms of
accounts of carriers, section 1, subdivision 20, authorizes
the imposition of conditions upon its grant of a certificate
of public convenience and'necessity for the acquisition
and operation of a railroad, and by necessary implication
it has power to see that the condition is complied with.
Disobedience to an order made to this end touching the
accounts would be punishable under section 20, subsection
7, of the act as a willful failure to make a correct entry and
the keeping of a record other than that approved by the
Commission." 28 F. (2d) 887. The basis for such a
liability should be certain. Compare United States v.
Fruit Growers Express Co., 279 U. S. 363, 369.
Second. In support of the contention that the passage
in the report of the Commission of October 9, 1929, is
legally an order, the Company insists that it must be

read in connection not only with the action of April 9,
1928, attacked by the original bill, but also with the certificate of public necessity and convenience dated October
26, 1926, authorizing the new company to acquire the
property, and the order of December 21, 1926, authorizing the issue of the $5,180,344.07 preferred stock and
150,000 shares of, no-par common. Neither the original
bill nor the supplemental bill attacks either the certificate
or the order of December 21st. The validity of the certificate and of that order is not now challenged. Moreover, the record discloses that the certificate and the order
have been acted upon by the acquisition of. the property
and issue of the stock.
Third. The Company contends that the decree of the
District Court on the original bill, in which the'defendants
acquiesced, is a final adjudication of the issues involved
in this case. The original bill dealt with the order of
April 9,- 1928; -the supplemental bill with the alleged
order of October 9, 1929. The Commission insists that
the decree on the original bill did not deal with the
merits, but determined only that the company must be,
accorded a hearing on its application. We need not determine whether jurisdiction existed to review the action
of April 9, 1928, or the scope of the issues litigated in
the original suit. For'a finding of jurisdiction to review
that order, or acquiescence by the defendants in the
decree rendered on the original bill, would not have made
res judicata, the question whether jurisdiction existed to
review the later action of October 9, 1929. Compare
Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351; Pellov. McCabe,
250 U. S. "573,577. The lack of power to review, because
of the absence of any order, cannot be cured by bringing
the suit in the form of a supplemental rather than a new
bill; Jurisdiction is equally lacking in either case.
