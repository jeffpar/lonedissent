Syllabus.

as of the date of its passage, by section 612 of the Revenue
Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 875). It is nbt necessary to attempt
to resolve the questions raised by the ambiguous language
-of this section, as we are of the opinion that, from any
point of view, it does not protect the taxpayers from the
operation of section 611 of the Revenue Act of '1928.
At the time the taxes were collected, there was no liability
on the part of the taxpayers, but this was also true in
the case of the petitioners in Graham v. Goodcell, supra.
The Congress ,had constitutional authority in'
the circumstances set forth in section 611 of the Revenue Act of
1928 to cure the defect in administration which had
resulted in. the collection of the tax after the statute of
limitations had run and to deny recovery to-the taxpayers
for the amount paid. The fact that section 1106 (a) of
the Revenue Act of 1926 was in effect at the time of the
collection is a distinction which does not affect the result.

AIR. JfusTicE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case came before the Circuit Court of Appeals
upon a short question. Returns for taxes for the fiscal>
year 1920 and the fiscal year 1921 were filed respectively
on March 15, 1921 and March 15, 1922. Assessments for
both years were made on March 15, 1926. The question
is whether the assessments were too late under the statutes by which they. were governed. The earlier one fell
under the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, ยง 250 (d), 40 Stat.
1057 , 1083, which requires the amount of tax due to be
'assessed "within five years after the return was due or
was made." That for 1921 was governed by Revenue Act,
of 1921, c. 136, ยง 250 (d), 42 Stat. 227, 265, which requires
the assessment to be "within four years after the return
was filed." Both -acts are affirmed in Revenue Act of
'(February 26,) 1926, c. 27, ยง 277, (a) (2) (3), 44 Stat. 9,
58. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the assess-

ments were too late. 36 F. (2d) 49. A writ of certiorari
was granted by this Court. 281 U. S. 710.
The argument that prevailed with the Circuit Court of
Appeals and that is pressed for the respondent is,. that a
taxpayer is entitled to the most favorabla construction
of taxing acts,, that there is a distinction between a limitation running from a day and one from an event, and
that, if the words quoted are taken literally, the part of
the day after the return was filed must. be part of the
four or five years. We are seeking a measure-f time, and
therefore we have to translate the event into-tlhe language
of time; and when, as here, there is no special reason
.for being more precise, the day is the unit, because people generally measure periods of more than one day- by
days, months or years, When we say "four years after
the return was filed," by common usage we think of four
years after the day on which the ,return'was filed, and
it would seem that Congress was following common
usage. The earlier act read, "after the teturn was due
or vwas made." The return was not due before the end of
the day for filing. By ยง 250 (d) of the Revenue Acts of
4918 and 1921 no suits shall be begun"' after the expiration of five years after the date when such return was
filed," obviously treating the "date" and the filing as
marking the same starting point, and "date" equally
plainly meaning the year and day of the month. The
general rule was laid down long ago in lafiguage quoted
from Chief Justice Bronson, Cornell v. Moulton, 3 Denio
12, [16]: "When the period allowed for doing an act is
to be reckoned from-the making of a contract, or the happening of any other event, the day on which the event
happened may be regarded as an entirety, or a point of
time; and so may be excluded from the computation."

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA.

No. 55. Argued January 19, 1931.--Decided ,February 2, 1931.
A Delaware corporation, which acquired and conducted, as agent of
the railroads, the interstate and intrastate railway-express business throughout the country, was created after a provision of
the Virginia constitution became effective, forbidding any foreign
'corporation to carry on the business of a public service company,,
intrastate, and was therefore denied a certificate of authority.
Weld:
1. That the prohibition was not shown to be void as a burden
on interstate commerce.
2. That it did not, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,
deprive the -foreign corporation of its right -to sue in the federal
courts ana.to remove suits to them on the ground of diversity-of
citizenship. P. 444.
