housing" and that there was a specification of a particular sort of support, that is, "truss rods attached to the
closed side of the housing." In other claims allowed, the
reference is to "adjustable stay rods."
The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in
the instant case, questioned the patentability of the device and said that if patentability existed at all, it must
depend upon the truss rod support or the adjustable stay
rods, neither of which the respondents use. We agree
with this statement, and we are also of the opinion, as
was the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,
(Smith v. SpringdaleAmusement Park, supra), that supplying the feature of the truss rods and the adjustable
stay rods did not constitute invention. To provide such
supports would be but a step obvious to any skilled mechanic. Atlantic Works v. Brady, 107 U. S. 192, 200;

Statement of the Case.

Since October 1, 1920, they have continuously maintained
their domicile in the State of California. During the
year 1928, Robert Malcolm received a salary of $3,600
for personal services rendered as an officer of, the Liberty
Farms Company, a California corporation. Under the
laws of the State of California, this income was community property, On March 1, 1929, the husband and
wife filed separate returns of their income for federal
income-tax purposes. Each reported one-half of the
salary of $3,600 received in 1928 by the husband, and
each fully paid the amount shown to be due on the
return. It i§_admitted that all income taxes due from
either husband or wife for the year 1928 have been fully
paid, if, as a matter of law, they had a lawful right to
make such separate returns under the provisions of § § 11,
12, and 51 of the Revenue Act of 1928.
"After the husband had fied his 'income-tax return for
the calendar year, 1928, as set out above, the Commissioner, upon an audit and examination, determined that
his return was incorrect in that the salary- of $3,600
should have been reported by the husband alone, and an
income tax paid thereon by him, instead of both husband
and wife reporting it at $1,800 on each return. Accordingly the Commissioner determined against the husband
a deficiency in income tax amounting to $18.39. An
assessment in this amount was then made and collected
from the husband, the plaintiff herein, together with interest amounting to $1.12. A claim for refund was thereafter filed and rejected by the Commissioner. From a
judgment for this amount in plaintiff's favor, the defendant has appealed."
The questions certified were as follows:
"1. Under the applicable provisions of the Revenue
Act of 1928 must the entire community income of a husband and wife domiciled in California be returned and
the income tax thereon be paid by the husband?
