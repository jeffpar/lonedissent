Syllabus.

would' yield something less than 7% on the approved
valuation of the property devoted to public use.
Having again heard the cause upon pleadings and
affidavits the court held that the valuation placed upon
the property by the Railroad Commission was too low.
and contrary to the evidence; also that the Commission's
estimate of operating expenses was too low and contrary
to the evidence; and further that the Commission's order
if enforced would cause confiscation. Accordingly, it entered a final decree restraining the defendants from taking
any steps to enforce the order.
After examining the findings and conclusioni and the
record upon which they axe based, we can find no adequate
reason for disapproving the result reached by the court
below.- Its decree will be affirmed.
The facts are peculiar; the applicable principles of law
have been stated in former opinions here. To enter upon
a detailed discussion of them at this time-vould serve no
useful purpose.

because' the declared purpose of promoting reasonable
insurance rates can be accomplished by the simple and
direct means of rate regulation, and is not in fact promoted by regulating the compensation of insurance agents.

Court.
These cases, which are here on appeals from the'highest
,court of New Jersey, were argued together: T.ey present
the qiiestion ,whether the folkodwing statutory, provison,

O'GORMAN & YOUNG v. HARTF'D INS, CO. 255

Opinion of the Court.

effective March 29, 1928,, is consistent with the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment:
"In order that rates of ihoutance against the hazards
of fire shall be reasonable 'itshall be unlawful for any
such insurer licensed in this State to-.
allow . . any
commission . . in excess of a reasonable-amount, to
any person-for acting'as its agent in respect to any class
of such insurance, nor,
to allow . . any commission
.
to any person for acting as its local agent in
respect to any class of such insurance, in excess of that
. I. allowed to any one of its local agents on such risks
in this State." (New Jersey Laws 1928, c. 128, p. 258.)
In each case, O'Gorman and Young, Inc., a domestic
dorporation licensed as an insurance'broker, sues a licensed
foreign fire insurance company to recover a balance alleged to be due for services performed as local agent at
Newark after the effective date of the statute. In the
Phoenix Assurance Company case, the complaint is on
a contract terminable at will, made prior to the enactment
of the statute, by which the company agreed to pay to the
agent twenty-five per cent. of the premiums. In the
Hartford Fire Insurance Company case, the complaint
is on a contract, made after the enactment of the statute,
by which the defendant agreed to spay as compensation
"what such services were reasonably worth"- and the
complaint alleges that the services were reasonably worth
twenty-five per cent. of the premiums. Each complaint
alleges that the defendant has paid the plaintiff only
twenty per cent. of the premiums. Each answer admits
the facts alleged in the complaint. As a defense, it sets
up the statute and the fact that the defendant had at
the date of its enactment, and. ever since has had, several
persons acting as its local agents within the State to whom
the compensation allowed in respect to the same class of
business has been only twenty per cent. of the premiums.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U. S.

Each case was heard upon a motion to strike out the
answer and for judgment on the ground that the statute
is void under the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. In each case the trial court denied the motion and entered judgment against the plaintiff, the facts
alleged in the answer being admitted. In an opinion discussing the question presented, that court said:
"Our statute provides that the'rates for fire insurance
'shall be reasonable.' Since the commissions paid to local
agents naturally' enter into the cost of such insurance to
the public, and therefore infltience the rates which must
be charged to the public for such insurance, it is within
the police power of the state to require that the commis-.
sions must be reasonable, otherwise such-large commissions might be allowed as to impair the financial stability
of the insurance companies, and thus imperil their ability
to meet their financial obligations to their policy holders.
"Since twenty per cent. is the amount of commissions
paid to some of its local agents, the effect of this legislation is to determine that a commission in excess of that
is unreasonable. The presumption is in favor of the reasonableness of the law until the contrary- is made to
appear.
"In the facts or argument, there is nothing to overcome
that presumption. . . ." 105 N. J. L. 645.1
"It is the settled practice in New Jersey that where the subject

regulated is properly within the scope of the police power of the
State, a charge of discrimination or lack of reasonable relation between the object of the act and the means employed, must be supported by facts in the record sufficient to overcome the general
presumption of constitutionality. Hopper v. 'Stack, 69 N. J. L.

Opinion of the Court.

251

On that, opinion the, Court of Errors and Appeals
affirmed the judgments of the trial court. 105 N. J. L.
642. We think it was right in so doing.
The business of insrance is so far affected with a public
,interest that the Siate may regulate the rates, German
Alliance Insurance Co.v. Lewis, .233 U. S. 389; and likewise the relations of those engaged in thp business, La
Tourette v..McMaster, 248 U. S. 465; Stipcich v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 277 U-i. S.311, 320. Compare
McCarter v. Firemen's Insurance Co., 74 N. J. Eq. 372,
382. The agent's compensation, being a percentage of
the premium, bears a direct relation to thd rate charged
the insured., The percentage commonly allowed is so large
that it is a vital element in the rate structure and may
seriously affect the adequacy of the, rate. Excessive commissions may result in an unreasonably high rate level or
in impairment of the financial stability of the, insurer.
It was stated at the bar'that the commission on some
classes of insurance is as high as thirty-five per cent.
Moreover, lack of a uniform scale of commissions allowed
local agents for the same service may encourage unfair
discrimination among policy holders by facilitating the,
forbidden practice of rebating. In the field of life insur-.
ance, such evils led long ago to legislative limitation of
agents' commissions.2
The statute here questioned deals with a subject clearly
within the scope of the police power. We are asked to
declare it void on the ground that the specific method of
regulation prescribed is unreasonable and-hence deprives
the plaintiff of due process of law. As underlying questions of fact. may condition the constitutionality of legislation of this character, -the presumption of constitutional2 Laws of New York, 1906, c. 326, Â§ 97, pp. 794-797; Insurance

which the court must take judicial notice, that in New
Jersey evils did not exist in the, business of fire insurance
for which this statutory provision was .an appropriate
remedy, 5he action of the legislature and of the highest

records present like circumstances and questions of law.
It will suffice here to point out the essentials disclosed inNo., 12.
O'Gorman and Young, a New Jersey corporation, under_
proper license-transacts business as 'an insurance broker ,
For many years it has been the agent of appellee,'a Connecticut -corporation authorized to issue fire policies in
New Jersey. Prior to March 29, 1928, the agreement of
employment provided that for negotiating and selling such policies the agent. should receive 25%o of prescribed premiums. On that day the original contract -was changed
and now itprovides that the agent shall be paid ' what such services were reasotiably Worth."
Acting under this modified arrangement, O'Gorman and'
Young negotiated and gold policies upon which the premiums amounted to $2,454.61. As reasonable 'compensation, demand was ndd for $613.68-25% of the
premiums. The Insurance Company paid $490.92, 20%,
and denied further liability.
Thereupon (October, 1928), Asserting that its services
were reasonably worth 26% of the premiums, O'Gorman
and Young brought an action against the Insurance Company in the Circuit Coukt, Es~ex County; New Jersey, to
recover $122.76. ' The complaint sets out. the foregoing
facts afid asks fbt- judghent; it says nothing concerning
any New Jersey statute.The answer admits the allegations of the complaint
except; "defendant denies that it owes the plaintiff the
sum of $122.76 as in said complaint alleged for the reasons hereinafter in this answer sdt forth." They are set

20% had been regularly allowed by the Insurance Company to certain agents in New Jersey and asserting the
invalidity of the Act of that date because of conflict with
^the Fourteenth Amendment, complainant moved to strike
out the answer as- insufficient. This motion was denied
and final judgment went for the defendant upon the
I
pleadings and admission.
The Circuit Court (Judge Dungan) said-'
"The other question is whether or not the act deprives
the-'plaintiffof 'its property without due process of law,'
and therefore is a violation of the 14th Amendment to
the Federal Constitution.

"Federal and State laws are in favor of the regulation
of- the business affairs of persons and corporations which
affect the public interest, and there are federal and state
decisions in almost every state in this country upholding
the constitutionality of such laws, 'provided they are -reasonable. Of ''ourse the mere statement in the law itself
as to the reasonableness of its provisions-does not -make
them so, but that is a question to bedecided sometimes by
the Court and sometines by a jury. Whether or not the
business of a fire insurance company is affected with a
public interest is not an open'question in this state. In
McCarter,Attorney General v. Firemen's Ins. Co., 74 N.
J. Eq. 372 (at p. 383), our Cont of Errors and Appeals
said, 'The business of the defendants [insurance companies] is in point of fact one that directly, affects the
interests of the public, and such public interest has been
recognized as'a subsisting one by the Legislature of this
State, and that in point of law, the business of the
defendants is affected with a public interest.'
I" If the regulations prescribed are reasonable, they are
valid. Our statute provides that the rates for fire insurance 'shall be reasonable.' Since the commissidns paid
to local agents naturally enter into the cost of such insurance to the public, and therefore influence the rates which
must be charged to the public for such insurance, it is
within the police power of the State to require that the
commissions must be reasonable, otherwise such large
-commIssions'might be allowed as to impair the financial
stability of the insurance companies, and thus imperil
their ability to meet their financial obligations to their
policy holders.
"Since twenty per cent. is the amount of commissions
paid-to some of its local agents, the effect of this legislation is to determine that a commission ini excess of that is

unreasonable. The presumption is in favor of the reasonableness of the law until the contrary is made to
appear.
"In the facts or arguments, tmere is nothing to overcome that presumption, and therefore the answers should
not be stricken out as an unlawful deprivation of the
plaintiff of his property without due process of law."
The Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed the questioned judgment "for the reasons expressed in the opinion
by Judge Dungan in the Circuit Court."
The matter for our consideration comes to this: A foreign in'surance Company, licensed to operate in New"Jersey, employed an agent and agreed to pay reasonable
compensation. The agent demanded 25% of the premiums collected. The Company paid 20% of these and
successfully resisted the claim for more upon the sole
.ground that "since twenty per cent. is the amount of
commissions paid to some of its local agents, the effect of
this legislation [Act March 29, 1928] is to determine that
a commission in excess of that is unreasonable." Ab-,
stractly stated, the principal paid "A" commissions at
the rate of 20%; therefore, it has been held, solely because
of the Act nothing above 20% can be recovered by "B,"
who claims under a contract fair on its face and not expressly inhibited, which definitely provides for reasor 2ble
compensation.
It cannot rightly be said that the burden of establishing any underlying disputable fact rests upon the appellant before it can successfully challenge the validity of the
questioned enactment. This is not a proceeding to enjoin
enforcement of a statute because of alleged discrimination
or other circumstance, the existence of which requires consideration of facts not known to the court. Opinions in
cases of that character are not in point. The court below

ruled, in effect, that without regard to any evidence which
'might -be presented, the complainant, although relying
upoli a contract fair upon its' face; could recover nothing
above the rate allowed to another agent-that the statute
restricted the right to contract for services for reasonable
cmpensation. And We must determine 'whether, thus
construed, and in the absence of any emergency, the statute necessarily conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment.
Is such legislation permissible in- the .ordinary circumstances of which the court ust take 'judicial notice?
Under German.Aliancq'Ins. Co. V. Lewis, 233 U.S. 389,
the appellant does not 'deny that -because of the public
interest involved reasonable rates for issuing fire insurance l policies may be fixed-by statute. But that decision
"marks the eitreme: limit' to which this court has thus
far gone in sustaining pricL-fixing legislation." Tysn &
Bro. v. Banton, 273 U. S. 418,-434.
The German Alliance Company questioned the Walidityâ€¢
of an order by the Su#6iimtehdent of Insurance of Kansas
which undertook to reduce its duly 'announced basic sched-'
ule' of' rates. The' definite point for decision was thus
stated: *"Whether a contract 'of fire insurance is. private,
and as such 'has constit-utional immunity from regulation.
Or, to state it differently and to express ati antithetical
proposition, is the business of' insurance so ,far affected
with a public interesf as t juistify legislative regulation
of its rates? And we mean a broad and definite 'public
interest." An dfirmative afiswer followed:
The decision is authoritative as to' the point o ruled,
but not otherwise. Nothing there determined would permit regulation of all the undertakings of an 'insurance
company. Here .we are not dealing directly with a contract to insure. And certainly it'does not follow that be&cause the State has power to regulate the rate for insur-

ance she may control every agreement having-any possible
relation' thereto.
The public has no direct, immediate interest in the
agency contract here set up. Its concern ib with rates.
Like any other expense item, brokers' commissions may
ultimately affect the rate charged for policies; but this
is true of the wages of office boys, printers, bookkeepers,
actuaries, officers; the price paid for pens, ifik, or other
supplies--indeed whatever expense may be incurred.
Broadly speaking, the funds of an insurance company
come from premiums collected; and necessarily all 'disbursements are made therefrom and, therefore, in some
sense may be said to affect the necessary rate of charge..
The State may not permit a foreign Insurance Company to do business within her limits upon condition that
it shall submit to deprivation of rights guaranteed by the
Constitution. Western, Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, 216
U. S. 1; Hanoverlns.Co. v. Harding;272 U. S. 494,508.
This Court has steadfastly upheld the general right to
enter into private contract and has definitely disapproved
attempts to fix prices by legislative fiat, "Freedom of
contract is, nevertheless, the general rule and restraint
the exception; and the exercise of legislative authority
to abridge it can be justified only by the existence of exceptional circumstances." "That the right to contract
about one's affairs is apart of the liberty of the individual
protected by this clause, [of the Fourteenth Amendment]
is settled by the decisions of this court and is no longer
open to question." Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261

Also it must be accepted as settled that the right to
regulate a business does not necessarily imply power to
fix the scale for services therein, or to trespass on the
duties of private management. Adams v. Tanner, supra;
Truax v. Corrigan,supra; Tyson & Bro. v. Banton, supra;
Southwestern Bell Tel. Co.-v. Public Service Commission,
262 U. S. 276, 289; Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court; supra.
Even if it be admitted that the power of the legislature
to~establish reasonable rates for insurance necessarily presupposes existence of the right to command or inhibit
what is essential to the accomplishment of that end, certainly this implied right extends to ,nothing which does
not clearly appear to benecessary for such purpose.
The statute under review does not prescribe a schedule
of rates or point out the basis for determination of reasonable rates; it leaves with each company the primary -right
and duty of deciding upon rates to be demanded. But
it inhibits payment to any agent, irrespective of the worth
of his services and without regard to any contract with
him, of anything in excess of what may be actually paid
to another agent. As construed, it declares that the
smallest compensation voluntarily paid to any agent shall
thereby become reasonable for every other agent. And it
permits an agent who has been paid'according to his agreement to recover more if he can show that some other
agent has received greater compensation.
The objections to the statute,no extraordinary conditions having been disclosed, by the defendant, should be
obvious. It goes far, beyond the mere, regulation of -the
business of insurance and interferes-directly with the
right of insurers to control the conduct of their internal
affairs; it restricts the right of both 'company and agent
to make reasonable private agreements in respect of com-

and BuTImm, JJ.,

pensation for ordinary services; and the restrictions have
no immediate or necessary'relation to the maintenance of
insurance rates fair to the public.
The difference between regulation and management is
pointed out in the cases cited above. Congress has power,
for example, to regulate interstate commerce; but generally, at least, it may not say what shall be paid to -employees or interfere with the freedom of the parties to
contrabt in'respect of wages. This was distinctly pointed
out in. Wilson-v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 347--:'YIt is also
equally true that as the right to fix by agreement between
the carrier and its employees a standard of wages to' control their relations is primarily piivate, the establishment
and giving effect to such agreed on standarc-is not subject
to be controlled or prevented by public authority."
In order to justify the denial of the right to make private contracts, some special circumstances, sufficient to
indicate the necessity therefor must be shown by the party
relying upon, the denial. Here the right freely to agree
upon reasonable compensation has been abridged; and
no special circumstances demanding such action have'
been disclosed. Under the construction placed upon. the
statute, no agent can make an enforcible agreement with
an insurance company definitely fixing his compensation.
Always the company can defeat his claim for the agreed
amount, reasonable in fact, by paying less to. another
agent.
The inability of the company to make enforcible agreements with necessary agents has no appreciable relation to
fair rates. One agent's efforts often produce much more
valuable results than those of another. Such interference
with the freedom of the parties hinders the proper conduct of the business and may ultimately cause increased
rates. The statute prescribes no definite rate of compensation; under it no two companies are required to pay

at the same rate for like servicei in the same locality; and
competition for business is necessarily abridged. And in
-order to operate at all -at some points, the insurer may
find it necessary to pay agents much more than prudent
management would require, and beyond the real value of
their .services at such places.
Although agents are -usuallypaid a specified percentage
t imited to that
-of premiums collected, the statute is noi
situation. -Certainly we <cannot' say that exercise by the
companies of the ordinary right'freely to contract touching compensation for services will tend materially to interfere 'withl-reasonable rates for ibgiance. Rates constitute the matter of public concern, not the compensation
of employees or representatives, which is, after all, only
an item of expense. And, so far as we can see, this legislation will afford no 1rotection ,to those who -wish to
insure.

The statute' before us'goes far beyond the usual provisions of slite laws concerning theinsurance business.
We,are advised that a similar one was enacted by the
State of Mississippi in 1924 and by the State of Louisiana
in 1926. Diligeqt counsel have disclosed no others. The
restrictions' are novel and lack the, sanction of general
assent and practical'eip iernce.
In our view the statute is arbitrary, unreasonable and
beyond the power of the legislature.
