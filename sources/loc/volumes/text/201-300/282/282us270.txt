at the same rate for like servicei in the same locality; and
competition for business is necessarily abridged. And in
-order to operate at all -at some points, the insurer may
find it necessary to pay agents much more than prudent
management would require, and beyond the real value of
their .services at such places.
Although agents are -usuallypaid a specified percentage
t imited to that
-of premiums collected, the statute is noi
situation. -Certainly we <cannot' say that exercise by the
companies of the ordinary right'freely to contract touching compensation for services will tend materially to interfere 'withl-reasonable rates for ibgiance. Rates constitute the matter of public concern, not the compensation
of employees or representatives, which is, after all, only
an item of expense. And, so far as we can see, this legislation will afford no 1rotection ,to those who -wish to
insure.

The statute' before us'goes far beyond the usual provisions of slite laws concerning theinsurance business.
We,are advised that a similar one was enacted by the
State of Mississippi in 1924 and by the State of Louisiana
in 1926. Diligeqt counsel have disclosed no others. The
restrictions' are novel and lack the, sanction of general
assent and practical'eip iernce.
In our view the statute is arbitrary, unreasonable and
beyond the power of the legislature.

Section 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1921, referring to income and
excess p~ofits taxes under earlier Acts, provides that the amount
due under any return made under such Acts shall be determined

Commissioner and taxpaye consent in writing to a later "determination, assessment, and. collection" of the tax; and that no suit
or proceeding for the collection of taxes, due under the prior Acts,
shall be begun after the expiration of five years after the date'when
such return was flied. Held:
1. The taxpayer's waiver of the limitation is effective even
though executed more than five years after the filingof his return
under the prior faxing Act. P. 273.
2. An agreement by.the ta)xpayer waiving any and all statutory
\limitations' as to the time within which assessments might be
.entered, but not in terms referring to "determination" or "collection" of the tax, was valid and comprehended both assessment'
and collection. P. 275,
3. A waiver is not a contract, and the provision of § 250 (d)
requiring the Commissiqner's signature was inserted for purely administrative purposes and not to convert into a contract what is
essentially a voluntary, unilateral waiver of a defense by the taxpayer. P. 276.

Court..
In Februaryi 4915, Stange made a .retum of taxable

In order to .aoid distraint, Stange paid the amount
assessed, with interest, and duly made claim for a refund
on the ground thatthe ietum made'in 1915 had included
all the income taxable" .. Upon the rejection of this 'claim,
he filed a supplementary claim fQr a refund on the giound
that the collection of the addiif
tax had.been barred
by the statute of-limitations con.tamed in § 250-(d)of the
Revenue Act of N6vember 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat, 227,
265. After.thq lapse of six months without,,a determmation by the' Coninssioner, he brought this, suit,-n the
Court of Claims to recover the money.so.paad.' There he_
urged both contentions. In answer to the latter, the Govermient ibsusted that the statute had been waived by a
written agreement signed by Stange in November, 1922,
and by the Comnissioner inM arch, 1023. The trial court
entered judgment foi tie United States. 68 Ct. Cls. 395.
This Court granted a.writ of certiorari, limited "to the
questions mvolvifig the validity and effect of the waiver
of the statute of limitations." 281 U S. 707
No constitutional question is presented. Wheth er the
petitioner is entitled to recover depends upon the construction and effect of § 250, (d) and of the written agreement called the waiver. That section provides:

August 5, 1909, shall be*determined and. assessed within
five years after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later

no suit or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes

The waiver provides:

waiver executed after the expiration of the period of limitation would give to the statute a retyoactive effect,
which Congress cannot be presumed to have intended.
There was no lack of power. Prior to the '1921 'Act no
legislation barred the enforcement of the liability for a
tax under the Act of 1913. Taxes duly'assessed could -be
collected at any lime by suit. There was a three-year
limitation on assessment2 (Section II (E), 3S Stat. 169),
which if duly made might be followed by distraint. But
there was -no limitation upon the time within which the
tax liability could be enforced by suit without a prior
assessment.. The 1921 Act was the first, to interpose a
limitation upon the right of the Government to enforce
a tax liability already accrued.' It barred collectjon in

There was doubt whether this provision required the Comnissoner both to discover the error in the return and to make an additional assessment, or, merely to make discovery, within the three
years. See Aiken v. Buinet, decided this day,' post, p. 280, note 2;

The provisidns in § 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (4Q Stat.

assessed under that Act. Compare Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Lighterage Co., 273 U. S.346, 350; Florsheim Bros. Co. v. United States,
280 U. S.453, 459, note 5. Even after the Act of 1921 suit might be
brought, within the limitation period, though no assessment had been
made. See Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, § 278 (d), 43 Stat, 253, 300.

STANGE v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

any manner after five years only in case no waiver was
given. Congress must have intended that a waiver should
be operative even though before the passage of the. Act
five years had elapsed from the time the return had been
filed. Among the earlier revenue acts referred to in § 250
(d) was that of 1909, the returns under which were required to be filed more than ten years prior to the passage of the 1921 'Act. Section 38, Third, 36 Stat. 114.
And returns under the Revenue Act of 1913 were required
to be filed more than six years before the passage of the
1921 Act. Section II (D), 38 Stat. 168. The consent
clause in § 250 (d) deals broadly with all assessments and
collections under past and future acts, and there is no
indication of an intention to confine it to those few cases
under the early revenue acts in which no return had been
filed or a so-called common law waiver had been given
prior to 1921. Unless it is to .be rendered practically
meaningless as applied to tax returns under these earlier
acts, it must be construed to permit the execution of
waivers after the period of'five years. Moreover, there
is the analogy of the rule that private .debts barred by the
statute of limitations may be effectively revived, after the
bar has fallen, by a new promise without new consideration. Williston, Contracts, §§ 160-184.
Second. It is contended that the so-called waiver was
inoperative because its-provisions did not conform, to
§ 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of '1921, in that it waived
"any and all statutory limitations as to the time within
which assessments based upon such liability may be entered," but did not in terms refer to the" determination"
or "collection" of the tax.' The argument is that Con5

gress had, in respect to a waiver, prescribed an exact and
mandatory procedure under which the, Copmnissioner was
authorized to defer action only if the taxpayer expressly
waived the limitations on all three steps, determination,
assessment, and collection,-reliance being had on the use
of the conjunctive "and" in the section; that the statutory authority given the Commissioner to consent to a
later performance of these three steps didl not imply a
like authority as to any one of them;' that under§ 250
(d) the periods within which both assessment and collection must be made, run concurrently five years from the
filing of the returh; and that nothing was accomplished by
consenting, to the assessment, since the assent to a later
collecti6n was withheld.
We are of the opinion that the validity 6f a waiver
under § 250 (d) was not conditioned on the precise use of
the three words, therein mentioned. As pointed out in
FlorsheimBros., etc. v. United States, 280 U. S. 453, 466,
a waiver is not a contract) and the provision requiring the
Commissioner's signature was inserted for purely administrative purposes and not to convert into a contract what'
is essentially a voluntary, unilateral waiver of a defense
by the taxpayer. The ambit of the Commissioner's authority may be in-many respects limited by the statute,
Florsheim Bros., etc. v. United States, supra, at 464, but
no reason appears why it was essential that specific reference be made to the period for collection, or why he could
not, with, the taxpayer's consent, employ one word instead
of three to secure the desired result. , rlhe waiver, in
terms, was executed by the taxpayer in order "that his
liability ..
might -be determined" only after
intensive and thorough reconsideration by the Conmmis(2d) 772; see, also, Watt & Holmes Hardware Co. v. Commissioner,

sioner. The parties cannot have intended to -have the
amount of the tax ascertained and to leave the taxpayer
free to pay it or not. They clearly cohtemplated the
entire procedure necessary to determination and collection
of the tax. This does not mean that the distinctions
between assessment and collection were to be disregarded,
but merely that the employment of a single term comprehended both steps.
In November, 1922, both parties understood that the
tax would be assessed and collected after a proper consideration of the taxpayer's objections to any additional
assessment. To secure sufficient time fqr this purpose,
the so-called waiver was executed. The failure to insert
in the written consent words expressly waiving the statutory limitation upon collection, is explained by the belief
prevailing prior to the decision in Bowers v. N. Y. & Al-,
bany Lighterage Company, 273 U. S. 346, that distraint,
the common method for coercing payment, was possible
even when the statutory period for collection by suit had
expired. That the parties at the time may have believed
that collection was possible independent of any waiver,
does not make less effective the instrument given for the
purpose of tolling the limitation on the ultimate determination and collection of the tax. It must be assumed
that an effective and not a futile act was intended.
