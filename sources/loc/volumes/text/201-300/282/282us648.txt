entitled to allowance for obsolescence of its building that
was caused by the imminence and taking effect of prohibition. That case rules this one.
Judgment affirmed.

ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND" CIRCUIT.

No. 61.

Argued January 21, 1931.-Decided FVebruary 24, 1931.

1. Under ยง 234 (a) (7) of the Revenue Act of 1918, a brewing company was entitled to a reasonable allowance for obsolescence of
tangible property caused by prohibition legislation. Gambrinus
Brewery Co. v. Anderson, ante, p. 638. P. 651.
2. The Court takes judicial notice that, prior to the submission of
the Eighteenth Amendment in 1917, more than thirty States had
enacted prohibitory laws; that a federal war measure, effective
August 10, 1917, required the redu4tion of the alcoholic content of
beer; that the proposed Amendment was ratified by twelve States
in the first six months of 1918land by three more before the expiration of that year; that twenty-one States ratified it in the early part of January, 1919; that in that month the Amendment became
a part of the Constitution and that it took effect one year later,
January 16, 1920. P. 651.
3. Obsolescence is not necessarily confined to particular elements or
parts of a plant, but may affect the whole of it; and it may result
from ]aws regulating or forbidding the particular use to which the
.property has been put as well as from other causes. P. 653.
4. The purpose of the statute in allowing deductions for obsolescence,
ยง 234 (a) (7), supra, is to guide the.ascertainment of taxable income each year; and, like other tax laws, it should be construed
liberally in favor of the taxpayer. P. 654.
5. The burden of proving the existence and amount of obsolescence
may be sustained by such weight of evidence as would reasonably
support a verdict for the plaintiff in an ordinary action for money.
P. 654.

Argument for Petitioner.

6. A reasonable approximation of the amount that fairly may be included in the accounts of any year is all that is required. P. 655.
7. In determining the deduction for obsolescence, the amount prob-.
ably recoverable from the property, at the end of its service, by
putting it to another use or by selling it as scrap or otherwise, is to
be considered. There is no hard and fast rule that the taxpayer
must show that it will be scrapped or cease to be used or useful
for any purpose, before an allowance may be made for obsolescence.
P. 655.
8. The facts found in this case show that obsolescence of the taxpayer's brewing plant commenced at about the beginning of 1918
and was complete upon the taking effect of prohibition in January
1920, the taxpayer having been unable to find any profitable use of
the property, in the manufacture of near-beer or otherwise, and
the sums received as rents and from a sale constituting mere salvage. P. 656.

Key, J. Louis Monarch and John MacC. Hudson, Special
Assistants to the Attorney General, and Clarence W.

The Revenue Act of 1918 does not authorize a deduction, either as obsolescence or as a loss, for the decline
in value of property, whether tangible or intangible, resulting from the imminence and incidence of national
prohibition legislation. Clarke v. Haberle Brewing. Co.,
280 U. S. 384.
There was no obsolescence in fact. To sustain the
claim it must appear that the taxpayer foresaw with reasonable certainty that the property would not be useful

in his business or any other business, at some definite
time in the future, when the property would have to be
abandoned. There is no finding that this occurred during
.1918 or 1919. Obsolescence results from a lack of usefulness and not from a lack of use. The taxpayer commenced to manufacture near-beer in 1917, using the same
property and equipment as was ,used to manufacture beer.
The imminence of prohibition legislation did not justify
the conclusion that it would affect the manufacture and
sale of near-beer or shorten the useful life of the property.
After the adoption of national prohibition, the taxpayer
continued the manufacture and sale of near-beer. Its
failure to use the property to as great an extent as before
was due not to any. lack of usefulness but solely to an
absence of a large demand for the product.
There was no sale or abandonment of the property
until 1928, and consequently there is no basis for an alternative claim to the deductions of 1918 and 1919 as a
business loss in those .years.
Mr. Basil Robillard for respondents.

MR.JUsTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
in making its tax returns for 1918 and 1919 the brewing company, because of approaching prohibtion, made
deductions for obsolescence of its buildings, machinery
and equiptibent. The Commissioner disallowed the deductions on the ground that after prohibition the taxpayer continued to use his property to make and sell near
beer and other non-intoxicating beverages. The Board of
Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner. 13 B. T. A.
1040. The Circuit Court of Appeals' reversed. 38'F.
(2d) 217.
The pertinent words of the statute, Revenue Act of
1918, ยง 234 (a) (7) are: "A reasonable allowance for the

Opinion of the Court.

exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the trade
or business, including' a reasonable allowance for
obsolescence."
The Government contends that this statute did not
authorize a deduction for obsolescence of tangible property resulting from the imminence of prohibition. But in
the Gambrinus case just decided we hold the contrary.
The Government also maintains that on the facts of
this case no allowance for obsolescence should be made.
We take judicial notice of the following: Prior to the
submission of the Eighteenth Amendment in' 1917, more
than 30 States had enacted prohibitory laws. A war
measure, effective August 10, 1917, required the reduction of the alcoholic content of beer. The proposed
amendment was ratified by 12 States in the first six
months of 1918 and by three more before the expiration
of that year; 21 States ratified in the early part of January, 1919, and in that month the Amendment became a
part of the Constitution and took effect one year later,
January 16, 1920.
There is no controversy as to facts found by the Board of
Tax Appeals:
The brewing company from 1902 until October, 1919,
was engaged in making and selling beer. Its sales from
1912 to 1917 inclusive ranged from 30,681 to 37,176 barrels per year. Due to war-time prohibition, its sales fell
off in 1918 to 30,204 barrels, about 19 per cent. less than
the sales of the preceding year, and in 1919 to 17,823 barrels, about 40 per cent. less than in 1918.
At the end of 1917 the depreciated cost, and actual
value, of the company's land, buildings and equipment
was $477,054.60. After deducting the allowances in 1918
and in 1019 for exhaustion, wear and tear of its plant and
for obsolescence of property used for making beer, the
book value of such property was reduced to $279,117.08.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

282 U.S.

But due to prohibition laws its actual value at the-end
of 1919 was only $90,475. That is $188,642.08 less than
the book value after such deductions.
Its buildings, machinery and equipment were designed
and constructed for the brewing and gelling of beer'and
were not available or readily adaptable to other uses.
The buildings were damp, the floor levels uneven; there
were few openings for light and no elevators; and, the
property was located in a manufacturing zone. Much
of the machinery could not be removed without dismantling or tearing out the walls of the building and some
of -it could not be removed except by tearing out a side
of the building. The company's officers considered sel4ing or converting its-buildings and machinery into a plant
for a dairy, cold storage, ice cream manufacturing, dry
storage, ice manufacture, fruit storage, semicold storage,
machine shop, or chemical plant. They could find no
use for the property except for the purpose of making near
beer and other soft drinks.
In 1917 the company began to manufacture near beer
and for that purpose used the machinery and processes
employed in the making of beer. An additional process
for dealcoholizing was necessary. It sold 16 barrels in
that year, 327 in 1918, 8 in 1919, 7,921 in 1920 and 2,852
in 1921.
In 1918 it began the manufacture of other soft'drinks
by use of machinery not here involved. In October,
1919, because of prohibition, the company discontinued
the making of beer. It abandoned the lower floor of
one of its buildings which had been devoted to storing
and aging beer. That process is not involved in making
near beer. Thereafter a part-of another building with the
equipment therein which had_ been used- three or four
times a week in making and bottling beer was used only
once in abo. two weeks in making near beer. Apparently the rest of the property was used in connection with

BURNET v. NIAGARA BREWING CO.
648

Opinion of the Court.

the making of such near beer and other soft drinks as
were made by the company prior to its going out of
business.
The company could not operate at a profit after prohibition and the corporation was voluntarily dissolved in
December of 1921. Its affairs were administered by its
former directors acting as trusteeA. In January, 1922,
they leased all the property, including equipment that
had been added for the making of soft drinks, for a term
of three months with privilege of renewal by the lessee.
The lease was still in effect at the time of the, hearing
before the Board in 1927. The rent was at the rate of
$5,000 per year plus taxes, insurance and repairs.
The difference between the depreciated cost (found to
be actual value) December 31, 1917, and the value of the
property in 1918 and 1919 was due to the imminence and
incidence of war-time and permanent prohibition. There
was no material change in the value of land and buildings in the vicinity used for purposes other than brewing.
In December, 1921, the company sold certain of its land,
free from buildings, for $20,000. Up to the time of the
hearing the highest offer for the remaining property that
the company was able to secure was $35,000.
The Government argues that obsolescence is the state
of becoming obsolete, that property is obsolete when it is
no longer useful for the purpose for which it was acquired
and cannot be used for any other purpose and that obsofescence begins only when there is a reasonable certainty
that the property will become obsolete. And further,
that there is no finding that at any time during the taxable years in question it became apparent that the property would become obsolete and that no inference to that
effect can properly be drawn from the facts found.
In the solution of the problem here presented, no general or. comprehensive definition of "obsolescence " is
necessary. The word is much used and its meaning de-

pends upon and varies with the connections in which it
is employed. It has been said to be "the condition or
process by which units gradually cease to be useful or
profitable as a part of the property, on account of changed
conditions." * Obsolescence is not necessarily confined
to particular elements or parts of a plant; the whole may
become obsolete. Obsolescence may arise as the result
of laws regulating or forbidding the particular use of the
property as well as from changes in the art, the shifting
of business centers, loss of trade, inadequacy or other
causes.
We are here concerned with the meaning of obsolescence
as used in the above quoted clause of the taxing Act.
Clearly the statute contemplates that, where warranted
by the facts, the taxpayer shall have the benefit of, and
in making his return may deduct in each year, a reasonable allowance to cover obsolescence of the tangible property. And that is in accord with sound principles of accounting. Cf. Kansas City So. Ry. v. United States, 231
U. S. 423, 451. Pacific Gas Co. v. San Francisco,265 U. S.
403, 415. The provision is general and applied alike to
all taxpayers; its purpose is to guide the ascertainment of
taxable income in each year. It is a familiat rule that
tax laws are to be liberally construed in favor of taxpayers.
FarmersLoan & T. Co. v. Minnesota, 280 U. S. 204, 212.

'States v. Merriam, 263 U. S. 179, 188. Shwab. v. Doyle,
258 U. S. 529, 536. Eidman v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 578,
583.
It would be unreasonable and violate that canon of
construction to put upon the taxpayer the burden of proving to a reasonable certainty the existence and amount of
obsolescence. Such weight of evidence as would reasonably support a verdict for a plaintiff in an ordinary action
for the recovery of money fairly may be deemed sufficient.

Opinion of the Court.

Neither the cost of obsolescence nor of accruing exhaustion, wear and tear that is properly chargeable in any period of time can be measured accurately. A reasonable
approximation of the amount that fairly may be included in the accounts of any year is all that is required.
In determining the proper deduction for obsolescence
there is to be taken into consideration the amount probably recoverable, at the end of its service, by putting the
property to another use or by selling it as scrap or otherwise. There is no hard and fast rule, as suggested by the
Government, that a taxpayer must show that his propefty will be scrapped or cease to be used or useful for
any purpose, before any allowance may be madi for
obsolescence.
There is no claim that, if allowable at all, the amounts
deducted were excessive or that they were not properly.allocated as between the two years in question. The
rapid advance toward prohibition prior to and in 1917 was
sufficient to warn one engaged in brewing beer that his
business would probably be brought to an end at an early
date. In January, 1919, before the, tax return for. 1918
was due, prohibition was established to take effect one
year later. The facts found show that in the early part of
1918 the company was abundantly justified in concluding
that upon the taking effect of prohibition it must cease to
use its brewery for making beer.
It was then warranted in concluding that the period of
dbsolescence commenced about the first of 1918 and would
end upon the taking effect of prohibition. The fact that
prohibition would put all the breweries out of business is..
enough to show that it would bepractically imjossible to
sell such properties or find other uses to which they profitably could be put. Due to prohibition the diminution in
value of the company's property in 1918 and 1919 was
about twice as much as the total of all sums deducted to
cover obsolescence in those years. In that period over 80

per cent. of the 1917 value of its lands, buildings and
equipment disappeared. Notwithstanding diligent efforts,
the property could not be put to any profitable use or soldfor more than a fraction of its value in 1917. The rents
realized under a short term lease renewed from time to
time for more than five years amounted to less than one
and one-half per cent. of such value.
The facts found clearly show that obsolescence commenced about the beginning of 1918 -and that the property became obsolete upon the taking effect of prohibition
in January, 1920. The company was unable to find any
profitable use to which the property could be put. The
sums received on the sale and as rents constituted mere
salvage.
