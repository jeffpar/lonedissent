delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the Commissioner's
determination of deficiencies in respondent's income and
profits taxes for fiscal years ending May 31, 1919, and
1920. The taxpayer claimed allowances for obsolescence,
resulting from prohibition legislation, of a part of a build-

ing. It was denied. 7 B. T. A. 1241. The Court of
Appeals reversed. 38 F. (2d) 718.
The taxpayer, a Louisiana corporation organized in
1911, was engaged in making and selling beer. November
3, 1919, it abandoned that business and commenced the
manufacture of near beer which it continued until 1923.
For the manufacture of beer the taxpayer had a brewery
building and a cellar building having three floors. After
prohibition the brewery building and one floor of the
cellar building were used in the production of near beer.
Two floors of the cellar building and c6rtain steel and
wooden vats thereon formerly used for aging beer were
not needed and their use was discontinued on November
1919. The Board found that the vats had no salvage
value and held their depreciated cost deductible as
obsolescence over the period from December 18, 1917, the
date of the submission of the Eighteenth Amend'ment, to
January 16, 1920, the' date that prohibition took effect.
But it denied any allowance for obsolescence of the two
floors on the ground that, while the taxpayer ceased to
use them, there was nothing in the record to indicate that
the structure was obsolete or becoming so. The Court
of Appeals held the evidence ample to support the taxpayer's contention that after abandonment the two floors
possessed no residual or salvage value. The Government
has raised here only the question whether under the Revenue Act^ of 1918, § 234 (a) (4) or (a) (7) a deduction
may be allowed for loss or obsolescence of tangible property caused' by prohibition legislation, and concedes that
it is not in position to conternd that the evidence was not
sufficient to establish- obsolescence, of the two floors.
The Government relies on Clarke v. Haberle Brewing
Co., 280 U. S. 384, and Renziehausen v. Lucas, 280 U. S.
387. But we have held in the Gambrinu& case just
decided that under § 234 (a) (7) a brewing company is

entitled to allowance for obsolescence of its building that
was caused by the imminence and taking effect of prohibition. That case rules this one.
Judgment affirmed.
BURNET, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. NIAGARA FALLS BREWING COMPANY
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND" CIRCUIT.

No. 61.

Argued January 21, 1931.-Decided FVebruary 24, 1931.

1. Under § 234 (a) (7) of the Revenue Act of 1918, a brewing company was entitled to a reasonable allowance for obsolescence of
tangible property caused by prohibition legislation. Gambrinus
Brewery Co. v. Anderson, ante, p. 638. P. 651.
2. The Court takes judicial notice that, prior to the submission of
the Eighteenth Amendment in 1917, more than thirty States had
enacted prohibitory laws; that a federal war measure, effective
August 10, 1917, required the redu4tion of the alcoholic content of
beer; that the proposed Amendment was ratified by twelve States
in the first six months of 1918land by three more before the expiration of that year; that twenty-one States ratified it in the early part of January, 1919; that in that month the Amendment became
a part of the Constitution and that it took effect one year later,
January 16, 1920. P. 651.
3. Obsolescence is not necessarily confined to particular elements or
parts of a plant, but may affect the whole of it; and it may result
from ]aws regulating or forbidding the particular use to which the
.property has been put as well as from other causes. P. 653.
4. The purpose of the statute in allowing deductions for obsolescence,
§ 234 (a) (7), supra, is to guide the.ascertainment of taxable income each year; and, like other tax laws, it should be construed
liberally in favor of the taxpayer. P. 654.
5. The burden of proving the existence and amount of obsolescence
may be sustained by such weight of evidence as would reasonably
support a verdict for the plaintiff in an ordinary action for money.
P. 654.
