tents of the package. The evidence of the search and
seizure made in his house tended to show that he knew
what he was doing and was a willing participant in the
conspiracy charged. But so far as concerns the other
defendants, it is immaterial whether he acted innocently
and without knowledge of the contents of the package or
knowingly to effect the object of the conspiracy. In either
case, his act would be equally chargeable to his codefendants. They are not entitled to a new trial. See Rossi v.
United States, 278 Fed. 349, 354; Belfi v. United States,

DRUGGAN v. ANDERSON, U. S. MARSHAL,

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 415.

Argued October 5, 6, 1925.-Decided October .19, 1925.

1. Although by the terms of the Eighteenth Amendment the prohibition thereby decreed did not go into force until one year from the
ratification (January 16, 1919) of the Article, the anendment itself
became effective as a law upon its ratification and empowered
Congress thereupon to legislate in anticipation for the enforcement of the proh'bition when the year should expire, without
awaiting that event. P. 38.
2. A preliminary injunction issued under § 22 of Title II of the
Prohibition Act, without the notice required by Equity Rule 73
and the Act of October 15, 1914, is not void. P. 40.
Affirmed.
APPEAL from an order of the District Court dismissing
a petition for habeas corpus. The imprisonment in-question was imposed upon the petitioner for disobedience of
an injunction issued under the Prohibition .Act.

Argument for Appellant.

Mr. Michael J. Ahern, with whom Mr. Thomas D. Nash
was on the briefs, for appellant.
Title II of the National Prohibition Act, is unconstitutional and void. Sections 1, 27, 37 and 38 may be copstitutional if they have reference only to Title I of the
Act and trace their source of authority to the war powers
of Congress. The Eighteenth Amendment did not go
into effect or become operative as a part of the Constitution until January 16, 1920. Dillon v. Gloss, 256 U. S.
368; § 3, Title II, National Prohibition Act; National
Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350; Street v. Lincoln Safe
Deposit Co., 254 U. S. 88.
The Government of the United States is ,a government
of limited and defined powers. Congress has power to
legislate only where it has constitutional authority to, do
so. Title II of the National Prohibition Act having been
passed October 27, 1919, prior to the time when the
Eighteenth Amendment went into effect, was passed without authority derived from the Constitution and is, therefore, unconstitutional.
Section 24 of Title II is an invasion of the jiadicial
power and therefore unconstitutional. The power to
punish for contempt is inherent in courts. Bessette v.
Conkey Co., 194 U. S. 324; Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289.
Section 24 of Title II limits the discretion of the court
in the fixing of penalties and thereby invades the inherent
power of the court. Ex parte Garner, 179 Cal. 409. Section 24 violates the Sixth Amendment. The injunctional
order upon which the judgment is founded is absolutely
void, as District Courts are without power, and are expressly prohibited by Equity Rule 73, to grant temporary
injunctions without notice.
Solicitor General Mitchell and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat,
Special Assistant to the Attorney General, were on the
brief, for appellees.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

269 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is -n appeal from an order dismissing a petition
for a writ of habeas corpus on demurrer. The petitioner
is imprisoned for contempt in disobeying a temporary injunction issued under Section 22 of Title II of the National Prohibition Act; October 28, 1919, c. 85; 41 Stat.
305, 315. The bill upon which the injunction was issued
alleged the existence of a public nuisance used for the
manufacture, sale, &c., of intoxicating liquor, and charged
that the petitioner among others was conducting the business. An injunction was ordered, pendente lite. Subsequently an information was filed against the petitioner
and others for contempt and the petitioner was sentenced
to a fine and to imprisonment for one year. He was committed to jail on November 11, 1924. The main ground
for the present petition is that Title II of the Act, with
immaterial exceptions, is unconstitutional because it was
enacted before Amendment XVIII of the Constitution
'went into effect. The Amendment prohibits the manufacture, sale, &c., of intoxicating liquors for beverage
purposes, 'after one year from the ratification of this
article'. The date of the ratification is fixed as January
16, 1919, Dillon v. Gloss, 256 U. S. 368, 376, and the National Prohibition Act was passed on October 28, 1919
before a year from the ratification had expired, It is said
that the prohibition is the Amendment; that until there
ig a prohibition there is no Amendment, and that without the Amendment the Act of Congress, although it was
not to go into effect until after the Amendment did, Title
II, § 3, was unauthorized and void.
We will give a few words to this argument notwithstanding the difficulties in the way of proceeding by
habeas corpus in a case like this, Howat v. Kansas, 258
U. S. 181, 189, 190; Craigv. Hecht, 263 U. S. 255, and notwithstanding the fact that the validity of the statutes has
been supposed to have been established heretofore.-It is

Opinion of the Court.

not correct to say that the Amendment did not exist until
its prohibition went into effect; in other words that 'there
was no Amendment until January 16, 1920, although one
had been ratified a year before. The moment that the
Amendment was ratified it became effective as alaw. The
operation of its words a year later depended wholly upon
what had happened on or before January 16, 1919. Nothing happened after that date except the lapse of time.
This distinction is maintained by the language of the
Amendment, which is not that the Amendment shall go
into operation a year after it is ratified but that the acts
against which it is directed are prohibited after that time,
although we attach no other importance to the precise
form of words used than that of showing an accurate instinct in those who drew it. Whichever form was used,
the world had notice of it, and we apprehend that there
would be little difficulty in holding void a contract made
in July, 1919, and contemplating performance in disregard of the prohibition in July, 1920. Every dogmatic
statement of the law is prophetic of what will happen in a
certain event. There is no more reason why the Constitution should not give the warning for the next year than
there is for its not giving it for the next moment. We
have no doubt .of the authority of Congress to pass the
law. Barbour v. Georgia, 249 U. S. 454. Diamond Glue
Co. v. United States Glue Co., 187 U. S. 611, 615, 616.
Indeed it would be going far to say that while the fate of
the Amendment was uncertain Congress could not have
passed a law in aid of it, conditioned upon the ratification
taking place.
A shorter answer to the whole matter is that the grant
of power to Congress is a present grant and that no reason
has been suggested why the Constitution may not give
Congress a present power to enact laws intended to carry
outictnstitutional provisions for the future when the time
comes for them to take effect.

Syllabus.

It is argued that the preliminary injunction vas void
for want of the notice required by Equity Rule 73 and
the Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323, § 17; 38 Stat. 730,
737. The statute provides that if it is made to appear
that the nlisance exists, a temporary injunction shall
issue forthwith. § 22. In view of the drastic policy of
the Amendment and the statute, we see no reason why
the words should not be taken literally, to mean what
they say. McFarland v. United States, 295 Fed. 648.
But if notice were required the injunction could not be
disregarded as void. Howat v. Kansas, supra.
We think the case too clear for extended discuission, but
it seemed worth while to say what we have said in explanation of our judgment, although we did not think it
necessary to hear the other side.
Judgment affirmed.

AMERICAN RAILWAY EXPRESS COMPANY v.
DANIEL.
CERTIORARI

TO

THE

SUPREME

COURT

OF

THE

STATE

OF

GEORGIA.

No. 53.

Argued October 16, 1925.-Decided October 26, 1925.

1. Where the tariff schedules of an express company governing interstate shipments offer a lower rate for goods below a specified value
and a higher rate for goods more valuable, a stipulation in an
express receipt fixing the lower value in consideration of the lower
rate binds the shipper, although both his agent and the carrier's,
in making the shipment, were unaware of the fact that the value
was higher, and the latter knew the former to be thus ignorant.
P. 41.
2. The sender is bound to know the relation established by the
carrier's schedules between values and rates, and in an action to
recover the value of the goods, it is error to exclude the schedules
from evidence. P. 42.
157 Ga. 731, reversed.
