Rep. 357. The Wynkoop Company thereupon prosecuted this appeal, and a motion has been made to dismiss
the same for want of jurisdiction.
That the motion to dismiss must be granted is manifest
from the statement we have made. Whatever may have
been the nature of the original controversy presented
by the intervention of the Wynkoop Company, the
acquiescence of both parties in the order of June 22, 1911,
settled that controversy, and the questions remaining
were purely administrative, concerning as they did merely
the carrying but of the order according to its true intent
and purpose. This being the case, the question whether
the order of June 22, 1911, was correctly interpreted by
the referee and the District Court in the distribution
directed by the subsequent administrative order is not
one concerning an allowance or rejection of a claim within
§ 25b of the Bankruptcy Act, but is a matter arising in the
administration of the bankrupt estate, which we are not
empowered to review.
Appeal dismissed.

VIRTUE v. CREAMERY PACKAGE MANUFACTURING COMPANY AND OWATONINA COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 80. Argued December 9, 10, 1912.-Decided January 20, 1913.
To sustain an action under § 7 of the Sherman Act a necessary element
is cooperation by some of the defendants in a scheme involving
monopoly or restraint of interstate trade and causing the damage
complained of.

VIRTUE v. CREAMERY PACKAGE CO.
227 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

The owner of a patent has exclusive rights of making, using and selling,
which he may keep or transfer in whole or in part.
Patents and patent rights cannot be made a cover for violation of law;
but they are not so used when only the rights conferred'by law are
exercised.
Patent rights can be protected by a party to an illegal combination.
While the combined effect of the separate acts alleged to have made the
combination illegal must be regarded as a whole, the strength of!each
act must be considered separately.
Assertion of patent rights may be so conducted as to constitute malicious prosecution; but failure of plaintiff to maintain the actidn does
not necessarily convict of malice.
Mere coincidence in time in the bringing by separate parties of suits for
infringements on patents against the same defendant held, in this case,
not to indicate a combination on the part of those parties to injure the
defendant within the meaning of § 7 of the Sherman Anti-trust Act.
A contract by which a manufacturer of a patented article appoints
another Who does not manufacture or sell like articles, his exclusive
agent for the output of the factory, held in this case not to violate
the Sherman Act.
Where an action under § 7 of the Sherman Act was tried in the Circuit
Court and argued in the Circuit Court of Appeals on the basis of
co6peration between the defendants, this court will not consider a
contention raised for the first time that one of the defendants was
itself a combination offensive to the statute.
In this case it does not appear that the contracts between the defendants were made for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, and both
courts below having so held this court also so holds.
179 Fed. Rep. 115, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of § 7 of the
Sherman Anti-trust Act and what constitutes an illegal
combination thereunder, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. HarlanE. Leach, with whom Mr. James F. Williamson and Mr. James A. Taumey were on the brief, for

plaintiff in error:
It is not necessary to prove the commission of any tort,
wrongful act or crime on the part of defendants, aside
from what is prohibited by the terms of the Sherman,
Anti-trust Act, in order to make the defendants liable

It is not necessary that the act which caused the damage should be anything in itself prohibited by the Antitrust Act. It is not necessary that it be a step in the
formation of the "contract," "combination" or "conspiracy" or a step in the attempt to secure monopoly.
It is sufficient if such an act originated in, or was directly
associated with, the motives which were the cause of the
contract, combination, conspiracy or attempt to secure
monopoly. ChattanoogaWorks v. Atlantd, 203 U. S. 390.

VIRTUE v. CREAMERY PACKAGE CO.
227 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

A scheme or contract whereby a corporation disposes
of its business, and agrees to ever thereafter remain out
of business, is illegal and void, under the Sherman Antitrust Act. Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson, 209 U. S.
423.
A combination has obtained a monopoly when it has
reached a position where it can control prices and suppress
competition.
United States v. Am. Tobacco Co., 164
Fed. Rep. 700, 721.
Where the necessary and direct effect of the combination is to restrain trade or effectuate a monopoly, the
intent is immaterial. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v.
United States, 175 U. S. 211.
But where acts in themselves are not directly in restraint of trade or do not directly tend towards a monopoly, or are only an attempt, the intent of the parties
becomes material. Swift v. United States; Loewe v. Lawlor,
supra; Penn. Sugar Co. v. Am. Refining Co., 166 Fed.
Rep. 254; Bigelow v. Calumet & Hecla Co., 167 Fed. Rep.
704, 709.
In cases of conspiracy it is always permissible to
allege and prove the history and various steps culminating
in the final conspiracy, even though the previous steps
were separate and distinct offenses, if they tend to throw
light on the present conspiracy and to show the intent
with which the final acts were committed. Wharton on

The contract of February 24, 1898, being illegal and
void, the defendant Creamery Company obtained no title
to the letters patent sued on in the infringement suit
brought by it against the plaintiffs herein, it having
acquired such patents, if at all, by said illegal and void
contract or the assignments executed pursuant to its
terms and as a part of the same illegal scheme. McMullen v. Hoffman, 174 U. S. 639; Connolly v. Union

Co., 87 N. E. Rep. 521; Thomson v. Thomson, 7 Ves. 468;
Levy v. Kansas City, 168 Fed. Rep. 524.
That the Creamery Company held assignments of the
patents valid on their face will avail nothing; the court
will look into the whole transaction. McMullen v. Hoffman, 174 U. S. 639.
The Creamery Company could not establish its cause
of action in the infringement suit without relying on the
illegal agreement, for it had to set up and prove its title
to the .patents sued on, and could only do this by bringing
in the assignments which were a part of the illegal scheme.
McMullen v. Hoffman, 174 U. S. 639; Continental Wall
PaperCo. v. Voight, 212 U. S. 227.
An interlocutory decree in a patent infringement suit,
providing for an injunction and ordering an accounting
and sending the case to a referee to ascertain the amount
of damages, has no force as an adjudication in any other
action. The decree must be a final decree to have such
effect. The decr'ee in the suit brought by the defendant
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company against these

of monopoly, restraint of trade and-lack of title are new
in this action, and were not litigated or at issue in the
patent infringement suit, as shown by the pleadings in
the patent infringement suit set forth in full in the complaint in this action. Harmon v. Struthers, 48 Fed. Rep.

This conspiracy was a continuing offense; every overt
act committed in furtherance thereof was a renewal of the
same as to all of the parties. The statute of limitations
does not begin to run until the commission of the last
overt act. Neither can the parties claim a vested right to
violate the law. 19 Am. & Eng. Enc. (2d ed.), "Limitations of Actions;" United States v. Creen- 115 Fed. Rep.

227 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Plaintiffs have a cause of action at common law. The
Creamery Package Company not having any title to the
patents it sued upon, had no right or authority to prosecute its suit. It is the same as where a person brings a
suit in the name of another without any authority for so
doing. The person so doing must be charged with knowledge of the kind of a title it had. 38 Cyc. 517; Bond v.

The assignment or transfer of a negotiable security
upon an illegal consideration is void, and confers no title

The 1897 contract between the two defendants was

InternationalHarvester Co. v. Clements, 163 Michigan, 55.
None of the contracts contained any provisions for
bringing action against alleged infringers of patents for
the purpose of driving them out of business.
The evidence did not warrant the jury in finding any
agreement or conspiracy between the defendants to
bring the patent suits for the purpose of driving the plaintiffs out of business.
The owner of a patent may notify infringers of his
claims and warn them that unless they desist, suits will
be brought to protect him in his legal rights. The only
limitation on the right to issue such warnings is the requirement of good faith. Kelly v. Ypsilanti Dress Stay Co.,

There is nothing in this case to indicate that any of
the warnings issued by the defendants were made in bad
faith, and they were promptly followed by the institution
of the infringement suits.
The 1897 agreements had to do solely with the settlement of litigation then existing or apprehended, with
the result that a large amount of litigation was settled,

None of the 1897 agreements was in restraint of trade.
The restraint of trade was not greater than the circumstances of the transaction required. Cincinnati &c.
Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U. S. 176; Shawnee Compress Co.
v. Anderson, 209 U. S. 423; Whitwell v. Continental
Tobacco Co., 125 Fed. Rep. 454, 461. Stipulations of
the kind involved are frequent and va.;d. Littlefield v.

policy. Westinghouse Co. v. $hicago &c. Co., 85 Fed. Rep.

Nor was the June, 1898, agreement in restraint of trade.
The stipulations in the Owatonna Manufacturing
Company agreements as to prosecuting infringers were
usual covenants, not warranting the inference of a purpose to drive competitors out of business by groundless suits. See collections of forms in Jones' Legal Forms,

vention of ruinous competition in churns and the avoidance and settlement of litigation and did not constitute
an undue restraint of interstate commerce within the
Sherman law, nor does it show a design to drive competitors out of business by groundless suits. Whitwell v.

The subsequent conduct of the Creamery Company in
using names other than its own, and in acquiring other
concerns, does not tend to show a design to drive competitors out of business.
The Creamery Company has never monopolized or
attempted to monopolize any part of interstate commerce
within the meaning of the Sherman Act. See Noyes on
Corporate Relations, § 389, p. 711; National Cotton Oil
Co. v. Texas, 197 U. S. 115.

The plaintiffs suffered no damage by the successful
prosecution of the suit against them.
The system of remedies applied in Federal courts does
not permit a pending suit in equity to be used as a ground
of recovery at law.
The plaintiffs are in fact prosecuting a suit for malicious
prosecution in defiance of the rule that such a suit is not
maintainable unless the primary suit has terminated in
their favor.
Under the Sherman Act the injury counted on must be
of a kind actionable at common law. The statute does not
override the rules as to damnum absque injuria. Whitwell

A patent owner may notify infringers of his claims and
threaten them with a suit unless they desist. If he doe
this in good faith, believing his claims to be valid, and
brings his suit with reasonable diligence he is acting within
his rights and incurs no liability. There is no evidence of
bad faith in the record. Kelley v. Ypsilanti Mfg. Co., 44

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA

227 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

court.
Action for the recovery of damages in the sum of
$406,881.60, being the total of certain specific items mentioned in the complaint, and for all other damages sustained by plaintiffs (so designated throughout this opinion)
by virtue of the facts stated, including all sums that they
are entitled to under the provisions of -the Sherman Antitrust Act, July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209, c. 647, together with
an attorney's fee. The grounds of recovery are set forth
in the complaint, which, inclusive of exhibits, occupies
150 pages of the record, and seems to make impossible
any attempt at brevity or condensation. The case, however, is not in wide compass and attention may be concentrated upon certain considerations. The contention
of plaintiffs in its most general form is that the defendants
entered into a conspiracy or combination in restraint of
interstate trade and in execution of it, plaintiff's interstate business was destroyed by defendants wrongfully
prosecuting two suits against them for the infringement
of patents under which the articles of their trade were
manufactured and by circulating slanders and libels to
the effect that such articles were infringements of defendants' patents. A cause of action is hence asserted under
§ 7 of the Anti-trust Act. The section is as follows: "Any
person who shall be injured in his business or property
by any other person or corporation by reason of anything
this act, may sue
forbidden or declared to be unlawful by
therefor in any circuit court of the United States in the
district in which the defendant resides or is found, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover
three fold the damages by him sustained, and the costs of
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
To justify recovery, therefore, injury must result from
something forbidden or made unlawful by the act, and

VIRTUE v. CREAMERY PACKAGE CO.
227 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

what is forbidden or made unlawful is expressed in §§ 1
and 2. Section 1 is as follows: "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States,
or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. .. ."
The acts forbidden are made a misdemeanor.- And
by § 2 it is also made a misdemeanor for any person
to "monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine
or conspire with. any other person or persons, to monopolize, any part of the trade or commerce among the several
States, or with foreign nations."
The question occurs, Do the facts of the case show a
breach of the law by defendants and injury resulting from
it to plaintiffs? The following facts are alleged: On the
twenty-fourth of February, 1898, or just prior thereto,
certain corporations, and one partnership were. engaged
in making or selling creamery supplies, including combined churns and butter workers, and transporting them
in state and interstate commerce. All of the corporations
and the partnership were in direct competition in their
lines of business and as the result of it all of the articles
manufactured and sold by them were sold at no more
than a fair price and legitimate profit. The corporations
controlled over 90% of the business of manufacturing
and selling creamery and dairy supplies in the States
of Michigan and Indiana and in all the States west and
in some of the States east thereof, manufacturing the
articles in one or more of the States and shipping by the
same common carriers from the States where manufactured to"other States and distributing and selling such
articles there.
On the twenty-fourth of February, 1898, the Creamery
Package Manufacturing Company, one of the corporations, and its stockholders, then engaged in the manufacture and sale of dairy and creamery supplies but not of

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.

227 U. S.

combined churns and butter workers, it being as to the
latter only the agent for their sale, entered into a contract
with the other corporations and the partnership by which
it was agreed to increase the .capital stock of the
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company to enable
it to purchase the property and business of the
other corporations parties to the contract, including
in the property all patents and applications for
patents.
The contract is very elaborate and verbose, but we
need not give its particular covenants as no point is made
upon them; it being only alleged and contended that its
purpose and effect were that the Creamery Package
Manufacturing Company should acquire the property
and business of the other corporations, and that while
the latter should cease to exist they should be represented
as continuing as separate and independent concerns and
competitors in the market with the Creamery Package
Manufacturing Company and with one another, while in
truth and fact there would be no competition between
them.
It is alleged that in execution of the purpose of the
contract traveling men from the different houses under instructions from the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company met and secretly arranged the bid
each shouid interpose, determining by lot and other
ways who should interpose the lowest bid and who the
highest.
The Owatonna Company was not a party to that contract, but it is contended that it participated in or is
brought into the scheme and purpose of the contract
by certain agreements entered into by it with the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company. They are all
attached to the complaint as exhibits and may be described as transferring certain patents or the right to use
certain patents to the Creamery Package Manufactur-

VIRTUE v. CREAMERY PACKAGE CO.

ing Company.

Opinion of the Court.

A brief summary of them is given in the

margin. 1
The first of the agreements between the companies was made
April 19, 1897 (that was before the contract of February 24, 1898), and
recited that the Owatonna Company was the owner of certain patents
covering combined churns and butter workers and was manufacturing
the same and that as the Cr;eamery Package Manufacturing Company
was desirous of handling the same as sole agents, the agreement was
made. It conveyed five patents issued between January, 1893, and
August, 1896, and applications for another. There were provisions as
to the size, material and other details; also as to royalties to be paid to
the Disbrow Manufacturing Company. And the Owatonna Company
agreed to protect the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company
from all suits for infringement of the patents, or claims for damages
arising out of the sales of the churns and promptly and vigorously to
attack infringers and to procure patents on all improvements made by
it or by any person in its behalf
There was an addition to the contract made June 4, 1897, in regard
to the repair parts of the "Winner" churns and the repair and perfection of the same, and the rebate from the billing pl'ice.
On January 12, 1898, a supplemental contract was made by the same
parties as to the disposition of the royalties received under a license
contract made September 30, 1897, with the Cornish, Curtis & Greene
Manufacturing Company, of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.
On June 4, 1898, another agreement was made between the parties
which referred to the agreement of April, 1897, and to the pendency of
litigation based on the infringement or charges of infringement of the
patents with which that contract was concerned. For the purpose of
adjusting all claims growing out of such infringement and settling the
litigation between the Owatonna Company and F. B. Fargo & Co.,
whose rights the Creamery Pa-kage Manufacturing Co. had acquired,
it was agreed that one of the suits which was named,, and in which
proofs had been taken, should be-brought to a speedy hearing and all
other suits dismissed.
The Creamery Package Manufacturing Company agreed not to
manufacture the machine known as the "Winner" or the "Disbrow,"
both referred to in the contract of April, 1897, called the "sales contract," or any other of a described kind made by the Owatonna Company, but was at liberty to manufacture and sell churns and butter
workers of any other construction. Satisfaction of all royalties, damages and costs was agreed on.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

227 U. S.

It is alleged that on July 8, 1904, the Creamery Package
Manufacturing Company and the Owatonna Company
brought suit separately in the Circuit Court of the United
States for the First Division of the State of Minnesota,
at Winona, against the plaintiffs, charging infringement
of patents for churns and butter workers. The bills in
the suits are attached to the complaint in this action and
are in the usual form. Process was issued and the. plaintiffs here answered. Upon proofs taken a decree was
entered in favor of plaintiffs and against the Owatonna
Company in the suit brought by it. It is not alleged in
the complaint but it is in the answer of the Creamery
The sales contract was continued in force and there was added to it
a provision entitling the Owatonna Company to furnish 55% in value
at list price of the churns and butter workers sold by the Creamery
Package Manufacturing Company in each year after the date of the
contract. If less than that per cent. should be made and furnished by
the Owatonna Company certain sums were provided to be paid by the
other company. And the latter company agreed not to discriminate
against the machines manufactured by the Owatonna Company in
favor of machines of its own manufacture or of other manufacturers,
and that it would give to the machines of the Owatonna Company the
same effort and energy to effect their sale. The Owatonna Company
agreed to protect the patents and prosecute infringers and give assistance to the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company in the prosecution of infringers. Permission was given to the Owatonna Company
to use the "Disbrow" and "Winner" churns owned by the Creamery
Package Manufacturing Company or to be acquired by it. There was
also an agreement made on the 4th of June, 1898, between the parties
in settlement of claims on account of the use of patents with certain
other parties besides F. B. Fargo & Co., whose business the Creamery
Package Manufacturing Co. had acquired. There was a provision for
paying royalties to the Disbrow Co., with other details not necessary to
mention.
On January 1, 1903, another agreement was entered into between
the parties which disposed of and adjusted rights and contentions as to
patents for a machine called a pasteurizer and cream ripener. By an
agreement made January 1, 1903, the prices provided for in'the sales
contract were changed in certain particulars

Opinion of the Court.

Package Manufacturing Company and not denied that
'it obtained a decree adjudging plaintiffs here infringers
of the patents which were the subject of the suit.
It is alleged that the defendants here conspired with
one another to commence and prosecute the suits and
that they were commenced and prosecuted maliciously
and without probable cause, whereby plaintiffs were caused
certain items of damages.
The other allegations of the complaint need not berepeated in detail. They are to the effect that the contract of February 24, 1898, was made in violation of law
to restrain state and interstate trade and commerce and
that all that was done under it was in pursuance and
execution of that purpose, including the suits brought
against plaintiffs by the Owatonna Company, and the
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company for the infringement of patents. That prior to the bringing of
those suits plaintiffs had a good and established trade
and market for their churns and were manufacturing
and shipping them in the States of Wisconsin, Iowa and
South Dakota, and knowing this and fearing that such
trade would be continued in those States and be extended
to other States, defendants commenced the suits for infringement, and prior thereto and since have written letters
and talked to purchasers and prospective purchasers of
plaintiffs' churns, threatening lawsuits and actions for.
damages for infringement of the patents described in the
bills and also threatened suits for injunction, and by this
means destroyed plaintiffs' state and interstate trade.
That plaintiff D. E. Virtue and one Martin Deeg were
the first joint inventors of a churn and butter worker and
that a patent was issued therefor, No. 634,074, under
which they manufactured those articles and sold them in
state and interstate commerce except as they had been
prevented by the suits brought against them as hereinbefore stated. And by elaborate allegations the patents upon

which those suits were brought are attacked for want of
invention and novelty.
That the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company
has purchased the property and business of other competitive concerns and that it has had during the last
several years contracts with many and numerous dealers
in the articles sold by which it required them to purchase
such goods exclusively of it at certain fixed and maintained
prices and to sell only in certain designated territory, the
object of which is to secure a monopoly to the Creamery
Package Manufacturing Company and to restrain interstate commerce. That all of the acts detailed were done
in pursuance of a common scheme and conspiracy on the
part of all of the defendants during the years 1897 and
1898 and ever since maintained and carried out, limiting
the production of creamery supplies, fixing and determining their prices, restraining trade in them and monopolizing over 90% of their production and sale, of which
prior to one year before the bringing of this action plaintiff
had no knowledge or notice except the two suits in equity
and the contract by which Virtue and Deeg transferred to
the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company the exclusive right to manufacture the churn and butter worker
under patent No. 634,074 for the period of three years.
That they did not know that that contract was procured
as part of the schemes of defendants. That they were at
no time parties to acts of defendants and did not know of
the wrongful contracts and combinations until after the
time limited to take the testimony in the two equity suits.
The defendants answered the complaint, admitting some
of its allegations and denying others. They alleged performance of the contract between the Creamery Package
Manufacturing Company and the plaintiff Virtue and said
Deeg and opposed to the charges of the complaint certain
affirmative matters, including two actions brought in the
state court,

VIRTUE v. CREAMERY PACKAGE CQ.
227 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

A jury was empaneled to try the issues which, under the
instructions of the court, found a verdict for defendants
upon which a judgment was duly entered. It was affirmed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 179 Fed. Rep. 115.
The Circuit Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals
both decided, that the damages which plaintiffs alleged
they sustained were not a consequence of a violation by
defendants of the provisions of the Sherman Anti-trust
Act. Both courts assumed for the purpose of their decision
that the contract of February 24, 1898, between the
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company and the other
manufacturers and sellers of churns and butter workers
was a combination in restraint of trade, but both courts
held that the Owatonna Company was not a party to it
nor became associated subsequently in its scheme.
Of the infringement suits the Court of Appeals said they
exhibited "a case where two suits are brought, one by a
party to a lawful agreement, the other by a party to an
unlawful agreement, for the infringement of patents
owned by them respectively and where both parties were
doing no more than exercising their legal rights." And
the court declared in effect that it could see no sinister
significance in the suits being simultaneous, and said,
further, that after a thorough examination of the record it
agreed with the Circuit Court that there was no. evidence
offered at the trial "'which would warrant the jury in
finding that any agreement of that kind existed."'
The plaintiffs attack this conclusion in twenty-one propositions, some of which are of very broad generality and
all, counsel contend, are supported by the decisions of this
and other courts. It is quite impossible to consider them
in detail without a review and repetition of the cases.
The view we take of the case makes this unnecessary.
The case is, as we have said, in narrow compass. The complaint charges a violation of the Sherman Act, and, as a
means of accomplishing its purpose, the destruction of

227 U. S.

plaintiffs' interstate trade by a malicious litigation of their
rights. A necessary element of the charge is the cooperation of at least the corporate defendants in the purpose,
and this determines our inquiry. In answering it we shall
assume, as the lower courts assumed, that by the contract
of February, 1898, the Creamery Package Manufacturing
Company and the corporations competing with it entered
into a combination offensive to the law. Did the Owatonna Company participate in it or subsequently join it
or codperate to execute its purposes? The question must
be answered in the negative, as we 'shall proceed to show.
The Owatonna Company was a manufacturer of churns
and butter workers under various patents owned by it,
which articles it sold throughout the United States, and
by the contract of April 19, 1897, it constituted the
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company its sales
agent of them, the latter company not making churns and
butter workers. The contract was a perfectly legal one
and preceded by some time the agreement of the twentyfourth of February, 1898, entered into between the latter
company and other corporations. There were contracts
between the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company
and the Owatonna Company subsequent to the latter
date, but all of them were supplemental to the first one
and had no illegal taint, nor did they affect it with illegal
taint. It is true they granted rights to the Creamery
Package Manufacturing Company, and exclusive rights,
but this was no violation of law. The owner of a patent
has exclusive rights,,rights of making, using and selling.
He may keep them or transfer them to another-keep
some of them and transfer others. This is elementary;
and, keeping it in mind, there is no trouble in estimating
the character of such rights or their transfer. Of course,
patents and patent rights cannot be made a cover for a
violation of law, as we said in Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company v. United States, 226 U. S. 20. But

VIRTUE v. CREAMERY PACKAGE CO.
227 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

patents are not so used when the rights conferred upon
them by law are only exercised. The agreement of the
nineteenth of April, 1897, constituted, as we said, the
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company a sales agent
of the churns and butter workers made by the Owatonna
Company and fixed their list price. The patents under
which the articles were manufactured were stated, and it
was provided that the Owatonna Company should protect
the Creamery Package Manufacturing Cbmpapy from all
suits for infringement, defend the validity of the patents
and promptly attack infringers. This provision is especially urged by plaintiffs as showing a common and
illegal purpose between the companies. It has not that
quality. It is but an assurance of title to the rights conveyed.
But it is said that the contract between the companies
dated June 4, 1898, exhibits knowledge by the Owatonna
Company of the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company's purpose, and "fitted into the scheme of the two
defendant corporations to get a monopoly in the United
States;" and this, it is said further, "can only be when all
of the doings . . . are looked at as a whole from beginning to end." We cannot concur. We have seen that
the contract of June 4, 1898 (inserted above in the margin), was but a settlement of claims growing out of reciprocal charges of infringement and it has no other
connection with the agreement of February, 1898, than
that some of the claims were against corporations Which
were parties to that agreement. It would be far-fetched to
say that the Owatonna Company could not assert rights
or protect rights because they were asserted or sought to
be protected against corporations which had become
members of an illegal combination, without participating
in the guilt of such combination and becoming a joint
conspirator in its purposes. But it may be said that we
are considering the transactions isolatedly and ignoring

227 U. S.

their combined effect. That indeed would be a fault, but
in order to compute their combined effect we must estimate
what strength they have separately, and 'so far, on the
face of the contracts, there is nothing to inculpate the
Owatonna Company.
But a united purpose is sought to be established between
it and thp Creamery Package Manufacturing Company
by the testimony of witnesses to the effect that the contract of April 19, 1897, between the Disbrow Manufacturing Company and the Owatonna Company was urged by
the president of the Creamery Package Manufacturing
Company, who represented that the acceptance of royalties by the Disbrow Company was better than a c6ntinuance of competition. It is not practicable. to give all the
testimony of what preceded and induced that contract.
The part most relevant to our inquiry is that which related
to the competition which existed between the companies.
A witness, who was president of the Owatonna Company
at the time, testified that-it was suggested to him and other
officers of the company by Mr. Gates, president of the
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company, that a settlement ought to be brought about by letter or otherwise
with the Disbrow Manufacturing Company "so as to
get the two churns which were then being manufactured
together," and stated that he (Gates) had had some conferences with the Disbrow Company, and he thought that
if the officers of the Owatonna Company would go to
Mankato "there might be an arrangement made whereby,.
that business could be brought in connection with ours,
and in that way eliminate the competition that at that
time existed between the Owatonna Manufacturing Company and the Disbrow Manufacturing Company.." This
object was expressed by the witnesses in different ways.
The president of the Disbrow Manufacturing Company
testified that Gates urged that the Disbrow Company
should "stop manufacturing and make a contract with

Opinion of the Court.

the Owatonna Manufacturing Company, and let them
have all our patents on combined churns and butter
workers and other things, and combine the whole business
under one head, and-let them do all of the manufacturing."
The witness testified that he at first rejected the propositio and resented the manner in which the proposal was
made, Gates going so far as to declare, with a profane
accompaniment, "You will do it or we will put you out of
business." But subsequently negotiations were resumed
and the president of the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company explained that he wanted matters settled,
litigation stopped, "and a new arrangement made so that
the whole thing should be run under one head and one
control," and in that way "control the whole churn business." The witness formulated the terms, which resulted,
after some days of negotiation, in the contract of April 19,
1897. But during the negotiations the witness did not
see the Owatonna Company's representatives until they
reached the point of signing the contract.
These declarations seem to be. very arbitrary and unjustifiable when standing alone and to have had no other
purpose than the ruthless crushing of a competitor in the
same line of business. They take on another character,
or rather the object of the negotiations and the contracts
which resulted from them, take on another character,
when all the testimony is considered. It will be observed
from the date of those negotiations and of. the contracts
that they preceded by nearly a year the contract between
the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company and its
competitors and could have had no relation to it. And,
besides, they had a natural and adequate inducement
They were an adjustment of disputes and litigation grow
ing out of a contract between the, Disbrow Company and
the Owatonna Company concerning the very samr
patents. In one suit the Owatonna Company was plaintif
against the Disbrow Company; in another suit the latter

company was plaintiff against the Owatonna Company,
and both suits were based on disputes as to rights or obligations arising from the contract of October 2, 1893. The
testimony. also shows some controversy between the
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company and the Disbrow Company in regard to other patents, but the effect
of it is not easy to estimate. There was also a contract
entered into between the 'Disbrow Company and the
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company on the
nineteenth of April, 1897, settling matters growing out, of
a contract between those companies made on the twelfth
of October, 1896, by which the Disbrow Company made
the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company its exclusive sales agent for churns and butter workers and
mortgaged to the latter company its plant. The other
provisions of the contract concern the adjustment of the
relations between all of the companies under the contemporaneous contracts, and need not be stated in detail. It
is clear, then, as we have already said, that what transpired on the nineteenth of April, 1897-negotiations and
contracts-had no relation to the contract of February,
1898, and had for their inducement and object the settlement of controversies and rights growing out of the contract of October 2, 1893, between the Disbrow Company
and the Owatonna Company, and that of October 12,
1896, between the Disbrow Company and the Creamery
Package Manufacturing Company and the proposition of,
the latter company to become the sales agent of the churns
made by the Owatonna Company. All of this is 'very
complicated in the statement, but is simple enough in the results, and can be definitely estimated as to actual and
legal effect. We may therefore sum up by saying that the
Disbrow Company, by its contract with the Owatonna
Company, did nothing more than confirm or enlarge the
rights which the Owatonna Company had obtained, by
the contract of 1893, and conveyed to it the exclusive right

Opinion of the Court.

in the patents for certain named royalties. This was no
violation of law. The Owatonna Company did nothing
more in its contract with the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company than to make that Company its exclusive sales agent, and this'was no violation of law. Both
contracts had natural and adequate legal inducements and
conveyed rights that could under the law be conveyed,
and, as a necessary incident to the conveyance, one only
of the parties could thereafter exercise them. It may be
that the Disbrow Company was to an extent in competition with the Owatonna Company, but it was a competition in part, at least, which, it was contended, was illegally
conducted against rights which had been transferred in
1893. But, be that as it may, we repeat, patent rights
may be conveyed partially or entirely, and the monopoly
of use, of manufacture or of sale is not one condemned by
law.
It is, however, urged that the infringement suits brought
by the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company and
the Owatonna Company against plaintiffs were provided
for by the contracts between the Owatonna Company and
the Disbrow Company, and their coincidence in time is
urged as proof of concerted action on the part of defendants and of a conspiracy to destroy plaintiffs' business.
The contention is that the bringing of those suits was not
a single and isolated act but was a part of the more comprehensive plan and scheme to secure a monopoly in the
United States of the business of making and selling
creamery supplies, or, more accurately, counsel say, to
continue and maintain the monopoly already acquired.
And it is contended that the attempt was successful in
that it destroyed plaintiffs' business. That these contentions are untenable we have demonstrated. The contracts
we have shown were legal conveyances of rights, and the
provision for the prosecution of infringement suits was but
an assurance of those rights. Patents would be of little

value if infringers of them could not be notified of the
consequences of infringement or proceeded against in the
courts. Such action considered by itself cannot be said to
be illegal. Patent rights, it is true, may be asserted in
malicious prosecutions as other rights, or asserted rights,
may be. But this is not an action for malicious prosecution. It is an action under the Sherman Anti-trust Act
for the violation of the provisions of that act, geeking
treble damages. This, indeed, plaintiffs take special pains
to allege, that there may be no confusion about the right
or grounds or extent of recovery. The testimony shows
that no wrong whatever was committed by the Owatonna
Company, and the fact that it failed in its suit against
plaintiffs does not convict it of any.
This is enough to dispose of the case, for the foundation
of the complaint is that the defendants entered into a contract or combination in restraint of trade which caused
damage to plaintiffs; and the guilt of the individual defendants and of the two corporations and of all of their
officers, servants, and stockholders, is very carefully
alleged. It was in this aspect that the case was tried.
But plaintiffs urge that the Creamery Package Manufacturing Company was of itself a combination offensive
to the statute and that they were entitled to go to the jury
as to that company. But the contention was not made in
the Circuit'Court nor was it made in the Circuit Court of
Appeals. the case was tried and ruled upon, as we have
seen, on the ground of the codperation of the defendants
in a scheme of monopoly and restraint of trade. There was
no liability asserted in the Circuit Court or in the Circuit
Court of Appeals against one of the defendants separately
from the others. Concert and co6peration was asserted
against all and a ruling was not invoked as to the separate
liability of either. One Frank LaBare was a! party defendant and as to him plaintiffs made a motion that "the
case be dismissed and dropped." The court denied the

motion for some reason and then plaintiffs' counsel said,
"We desire to proceed with the case as against the defendants, the Owatonna Manufacturing Company and the
Creamery Package Manufacturing Company." The
plaintiffs then offered to prove that they had not infringed
the patents sued on by the defendants. It is manifest,
therefore, that the separate liability of the Creamery
Package Manufacturing Company is an afterthought and
urged in this court for the first time.
There are twenty-seven errors assigned upon offers of
testimony excluded or upon other rulings of the Circuit
Court. These we have examined and find that in the view
taken by the courts below of the case and that which we
tUke, there was no error of substance committed.
Judgment affirmed.

CAMERON SEPTIC TANK COMPANY v. CITY
OF KNOXVILLE, IOWA.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN

No. 82.

DISTRICT OF IOWA.

Argued December 11, 12, 1912. -Decided January 20, 1913.

Although under §4884, Rev. Stat., a patent is for seventeen years, under
the provision of § 4887, Rev. Stat., as it has been judicially construed,
the American patent granted for an invention previously patented
in another country is limited by law, whether so expressed in the
l)atent itself or not, to expire with the foreign patent previously
ganted having the shortest term.
'-eetion 4887, Rev. Stat., limiting patents to the period of the same
patent previously granted by a foreign country, if any, has not been
superseded by Article 4 bis of the Treaty of Brussels of 1900.
A most essential attribute of a patent is the term of its duration, which
is necessarily fixed by local law, and the Treaty of Brussels will not
be construed as break1ing down provisions of the local law regulating
the issuing of the patent.
