clause was restricted by limitations such as those which
it is here insisted limit the power to enforce the guarantees
of the Fourteenth Amendment, affords the most conclusive
demonstration of the unsoundness of the contentions here
made. The immediate and efficient Federal right to enforce the contract clause of the Constitution as against

those who violate or attempt to violate its prohibition,
which has always been exerted without question, is but
typical of the power which exists to enforce the guarantees
of the Fourteenth Amendment. See authorities as to the
contract clause referred to in the opinion in Ross v. Oregon,

NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 139.

Submitted January 23, 1913.-Decided February 24, 1913.

While there are exceptions, especially in the case of remedial statutes,
the general rule is that statutes are addressed to the future and not
to the past; and, in the absence of explicit words to that effect, statutes are not retroactive in their application.
The Employers' Liability Act of 1908 introduced a new policy and
radically changed existing law and will not be construed as a remedial
statute having retrospective effect.
An action brought under the Employers' Liability Act of 1908 by the
)ersonal representative of the person who was killed prior to the
passage of the act cannot be sustained as stating a cause of action
under the law of the State, where that law gives the action to the
parents.
Darnages to the estate of one killed by negligence is a distinct cause of
action, under the laws of the State of Washington, from damages to
the parents of the person so kilhd,
173 Fed. Rep. 65, affirmed.

WINFREE v. NOR. PAC. RY. CO.
227 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the Employers' Liability Act of 1908 and whether it had a retroactive effect, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. B. C. Mosby for plaintiff in error:
The act was retroactive. It is a remedial measure, designed to supply a remedy for wrongs for which the law had
offered no adequate redress or, asf in the case at bar, no
redress whatever.
If the meaning of the statute were doubtful, judicial
construction ought not to lean- towards the wrongdoer
but should rather give the benefit of the doubt to the
victims of the wrong. There is no sound ,reason to favor
the common carrier. Stewart v. B. & 0. R. R. Co., 168 U. S.
448; Spain.v. St..L. & S. F. R. Co., 151 Fed. Rep. 529;
Hayes v. Williams, 17 Colorado, 467; Employers' Liability
Cces, 207 U. S. 447.
To correct the imperfections of the former act, Congress
passed the act of 1908. The second is, like the first,
clearly remedial, and should accordingly receive a catholic
construction. 36 Cyc. 1173, 1174, 1188; 13 Cyc. 312, n. 9.;

The act of 1908, being then of a remedial nature, should

Remedial statutes were retroactively applied in actions
for injuries in Chapman v. State, 104 California, 690;
Cannon v. Rowland, 34 Georgia, 422; Bevier v. Dillingham,
18 Wisconsin, 556; Rouge v. Rouge, 36 N. Y. Supp. 436;
Brower v. Bowers, 1 Abb. Dec. 214; Kuehn v. Paroni, 20
Nevada, 203.
The act of 1908 is shown, by its entire phraseology, to
relate to past as well as to future occurrences. Sohn v.
Waterson, 17 Wall. 599.
The limitation of two years is an extension of the one
year period provided by the act of 1906. Thus an evident
purpose of Congress in its later legislation was to save the
rights of those persons whose suits had abated in consequence of the decision in the Employers' Liability Cases,
207 U. S. 463.
Expired and repealed acts in pari materiawith the statute to be construed may also be considered in the interpretation thereof. United States v. Bowen, 100 U. S. 508; Viterbo v. Friedlander,120 U. S. 707; People v. Essex County,
70N. Y. 236; People v. Columbia County, 43 N. Y. 132.
The rule against retrospective operation of law allows
the introduction of remedies where none existed before,
and their equitable application to existing causes of action. Cooley, Const. Lim. 347, 436, 442, 454, 477, 478; 1
Hare Const. Law, 421; Gage v. Gage, 66 N. H. 294; Milne
v. Huber, 3 McLean, 217.

WINFREE v. NOR. PAC. RY. CO
227 U. S.

Argument, for Plaintiff in Error.

The legislature cannot make contracts for individuals,
and they cannot impose an obligation which does not
equitably arise out of the transaction. But they may give
a remedy where there is none, and where in good conscience there should be one. A remedy being general applies to previous as well as subsequent cases.
As to contention of defendant in error that to apply the
act of 1908 in the present instance, would be to destroy
vested rights of the railway company, under the common
law, see Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 50,
holding that a person has no property, no vested interest,
in any rule of the common law; Walker v. Ware, Hadham &c. Rail Co., 12 Jur. (N. S.) 18; Cooley, Const. Lim.,
6th ed., p. 438; Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196.
Under the rule of stare decisis, this case is disposed of
by Phil. Balt. & Wash. R. R. Co. v. Schubert, 224 U. S. 603.
In the case, at bar, the 6omplaint alleged, inter alia,
that on the part of the deceased there was no contributory
negligence and no assumption of risk. Neither of these
allegations was controverted. There was no answer of
any kind. Yet the district judge considered that the
facts were just the opposite of what was alleged. At least
for the purposes of the demurrer, the complaint should
have been taken as true.
The ruling of the district court was based upon matter
not simply dehors the record but contrary to the record.
Irrespective of the act of Congress, implied contracts
disregarding comparative negligence in cases of homicide
should be deemed void as in contravention of public
policy. 26 Cyc., pp. 609, 1094.
Apart from the act of 1908, the complaint presents a
case for Federal cognizance. It states a cause of action
under the statutes of the State of Washington, but not
under the common law. Also that plaintiff in error is
a citizen of the State of Washington; the parents of the
decedent are citizens of the State of Wyoming; the de-

fendant in error is a corporation resident in the State of
Wisconsin; and the amount involved in the action exceeds
$2,000, exclusive of interest and costs.
Under the laws of Washington, when the death of a
minor has been caused by wrongful act, the father may
compel compensation for the loss of the child's services,
but he cannot recover a solatium. Noble v. Seattle, 19
Washington, 133.
The compensation received, however, belongs, under
the community system, to the mother as well as to the
father. 2 Rem. & Bal. Code, § 5917. See also Kleps v.
Bristol Manfg. Co., 81 N. E. Rep. 765.
In England a declaration may fail to show a cause of
action under a statute, and yet may state a good case, a
negligent breach of duty under the unwritten law. Parnaby v. Lancaster Canal Co., 11 Ad. & El. 223; S. C., Nev.
& P. 223; 3 Per. & Dav. 162.
Mr. Charles W. Bunn for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the

court.
This action was brought in the Circuit Court of the
United f States for the Eastern District of Washington,
Eastern Division, by plaintiff in error (herein referred to
as plaintiff) as administrator of the estate of Albert E.
Phipps, deceased, against defendant in error (herein referred to as defendant) for the wrongful death, it is alleged,
of Albert E. Phipps, a minor, of the age of eighteen years
and five months, while acting as fireman upon a freight
locomotive of the defendant in the State of Washington.
The negligence of defendant is alleged and that defendant
was engaged in interstate commerce; that decedent had
not been emancipated nor had his parents knowledge of
his employment; that they lived in the State of Wyoming

Opinion of the Court.

and that the action was brought for their benefit under the
provisions of the act of Congress of April 22, 1908, (35
Stat. 65, c. 149), entitled "An Act Relating to the Liability
of Common Carriers by Railroads to their Employees in
Certain Cases."
Defendant demurred to the complaint on the ground,
among others, that -the act of Congress upon which plaintiff relied was passed, approved and became a law after
plaintiff's alleged cause of action accrued and imposed
no liability, therefore, on defendant by reason of the facts
set forth in the complaint. The demurrer was sustained,
and, plaintiff refusing to plead further, judgment was
entered dismissing the complaint and for costs.

The

Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 173 Fed. Rep.
65.
Plaintiff, to support his contention that the act of Congress has-retroactive operation, presents a very elaborate
argument based on the extensive effect which courts have
given to remedial statutes, applying them, it is contended,
to the past as well as to the future. The Court of Appeals
met the argument, as we think it should be met, by saying
that statutes that had received such extensive application
were "such as were intended to remedy a mischief, to promote public justice, to correct innocent mistakes, to cure
irregularities in judicial proceedings or to give effect to
acts and contracts of individuals according to the intention thereof." It is hardly necessary to say that such
statutes are exceptions to the almost universal rule that
statutes are addressed to the future, not to the past. They
usually constitute a new factor in the affairs and relations
of men and should not be held to affect what has happened unless, indeed, explicit words be used or by clear
implication that construction be required. It is true that
it is said that there was liability on the part of the defendant for its negligence before the passage of the act of
Congress and the act has only given a more efficient and

a more complete remedy. It, however, takes away material defenses, defenses which did something more than
resist the remedy; they disproved the right of action.
Such defenses the statute takes away, and that none may
exist in the present case is immaterial. It is the operation
of the statute which determines its character. The Court
of Appeals aptly characterized it, and we may quote from
its opinion (173 Fed. Rep. 66): "It is a statute which
permits recovery, in cases where recovery could not be
had before, and takes from the defendant defenses which
formerly were available, defenses which in this instance
existed at the time when the contract of service was entered into and at the time when the accident occurred."
Such a statute, under the rule of the cases, should not be
oonstrued as retrospective. It introduced a new policy
and quite radically changed the existing law.
It is contended that apart from the act of Congress
the complaint "states a cause of action under the statutes
of the State of Washington." This does not avail plaintiff.
He admits that the statutes of Washington give the right
of action to the father of the deceased minor, not to a personal representative. He, however, to justify his right of
action says that the compensation recovered in an action
by the father of the minor belongs under the community
system to the mother as well as to the father. But we are
not informed how this, if true, gives a right of action in
the administrator of the minor's estate. Damages to his
estate would be a distinct cause of action from damages
to his parents. Hedrick v. Ilwaco Ry. & Nay. Co., 4 Washington, 400.
Judgment affirmed.
