they are deprived of his society and any care and consideration he might take of them, or have for them during his
life."
The loss of the society or companionship of a son is a
deprivation not to be measured by any money standard.
It is not a pecuniary loss under such a statute as this.
Laying out of consideration the indefiniteness of the term
"care and consideration," as elements in addition to the
loss and damage of such pecuniary assistance as the
parents of the decedent might have reasonably anticipated
from their son, it is enough for the purpose of this case to
say that there was no allegation of any such loss, nor any
evidence relating to the subject, or from which its pecuniary value might have been estimated. The scope of
the compensation recoverable under this statute has been
so fully considered in Michigan Central Railroad v. Vreeland, ante, p. 59, that we need not say more.
The other assignments of error we pass by without
decision. None of them are of either general importance
or such as are likely to arise upon a new trial.
Reversed and remanded for a new trial.

ROSS v. STATE OF OREGON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT. OF THE STATE OF OREGON.
No. 75.

Argued December 6,1912.-Decided January 27, 1913.

The prohibition in ยง 10 of Article I of the Constitution against ex post
facto laws is a restraint upon the legislative power of the States and

concerrns the making of laws and not their construction by the courts.
While tilat prohibition is directed against legislative acts, and reaches
every form in which the legislative power acts, and while a judicial
decision is the a(t of an instrumentality of the State, if the )urpose

of that decision is not to prescrie a new law for the future hut only

The purpose of a judicial inquiry is to enforce laws as they are at
present; legislation looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making new laws to be applicable hereafter. Prentis v.
Atlantic Coast Line, 211 U. S. 210, 226.
Whether an anendment to the state constitution requiring prosecutions
for crime to be based on indictment applies to pending cases is a
question of local law and the decision of the state court is not reviewable here; and the decision of that court that such an amendment
did not repeal the statute under which a prosecution based on an
information already instituted does not deprive plaintiff in error of
his liberty without due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and no Federal question is involved
giving this court jurisdiction to review the judgment of conviction.
Where the record presents no Federal question, the writ of error must
he dismiss'ed and this court cannot discuss the merits of the questions
I)r'sented and determined in the state court.

Opinion of the Court.

The constitutional provision against ex post facto laws
applies only to criminal or penal statutes. Ogden v.
Sanders, 12 Wheat. 213; League v. Texas, 184 U. S. 161;
Calder v. Bull, supra; Locke v. New Orleans, 4 Wall. 172.
The constitutional provision that no State shall pass an
ex post facto law refers to a legislative enactment and not
to a judicial decision.
A contract can only be impaired within the meaning of
the United States Constitution so as to give this court
jurisdiction on writ of error to a state court by some subsequent statute of the State which has been upheld or
given effect by the state court. Bacon v. State of Texas,

The Federal Supreme Court will not hold a state
statute void on the ground that it impairs the obligation
of contracts unless it impairs the obligation of thie particular contract which is involved in the controversy.
Lehigh Water Co. v. Easton, 121 U. S. 388.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of
the court.
This was a criminal prosecution in the State of Oregon,
instituted by an information charging the defendants, of
whom the plaintiff in error was one, with having converted to their own use a large sum of money belonging
to the State's Irreducible School Fund, Agricultural
College Fund and University Fund, collectively spoken of
as educational funds, then held for safe-keeping in a bank
of which the defendants were in control as its officers and
directors. Upon a separate trial of the plaintiff in error
he was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment
arld to pay a fine. An appeal to the S, ,)reme Court of
the State resulted in the elimination of the fine and in the

affirmance of the judgment in other respects. 55 Oregon,
450. The plaintiff in error then brought the case here,
claiming that rights secured to him by the Constitution
of the United States, and specially set up in the Supreme
Court of the State, were denied by the judgment of affirmance.
Briefly outlined, the case, as we must take it to be, is as
follows: In June, 1907, the bank became an "active depository" under a statute of the State presently to be
mentioned, and thereupon an account was opened with
the bank as such depository in the name of the state treasThe
urer, with the added designation "educational."
deposits going into the account consisted of checks and
drafts belonging to the State's educational funds, and the
money collected by the bank on these checks and drafts,
less what was drawn out by the State, amounted on
November 6, 1907, to $288,426.87. On that day the bank
failed, and it was then disclosed that on August 21 the
total cash in the bank was $296.19 short of the amount
called for by the account and that this shortage had continued and increased until the day of the failure, when it
reached $274,882.73. The defendants had not literally
appropriated any of the money to their personal use, but,
knowing that it belonged to the State's educational funds
and was received and held by the bank as an active depository, had permitted it to be commingled with other
deposits and funds and had sanctioned its use in paying
liabilities of the bank.
The prosecution was founded upon ยง 1807 of Bellinger & Cotton's Codes of Oregon, which declares: "If
any person shall receive any money whatever for this
State, . . . or shall have in his possession any
money whatever belonging to such State, . . .. and

shall in any way convert to his own use any portion
thereof,

larceny."

.

.

such person shall be deemed guilty of

ROSS v. OREGON.
227 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

By an act taking effect May 26, 1907, Laws of 1907,
c. 135, p. 248, the legislature of the State provided for the
designation of "State depositories for the purpose of receiving on deposit funds of this State, and paying out the
same on order or checks of the State treasurer" (ยงยง 1, 2);
made it the duty of the treasurer to "deposit and at all
times keep on deposit" in such depositories the "money in
his hands belonging to the several funds in the State
treasury," excepting a reserve of not to exceed $100,000
with which to pay current obligations (ยง 3); required each
depository to pay interest on deposits of such funds at not
less than two per cent. per annum (ยงยง 3, 4) and to give
approved security "for the payment of such deposits and
the interest thereon" (ยง 5); and made the following declaration relating to educational funds (ยง 16): "The word
'funds' used in this act shall apply to all funds in the State
treasury except the common school,' agricultural college,
and university funds."
The same act authorized the designation of "an active
depository for the collection of any drafts, checks, certificates of deposit and coupons that may be received by him
[the treasurer] on account of any claim due the State"
(ยง 6); required such depository to give approved security
"for the prompt collection of all drafts, checks, certificates
of deposit, or coupons that may be delivered to such
active depository by the State treasurer for collection;
also, for the safekeeping and prompt payment on the
State treasurer's order of the proceeds of 'all.such collections" (ยง 7); and in that connection provided (ยง8): "The
State treasurer, on receipt of any draft, check or certificate
of deposit, on account of State dues, may place the same
in such active depository for collection, and it shall be the
'The common school fund and the irreducible school fund appear
to have been identical. Ore. Const., Art. VIII, ยง 2; Ore. Laws 1907,
c. 117, ยง 36.

duty of such active depository to collect the same without
delay, without charge for its services for such collection,
or for exchange, and to notify the State treasurer when
collected. The compensation to be paid by such active
depository shall be fixed by the State treasurer upon the
best terms obtainable for the State." The word "funds"
particularly defined in ยง 16, as before quoted, was not used
in any of the sections having special relation to the active
depository.
Before the passage of the depository act the Supreme
Court of the State had occasion to consider and determine,
in Baker v. Williams Banking Co., 42 Oregon, 213, 222225, whether, in view of ยง 1807 of Bellinger & Cotton's
Codes (then ยง 1772, Hill's Ann. Laws), the state treasurer
lawfully could make a general deposit in a bank of money
of the State belonging to its educational funds, and it was
held that he could, the court saying:
"It is inade a felony by statute for any person having in
his possession any money belonging to the State, county,
town, or other municipality to convert to his own use or
loan the same, with or without interest (Hill's Ann. Laws,
ยง 1772); and, while a mere deposit in a bank for safekeeping is not inhibited by this provision, it is manifest
that in case of the failure of the bank the officer is not entitled to interest in his own right on the fund so deposited,
whatever the right of the State or municipality might be
in the premises. If, therefore, the claims are in fact for
public money, as the objectors allege, no interest should
be allowed thereon. A public officer may not loan, with
or without interest, any part of the public funds in his
possession, without being guilty of a felony; but he is required to keep such funds safely, and for that purpose
may deposit them in a bank, provided they are at all times
subject to his order, and there is no fixed period during
which he has no right to demand their return. . .
The deposit is made on his own personal responsibility,

ROSS v. OREGON.
227 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

however; and if, in the case of the failure of the bank, he
makes the loss good, the money deposited must necessarily become his property, and thereafter be considered
and treated as such."
After that decision and before the transactions here in
question the depository act was passed and put in force,
but its construction and operation were not determined
by the Supreme Court of the State until it passed upon the
case at bar. It was then held (a) that the act made provision for general depositories, wherein moneys of the
State, not belonging to the educational funds, were to be
placed as general deposits, with the right in the depository
to commingle them with other deposits and to loan them
in the usual course of business, and with an absolute
obligation on the depository to pay interest on them at not
less than two per cent. per annum; (b) that the act also
made provision for an active depository for the collection
of checks, drafts and the like, belonging to any state fund,
whether educational or otherwise, and the safe-keeping of
the proceeds subject to the treasurer's order, but with no
right in the depository to commingle them with other deposits or to loan them, and with no specific or absolute
obligation on the depository to pay interest thereon; (c)
that by contrasting the provisions relating to general depositories with those relating to the active depository it
was evident that deposits in the latter, unlike deposits in
the former, were to be special, the title not passing to the
depository but remaining in the State; and (d) that the
act operated, and the legislature intended, to take the
educational funds out of the custom or right of the treasurer to make general deposits which was recognized in
Baker v. Williams Banking Co., supra. Then coming to
apply the act, as so construed, together with ยง 1807, to
the facts of the case as reflected.by the verdict of the jury,
it was further held (1) that the bank held the money as a
special deposit, the title being in the State; (2) that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

227 U. S.

defendants, being in control of the bank as its officers and
directors and knowing of the deposit, were to be regarded
as having the money in their possession within the meaning of ยง 1807; (3) that the commingling of the money with
other deposits and the using of it in paying liabilities of
the bank constituted an unlawful appropriation of it; and
(4) that as the defendants, as controlling officers and directors of the bank, sanctioned that appropriation, knowing that the moneybelonged to the educational funds of
the State and was held by the bank as an active depository,
they thereby converted the money to their own use within
the meaning of ยง 1807, even although the appropriation
was for the benefit of the bank and not of themselves personally.
It will be perceived that but for the depository act,
as so construed, the deposit would have been a general
one, merely creating the relation of debtor and creditor
between the bank and the State, and the commingling
and use of the money in the manner shown would not
have been a crime under ยง 1807.
The record shows that the plaintiff in error contended
in the Supreme Court of the State that the depository
act was not reasonably susceptible of the construction
ultimately adopted, and that to put such a construction
upon it would be violative of the prohibition in the Constitution of the United States against ex post facto state
laws. Both phases of the contention were denied, the
second necessarily failing with the first, and the plaintiff
in error now assigns error upon that holding and complains that it deprived him of a right secured by the
Constitution.
Bearing in mind what has been said, and especially
that the depository act and ยง 1807 were both in force
at the time of the alleged offense, it will be perceiized
that the real complaint which we are asked to consider
is, not that the Supreme Court of the State in a ny wise

ROSS v. OREGON.
227 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

rested its judgment upon a statute passed after the time
of the illeged offense, but only that it misconstrued
a preexisting statute to the disadvantage of the plaintiff
in error and that such a decision is an ex post facto law
within the meaning of Art. I, ยง 10, of the Constitution,
shall pass any bill of
which declares: "No State
attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts."
But that provision of the Constitution, according to
the natural import of its terms, is a restraint upon legislative power and concerns the making of laws, not their
construction by the courts. It has been so regarded
from the beginning. In Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, one
of the first cases in which the provision was considered,
it was spoken of as reaching legislative, but not judicial,
acts; and in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, 138, Chief
Justice Marshall said of it: "In this form the power of
the legislature over the lives and fortunes of individuals
is expressly restrained." True, neither of those cases
turned upon the question whether the words "no State
shall pass a law" embrace a decision of a court construing
,astatute, but that question was both presented and decided in Commercial Bank v. Buckingham's Executors,
5 How. 317. There the Supreme Court of Ohio, in an
action upon a contract, had put upon two preexisting
statutes of the State a construction which was claimed
to be unreasonable and to impair the obligation of the
contract, and it was sought to have that decision reviewed
by this court on the ground that it denied a right secured
by the Constitution of the United States. But the writ
of error was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, because,
as was said in the opinion (p. 342): "If this court were
to assume jurisdiction of this case, it is evident that the
question submitted for our decision would be, not whether
the statutes of Ohio are repugnant to the constitution
of the United States, but whether the Supreme Court of
VOL.

227 U. S.

Ohio has erred in its construction of them. It is the peculiar province and privilege of the state courts to construe their own statutes; and it is no part of the functions
of this court to review their decisions, or assume jurisdiction over them on the pretence that their judgments
have impaired the obligation of contracts. The power
delegated to us is for the restraint of unconstitutional
legislation by the States, and not for, the correction of
alleged errors committed by their judiciary." A like
question was presented, and similarly disposed of, in
New Orleans Water Works Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining
(o., 125 U. S. 18, 30, where it was said: "In order to come
within the provision of the Constitution of the United
States which declares that no State shall pass any law
impairing the obligation of contracts, not only must the
obligation of a contract have been impaired, but it must
have been impaired by a law of the State. The prohibit ion isaimed at the legisldtive power of the State, and not

al the decisions of its courts, or the acts of administrative
or executive boards or officers, or the doings of corporations
or individuals." And in Brown v. Smart, 145 U. S.454,
458, where a decision' of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, expounding a statute of that State, was challenged
as impairing the obligation of a contract made after the
statute came into existence, it was held that the decision
"was not a law" within the ,meaning of the provision
against the impairment of contractual obligations by
state laws. Many other cases give effect to this ruling,
but it will suffice to cite, from among them, Central Land
Co. v. Laidley, 159 U. S.103, 109; Bacon v. Texas, 163
U. S.207, 220; Hanford v. Davies, Ibid. 273, 278; Turner
v. Wilkes County, 173 U. S.461; Cross Lake Shooting &
Fishing Club v. Louisiana, 224 U. S.632, 638.
But whilst thus uniformly holding that the provision is
directed against legislative, but not judicial, acts, this

every form in which the legislative power of a State is
exerted, whether it be a constitution, a constitutional
amendment, an enactment of the legislature, a by-law or
ordinance of a municipal corporation, or a regulation or
order of some other instrumentality of the State exercising
delegated legislative authority. New Orleans Water
Works Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Co., supra; St.
Paul Gas Light Co. v. St. Paul, 181 U. S. 142, 148; Davis
& Farnum Manufacturing Co. v. Los Angeles, 189 U. S.
207, 216; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. RailroadCommission
of Indiana,221 U. S. 400, 403. Of course, the ruling here
in question was by an instrumentality of the State, but as
its purpose was, not to prescribe a new law for the future,
but only to apply to a completed transaction laws which
were in force at the time, it is quite plain that the ruling
was a judicial act and not an exercise of legislative authority. As was said in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co.,
211 U. S. 210, 226: "A judicial inquiry investigates,
declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present
or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist.
That is its purpose and end. Legislation, on the other
hand, looks to the future and changes existing conditions
by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or
some part of those subject to its power."
The plaintiff in error cites the cases of Kring v. Missouri,
107 U. S. 221; Muhlker v. New York & Harlem.Railroad
Co., 197 U. S. 544; Louisiana v. Pilsbury, 105 U. S. 278;
Gelpcke v, Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, and Butz v. City of
Muscatiiie, 8 Wall. 575, as holding that a judicial decision
may be a law in the sense of the constitutional provision
which he invokes. But none of those cases, when rightly
considered, sustains that position. The first was a criminal case in which a provision in a new constitution was
held to be an ex post facto law a.s to an offense theretofore
committed; the second presented the question whether a
state statute of 1892 impaired contractual obligations

created by deeds of a much earlier date; the third and
,fourth were explained in Central Land Co. v. Laidley, 159
U. S. 103, 111-112; Bacon v. Texas, 163 U. S. 207, 221223, and Turner v. Wilkes County, supra, and were there
shown not to be in conflict with other cases on the subject,
and the fifth is in no wise distinguishable from the fourth.
We conclude that no Federal right was involved in the
ruling respecting the construction of the depository act.
The prosecution was instituted by an information conformably to a law of the State in force at the time. Bellinger & Cotton's Codes, ยง 1258. Following the judgment

of conviction, and while the case was pending on appeal,
a constitutional amendment was adopted, declaring:
"No person shall be charged in any circuit court with the
commission of any crime or misdemeanor defined or
made punishable by any of the laws of this State, except
upon an indictment found by a grand jury." The plaintiff
in error thereupon advanced the contention that the constitutional amendment worked a repeal of the statute
under which the information was filed and made it impossible to enforce the judgment against him. without depriving him of his liberty without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States. The state court ruled that the amendment to the state constitution was prospective and did
not affect pending cases. Error is now assigned upon that
ruling. But it involved nothing more than the construction of the constitutional amendment, which was a question of local law, and its decision by the state court is not
reviewable here.
As the record presents no Federal question, we are
without jurisdiction to review the judgment, and therefore
cannot enter into the merits of the questions that were
presented and determined in the state court.
Writ of error dismissed.
