UNITED STATES EX REL. CHAMPION LUMBER
COMPANY v. FISHER, SECRETARY OF THE
INTERIOR.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

Submitted January 27, 1913.-Decided February 24, 1913.
Under subd. 5 of § 250 of the Judicial Code of 1911 a final judgment
of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia can only be reviewed by this court in cases where the validity of any authority
exercised under the United States, or the existence or scope of any
power or duty of any officer of the United States, is drawn in question.
The meaning of the phrase "drawn in question" as it occurs in § 250 of
the Judicial Code is the same as in § 709, Rev. Stat.; § 5 of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act, and other statutes regulating territorial
appeals.
A statute of the United States authorizing an officer to act in a certain
manner under certain conditions is not drawn in question nor is the
scope or Validity of authority of the officer acting thereunder drawn
in question, simply because there is a controversy as to whether the
specified conditions do or do not exist.

protest was pending, the denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus

MR. JUSTICE DAY-delivered the opinion of the court

This is a petition for the allowance of a writ of error to
the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia to review
the judgment of that court affirming the judgment of the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, dismissing
the petition of the Champion Lumber Company against
the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the
General Land Office.
It appears that on April 26, 1910, a petition was filed by
the petitioner in the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia praying for a writ of mandamus against the
Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the
General Land Office to issue a patent for the land hereinafter referred to. The grounds of the petition were that
the Lumber Company was the owner of certain lands
which had been finally entered under the homestead laws
by one Lucy Johns, from whom the petitioner derived
title; that the only authority left in the Land Department
on the facts set forth was to issue a patent for the land,

Opinion of the Court.

and further that the ruling of the Secretary of the Interior
and the Commissioner of the General Land Office that a
protest, made within two years from the date of the issuance of the receiver's receipt, was pending, whereby the
patent was withheld in accordance with the provisions of
§ 7 of the act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1095, 1098,
c. 561), was an arbitrary and capricious ruling, made
without legal authority.' The respondents answered and
denied the allegations of the petition in this respect, and
averred the pendency of a protest which justified the holding up of the patent under the provisions of the statute.
The case was tried upon an agreed statement of facts, of
which the following is an abridgment:
On September 17, 1897, Lucy Johns made entry under
the homestead laws at Jackson, Mississippi, of certain
land subject to entry, the papers showing that she was
qualified to make the entry, which showing has not been
questioned; on September 24, 1902, she having made
primafacie proof of compliance with the requirements of
the homestead laws, final certificate and receipt were
issued to her, and the proof was forwarded to the Commissioner of the General Land Office at Washington during October of that year. On January 15, 1903, she conveyed all her interest in the entry to the petitioner, which
subsequently conveyed it to one Hines, who later conveyed it back to the petitioner. On November 19, 1902,
a special agent of the General Land Office named Hammer
wrote the Commissioner that he had reason to believe
that ninety per cent. of the proofs in the territory where.
petitioner's land is situated were fraudulent, and that he
had under investigation certain entries, including the one
in question, and requested that all patents be withheld
until a full report was made; on November 28, 1902,
Hammer informed the Commissioner that the investigation so far made had disclosed flagrant frauds; and renewed
his request to withhold patents to such lands, and on

227 U. S.

December 13th of that year the Commissioner directed
the register and receiver at Jackson to suspend action on
commutations and proofs until Hammer had reported;
and on June 24, 1904, Hammer, in response to a letter
from the Commissioner inquiring as to the necessity of an
investigation, replied in the affirmative. On May 12, 1906,
another special agent reported that the entry of Lucy
Johns "was. made for speculative purposes, with no
attempt to comply with the requirements of the law, and
recommended that the entry be canceled on the ground
of non-residence, fnon-cultivation, non-improvement and
abandonment." Thereupon the Commissioner directed
that a hearing be had. The petitioner moved for a stay of
proceedings, claiming that under § 7, supra, the entry
should be patented without further proceedings. The
motion was denied by the Commissioner and this denial affimed by the Secretary of the Interior, who
later denied a motion to review his decision, finding that
a protest had been filed against the patent of Lucy
Johns' homestead entry within two years from the issuance of the receiver's receipt and holding that the
case should proceed to hearing on the special agent's
charge.
The 'Supreme Court of the District of Columbia dismissed the petition. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals
that court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court.
40 Washington Law Reporter, 780. In the course of the
opinion the Court of Appeals said (p. 781):
"Every point advanced by appellant in this case is, in
our view, settled by the following very recent decisions:
Fisher v. Grand)Rapids Timber Co., 37 App. D. C. 436;
Ness v. Fisher, 223 U. S. 683; McKensie v. Fisher, 39
App. D. C. 7. In Fisher v. Grand Rapids Timber Co.,
which involved the interpretation of the very statute upon
which appellant here relies, this court, speaking through
Mr. Justice Van Orsdel, said: 'While it is true that ar-

bitrary power resides nowhere in our system of government, and while the supervisory authority vested in the
Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the
General Land Office over the disposition of the public
lands is neither unlimited nor arbitrary, yet the question
here presented as to whether or not the communication
and order amounted to a protest, which we regard as
exceedingly close, was one clearly within the power of the
Commissioner to decide. To say that he was mistaken
would require us to review a matter exclusively confided
by law to his discretion and judgment. This proceeding
will not admit of such a review.'
"The communications of Special Agent Hammer respecting this entry were made within the two years contemplated by said act of March 3, 1891, as was the communication of June 18, 1904, from the Commissioner to.
said agent. It is apparent that these communications
resulted in the withholding of a patent; in other words,
that the Commissioner regarded the right to that patent
as dependent upon the outcome of the investigation which
was to ensue. The subsequent decision of the Secretary
that what was done within the two-year period constituted a protest against the patenting of the entry, was not
arbitrary or capricious, but was based upon evidence;
and the sufficiency of that evidence was for his and not
our determination."
The writ of error is asked for under § 250 of the Judicial
Code, which provides:
"SEc. 250. Any final judgment or decree of the court
of appeals of the District of Columbia may be reexamined
and affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Supreme Court
of the United States, upon writ of error or appeal, in the
following cases:
"Fifth. In cases in which the validity of iny authority
exercised under the United States, or the existence or
VOL. ccxxvii-29

227 U. S.

scope of any power or duty of an officer of the United
States is drawn in question."
The case therefore to be appealable to this court from
the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia must be
one in which the validity of the authority exercised or the
existence or scope of the authority of the officer named is
drawn in question.
"Drawn in question" is a phrase long used in other
statutes of the United States regulating appellate jurisdiction. It is found in § 709 of the Revised Statutes,
governing appeals from state courts to this' court. It is
in the fifth section of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of
March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 826, 828, c. 517). It is in the
statute regulating territorial appeals, (March 3, 1885, 23
Stat. 443, c. 355). The meaning of this phrase has been
the subject of frequent consideration in this court, and it
is unnecessary to review the numerous cases in which it has
been interpreted.
As we have said, it is in the Circuit Court of Appeals Act,
which provides that cases may be brought directly to this
court from the Circuit Court in which, among other
things, the validity or construction of any treaty made
under the authority of the United States is drawn in
question. In Muse v. Arlington Hotel Co., 168 U. S.430,
in considering whether the provisions of a certain treaty
were drawn in question, so far as the validity or construction thereof was concerned, with a view to the exercise of
the appellate jurisdiction of this court, Mr. Chief Justice
Fuller, delivering the opinion of the. court, reviewed the
cases in this court and stated as the conclusion of the matter that in order to involve the validity or construction of
a treaty "some right, title, privilege or immunity dependent on the treaty must be so set up or claimed as to
require the Circuit Court to pass on the question of validity or construction in disposing of the right asserted." In
Pettit v. Walshe, 194 U. S. 205, 216, the construction of a

treaty was held to be drawn in question wvhere the petition
for a writ of habeas corpus and the warrant under which
the accused was arrested referred to the treaty, and the
court below proceeded on the ground that the determination of the questions involved in the case depended in
part upon the meaning of certain provisions of that
treaty, these provisions having been duly .brought to the
attention of the court. It has also been held that the
validity of a. statute of the United States or authority
exercised thereunder is drawn in question when the existence or constitutionality or legality of such law is denied
and the denial forms the subject of direbt inquiry in the
case. United States v. Lynch, 137 U. S. 280; Linford v.
Ellison, 155 U. S. 503; Snow v. United States, 118 U. S.
346, 353; McLean v. R. R. Co., 203 U. S. 38.
In clause five of § 250, under consideration, the added
ground of appeal is given if the existence or scope of any
power or duty of an officer of the United States is drawn
in question. Within the meaning ofthis statute, was any
such validity or existence or scope of authority drawn in
question? It appears that the petitioner contended that
no protest was pending in the Department which could
rightfully justify the withholding of the patent. The
officers of the United States took issue upon this allegation, and the Court of Appeals decided that there was
testimony before the Secretary authorizing the exercise
of the discretion conferred by law to withhold the patent,
and upon that ground affirmed the decision, refusing the
writ. The case was therefore submitted and decided upon
the issue whether the action of the Secretary was justified
in the exercise of his lawful discretion because of the-facts
disclosed in the record. The petitioner did not challenge,
nor did the court pass upon, the validity of any authority
exercised under the United States, nor was the existence
or extent of the authority or duty of an officer of the
United States drawn in quesfion in the sense in which it is

used in the statute, that is, brought forward and made a
ground of decision. The statutes under which the officers
of the United States acted were concededly valid, and the
authority exerted was lawful and within the powers of the
officers, if the facts justified their action. The petitioner's
real attack upon the action of the Secretary and Commissioner was because the facts shown did not warrant
the exercise of the power given by law. The decision of
that issue, upon which it is clear the case turned, neither
involved nor decided the questions which make the case
appealable to this court under the fifth clause of § 250 of
the Judicial Code.
It follows that the petitionfor writ of error must be denied.
