APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 85. Argued December 13, 16, 1912.-Decided February 24, 1913.
Under § 233 of the Code of the District of Columbia this court has
jurisdiction of an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals
of the District of Columbia where the validity of a regulation promulgated by the Commissioners under an act of Congress is drawn in
question, irrespective of the conclusion reached by the court below.
The fundamental idea of a party wall is that of mutual benefit.
In the absence of plain error this court will accept the decision of the
Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia determining whether
a particular structure comes within the definition of a party wall
under the building regulations promulgated by the Commissioners.
In this case this court affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals
that the wall of a bay-window which can serve no mutual purpose is
not a party wall within the meaning of the building regulations in
force in the District of Columbia.
34 App. D. C. 480, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of this court
to review judgments of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia under § 250 of the Judicial Code of 1911
and also the construction of the act of 1878 authorizing
the Commissioners of the District of Columbia to make
building regulations and the determination of what is a
party wall under such regulations, are stated in the
opinion.

Mr. William G. Johnson for appellant:
The building regulations extend to all lands within the
District of Columbia. Act of June 14, 1878, 20 Stat.,
p. 131.
The regulation is constitutional and valid.

the regulation as to party walls.

remediable departures from the requirements of the regulations, the decree should not be modified. Sections

benefit or advantage to appellees, is in no sense a party
wall. Sharp v. Cheatham, 5 W. Va. 673; CorcoranIv.

There is no provision of law to authorize the building
of party walls outside of the limits of Washington City as
a right appurtenant to the ownership of land. Fowler v.
Saks, 18 App. D. C. 570.
In some of the States provision for party walls is made
by statute and such statutes are held not to be obnoxious
to the contention that they deprive the owner of the
servient land of his property without due process of law.

vigorously assailed on constitutional grounds.
The police power of the legislature does not justify it in
authorizing one man to appropriate and use the property
of another without his consent and without adequate
compensation. Wilkins v. Jewett, 139 Massachusetts, 29.

MR. JUSTICE

HUGHES

delivered the opinion of the court.

The appellant is the owner of a lot of land on the north
side of Wyoming Avenue, between Twentieth and Twentyfirst Streets, northwest, in the District of Columbia. The
appellees own the adjoining lot on the west. The appel-

Opinion of the ('ourt.

lant constructed on his lot a brick dwelling, the front of

which was placed forty feet from the avenue. He located
the main west wall of the dwelling about three feet inside
of the line of his lot. This wall was about forty feet long
and three stories high. About five feet back of the front
end of this wall the appellant projected a semi-hexagonal
bay-window, the west wall of which-about eight feet
long and extending through the height of the first story
was placed upon the line of the lot so that approximately
one-half the thickness of the wall was put upon the appellees' land. The appellant called this west wall of the
bay-window a party -wall and claimed the right to construct it in part upon his neighbor's land by virtue of the
building regulations of the District of Columbia. The
appellees protested against this use of their property and
brought this suit in the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia to enjoin the maintenance of the wall on their
land. The court entered a decree in their favor requiring
its removal. The decree was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals and this appeal is brought. 34 App. D. C. 480.
The act of June 14, 1878, c. 194? 20 Stat. 131, authorized
the Conunissioners of the District of Columbia to make
"such building regulations for the said District as they may
deem advisable" and provided that, these should have the
same force within the District as if enacted by Congress.
Among the regulations promulgated by the Commissioners was the one approved by President Washington
on October 17, 1791, relating to the location of party
walls, which was recognized as in force and was "published for the information of builders." (Building Regulations, § 62, set forth in the margin. 1) The land in question

of this regulation' as the matter is one of private rights between parties:

lies outside the original limits of the city of Washington,
but the appellant contends that, by the above-mentioned
act of Congress and the action of the Commissioners, this
regulation was made applicable throughout the District.
The appellees in their bill alleged that the wall built across
their line was not a party wall, that the regulation permitting the use of adjoining land for party walls did not
extend beyond the bounds of the Federal City as originally
laid out, and that if it was intended to apply in the District beyond these limits it was "unconstitutional and void
because its effect is to deprive your complainants of their
property without due process of law and just compensation."
1. This court has jurisdiction. District Code, § 233,
Act of March 3, 1901, c. 854, 31 Stat. 1189, 1227; Steinmetz v. Allen, 192 U. S. 543, 556; McLean v. Denver & Rio
Grande R. R. Co., 203 U. S. 38, 47, 48. As the appellees
challenged the validity of the regolation if it applied to
their property as was insisted by the appellant, the case
was one in which there was drawn in question the validity
of an authority exercised under the United States. The
question was a substantial one, and was directly presented,.
its determination being required unless the appellees
succeeded upon one (f the other issues. To justify a review of the decision under the act governing this appeal
"That the person or persons appointed by the Commissioners to
superintend buildings may enter upon the land of any person to set
out the foundation and regulate the walls to be built between party
and party, as to the breadth and thickness thereof, which foundation
shall be laid equally upon the lands of the persons between whom such
party walls are to be built, and shall be of the breadth and thickness
determined by such person proper, and the first builder shall be reimbursed one moiety of the charge of such party wall or so much thereof
as the next builder shall have occasion to make use of before such next
builder shall anyways use or break into the wall, the charge of value
thereof to be set by the person or persons so appointed by the Commissioners."

SMOOT v. HEYL.
227 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

it is sufficient if the validity of the authority is drawn in
question irrespective of the conclusion reached by the
court below. Baltimore & Potomac R. R. Co. v. Hopkins,
130 U. S.210, 222. The appeal brings the entire case here.
See Homer v. United States, No. 2, 143 U. S. 570, 577;
Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Austin, 168 U. S. 685, 695.
In this view, it is unnecessary to pass upon the conflicting
contentions with respect to the amount involved.
2. Upon the merits, we need not go beyond the point
on which the Court of Appeals rested its decision. The
court held that the wall placed on the appellees' land was
not a party wall. In the building regulationsa party wall
is defined as "a wall built upon the dividing line between
adjoining premises for their common use." The fundamental idea is that of mutual benefit. It is manifest
that not every sort of construction projecting oyer the
boundary, although it may form part of the exterior wall
of a building, can be called a party wall. Instead of being
for the common use, it may be merely an injurious protuberance. And whether or not a particular structure
comes within the District rules is' a question the decision
of which by the Court of Appeals should be accepted unless there is plain error. Here we have the wall of a baywindow eight feet long projecting from the main wall of
the house. Save for this short projection the main wall
is set back three feet within the building line. The ends
of the bay-window wall are splayed as is usual in such
cases and, while it appeared that they could be chiseled'
out in order to make right angles, the testimony was that
if the adjoining owners desired to build in connection
with the wall it would cost as much as to erect a new wall
of the same dimensions. Taking the entire construction
into consideration, it would seem to be merely the case
of an encroachment on the adjoining property rather than
that of a wall built on the dividing line for mutual advantage. After reviewing the facts the Court of Appeals

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Syllabus.

227 U. S.

summed up the matter by saying (pp. 482, 483): "It
could serve no such purpose to appellees as is contemplated by the regulations of the District authorizing the
construction of party walls. . . . Appellees can derive no such benefit from it as the servient owner is entitled to receive as compensation for the taking and occupation of his land. It constitutes a nuisance rather than
a benefit."
We find no reason for disturbing the decree.

SVOR v. MORRIS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
MINNESOTA.

No. 756.

Submitted January C),1913.- Decided February 24, 1913.

One who settled on land not, at the time open to entry but which became
open does not-have to go through the idle ceremony of vacating and
settling upon it anew.
Where the first selection of lieu lands is rejected as irregular, the land
is open during the interval before a new and regular selection is filed,
and the homestead right of one who had previously settled thereon
in good faith attaches and is superior to that under the new selection.
As between conflicting claims to public lands, the one whose initiation
is first in time, if adequately followed up, is to be deemed first in
right.
Under the act of May 14, 1880, 21 Stat. 141 and § 2265, Rev. Stat., the
rights of a settler who fails to assert his claim within three months
of settlement are not inexorably extinguished but only awarded to
the next settler in order of time who does assert his claim and complies with the law, and advantage of this statute cannot be taken
by a railroad company selecting land which is withdrawn from selection by having already been settled on. Hastings & Dakota Ry. Co.
