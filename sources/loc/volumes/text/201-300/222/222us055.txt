KALEM COMPANY v. HARPER BROTHERS.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 26. Argued October 31, November 1, 1911.-Decided November 13,
1911.
An exhibition of a series of photographs of persons and things, arranged on films as moving pictures and so depicting the principal
scenes of an author's work as to tell the story is a dramatization of
such work, and the person producing the films and offering them for
sale for exhibitions, even if not himself exhibiting them, infringes the
copyright of the authbr under Rev. Stat., § 4952, as amended bj
the act of March 3, 1891, c. 565, 26 Stat. 1106.
Quanre whether there would be infringement if the illusion of motion
were. produced from paintings instead of photographs of real persons, and also quwre whether such photographs can be copyrighted.
Rev. Stat., § 4952, as amended by the act of March 3, 1891,. c. 65,
26 Stat. 1106, confines itself to a well-known form of reproduction
and does not exceed the power given to Congress under Art. I, § 8,
cl. 8 of the Constitution, to secure to authors the exclusive right to
their writings for a limited period.
169 Fed. Rep. 61, affirmed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. John W. Griggs and Mr. Drury W. Cooper for appellant:
The Court of Appeals was right in affirming the propos tion that the making and publication of a series of pictures
of the incidents described in a book is not an infringement of a copyright in the book.
Copyright does not monopolize the intellectual conception, but only the form of expression, i. e., the "arrangement of words," Holmes v. Hurst, 174 U. S. 86,
adopted by the author. It is the writings-of the author
that are protected, and the statute cannot extend the

A moving picture film, whether made by a modern

If one, by copyrighting a book, can prevent an artist
from picturing the scenes described, reason 'cannot afford
room fpr the orator to use, in his flights of fancy, the aulthor's created characters or figures of speech, for the idea
is not open to appropriation or use in one case more than
in the other. But it is the writing only, and not the idea,
that is monopolized; the mode of expression and not the'
thoiight conveyed. Books 6nd pictures are essentially
different.

Argument for Appellant.

A series of moving pictures is not a copy of the book,
Perforated Music Roll Case, 209 U. S. 1, nor are defendants' pbotographs copies of the book as the word copy is
understood. Bennett v.. Carr, 96 Fed. Rep. 213.
The statutory monopoly to make"copies does not cover
the plates and other tools with which they are made and
does not pass with their ownership. Stephens v. Cady, 14
How. 530. Being a creature of the statute, this species of
property is legally distinct from the underlying ideas upon
which it is, after all, predicated, just as from the paper
and metal without which it would have no commercial
value.
A person may utilize the ideas portrayed in a copyrighted publication, provided he bestows upon his own
writings such skill and labor as to produce an original
result. Folsom v. Marsh, 2 Story, 100, 115; S.C., 9 Fed.
Cas. 342. Utilizing ideas without copyrighting their expression is lawful. Dun Co. v. Lumbermen's Credit Assn.,
209 U. S. 20; Morris v. Wright .(1870), L. R. 5 Ch. 279;
West Pub. Co. v. Lawyers' Co., 64 Fed. Rep. 360; 79 Fed.
Rep. 756; Edward Thompson Co. v. American Co., 130
Fed. Rep. 369; 157 Fed. Rep. 1003.
Not only is there no evidence here that the copyright
proprietors were injured even in the slightest degree; but,
on the contrary, the defendant asserted by letter that its'
films would benefit the c~qnplainants, and this they did
not deny, but stood upon their naked assertion of legal
right.
To transcribe a musical composition by making a
record upon a phonograph blank, or by perforating a
sheet of paper, requires neither creative nor artistic power,
but merely the common skill of the artisan. Yet, to make
such record, is not, to copy the composition, as has been
held in every reported case that has come to our special
knowledge. Kennedy v. McTammany, 33 Fed. Rep. 584;
White-Smith Co. v. Apollo Co., 77 C. C. A. 368; 147 Fed.

Under Lithograph Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.' S. 53, and
Bleistein v. Donhldson, 188 U. S. 250, the films were legally
copyrightable as they .were the result of original conception, posing and artistic skill.
A photograph cannot be an infringement of a copyrighted book. See Littleton v. Ditson Co., 62 Fed. Rep.
597; 67 Fed. Rep. 90.5, holding that "book" is distinct from "musical composition " Woods v. Abbott, Fed.
Cas. No. 17,938, holding that*"photograph" is not a
"print"; Stowe v. Thomas, 2'Wall. Jr. 5.47, holding that
"translation" is not a "copy"; Hills v. Austrich, 120
Fed. Rep. 862, holding that "stone" does not include
"metal plate."
All the marks of literary property that distinguish the
book or the drama are lacking from the picture, save in
so far as both involve the same underlying ideas.
The exhibition of the pictures, arranged upon a film
vhich is, during All the time of its use, a part of a ma-chine, is not an infringement of the book copyright.
The complainants' creation was not copied in the making of the pictures, but they are realizations, in a different
art, of some of the ideas to which Gen. Wallace gave a
written portrayal. Their exhibition by machine does not
approach more nearly the writing of the book than did
their making and selling.
Such exhibition of the pictures is not a "public performance or representation" in violation of the Dramatic
C6pyright Act. Daly v. Palmer, 6 Blatchf. 256; Daly
v. Webster, 56 Fed. Rep. 483, distinguished. And see
Chatterton v. Cave, 10 C. P. 572; Hanststaengel v. Baynes,

Thompson v. Hubbard, 131 U. S. 123. See, generally,
Oregon Ry. v. OregonianCo., 130 U. S. 1, 26.
In any event, defendant is not an infringer, direct or
contributory. It does not give any performance in, nor
does it manage, any theatre. Dramatizing is entirely distinct from, public performance or representation. As an
act of infringement, it is defined, Rev. Stat., § 4965, and
is punishable by forfeiture of plates; as a penal statute
it must be strictly construed. Thornton v. Schreiber, 124
U. S. 612; Bolles v. Outing Co., 175 U. S. 262. Section
4966 provides damages against public performances.
Defendant derives no profit from the exhibition, and
hence is not within the class against which § 4966. is
directed, for that operates against the actual wrongdoer,
Brady v. Daly, 175 U. S. 174, not the indirect participant
therein.
The defendant is not concerned with the ultimate use
to which its films are put, and they are manifestly susceptible of many uses which complainants do not contend to be within the purview of a dramatic copyright.

If the act protects copyright in a drama against any
exhibition of pictures, it is stretched to cover that which
was not the work of the author, but of another, and therefore it is unconstitutional; since that instrument limits
the author's monopoly to his writings.

MR.

JUSTIcE

HOLMiS delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from a decree restraining an alleged
infringement of the copyright upon the late General
Lew Wallace's book 'Ben Hrr.' 169 Fed. Rep. 61. 94
C. C. A. 429. The case was heard on the pleadings and
an agreed statement of facts, and the only issue is whether
those facts constitute an infringement of the copyright
upon the book. So far as they need to be stated here
they are as follows. The appellant and defendant, the
Kalem Company, is engaged in the production of moving
picture films, the operation and effect of which are too
well known to require description. By means of them
anything of general interest from a coronation to a prize
fight is presented to the public with almost'the illusion
of reality-latterly even color being more or less reproduced. The defendant employed a man to read Ben
Hur and to write out such a description or scenario of
certain portions that it could be followed in action; these
portions giving enough of the story to beidentified with
ease. It then caused the described action to be performed and took negatives for moving pictures of the
scenes, from which it produced films suitable for exhibitioft. These films it expected and intended to sell for

Opinion of the Court.

use as moving pictures in the way in which such pictures
commonly are used. It advertised them under the title
Ben Hur. 'Scenery.and Supers by Pain's Fireworks Co:
Costumes from Metropolitan Opera House. Chariot Rlce
by 3d Battery, Brooklyn. Positively the Most Superb
Moving Picture Spectacle ever Produced in America in
Sixteen Magnificent Scenes,' etc., with taking titles, culminating in 'BenHur Victor.' It sold the films and public
exhibitions from them took place.
The subdivision of the question that has the most general importance is whether the 15ublic exhibition of these
moving pictures infringed any rights under the copyright
law. By Rev. Stat., § 4952, as amended by the act of
March 3, 1891, c. 565, 26 Stat. 1106, authors have the
exclusive right to dramatize any of. their. works. So, if
the exhibition was or was founded on a dramatizing of
Ben Hur this copyright was infringed. We are of opinion that Ben Hur was dramatized by what was done.
Whether we consider the purpose of this clause of the statute, or the etymological history and present usages of language, drama may be achieved by action as well as byspeech. Action can tell a story, display all the moA vivid
relations between men, and depict every kind of human
emotion, without the aid of-a word. It would be impossible to deny the title of drama to pantomime as played by
masters of the art. Daly v. Plmer, 6 Blatchf. 256, 264.
But if a pantomime of Ben Hur would be a dramatizing of
Ben Hur, it would be none the less so that it was exhibited
to'the audience by reflection from a glass and not by direct
vision of the figures-as sometimes has been done in order
to produce ghostly or inexplicable effects. The essence
of the matter in the case last supposed is not the mechanism employed but that we see the event or story lived.
The moving pictures are only less vivid than reflectiong
from a mirror. With the former as with the latter our
visual impression-what we ee-is caused by the real pan-

tomime of real men through the medium of natural forces,
although the machinery is different and more complex.
How it would be if the illusion of motion were produced
from paintings instead of from photographs of the real
thing may be left open until the question shall arise.
It is said that pictures of scenes in a novel may be made
and exhibited without infringing the copyright and that
they may be copyrighted themselves. Indeed it was conceded by the Circuit Court of Appeals that these films
could be copyrighted and, we may assume, could be exhibited as photographs. Whether this concession is correct or not, in view of the fact that they are photographs
of an unlawful dramatization of the novel, we need not
decide. We will assume that it is. But it does not follow that the use of them in motion does not infringe the
author's rights. The most innocent objects, such as the
-mirror in the other case that we have supposed, may be
used for unlawful purposes. And if, as we have tried
to show, moving pictures may be used for dramatizing
a novel, when the photographs are used in that way they
are used to infringe a right which the statute reserves.
But again it is said that the defendant did not produce the representations, but merely sold the films to
jobbers, and on that ground ought not to be held. In
some cases where an ordinary article of commerce is sold
nice questions may arise as to the point at which the
seller becomes an accomplice in a subsequent illegal use
by"the buyer. It has been held that mere indifferent
supposition or knowledge on the part of the seller that the
buyer of spirituous liquor is contemplating such unlawful
use is not enough to connect him with the possible unlawful consequences, Graves v. Johnson, 179 Massachusetts,
53, but that if the sale was made with a view to the illegal
resale the price could not be recovered. Graves v. Johnson,
156 Massachusetts, 211. But no such niceties are involved
here. The defendant not only expected but invoked by ad-

Syllabus.

vertisement the use of its films for dramatic reproduction
of the story. That was the most conspicuous purpose for
which they could be used, and the one for which especially
they were made. If the defendant did not contribute to
the infringement it is impossible to do so except by taking
pirt in the final act. It is liable on principles recognized
in -every part of the law. Rupp & Wittgenfeld Co. v.
Elliott, 131 Fed..Rep. 730, 732. Harper v. Shoppell, 28
Fed. Rep. 613. Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany PaperCo.,
15 U. S. 425, 433.
It is argued that the law construed as we have construed
it goes beyond the power conferred upon Congress by
tlekConstitution, to secure to authors for a limited time
the exclusive right to their writings. Art. I, § 8, cl. 8.
It is suggested that to extend the copyright to a case like
this is to extend it to the ideas as distinguished from the
words in which those ideas are clothed. But there is no
attempt to make a monopoly of the ideas expressed. The
law confines itself to a particular, cognate and well known
form of reproduction. If to*that extent a grant of monopoly is thought a proper way to secure the right to the
writings this court cannot say that Congress was wrong.
Decree affirmed.
