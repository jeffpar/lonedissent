CITY OF CHICAGO v. STURGES.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 39. Argued November 6, 1911.-Decided December 18, 1911.
The question of validity of a state statute under the state constitution
is foreclosed in this court by the decision of the highest court of the
State.
The general principles of law that there is no individual liability for an
act which ordinary hunian care and foresight could not guard against
and that loss for causes purely accidental must rest where it falls,
are subject to the legislative power which, in the absence of organic
restraint, may, for the general welfare, impose obligations and responsibilities otherwise non-existent.
Primarily government exists for the maintenance of social order and
is under the obligation to protect life, liberty and property against
the careless and evil-minded.
Legislation reasonably adapted to the maintenance of social order, affording hearing before judgment, and not affirmatively forbidden by
any constitutional provision, does not deny due process of law.
It is a familiar rule of the common law that the state which creates
subordinate municipal governments and vests in them police powers
essential to preservation of law and order may impose upon them
the duty of protecting property from mob violence and holk them
liable for loss caused by such violence.
Liability of the municipality for property destroyed by mob violence
rests upon reasonable grounds of public policy and operates to deter
the lawless destruction of property.
It is not unreasonable for a State to make a county liable for damages
sustained by sufferers whose property is not within any incorporated
city.
Equal protection of the law is not denied where the classification is
not so unreasonable and extravagant as to be merely an arbitrary
mandate. A classification between cities and unincorporated subdivisions of a county is a reasonable one within the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The act of Illinois of 1887 indemnifying owners of property for damages by mobs and riots is not unconstitutional as depriving cities of

their property without due process of law because liability is imposed irrespective of the power of the 'city to have prevented the
violence; nor is it unconstitutional as denying equal protection of the
law because it discriminates between cities and unincorporated subdivisions of a county.
237 Illinois, 46, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under
the Fourteenth Amendment of the mob and riot indemnity
law of Illinois, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. John W. Beckwith and Mr. Joseph F. Grossman,
with whom Mr. William H. Sexton, Mr. Edward J. Brundage and Mr. Robert N. Holt were on the brief, for plaintiff
in error:
The statute denies equal protection of the laws.
An arbitrary classification of persons or corporations

by the usual general law, according to the nature of the
particular matter in hand. It will not tolerate unuisual
or arbitrary actions. Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366;

The act deprive. plaintiff in error of its right to a judicial
inquiry upon the question of fact as to whether or not it
was derelict in the duties which it owes to the publicto preserve the peace and protect private property.
English authority for legislation under the police.power
of the state is inapplicable to our jurisprudence. In England there are no vested rights. Its police power is absolute and without limitation. Coke, 4 Inst. 36.
To justify legislation in this country under the police
power of the state it must appear that the act is reasonably
necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which
it is passed, and not unduly oppressive. Lawton v. Steele,
152 U. S. 133.
The act cannot be justified upon the theory that there

is an implied contract between the State and the city that
,the latter shall preserve the peace and maintain good
order within its borders. These duties are not contractual
obligations, but are imposed upon municipalities in invitum. But even if they are contractual the act is unconstitutional because it conclusively presumes a breach
of the contract.
The proceedings in the state courts in which judgment
was rendered against plaintiff in error herein were not due
process of law. If any question of fact or liability be conclusively presumed against it, this is not due process of
law. Zeigler v. Ala. R. R. Co., 58 Alabama, 594; Chicago
&c. R. R. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S. 418.
The State has no greater control over the property
rights of municipal corporations than of other corporations or individuals. Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4

v. C. & N. W. Ry. Co. (Ill. Appellate Court, not yet reported); People v. Fields, 58 N. Y. 491.
The statute contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment,
in that it denies to cities and its inhabitants the equal
protection of the law.
The guarantee of the equal protection of the law means
that no person or class of persons shall be denied the same
protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons
or other classes in the same place and in like circumstances.

The act arbitrarily discriminates between cities and
villages or incorporated towns. To justify legislation affecting a class of persons the classification must bear a
reasonable relation to the purposes for which the legislation is aimed. Cases supra and People v. Knopf, 183
Illinois, 410; Bessette v. People, 193 Illinois, 334; Richards

L. 105; People v. Fox, 247 Illinois, 402.
Each city, village or town incorporated prior to the
adoption of the Illinois constitution of 1870 is as similar
or dissimilar as their special charters and hence the fact
that a municipality was organized under the name of
"city" prior to the constitution of 1870, bears no reasonable relation to the purposes of the act, which is to suppress
mob violence and to indemnify the owners of property for
damages occasioned by mobs and riots throughout the
State. Art. X, ยง 1, Illinois Constitution, 1848; People v.
Board of Trustees, 170 Illinois, 468.
Cities and villages or incorporated towns organized
since the adoption of the Illinois constitution of 1870
differ only in the manner of organization. Their rights
and powers are identical and their duties and obligations
should and must be correspondingly the same. 'Starr &
Curtiss' Annotated Illinois Statutes, 1896, Ch. 24.
The judgment of the state Supreme Court that there
is such a difference between cities, villages and towns
as to form a rational basis for classification in the act
under consideration is not conclusive upon the Supreme
Court of the United States. Yick Wo -. HQpki?s, '118

The act arbitrarily discriminates between the inhabitants of the same county and is therefore unconstitutional.
The statute gives to owners of property in the county
outside the limits of any city a right of action against said
county, but does n6t give such right to owners of property
within the same county if within the limits of any city.

having declined to hear counsel for defendant in error:
It is arulbof construction that a penal statute is to
be strictly construed, but courts do not construe such
statutes so strictly as to defeat the apparent purpose of

Municipal corporations are instrumentalities of the
State for the convenient administration of government
within their limits. Their functions are for the public good.
They are created, among other purposes, to manage the
concerns, police and public interest of the people living
within their territory, and they are subject to legal obligations and duties, and derive all their powers from the
legislature, except where the constitution of the State
otherwise provides. They have only such powers as the
legislature confers upon them. All the rights, duties and

delivered the opinion of the court.

The only question under this writ of error is as to the
validity of a statute of the State of Illinois entitled "An
Act to indemnify the owners of property for damages
occasioned by mobs and riots." Laws of 1887, p. 237.
The defendant in error recovered a judgment against
the city under that statute, which was affirmed in the
Supreme Court of the State. 237 Illinois, 46. The validity of the law under the Illinois constitution was thus
affirmed, and that question is thereby foreclosed'. But
it was urged in the Illinois courts that the act violated
the guarantee of due process of law and the equal protection of the law as provided by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
By the provisions of the statute referred to, a city is
made liable for three-fourths of- the damage resulting to
property situated therein, caused by the violence of anymob or riotous assemblage of more than twelve persons,
not abetted or permitted by the negligent or wrongful
act of the owner, etc. If the damage be to property not
within the city, then the county in which it is located
is in like manner made responsible. The act saves to the
owner his action against the rioters and gives the city or
county, as the case may be, a lien upon any judgment
against such participants for reimbursement, or a reniedy
to the city or county directly, against the individuals
causing the damage, to the amount of any judgment it
may have paid the sufferer.
It is said that the act denies to the city due process of
law, since it imposes liability irrespective of any question
of the power of the city to have prevented the violence,
or of negligence in the use of its power. This was the inVOL. ccXXI-21

322

222 U. S.

terpretation placed upon the act by the Supreme Court
of Illinois. Does the law as thus interpreted deny due
process of law? That the law provides for a judicial hearing and a remedy over against those primarily liable
narrows the objection to the single question of legislative
power to impose liability regardless of fault.
It is a general principle of our law that there is no individual liability for an act which ordinary human care
and foresight could not guard against. It is also a general
principle of the same law that a loss from any cause
purely accidental must rest where it chances to fall. But
behind and above these general principles which the law
recognizes as ordinarily prevailing, there lies the legislative power, which, in the absence of organic restraint, may,
for the general welfare of society, impose obligations and
responsibilities otherwise non-existent.
Primarily, governments exist for the maintenance of
social order. Hence it is that the obligation of the government to protect life, liberty and property against the
conduct of the indifferent, the careless and the evil-minded
may be regarded as lying at the very foundation of the
social compact. A recognition of this supreme obligation
is found in those exertions of the legislative power which
have as an end the preservation of social order and the protection of the welfare of the public and of the individual.
If such legislation be reasonably adapted to the end in
view, affords a hearing before judgment, and is not forbidden by some other affirmative provision of constitutional law, it is not to be regarded as denying due process
of law under the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The law in question is a valid exercise of the police power
of the State of Illinois. It rests upon the duty of the State
to protect-its citizens in the enjoyment and possession of
their acquisitions, and is but a recognition of the obligation of the State to preserve social order ar d the property
of the citizen against the violence of a riot or a mob.

CITY OF CHICAGO v. STURGES.

222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The State is the creator of subordinate municipal governments. It vests in them the police powers essential
to the preservation of law and order. It imposes upon
them the duty of protecting property situated within their
limits from the violence of such public breaches of the
peace as are mobs and riots. This duty and obligation
thus entrusted to the local subordinate government is
by this enactment emphasized and enforced by imposing
upon the local community absolute liability for property
losses resulting from the violence of such public tumults.
The policy of imposing liability upon a civil subdivisioft
of government exercising delegated police power is familiar
to every student of*the common law. We find it recognized in the beginning of the police system of AngloSaxon people. Thus, "The Hundred," a very early form
of civil subdivision, was held answerable for robberies
committed within the division. By a series of statutes,
beginning possibly in 1285, in the statutes of Winchester,
13 Edw. I, c. 1, coming on down to the 27th Elizabeth,
c. 13, the Riot Act of George I (1 Geo. I, St. 2) and Act
of 8 George II, c. 16, we may find a continuous recognition of the principle that a civil subdivision entrusted with
the duty of protecting property in its midst and with
police power to discharge the function, may be made
answerable not only for negligence affirmatively shown,
but absolutely as not having afforded a protection adequate to the obligation. Statutes of a similar character
have been enacted by several of the States and held valid
exertions of -the police power. Darlington v. Mayor &c.
of New York, 31 N. Y. 164; Fauviav. New Orleans, 20 La.
Ann. 410; County.of Allegheny v. Gibson &c., 90 Pa. St. 397.
The imposition of absolute liability upon the community
when property is destroyed through the violence of a mob
is not, therefore, an unusual police regulation. Neither is
it arbitrary, as not resting upon reasonable grounds of
policy. Such a regulation has a tendency to deter the

222 U. S.

lawless, since the sufferer must be compensated by a tax
burden which will fall upon all property, including that
of the evil doers as members of the community. It is
likewise calculated to stimulate the exertions of the indifferent and the law-abiding to avoid the falling of. a
burden which they must share with the lawless. In that
it directly operates on and affects public opinion, it tends
strongly to the upholding of the empire of the law.
There remains the contention that the act discriminates
between cities and villages or other incorporated towns.
The liability is imposed upon the city if the property be
within the limits of a city; if not, then upon the county.
,The classification is not an unreasonable one. A city is
presumptively the more populous and better organized
community. As such it may well be singled out and made
exclusively responsible for the consequence of riots and
mobs to property therein.
The county, which includes the city and other incorporated subdivisions, is, not unreasonably, made liable to all
-sufferers whose property is not within the limits of a city.
The power of the State to impose liability for damage
and injury to property from riots and mobs includes the
power to make a classification of the subordinate munici
-palities upon which the responsibility may be imposed
It is a matter for the exercise of legislative discretion, and
*theequal protectiQn of the law is not denied where the
classification is not so unreasonable and extravagant as
to be a mere arbitrary mandate.
The cases upon this subject are so numerous as to need
no further 'elucidation.
Among the later cases are Williams v. Arkansas, 217
U. S. 79; Watson v. Maryland, 218 U. S. 173; Chicago, B.
