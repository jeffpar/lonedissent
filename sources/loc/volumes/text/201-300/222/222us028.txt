FINLEY v. PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA.
No. 15.

Argued October 26, 1911.-Decided November 6,. 1911.

Whether a state statute denies equal protection of the laws by reason
of classification depends upon whether there is a basis for the
classification.
There is a proper basis for classification of punishment for crimes between convicts serving life terms in the state prison and convicts
serving lesser terms.
Section 246 of the Penal Code of California inflicting the death penalty
for assaults with intent to kill committed by life term convicts in
the state prison is not unconstitutional under the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because its provisions are not
applicable to convicts serving lesser terms.
153 California, 59, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under
the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of § 246 of the Penal Code of the State of California, are stated in the opinion.

neficent advance of penal reform necessitates the conclusion that no trivial reason prompted or should be held
to have prompted the statute. Boles, Science of Penology,

The legislature did not base the statute upon the ground
that life termers are more dangerous than other prisoners.

other than personal character. Drahms, The Criminal,.

Life termers are not desperate because of the loss of all
hope of freedom, since the parol9 law of California supplies ample relief.
"Permanent loss of civil rights as compared with a
temporary loss thereof does not make the life termer
more dangerous than his'fellow convict.
A law predicated on length of term is unconstitutional.

The only possible reason for the enactment of the statute is a seeming lack of adequate*punishment for life
termers.
The classification necessary to support a statute must
be based upon real differences in the situation, condition
and tendencies of things. Ho Ah Kow v. Nunan, 5 Sawyer,

The statute does not meet constitutional tests. There
is no inherent difference between the life termer and the
middle-aged long termer. See Report State Board Prison
Directors, 1909-1910, 69 and 185; 70 and 184.
Owing to the condition of the California law, certain
prisoners are, with reference to immunity from punishment, in the same position as life termers. Code Civ.

General of the State of California, was on the brief, for
defendant in error.
Memorandum opinion, by direction of the court, by
MR.

JUSTICE MCKENNA.

Section 246 of the Penal Code of the State of California
provides as follows: "Every person, undergoing a life
sentence in a state prison of this State, who, with malice
aforethought, commits an assault upon the person- of
another with a deadly weapon or instrument, or by any
means or force likely to produce great bodily injury, is
punishable with death."

FINLEY v. CALIFORNIA.

222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Plaintiff in error was indicted under this section, tried,
fouid guilty and the death penalty imposed. To the
judgment of the Supreme Court of the State affirming the
sentence against him he prosecutes this writ of error and
urges as ground there6f that § 246 is repugnant to the
Fourteenth Amhendment of the Constitution of the United
States in that it denies to him the equal protection of
the laws because it provides an exceptional punishment
for life prisoners.
The Supreme Court sustained the law on the ground
that there was a proper basis for classification between
convicts serving life sentences in the state prison, as defendant was when he committed the crime for which he
was indicted and found guilty, and convicts serving lesser
terms.
't is elementary that the contention is to be tested by
cons'dering whether there is a basis for the classification
made by the statute. Applying that test we see no error
in the ruling. As said by Mr. Justice Henshaw, delivering the opinion of the court, "The classification [of the
statute] in question is not arbitrary but is based upon
valid reasons and distinctions." And pointing out the
distinction between life prisoners and other convicts, he
said that "The 'life termers,' as has been said, while
within the prison walls, constitute a class by themselves,
a class recognized as such by penologists the world over.
Their situation is legally different. Their civic death is
perpetual." Manifestly there could be no extefision of
the term of imprisonment as a punishment for crimes they
might commit, and whatever other punishment should be
imposed was for the legislature to determine. The power
of classification which the law-making power possesses has
been illustrated by many cases which need not be cited.
They demonstrate that the legislature of California did
riot transcend its power in the enactment of § 246.
Judgment affirmed.
