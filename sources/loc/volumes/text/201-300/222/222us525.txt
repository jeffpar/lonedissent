KEENEY, AS ADMINISTRATOR, v. COMPTROLLER OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
ERROR TO THE SURROGATE'S COURT OF THE COUNTY OF
KINGS, STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 81.

Argued December 6, 1911.-Decided January 9, 1912.

The statute of New York of 1896, providing for a transfer tax on property passing by deed of a resident intended to take effect in possession
or enjoyment at or after the death of the grantor, is not unconstitutional as taking property without due process of law nor does it
deny the equal protection of the law by arbitrary classification of the
subject-matter or by different rates of taxation depending on the
relationship of the beneficiaries to the grantor.
The privilege of acquiring property by trust instrument, taking effect
on the death of the grantor, is as much dependent on the law as that
of acquiring property by inheritance and is subject to taxation by
the State.
Where a state tax on the transfer of property does not offend the Constitution of the United States, its validity must be determined by
the law of the State.
An excise on transfers"does not become an ad valorem tax on the property conveyed because the amount is based on the value of such
property. Magoun v. Illinois Trust Bank, 170 U. S. 283.
The Fourteentl Amendment does not diminish the taxing power of
the State or deprive the.State of the power to select subjects for
taxation, but only requires that the citizen be given opportunity to
be heard on questions of liability and value, and be not arbitrarily
denied equal protection.
The Fourteenth Amendment does not require a State to tax all transfers because it taxes some transfers.
While there can be no arbitrary classification without denying equal
protection of the law, there need not be great or conspicuous differences in order to'justify a classification.
A State may impose a graduated tax on transfers of personal property
by instrument taking effect on the grantor's death without violating
the. equal protection clause.
One assessed at the lowest rate under a graduated tax statute cannot

object to the constitutionality because others are taxed at the higher
rate.
A statute imposing a graduated tax would not necessarily be held unconstitutional as to the initial rate, even if the provisions as to the
higher rates were unconstitutional.
A State may impose a transfer tax based on personal property passing
under a trust deed to take effect at the grantor's death if the property had its situs in that State when the deed was made.
Where the power to tax exists, the State may fix the rate and say when
and how the amount shall be ascertained and paid, and if the personal
property has its situs in the State when the deed is made, it may tax
a transfer of personal property undef a trust deed to a resident of
the State to take effect at the grantor's death, although the personal
property at that time may be without the State.
194 N. Y. 281, affirmed.

ON June 13, 1903, Susan A. Keeney, a resident of New
York, being in good health, executed in Kings County a
deed, Whereby she conveyed a cattle ranch in Texas and
certain stocks and bonds to the Fidelity Trust Company
of Newark, New Jersey, in trust, to hold the same during
her lifetime, and to divide the net income equally between
herself and her three children, two of whom reside out of
the State of New York. The deed further provided that
after her death the trustees should pay the entire income,
or transfer the property, to her children, or their issue,
on terms and limitations not.material to this iniestigation.
In the deed she "reserved the right to revoke or alter the
whole or any part of the trust conveyance, at any time
after six naonths notice in writing."
She died March 29,
1907, being at the time a resident of Kings County, leaving an estate of the value of $25,000 and the three children
as sole heirs at law.
In tax proceedings the proper officers found that the
stocks and bonds were .of the then value of $773,600,
one-fourth ($193,400) being for the use of Mrs: Keeney
for life, and the remainder to her children, being intended
to take effect at her death. It was held that their in-

terest was subject to the tax imposed by the New York
statute of 1896 (May 27, 1896, Laws 1896., v. 1, c. 908,
ยง 220, .Subd. 1, 3), which provides: "A tax shall be and is hereby imposed upon the transfer of any property, real or personal . . . or of any
interest therein or income therefrom, in trust or otherwise. - .
(3) When the transfer is of property made
by a resident or by a non resident, when such non resident's property is within this state, by deed, grant, bar-gain, sale or gift made in contemplation of the death of the
grantor, vendor or donor, or intended to take effect, in
possession or enjoyment, at or after such death."
Mrs. Keeney's administrator and children appealed
on the ground that the taxable transfer act of New York,
in so far is it imposes a tax upon property transferred
inter vivos, violated the Fourteenth Amendment, in that
it took the property without due process of'law, and the
different rates of taxation and classification were of such
discriminatory a character as to deny the equal protection
of the law.
The judgment was affirmed. The case is here on writ
of error from the final order of the Surrogates' Court, entered in pursuance of the mandate of the Court of Appeals.

Mr. George r. Canfield, with whom Mr. Karl T. Frederick was on the brief, for plaintiffs in error:
Even if the State was taxing a transfer of propeity (an
assumption contrary to fact) the transfer in this case was
strictly a conveyance.inter vivos, and was in no sepse testamentary. The tax must therefore be sharply" distinguished from an inheritance tax., Ridden v. Thrall, 125

A tax upon the special form of transfers inter vivos
covered by this act is unconstitutional because arbitrarily
discriminatory and not based upon any legal or natural
classification bearing any legally reasonable relation to the
subject. Nichol v. Ames, 173 U. S. 509.
The tax in this case upon all remainders limited to
take effect in possession after the death of the grantor is
not imposed under the taxing power proper of the State,
and cannot be upheld as an exercise thereof because it is
based upon a classification which has no reasonable relation to taxation. Frazer v. McConway Co., 82 Fed. Rep.
257; Hatch v. Reardon, 184 N. Y. 431; affirmed, 204 U. S.
152; Farringdon v. Mensching, 187 N. Y. 8; Matter of
Brandreth, 169 N. Y. 437.
The tax cannot be upheld under the general regulative
or police power of the State, because it is not imposed for
the purpose of regulating or promoting any of those interests of society which may be regulated or promoted
under the police power.
That line of reasoning is entirely untenable; because
such an object does not come fairly within the scope of the
regulative or police power of the State; is not limited to
cases having any connection at all with the subject of inheritance taxation; and, even if limited to cases which
might be availed of for the purpose of escaping taxation,
the act would be entirely ineffective and useless to prevent
the accomplishment of such a purpose. Barbier v. Connelly, 113 U. S. 27; Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623; Matter
of Graves, 52 N. Y. (Misc.) 433; Matter of Edgerton, 35
N. Y. App. Div. 125; S. C., affirmed, 158 N. Y. 671.
The assumption that the tax is upon the transfer of
property is contrary to fact. No such tax was imposed in
this case, and the section of law under which the tax was
imposed does not in effect provide for a tax upon "a transfer" of property but only upon "a coming into possession"
of property previously transferred. Matter of Gould, 156

A tax upon the coming into possession of property is
unconstitutional because it deprives appellants of their
property without due process of law and denies to them the
equal protection of the laws. Matter of Pell, 171 N. Y. 48.
The tax upon the coming into possession of the property in this case is also bad because the property was
situated and the coming into possession took place in a
State other than New York, and of the three persons beneficially interested in the property, two were non-residents
of that State. The State, therefore, had no jurisdiction
over such property. Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199

This court will also be bound by the decision of the
highest court of the State that there is nothing in the statute or its enforcement in conflict with the constitution
of the State, and that the proceedings taken therein for
its ascertainment did not deprive the plaintiffs in error
of their property without due process of law within the
meaning of the state constitution: Met. St. Ry. Co. v.

The right to take property by devise or descent is a
creature of the law and not a natural gift; since it is a privilege granted and conferred by the State, the State may
confer particular rights of succession, but with them impose conditions, limitations, classifications, and impositions upon the right of each particular succession granted.

This court will take it to have been found that the possession or enjoyment of the property passed to the plaintiffs in error, at the death of Susan A. Keeney, and that
the statute was applicable to the right of succession of the
plaintiffs in error to the remainders therein which vested
in possession and enjoyment at her death. Cases supra

The classification of remainders which take effect in

The Constitution does not, generally speaking, control
the power of the State to select and classify subjects of
taxation. Cases supra and Cahen v. Brewster, 203 U. S.

The cases cited sustain the proposition that the statute
imposing a tax upon the transfer of this class of remainders,
limited to vest in possession and enjoyment at the death
of the donor, the former owner of the property, and which
cannot vest at any other time or upon any other contingency, does not deprive the plaintiffs in error of any of
their rights or any of the privileges and immunities of
citizens of the United States, nor does it violate the Fourteenth Amendment or any provision of the Constitution

See also McMillen v. Anderson,

MR. JUSTICE LAmAR, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
So much of the New York statute, as imposes an inheritance tax, was sustained in Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S.
115, and in several decisions of the Court of Appeals of
that State. But the plaintiffs insist that there is a radical
difference between an inheritance tax and one on transfers
inter vivos. The first, they say, is an excise, imposed on a
privilege; While that complained of here is really on property, though called a tax on a transfer. They argue that
inheritance taxes have been sustained on th6 ground
(United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625), that no one has
the natural right to acquire property by will or descent, and
if the State permits such acquisition, it may require/ the
payment of a tax as a condition precedent to the right of
using that privilege. On the other hand, they contend
that the right to convey. or come into possession, does
not depend upon a statutory or taxable privilege, but is
a right incident to the ownership of property, and that
the tax imposed by the statute on that right is in effect
a tax on the property itself, and void because lacking in
the elements of uniformity and equality required in the
assessment of property taxes.
But, if any such distinction could be made between
taxing a right and taxing a privilege, it would not avail
plaintiffs in the present case. There is no natural right
to create artificial and technical estates with limitations
over, nor has the remainderman any more right to succeed
to -the possession of property under such deeds than
legatees and devisees under a will. The privilege of acquiring property by such an instrument is as much dependent upon the law as that of acquiring property by

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

222 U. S.

inheritance, and transfers by deed to take effect at death,
have frequently been classed with death duties, legacy
and inheritance taxes. Some statutes go further than
that of New York, and tax gratuitous acquisitions under
marriage settlements, trust conveyances, or other instruments where the transfer of property takes effect upon
the death, not merely of the grantor, but of any person
whomsoever.
This was true under the Internal Revenue Act of 1864
(June 30, 1864, 13 Stat. 223, c. 173). It imposed a succession tax on "all dispositions of real estate, taking effect
upon the death of any person." It was not apportioned,
and would have been: void if a tax on property. But it
was held that "it was not a tax on land," since "the
succession or devolution of the real estate is the subject
matter of the tax . . . whether . . . effected
by will, deed or law of descent." Scholey v. Rew, 23 Wall.
331, 347, cited and followed, Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S.
41, 78-81.
Wherever the amount of a tax is, as here, to be measured
by the value .of property, it has been earnestly argued
that it was to tax the property itself, and that to ignore
that feature is to put the name above the fact. But when
the State decides to impose such a tax the amount must
be determined by some standard. To require the same
amount to be paid on all transfers is not so fair as to
impose the burden in proportion to the value of the property. An excise on transfers therefore does not lose that
character because the amount to be paid is determined
by -the values conveyed. In view of the decisions in
Magoun v. Illinois Trust Bank, 170 U. S. 283, and other
cases already cited, it is innecessary to review the arguments pro and con, and Sgain point out the. distinction
which has been made and sustained between hxcises and
ad valorem taxes. We therefore accept the cinclusibn
of the Court of Appeals of New York that the statute of

KEENEY v. NEW YORK.
222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

that State imposing a tax on the transfers of property
"intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or
after the death of grantor" is "not a property tax, but in
the nature of an excise tax on the transfer of property."
194 N. Y. 281.
The validity of the tax must be determined by the laws
of New York. The Fourteenth Amendment does not
diminish the taxing power of the State, but only requires
that in its exercise the citizen must be afforded an opportunity to be heard on all questions of liability and
value, and shall not, by arbitrary and discriminatory provisions; be dened equal protection. It does not deprive
the State of the power to select the subjects of taxation.
But it does not follow that because it can tax any transfer
(Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U.- S. 52, 159), that it must tax
all transfers, or that all must bo treated alike.
It is true that in New York it is as lawful to create an
estate for life, with remainder after the death of grantor,
as it is to convey in fee, or with remainder after the death
of a third person, or on the happening of a particular event.
But there is a difference in law as well as in practical effect
between these various estates. Every encouragement is
given to making conveyances in fee. But, from an early
date, public policy has been opposed to the private interest
which impelled men to withdraw property from the channels of trade and tie it u with limitations intended, among
other things, to secure to the beneficiary the use of the
property, while at the same time removing it, to some-extent, from liability for his debts. The favored transfers in
fee need not be taxed with the latter, even though the law
permits their creation. These latter estates also differ
among themselves. Where the grantor makes a transfer
of property to take effect on the death of a third person, it
might, under the ruling in Scholey v. Rew, supra, be taxed
as a devolution or succession. But under such an instrumeftt the grantor does not retain the use and power during

his own lifetime, the remainder does not fall in at his death,
and such conveyances would not be so often resorted to as
a means of evading the inheritance tax. 194 N. Y. 287.
They are not so testamentary in effect as those transfers
wherein the grantor provides that the property shall
go to his children, or other beneficiary, at and after his
death.
The New York statute recognizes this difference. It imposes a tax on transfers by descent, or will, which take
effect at the death of the testator; and then a tax upon
transfers made in contemplation of death. It was but logical to take the next step, and tax transfers intended to
take effect at or after the death of the grantor--even
though that event was not actually impending when the
deed was signed.
There can be no arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination. But when there is a difference it need not be great
or conspicuous in order to warrant classification. In the
present instance, and so far as the Fourteenth Amendment
is concerned, the State could put transfers intended to take
effect at the deatl of the grantor in a class with transfers
by descent, will or gifts in contemplation of the death of
the donor, without, at the same time, taxing transfers intended to take effect on the death of some person other
than the grantor, or on the happening of a certain or contingent.event.
As to the other discriminatory features which, it is alleged, operate to deny the equal protection of the law, it is
sufficient to say that it is now well settled that the State
may impose a graduated tax in this class of cases. Magoun
v. Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283, 298. The
plaintiffs in error being children of the grantor were assessed at the lowest rate. They are, therefore, not in a
position to take advantage of the fact that transfers to collaterals and strangers in blood are, by this act, taxed at a
hizher rate. The entire statute would not be.invalidated

KEENEY v. NEW YORK.
222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

even if that feature should ultimately be held to be discriminatory and void. 194 N. Y. 286.
The real estate and tangible property in Texas were not
within the taxing jurisdiction of the State of New York,
and there was no effort to tax the transfer of that property.
St. Louis v. Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423, 430; Tax on Foreign
Held Bonds, 15 Wall. 301, 319. It is urged that on the
same principle the stocks and bonds could not be taxed because they were in New Jersey in the hands of a trustee
holding title and possession, by virtue of a deed made
three years before the grantor died..
But the statute does not impose a tax on the property,
but on the transfer. The validity of that burden must be
determined by the situation as it existed in 1903, when the
deed was made. At that time the grantor was a resident of
the State of New York. This personal property there had
its situs. She there made a transfer, which was taxable,
regardless of the residence of the trustee or beneficiary.
The fact that the assessment and payment were postponed
until the death of the grantor would be a benefit to the remainderman in the many instances in which values d&
creased. But where the power to tax exists, it is for the
State to fix the rate and to say when and how the amount
shall be ascertained and paid. The fact that the liability
was imposed when the transfer was made in 1903, and that
payment was not required until the death of grantor in
1907, does not present any Federal question.

Affirmed.
