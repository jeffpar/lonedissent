the War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, 464,

paid under the act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448,

464; the actiond being based on the act of June 27, 1902,
c. 1160, ยง 3, 32 Stat. 406, which provides for refunding "so
much of said tax as may have been cdllected on contingent
beneficial interests which shall not have become vested
prior to July first, nineteen hundred and.two.". The petitioner, appellee, was residuary legatee under a will, in
trust to hold the lund 'either as at present invested or
in such securities as to my said trustee may be deemed
safe,' and to pay over the net income to the testator's
niece 'in quarterly payments during all the period of her
natural life.' On June 8, 1900, the appellee made a return
to the collector of internal revenue, stating that the value
of the residuary estate was $120,303.94, and that of a specific legacy of silverware &c. to the niece, $500. -With the
aid of mortuary tables, the rate of interest being assumed
to be four per cent, the clear value of the legacies to the
niece was fixed at $74678.68, and an inheritance tax of
$5600.90 was assessed upon it, which was paid on August 16, 1900. Up to July 1, 1902, the date fixed by the
statute, the petitioner had paid to the niece $17027.59 income from the residue, and had delivered t6 her the specific
legacy valued at $500. The tax on these sums at the rate
of taxation was $1314.59, which, deducted from the whole
tax paid, leaves $4286.31, to recover which this suit is
brought. The appellees had judgment in the Court of
Claims. 45 C. Cls. 362.
The words 'which shall not have become vested,' quoted
above, mean the same.as 'absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment' in a later clause ending the tao on
contingent interests unless so vested before July 1, 1902.
Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S.480, 500. On this ground
it is argued at great length that only-so much of the life
interest of the niece as she had received before the date
mentioned had vested in the sense of the clause. We are
of opinion that this argument cannot be maintained. The
interest of the niece was not a contingent right to income as

it should accrue in her lifetime, it was a vested life estate
in a fund, changing in investment at the discretion of the
trustee, but retaining its equitable identity. Objections
like those that are made to treating a life estate as a present unity in the enjoyment of the life'tenant might be
made to the similar treatment of absolute ownership in
fee. In actual life a fee can be enjoyed only minute by
minute, but, although eternal in theory of law, by the
same theory at every moment it is all and wholly in the
owner's hands. The statute does not invite speculation in
a new nomenclature, or attempt to reach profounder conceptions than those familiar to the law. When it speaks
of interests absolutely vested in possession we presume
that it uses familiar legal expressions in their familiar
legal sense. It deals: in terms with the interest, that is, the
legal unit of right, not with the money received before a
given moment. No better example of such an interest
could be given than a life estate in a fund, the enjoyment
of which actually has begun; none that more clearly and
dbsolutely excludes the qualification 'contingent' in the
sense of the law. Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480,
concerned a life estate in remainder, which, whether the
remainder was technically vested or contingent, Ibid. 501,
502, was not vested in possession or enjoyment. It was
assumed that the tax was payable in a case like this. Ibid.
