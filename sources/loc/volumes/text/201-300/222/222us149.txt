Argument for Petitioner.

GRIGSBY v. RUSSELL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.'
No. 53. Argued November 10, 13, 1911.-Decided December 4, 1911.
A condition in an insurance policy that it shall be void for non-payment
of premiums means only that it shall be voidable at option of the,
company.
The rule of public policy that forbids the taking out of insurance by
one on the life of another in which he has no insurable interest does
not apply to the assignment by tffe insured of a perfectly valid
policy to one not having an insurable interest.:
In this case, held, that the assignment by the insured of a perfectly
valid policy to one not having any insurable interest but who paid
a consideration therefor and afterwards paid the premiums thereon
was valid and the assignee was entitled to the proceeds from the
insurance ompany as against the heirs of the deceased.
A valid policy of insurance is not avoided by a cessation of insurable
interest even as against the insurer unless so provided by the policy
itself. Conn. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 94 U. S. 457; Warnock v.
Davis, 104 U. S. 775, distinguished.
Where there is no rule of law against paying to an assignee who has no
insurable interest in the life of the insured, and the company waives
a clause in the policy requiring proof of interest, the rights of the
assignee are not diminished by such clause as against the insured's
administrator.
Even though a court below might hesitate to decide against language
of this court referring to a debated point, if there has been no direct
decision this court is not precluded by such references whern\the
point is actually before it.
168 Fed. Rep. 577, reversed.

insured, with no idea of assigning it, payable to his "executor, administrator or assigns," can afterwards, in good
faith, and for a valuable consideration, with the knowledge
and assent of the insurer, be sold and assigned to one who
has no insurable interest in the life of the insured; and such
assignee, after he had bought a policy, taking an absolute
assignment thereof, and in good faith, with the knowledge
and consent of the company, pays the subsequent premiums, acquires the right to collect the proceeds of the
policy at maturity.
The conflicting decisions upon this question have given
rise to two general rules, termed respectively by judges and
text-writers: (a) The "prevailing" or "majority" rule,
holding such assignments valid,. and (b) the "minority"
rule holding them void.
This court has not as yet directly decided this question,
but its decisions on similar questions-have been differently
construed in the various circuits. The Eighth Circuit has
endorsed the majority, and the Fifth and Sixth Circuits,
the minority rule. Gordon v. Ware National Bank, 132
Fed. Rep. 444, 450; Alexander v. Lane, 157 Fed. Rep. 1002";
Clark Y. Equitable Life Ass. Soc., 143 Fed. Rep. 176.
There are also conflicting views of other courts and of
text-writers with respect to the trend of the decisions of.
this court: see in Clark v. Allen, 11 R. I. 439, action was
for money had and received by the widow of an insiired

This court-is either already committed to the "majority" rule or else has never taken any definite position
upon the single sharp question presented in the case at
bar. The general weight of authority is that a decided
majority of the state courts uphold such assignments,
Only the States of Kansas, Alabama, Texas and Kentucky now stand clearly and unequivocally on the side of
the "minority" rule. The State of Missouri is doubtful,
the decisions seeming to point both ways, "with possibly
the stronger tendency to the "minority" rule.
On the other hand, England, Canada, Nova Scotia, New

MR.JusTIcE HOLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill of interpleader brought by an insurance
company to determine whether a policy of insurance issued to John C. Burchard, now deceased, upon his life,
shall be paid to his administrators or to an assignee, the
company having turned the amount into court. The material facts are that after he had paid two premiums and a
third was overdue, Burchard, being in want and needing
money for a surgical operation, asked Dr. Grigsby to buy
the policy and sold it to him in consideration of one hundred dollars and Grigsby's undertaking to pay. the premiums due or to become due; and that Grigsby had no
interest in the life of the assured. The Circuit Court of'
Appeals in deference to some intimations of this court held
the assignment valid only to the extent of the money actually given for it and the premiums subsequently paid. 168
Fed. Rep. 577, 94 C. C. A. 61.
Of course the ground suggestdd for denying the validity
of an assignment to a person having no inferest in the life
insured is the public policy that refuses to allow insurance
to be taken out by such persons in the first place. A contract of insurance upon a life in which the insured has no
interest is a pure wager that- gives the insured a sinister
counter interest in having the life come to an end. And

GRIGSBY v. RUSSELL.
222 U. S.

Opinion.of the Court.

although that counter interest always exists, as early was
emphasized for England in the famous case of Wainewright (Janus Weathercock), the chance that in some cases
it may prove a sufficient motive for crime is greatly enhanced if the whole world of the unscrupulous are free to
bet on what life they choose. The very meaning of an insurable interest is *aninterest in having the life continue
and so one that is opposed to crime. And, what perhaps
is more important, the existence of such an interest makes
a roughly selected class of persons who by their general relations with the person whose life is insured are less likely
than criminals at large toattempt to compass his death.
But when the question arises upon an assignment it is
assumed that the objection to the insurance as a wager is
out of the case. In the present instance the policy was
perfectly good. There was a faint suggestion in argument
that it had become void by the failure of Burchard to pay
the third premium ad diem, and that when Grigsby paid he
was making a new contract. But a condition in a policy
that it shall be void if premiums are not paid when due,
means only that it shall be voidable at.the option of the
company. Knickerbocker Life Insurance Company v. Norton, 96 U. S. 234; Oakes v. Manufacturers'Fire & Marine
Ins. Co., 135 Massachusetts, 248. The company waived.
the breach, if there was one, and the original contract with
Burchard remained on foot. No question as to the character of that contract is before us. It has been performed
and the money is in court. But this being so, not only
does the objection to wagers disappear, but also the lrinciple of public policy referred to, at least in its most convinoing form. The danger that might arise from a general
license to all to insure whom they like does not exist. Obviously it is a very different thing from granting such a
general license, to allow the holder of a valid insurance
upon his own life to transfer it to one whom he, the party
most concerned, is not afraid to tru'st. The law has no

universal cynic fear of the temptation opened by a pecuniary benefit accruing upon a death. It shows no prejudice against remainders after life estates, even by the rule
in Shelley's Case.' Indeed, the ground of the objection to
life insurance without interest in the earlier English cases
was not the temptation to murder but the fact that such
wagers came to be regarded as a mischievous kind of gaming. St. 14 George III, c. 48.
On the other hand, life insurance has become in our
days
selfand
one of the best recognized forms of investment
compelled saving. So far as reasonable safety permits, it
is desirable to give to life policies the ordinary characteristics of property. This is recognized by the Bankruptcy Law, § 70, which provides that unless the cash surrender value of a policy like the one before us is secured to
the trustee within thirty days after it has been stated the
policy shall pass to the trustee as assets. Of course the
trustee may have no interest in the bankrupt's life. To
deny the right to sell except to persons having such an interest is to diminish appreciably the value of the contract
in the owner's hands. The collateral difficulty that arose
from regarding life insurance as a contract of indemnity
only, Godsall v. Boldero, 9 East, 72, long has disappeared.
Phenix Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Bailey, 13 Wall. 616. And
cases in which a person having an interest lends himself to
one without any as a cloak to what is in its inception a
wager have no similarity to those where an honest contract
is sold in good faith.
Coming to the. authorities in this court, it is true that
there are intimations in favor of the result come to by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. But the case in which the
strongest of them occur was one of the type just referred
to, the polidy having been taken out for the purpose of
allowing a stranger association to pay the premiums and
receive the greater part of the benefit, and having been
assigned to it at once. Warnock v. Davis, 104 U. S. 775.

GRIGSBY v. RUSSELL.

222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

On the other hand it has been decided that a valid policy
is not avoided by the cessation of the insurable interest,
even as against the insurer, unless so provided by the policy itself. Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 94
U. S. 457. And expressions more or less in favor of the doctrine that we adopt are to be found also in fEtna Life Ins.
Co. v. France, 94 U. S. 561. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Armstrong, 117 U. S. 591. It 'is enough to say that while the
court below might hesitate to decide against the language
of Warnock v. Davis, there has been no decision that precludes us from exercising our own judgment upon this
much debated point. It is at least satisfactory to learn
from the decision below that in Tennessee, where this assignment was made, although there has been much division of opinion, the Supreme Court of that State came to
the conclusion that we adopt, in an unreported case, Lewis
v. Edwards, December 14, 1903. The law in England and
the preponderance of decisions in our state courts are on
the same side.
Some reference was made to a clause in tae policy that
"any claim against the company arising under any assignment of th6 policy shall be subject to proof of interest."
But it rightly was assumed below that if there was no rule
of law to that effect and the company saw fit to pay, the
clause did not diminish the rights of Grigsby as against
the administrators of Burchard's estate.
