OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Argument for Appellees.

222 U. S.

OMAHA & COUNCIL BLUFFS STREET RAILWAY
COMPANY v. INTERSTATE COMMERCE COM.MISSION.
APPEAL FROM THE COMMERCE COURT.
No. 846. Motion for order to maintain the status quo pencing appeal.
Submitted October 30, 1911.-Decided November 6, 1911.
Where this court considers it proper the status quo will be maintained
pending an appeal from the judgment of the Commerde Court sustaining an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission; and the
enforcement of the order in question will be suspended pending the
appeal, on the appellant giving a bond for the amountrnd in the
form prescribed by this court.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. John Lee Webster for the appellants in support of
the motion.
The Attorney General, Mr. Blackburn Esterline and
Mr. Charles W. Needham for the appellees in opposition:
The final decree dismissing the bill dissolved the preliminary injunction. 22 Cyc. 981; 1 Joyce on Injunctions,
§§ 330b, 330c; 10 Ency. P1. and Pr. 1029; Hovey v. MacDonald, 109 U. S. 150, 158, 161; Sweeney v. Handley, 126
Fed. Rep. 97, 99.
When the preliminary injunction has thus been dissolved it cannot -be,revived except by a new exercise of
judicial power, and the appeal from the final decree dismissing'the bill does not affect the dissolution of the in'junction. Knox County v. Harshman,132 U. S. 14; Leonard v. Ozark Land Co., 115 U. S. 465; Hovey v. MacDonald,
109 U. S. 150, 161.
A supersedeas cannot be granted in view of § 2 of the
act creating the Commerce Court, of June 18, 1910, 36
Stat. 542.
The order of the Interstate Commerce Commission will

Per Curiam.

expire in less than three months. If this. court further
suspends, the order of the Commission, the order will expire before any final judgment can possibly be entered
by this court" on the merits, and the appellees will have
avoided complying with-the same while it lasted.
The giving of a bond would avail nothing. The Interstate Commerce Commission and the United States
are the appellees. If the appellees are named as the'
obligees of the boned, such a bond would be ineffective as
to the passengers traveling between Council Bluffs and
Omaha. As the nickels pass into the possession of the
company, it is at once beyond the power of the passengers
ever to prove the payments and recover them back.
PER CURAM: Upon the authority of Revised Statutes,
§ 716; 'Ex parte Milwaukee Railroad Co., 5 Wall. 188;
Leonard v. Ozark Co., 115 U. S.465, 468; In re Classen,
140 U. S.200, 207; In re McKenzie, 180 U. S.536, 549;
United States v. Shipp, 203 U. S.563, 573; and upon full
consideration of. the facts bearing upon the propriety
of the appellants' motion for an order to maintain the
status quo pending.this appeal, it is ordered that the enforcement of the order of the Interstate Commerce-Commission entered November 27, 1909, and drawn in question
in this casei be, and it is, suspended and enjoined during
the pendency of this appeal, upon condition that within
10 days herefrom the appellants execute unto the Interstate. Commerce Commission and file in this cause a good
and sufficient bond in the sum of $10,000, with sureties
to be approved by theI clerk of this court, and conditioned
that the appellants will promptly pay any and all damages which may be suffered by their several passengers
and intended passengers by reason of the granting or
continuance of this order if it is adjudged ultimately
that the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
drawn in question in this case, is. a valid one.
