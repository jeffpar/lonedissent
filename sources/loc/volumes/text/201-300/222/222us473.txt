CUBA .R. R. CO. v. CROSBY.
222 U. S.

Argument for Petitioner.

CUBA RAILROAD COMPANY v. CROSBY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 124.

Argued December 18, 1911.-Decided January 9, 1912.

In dealing with rudimentary contracts, or torts made or committed
abroad, courts may assume a liability to exist if nothing to the
contrary appears, but they cannot asume that the rights and liabilities are fixed and measured in the same manner in foreign countries as they are in this.
With rare exceptions, the liabilities of parties to each other are fixed
by the law of the territorial jurisdiction within which the wrong is
done and the parties are at the time of doing it.
The extension of hospitality of our courts to foreign suitors must not
be made a cover for injustice to defendants of whom they may be
able to lay hold.
There is no general presumption that the law of Cuba as inherited
from Spain and as since modified is the same as the common law.
While as between two common-law countries the common law may be
presumed to be the same in one as in the other, a statute of one
would not be presumed to be the statute of the other.
A trial court of the United States cannot presume that the same obligation rests upon an employer in Cuba as in this country to repair
defects in machinery called to his attention, or in case of failure to
repak to be deprived of the fellow-servants defense. Such a rule of
law, if existent in a foreign jurisdiction, must be proved.

Tim facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Howard Mansfield for petitioner:
The courts of the United States should not take cognizance of an alleged cause of action for a foreign tort

cannot be certainly and definitely ascertained, and where

The last two cases dispose of the dictum inScott v. Lord
Seymour, 1 H. & C., 219, relied on by the,. Circuit Court,
and by the majority of the Circpit Court'of Appeals.
Federal courts will not take' cognizance of a common
tort which arose in a civil law jurisdiction, unless the acts
complained of gave rise to an obligation in the jurisdiction
where the alleged cause of action arose.
There can be no presumption that the common law
extends to Cuba.
In the case of a country not settled by England or English colonists there is no presumption that the common
law prevails there or that rights given by the common
law exist in such country; and our courts must take judicial notice that Cuba was not settled by England or her
colonists, but that it formed part of the Spanish possessions
and that the civil law obtains there, and that that law is
wholly statutory. Davison v. Gibson, 56 Fed. Rep. 443;

There can be no presumption, nor any ruling in the
absence of pleading or proof, that the act alleged gave rise
to a cause of action in the foreign country. Evey v. Mexican Cent. R. R. Co., 81 Fed. Rep. 294; Slater v. Mexican

Where the act complained of happened in a foreign jurisdiction and a right of action is alleged to have arisen

The rule applied by the courts below that the plaintiff
was relieved from the assumption of risk of injury due to
the defective machinery after he had noticed the defect
and received from the superintendent a promise to remedy
the defect, is not applicable, since that rule can properly
be applied only to cases where the servant is necessarily
exposed to the dangers of that particular machinery.

Argument for Respondent.

Mr. Benjamin M. Weinberg, with whom Mr. Edwin L.
Kalish was on the brief, for respondent:
If the law of the State or country in which the injury
occurred is opposed to the public policy of the State or
country in which the action is brought, that law will not
be followed. Scott v. Seymour, 1 H. & C. 219; Morisette

& N. E. Ry. Co., 160 Massachusetts, 571; Whitford v.
Panama R. R. Co., 25 N. Y. 465.
It was immaterial that the plaintiff failed to prove his
right of recovery under the Cuban law, as the court will
presume, until otherwise proven, that the law of the place
where the injury was inflicted, if such injury is predicated on the invasion of a generally known right, is the
same as that prevailing in the trial forum. Jones on

MR. JUSTICE HommEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an action for the loss of a hand through a defect
in machinery, in connection with which the defendant in
error, the plaintiff, was employed. The plaintiff had noticed the defect and reported it, and, according to his testimony, had been promised that it should be repaired or
replaced as soon as they had time, and he had been told to
go on in the meanwhile. The jury was instructed that if
that was what took place the defendant company assumed
the risk for a reasonable time, and, in effect, that if that
time had not expired the plaintiff was entitled to recover.
The jury found for the plaintiff. The accident took
place in Cuba, and no evidence was given as to the Cuban
law, but the judge held that if that law was different
from the lex fori it was for the defendant to allege and
prove it, and that as it had pleaded only the general issue
the verdict must stand. 158 Fed. Rep. 144. The judgment was affirmed by a majority of the Circuit Couft of
Appeals. 170 Fed. Rep. 369. 95 C. C. A. 539.
The court below went on the ground that in the absence
of evidence to the contrary it would "apply the law as it
conceives it to be, according to its idea of right and justice;
or, in other words, according to the law of the forum."
We regard this statement as too broad, and as having been
wrongly applied to this case.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

Opinion of the Court.

222 U. S.

It may be that in dealing with rudimentary contracts or
torts made or committed abroad, such as promises to pay
money for goods or services, or battery of the person or
conversion of goods, courts would assume a liability to exist
if nothing to the contrary appeared. Parrotv. Mexican
CentralRailway Co., 207 Massachusetts, 184. Such matters
are likely to -impose an obligation in all civilized countries.
But when an action is brought upon a cause arising outside of the jurisdiction it always should be borne in'mind
that the duty of the court is not to administer its notion
of justice but to enforce an obligation that has been created
by a different law. Slater v. Mexican National R. R. Co.,
194 U. S. 120, 126. The law of the forum is material only
as setting a limit of pplicy beyond which such obligations
will not be enforced there. With very rare. exceptions the
liabilities of parties to each other are fixed by the law of
the territorial jurisdiction within which the wrong is done
and the parties are at the time of doing it. American
Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 356. See
Bean v. Morris, 221 U. S. 485, 486, 487. That and that
alone is the foundation of their rights.
The language of Mr. Justice Bradley in The Scotland,
105 U. S. 24, with regard to the application of the lex fori
to a case of collision between vessels belonging to different
nations and so subject to no common law, referred to that
class of cases and no others, and was used only in coming
to the conclusion that foreign vessels might take advantage of our Limited Liability Act. See also The Chattahoochee, 173 U. S. 540, 550. Other exceptional cases are
referred to in American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co.,
ubi supra, such as those arising in regions having no law
that civilized countries would recognize as adequate. But
as to causes of action arising in a civilized country the
disregard of the foreign law occasionally indicated by
some English judges before the theory to be applied was
quite worked out must be disregarded in its turn. The

CUBA R. R. CO. v. CROSBY.
222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

principle adopted by the decisions of this court is clear.
See also Dicey, Confl. of Laws, 2d ed., 647 et seq.
We repeat that the only justification for allowing a
party to recover when the cause of action arose in another
civilized jurisdiction is a well founded belief that it was a
cause of action in that place. The right to recover stands
upon that as its necessary foundation. It is part of the
plaintiff's case, and if there is reason for doubt he must
allege and prove it. The extension of the hospitality of our
courts to foreign suitors must not be made a cover for injustice to the defendants of whom they happen to be able
to lay hold.
In the case at bar the court was dealing with the law of
Cuba, a country inheriting the law of Spain and, we may
presume, continuing it with such modifications as later
years may have brought. There is no general presumption that that law is the same as the common law. We
properly may say that we all know the fact to be otherwise. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Rubber Tire Wheel
Co., 164 Fed. Rep. 869. Whatever presumption there
is is purely one of fact, that may be corrected by proof.
Therefore the presumption should be limited to cases in
which it reasonably may be believed to express the fact.
Generally speaking, as between two common law countries,
the common law of one reasonably may be presumed to
be what it is decided to be in the other, in a case tried in
the latter state. But a statute of one would not be presumed to correspond to a statute in the other, and when
we leave common law territory for that where a different
system prevails obviously the limits must be narrower still.
Savage v. O'Neil, 44 N. Y. 298. Crashley v. Press Publishing Co., 179 N. Y. 27, 32, 33. Aslanian v. Dostumian,,
174 Massachusetts, 328, 331.
Even if we should presume that an employ6 could recover in Cuba if injured by machinery left defective
through the negligence of his employer's servants, which

would be going far, that would not be enough. The plaintiff recovered, or, under the instructions stated at the
beginning of this decision, at least may have recovered,
notwithstanding his knowledge and appreciation of the
danger, on the strength of a doctrine the peculiarity and
difficulties of which are elaborately displayed in the treatise of Mr. Labatt. 1 Labatt, Master & Servant, ch. 22,
esp. § 424. To say that a promise to repair or replace
throws the risk on the master until the time for performance has gone by, or that it does away with or leaves to
the jury what otherwise would be negligence as matter of
law is evidence of the great consideration with which workmen are treated here, but cannot be deemed a necessary
incident of all civilized codes. It could not be assumed
without proof that the defendant was subject to such a
rule.
There was some suggestion below that there would be
hardship in requiring the plaintiff to prove his case. But
it should be remembered that parties do not enter into
civil relations in foreign jurisdictions in reliance upon
our courts. They could not complain if our courts refused to meddle with their affairs and remitted them to
the place that established and would enforce their rights.
A discretion is asserted in some cases even when the policy of our law is not opposed to the claim. The Maggie
Hammond, 9 Wall. 435. The only just ground for complaint would be if their rights and liabilities, when enforced by our courts, should be measured by a different
rule from that under which the parties dealt.
Judgment reversed.
