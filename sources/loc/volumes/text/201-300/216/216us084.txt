Argued i.aualry 1I4, 110.-]1)ccihld ,Ianuary 31, 1910.

There is no (luestion as to the comlplete legislative power of he United
States over the land of the \\yandotte ln(dians while it remained

in their occupation, and piarcels ccxcelted from the gencral distribution under the trcaty of 1S55 continued under such legislative
control for the benefit of the trihe.
While the United States maintains and protects Indian use of land
and its occupation against others it is.hbonl itself only by honor
and not hy law, and it will not he lreIui ied to have abandoned at
any time its attitude of protection towards its wards.
Nor is its
good faith brokeni by any, change in disposition of property believed by Congress to be for the welfare of the Indians.
Even if a suit to enjoin di s position of property reserved by the treaty
of 1855 xvith the Wyandottes for cemetery use is not 6 suit against
the United tates, a descendant of an Indian buried in such cemetery
cannot maintain suiih an action to enjoin the disposition of the
reserved property in accordance with an act of Congress.
Ill view of'the .ircumstances of this case it is proper to dismiss the
bill without costs under the provisions of the act of March 3, 1875,
c. 137, § 5.

Appellant shows by the cases cited that this case is not one
against the United States; that the act of Congress involved
interferes with her vested rights to her irrel)arable injury without due process of law arid is not a proper exercise of legislative power under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution;-that Congress cannot interfere with vested rights under
treaties and has no power to nullify titles confirmed many
years before by the Government's authorized agents and that
charitable uses are protected by. the courts as required by
equity and good conscience, and the court has jurisdiction to
and should award the relief prayed for.
The Solicitor General and Mr. Barton Corneau for appellees,
submitted:
The lower court was without jurisdiction as $2,000 was not
involved and the act of February 6, 1901, 31 Stat. 760, authorizing suits by Indian allottees does not apply-and furthermore the suit is one really against the United States. Naganab
v. Hitchcock, 202 U. S. 473; Oregon v. Hitchcock, 202 U. S. 60;
Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S.373; Louisiana v. Garfield,

It was not the purpose of the Treaty of 1855 in 'reserving
this land as a public burying ground to create in appellant, or
other members ,of the former Wyandotte Tribe individual
rights, legal or equitable, in the land. The United States took
the land free at any rate from more than a mere moral obligation, which the act of June 21, 1906, amply meets. Fleming v.

the course of such administration to alter the use or application of the Indian tribal property, during the continuance of
the tribal existence. It is not to be supposed that the Treaty
of 1855, in making the cemetery reservation, contemplated a
surrender of this power of the United States over the land after
the tribe had been dissolved. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187
U.S. 553.
The Wyandotte tribal authorities undoubtedly had power
to terminate the usc of this burial ground at its pleasure. By
the cession the United States would have acquired like power,
even if it had not possessed it already.
MR.JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a bill in equity to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior
and Commissioners appointed by him from selling or disturbing an Indian cemetery. The bill was demurred to on the
grounds, among others, that the matter in dispute was not
alleged to exceed the value of two thousand dollars, and that
the suit was a suit against the United States. The bill was
dismissed for wanvt of jurisdiction and an appeal was taken to
this court.
The substance of the bill is as follows: The plaintiff is a
citizen of the State of Kansas and of the United States and a
descendant of Wyandotte Indians dealt with in the Treaty of
January 31, 1855. 10 Stat. 1159. *By Article 1 of that treaty
the tribe of the Wyandottes was to be dissolved on the ratification of the treaty and the members made citizens 'of the
United States, with exemption for a limited time of such as
should apply for it. By Article 2 the Wyandotte Nation ceded
their land to the United States for subdivision in severalty to
the members, "except as follows, viz., The portion now enclosed and used as a public burying ground, shall be permanently reserved and appropriated for that purpose;" &c. The
plaintiff's parents and sister are bulried in this ground, and she
alleges that shQ "has scizin, and a legal estate and vested

216 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

rights in and to" the same', and that although the land is
worth $75,000, there is no standard by which to estimate the
value of her rights. (It is set forth further that by a treaty of
February 23, 1867, with the Senecas and others, Art. 13, 15
Stat. 513, 516, a portion of the Wyandottes were allowed to
begin anew a tribal existence; but the bearing of this treaty
upon the case does not appear.) The defendants are intending
and threatening to remove the remains of persons buried as
above to another designated place and to sell the burying
ground; the proceeds after certain deductions to be paid to
parties to the Treaty of 1855, or their representatives, in accordance with the Act of Congress of June 21, 1906, c. 3504.
34 Stat. 325, 348. This act is alleged to violate the constitutional rights of the plaintiff and to be void.
The record shows that the court, left it open to the plaintiff,
to amend so as to avoid any technical objection that could be
avoided by amendment, and as she conducted her own case, we
go as far as we can in leaving such considerations on one side.
For every reason we have examined the facts with anxiety to
give full weight to any ar'gument by which the plaintiff's pious
wishes might be carried out. But if it is obvious that the bill
could not be amended so as to state a case within the jurisdiction of the court, the judgment must be affirmed or the appeal
dismissed, as the defectof jurisdiction turns out to be peculiar
to courts of the United States as such, or one common to all
courts.
The allegation of the plaintiff's interest plainly does not
mean that she has taken possession of the whole burying
ground and has acquired a seizin of the whole by wrong. As it
does not mean that, it must mean simply a statement of the
rights that the plaintiff conceives to have been conferred by
the Treaty of 1855 upon those whom she represents.

The

argument that vested rights were conferred upon individuals
by that treaty, stated as strongly as we can state.it, would be
that, as the tribe was to be dissolved by the treaty, it cannot
have been the beneficiary of the agr enient for the permanent

OCTOBER TEtRM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

216 U. S.

appropriation of the land in question as a public burying
ground, that the language used imported a serious undertaking, and that to give it force as such the Tnited States must be
taken to have declared a trust. If a trust, was declared, the
benefit by it must have been limited to the members of the
disintegrated tribe and their representatives, whether as individuals or as a limited public, and thus it might be possible
to work out a right of property in the plaintiff, as a first step
towards maintaining her bill.
But we do not pursue the attempt to state the argument on
that side because we are of opinion that it is plainly impossible
for the plaintiff to prevail. There is no question as to the complete legislativ power of the United States over the land of the
Wyandottes while it remained in their occupation before their
quitclaim to the United States. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187'
U. S. 553, 565. When they made that grant they excepted this
parcel. Therefore it remained, as the whole of the land had
been before, in the ownership of the United States, subject to
the recognized use of the Wyandottes. But the right of the
Wyandottes was in them only as a tribe or nation. The right
excepted was at right of the tribe. The United States maintained and protected the Indian use or occupation against
others, but was bound itself only by honor, not by law. This
mode of statement sounds technical perhaps, but the principles
concerned are not so. The Government cannot be supposed
to have abandoned merely for a moment and for a secondary
matter its general attitude toward the Indians as wards over
whom and whose property it retained unusual powers, so long
as they remained set apart from the body of the people. The
very Treaty of 1867, cited in the bill, providing for the resumption of the tribal mode of life by the Wyandottes, shows that
the United States assumed still to possess such unusual powers.
It seems to us that the reasonable interpretation of the language as to the burying ground is not that the United States
declares itself subject to a trust which no court could enforce
against it, if against any one, (see Naganab v. Hitchcock, 202

CONLEY v. BALLINGER.
216 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

U. S. 473; Oregon v. Hitchcock, 202 U. S. 60,) while on the other
hand it stripped itself of anly protecting power that otherwise
it might have rdtained. It seems to us more reasonable to suppose that the words 'shall be purmanantly reserved and appropriated for that purpose,' like the rest of the treaty, were
addressed only to the tribe and rested for their fulfilment on
the good faith of the United States-a good faith that would
not be broken by a change belioved by Congress to be for the
welfare of the Indians.
Ve are driven to the conclusion that even if the suit is not
to be regarded as a suit against the United States within the
authority of the cases cited, 202 U. S. 60 and 473, the United
States retained the same power that it would have had if the
Wyandotte Tribe had continued in existence after the treaty
of 1855, that the only rights in and over the cemetery were
tribal rights, and that the plaintiff cannot establish a legal
or equitable title of the value of $2,000, or indeed any right to
have the cemetery remain undisturbed by the United States.
We are of opinion- that in view of the circumstances it is
just that the bill should be dismissed without costs. Act of
March 3, 1875, c. 137, § 5, 18 Stat. 472.
Decree reversed. Bill dismissed without costs.
