Syllabus.

minerals a mining claim to it will be located, only the owners,
of which can cut the timber, whereas the- statute gives the
right to all residents. If that were true, courts still would be
bound by the explicit and unmistakable words. It is not unknown, when opinion is divided, that qualifications sometimes are inserted into an act that are hoped to make it ineffective. - But the obj~ction is stated too strongly. As
pointed out at the argument, in 1878 probably there was a
great deal of mineral-land still unexplored .on which claims
had not been located, not to speak of mere exceptional cases
in which. the act would apply. The regulations of the Secretary of the Interior for a long time, and it would seem
always, have been in accord with our dpinion and -the laInguage of the act.

SAXLEHNER v. WAGNER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 81.

Argued January 17, 1910.-Decidcd February 21, 1910.

The right to individual appropriation once lost is gone forever.
Where a geographic or family name becomes the name for a natural
water coming from a more dr less extensive district, all are free to
try to imitate it, and the owners of one of such natural springs

cannot prevent the sale of an artificial water as being similar to that
of the natural spring, where there is no attempt to deceive the
public as to its l6eing artificial.
Hunyadi is now in effect a geographical expression and the owners of
the Hunyadi Janos Springs cannot prevent the sale .of artificial

Hunyadi water where there is no deception of the public as to its
being an imitation.
157 Fed. R4. 745, affirmed.

Argument, for Petitioner.

216 U. S.

THE facts, which involve the right of the owners of thc
Huinyadi .*anos Springs to enjoin the sale of artificial Hunyadi
water, are stated in the ol)inion.
Mr. Antonio Knauth and Mr. John G. Johnson for petilioner:
Petitioner has always been solicitous in suppressing the
use of the Hunyadi name on any artificial products. See
Hunyadi Case, 179 U. S. 19; Flower Mills Co. v: Eagle, 86
Fed. Rep. (i08; Thackeray v. Saxlehner, 125 Fed. Rep. 911.
Appellees' manfactured product is not artificial Hunyadi
water. See work of Count Maillard de Marafy, cited in.
Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Co., 163 U. S. 169, 199.
Appellees' labels iand advertisements are untruthful and
designed to reap the benefits of complainant's reputation; if
the word Hunyadi shall be allowed to the defendants, the door
will be opened to wholesale fraud.
The name of a spring and the water bottled therefrom is
protected, according to principles applied to trade-marks in
general. Congress Spring Co. v. High Rock Congress Spring
Co., '45 N. Y. 291; Apollinaris Co. v. Scherer, 27 Fed. Rep.

Northcutt v. Turney (Ky.), 41 S. W. Rep. 21; Hunyadi Cases,
179 U. S. 19.
Such names, as can be properly called geographical names,
cIan only be legally used by thoge whose products come from
the geographical region in question.

essential to the maintenance of any suit to enjoin the misuse
of these terms or symbols. An interest in the good-will of
the business or any other property threatened by such misuse
is sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to an injunction. Cohen

Rep. 821, 832; Manitowoc v. Win. Numsen; 93 Fed. Rep. 196.
It is no defense that the full name "Hunyadi Janos" was
dropped from the defendants' labels before the bringing of
the suit. Saxlehner v. Eisner, 147 F4d. Rep. 189; India
Ruber Co. v. Rub'berComb Co., 45 N. Y. Super. Ct. 258; Low
v. Hart, 90 N. Y. 457; Plant Co. v. May Mercantile Co., 153
Fed. Rep. 229; Hutchinson v. Blumberg, 51, Fed. Rep. 829..
Even if appellees may use th-e- word ",Hunyadi" with proper
correctives 'and explanatives, sufficient care has not been
taken to distinguish. "Hunyadi"is emphasized. "Wagner"
and "Artificial". are inconspicuous on the label and in advertising.
3oth are omitted in the price list. The distinctions
are insufficient. Fuller v. jIuff, 104 Fed. Rep. 141; Hansen
v. Siegel Cooper Co., 106 Fed'. Rep. 691, 692;.Menendez v.
Holt. 128 U. S. 51.4, 521;Shaver v. Heller, 108 Fed. Rep. 821,
833; Carlsbad v. Schultz, 78 Fed. Rep. 469; Baker v. Slack, 130
Fed. Rep. 514.
That others have infringed is no defense. Singer Mfg.
Co. 'v. June Mfig. Co., 163 U. S. 169; Taylor v. Carpenter, 3
Story, 458; and see 2 Wood & M. 21.
,The fact, even if proven, that the artificial product of
appellees is better than the genuine natural water is no
justification for calling it spurious "Hunyadi."
The public,
is entitled to the very thing it expects and cannot, De deceived
even for its own benefit. Singer Co. v. Loog, 8 App. Cas. 29;
Coats v, Holbrook,' 2 Sand. Chan. 586; Pillsbury v. Pillsbury

v. Illinois Watch Co., 179 U. S. 665, do not militate against
this rule, nor is the law established in this country different
fiom that applied in England on this point.
Mr. Walter F. Murray for respondents:
This court in the case of Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson
Co., 179 U. S. 19, 38, decided that the complainant has lost
her title to the word "Hunyadi" as a trade-mark. Menendez

Where thp alleged infringers of a trade-mark have been
using it under a show of right, or in the absence of fraud,
neglect of the owner of the right to pursue the infringers,
if continued for a long period of tirpe will cause the mark to
become public property. This will be the case, especially
where the infringers are numerous. -Virginia Hot Springs v.

Deception of the public,, as to the ingredients of an article
of merchandise, is not unfair competition in trade, and is not
actionable af the suit of a private individual or group of such
individuals, in the absence of legislation. American Washboard Co. v. Saginaw Mfg. Co., 103 Fed. Rep. 281; New York

Defendants have not deceived the public about the ingredients of their artificiai "Hunyadi."
Defendants have insisted, before the public in all their
literature and advertisements, that artificial mineral waters
are better than the natural mineral waters,

respondents make a bitter water in Cincinnati and label it
"W. T. Wagner's Sons Carbonated Artificial Hunyadi Conforming to Fresenius Analysis of Hunyadi Janos Springs."
Formerly they for a time labeled it "W. T. Wagner's Sons
Artificial Hunyadi Janos.
Ofen Bitter Water. Highly
Aerated," but this label had been given up before the bill
was l rought. The petitioner seeks an injunction against the
use of either 'Hunyadi Janos' or 'Hunyadi' on any water
not coming from hei- wells. The Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit in a more or less similar case granted an
injunction against the use of the word Hunyadi. Thackeray
v. Saxtehner, 125 Fed. Rep. 911; S. C., 60 C. C. A. 562. . In the
present suit the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals, treating the right of the petitioners to' Hunyadi Janos'
as admitted, refused an injunction against the use of 'Hunyadi,' and finding that no unfair competition was shown'
dismissed the bill. 157 Fed. Rep 745; S. C., 85 C. C. A. 321..
A writ of certiorari was allowed by this court.
We see no reason for disturbing the finding of -the courts
below that there was no unfair competition and no fraud,
The real intent of the plaintiff's bill, 'it seems to us, is to extend
the monopoly of such trade-mark or trade name as she may
hiave to a monopoly of her type of bitter water, by preventing
manufacturers from telling the public in a way that will be
understood what they are copying and trying to sell. But
the plaintiff has no'patent for the water,'and the defendants
have , right to reproduce it as nearly as they can. They
have a right to tell the public what they are doing and to get
whatever share they can in the popularity of the water by
advertising that they are trying to make the same article
.and think 'that they succeed. If they donot convey, but, on
the, ontrary, exclude the notion that they are selling the
plaintiff's goods, it is a strong proposition that when the
article has a well-kiown name they have not the right to
explain by that name what they imitate. By doing so they
are not, trying to get the good will of the name, but the good

will of the goods. See Floq Manaufac/urinr Co. v. Holutra,
1.78 Massachusetts, 83, 91; Chadwick v. Covell, 1.51 Massachusetts, 190, 191. Although 'the application is different,
the principle seems to be similar to the rule that when It
patent has -expired descriptive words or even an arbitrary
or personal name by which it has become known may be used
if suffiCient precautions are taken to preveht the public from
being deceived. See Singer Manufactaring Co. ,v.June
Manufacturing Co., 163 U. S.169.
The plaintiff says that no one can succeed in imitating a
natural water. But all are free to try. In the absence of
some fraud injurionis to the plaintiff, it Wiould be going far
under any circumstances to allow her to prevent advertising
"Artificial Hunyadi." But it is enough to say that. under
the decision in Saxlehner v,. Eisner & Mendelson Co., 179
U-.S. 19, 36, the defendants may do so in this case. In that
decision it was said that 'Hunyadi,' as applied to similar
water, had been public property in Hungary, and therefore
had become so here, and that a later change there would not
work a .corresponding change in the United States. 'The
right to individual appropriation once lost is gone forever.,
See also French Republic v. Saratoga Vichy Co., 191 U. S.
427, 437. At the Very least the family name has become the
name for any natural water of a certain type coming from'a
more or less extensive district, if not from anywhere in
Hungary. It does not belong to the plaintiff alone in this
country, even if she is the only one now sending the water
here. But if there is any well-founded doubt as to.the right
to use a personal trade name with proper guards against
deception to signify what one is imitating where one has the
right. to imitate, there can be none that one is at liberty to
refer to a geographical expression to signify the source of
one's model.. 'Ijunyadi' at best is now only -a geographical
expression in effect.
Decree affirmed.
