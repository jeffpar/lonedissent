LAUREL HILL CEMETERY v. CITY AND COUNTY
OF SAN FRANCISCO.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 100.

Argued January 21, 24, 1910.-ecided Fcbruary 21, 1910.

Great csution must be exercised by any tribunal in overruling, or
allowing to be overruled, the decision of the local adthorities on
questions involving the health of the neighborhood; and this court
is doubly reluctant to interfere with deliberate decisions df the
-highest court of a State confirming a specific determination on such
i question previously reached by the body Taking the law.
Where opinion is divided as to whether a practice prohibited by a
police ordinance is dangerous, and if the ordinance be valid if the
danger he real, this court will not overthrow^ the ordinance- as an
unconstitutional deprivation of property vithout due -process of
law or a denial of equal protection of the law merely 'because of
adherence to the other belief. Jaeobsan v':Massachusetts, 'i97

U. S. Ii.
One not belonging to a-class, cannot. raise the question of constitutionality of'a statute as it .affects that class.
Tradition and habits of the community count for more than logic in
determining constitutionality of laws enacted for the public welfare
under the police power.
An ordinance prohibiting burial of the dead within the limits of a
populous city based on a determination of the city authorities that,
the practice is dangerous to life and detrimental to publichealth,
and which has been sustained by-the highest court of the State, will
not be overthrown by this court-as an unconstitutional exertion of
the police power of the State; and so held as to such an ordinance
of San Francisco, California.
152 California, 464, affirmed.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Thoma.s E. Haven for plaintiff in error:
Th(! ordinance is invalid because it goes. beyond' the necessities of the case.
The deterrnination by legislative ,bodies as to the necessity
of the exercise of the police power is hot final nor conclusive,

conduct of the same, rather than to any inherent danger resulting from burials when properly conducted.

The police. power vested in the Board of Supervisors of

Whenever threatened danger can be removed by restrictions, or regulations, without entire prohibition, the latter

The court should not declare the act unconstitutional be-.
cause a statute ordains a complete prohibition of the act or
thing legislated against instead of a regulation thereof. Powell v..Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678.
The judiciary cannot declare the act unconstitutional merely
because it prohibits harmless things and harmless acts as well
as harmful things and harmful acts. Booth' v. Illinois, 184
U. S. 425.
The court will not declare an ordinance unconstitutional
merely because the court itself knows or feels that the legislative conclusion as expressed in the enactmen*t is incorrect,
when as a matter of fact, the legislative conclusion is supported
by public opinion, commonly held belief, or scientific authority. Austin v. Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343.
The prohibition in this case is a prohibition of burials; it is
not a direct confiscation of cemeteries. In so far as it may
act as a deprivation of the property of plaintiff, it does so
incidentally only; as to the danger of cemeteries and for upholding prohibition of burials in cities and settled neighborhoods, see Carpenterv. Yeadon, 158 Fed. Rep. 766 . Odd Fellows' Cemetery Assn. v. San Francisco, 140 California, 226.

LAUREL HILL CEMETERY v. SAN FRANCISCO. 363
216 II. S.
MR.

Opinion of the Court.

JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action to restrain the City and .County of San
Francisco and its officers from enforcing an ordinance forbidding the burial of the dead within the City and County
limits. The allegations of the complaint are lengthy, but the
material facts set forth are as follows: 'The plaintiff was incorporated in 1867 as a rural cemetery under a geieral act.
The land in question had been dedicated as a burying ground,
being at that time outside the city limits and a mile or two
away from dwellings -and,business. It was conveyed to the
plaintiff, and later a grant of the same was obtained from the
city in consideration of $24,139.79, which sum the city retains.
The land has been used as a cemetery ever since; forty thousand lots have been sold and over two million dollars have
been spent by the lot owners and other large sums by the
plaintiff in preparing and embellishing the grounds. By the
terms of the above-mentioned general statute the lots, after
a burial in them, arc inalienable and descend to the heirs of
the owner, and the plaintiff is bound to apply the proceeds
of sales to the improvement, embellishment and )reservation
of the grounds. There is land still unsold estimated to be
worth $75,000. There now are many dwellings near the
cemetery, but it is alleged to be in no way injurious to health,
or offensive, or otherwise an interference with the enjoymient
of property or life. There also is an allegation that there air(,
within the city large tracts, some of them vacant and some
of them containing several hundred acres, in several of which
interments could be made more than a mile distant from any
inhabitants or highway. The odinance in question begins
with a recital that "the burial of the dead. within the City
and County of San Francisco is dangerous to life and detrimental to the. pubjic health," and goes on to forbid such burial
tnder a penalty of fine, imprisonment, or both. The complaint sets up that it violates Article I, § 8, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

'216 U.'S.

The answer denied some of the above statements on the
ground of. ignorance, and categorically denied the averment
as to the large vacant tracts available for burying within the
city. The defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings,
the notice showing the ground to be that the complaint did
not state a cause of action, but going on to say that the
motion would be made upon 11the papers on file. The
motion was granted and an exception to the judgment was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 152 California,
464. As the state court and. the arguments before us assumed
the material allegations of the complaint to be true, we shall
assume that the judgment was ordered upon the complaint
without regard to the denials in'the answer, although 'it was
then on file.
The' only question that needs to be answered, if not the
only one before Us, iswhether the plaintiff's property is taken
contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. In considering it,
the allegation as to the large tracts available for burying purposes may be laid on one-side. The plaintiff has no grievance
with regard to' them. The Winnebago, 205 U. S.354, 360.
Moreover, it is said by the Supreme Court of the State that
burial within the San Francisco City or County limits already
was forbidden by statute, except in existing cemeteries or
such. as might be' established by the Board of Supervisors.
The Board of Supervisors passed the ordinance now complained of; so that, as pointed out by the court, the ordinance
in effect • merely prohibited burials in existing cemeteries.
It was, therefore, a specific 'determination .bythe lawmaking
authority as to the relation of' those cemeteries to their
respective neighborhoods, and the question is whether the
court can say that it was wrong.
To aid its contention and in support of the averment that
its cemetery, although no- bordered by'many dwellings, is
in no way harmful, the plaintiff refers to opinions of' scientific
men who have inainttained that the piopular belief is a superstition. Of these we are asked, by implication, to take judicial

notice, to adopt them, and on the strength of our acceptance
to declare the foundation of the ordinance a mistake ald the
ordinance void It may be, in a matter of this kind, where
the finding of fact is merely a premise to laying down a rule
of law, thilt this court has power to form its own judgment,
without the aid of a jury. Prentis v. Atlaitic Coast Line, 211
U. S. 210, 227. But whatever the tribunal, in questions of
this kind, great' caution must be used in overruling thq

decision of the local .authorities, or in allowing it to be overruled. No doubt this court has gone a certain distance in
that direction. Dobbins v. Lo.s Angeles, 1 95 U. S. 222.. Lochner
v. New York, 198 L7. S. 45, 58 et scq.

But it

hns exl)ress(d

through the mouth of the same judge who delivered the
judgmeint in the case last cited the great reluctance that it
feels to interfere with the deliberate deeisions ,of the highest
court of the State whose people are directly, concerned.
Welch v. Swosey, 214 1'. S. 91, 1.06. The reluctance must be
redoubled when as here the opinion of that court confirns a
.spccific determiAtion concerning the same spot previously
reached by the body that made the. law. See French v.
BIarlicr Asphalt Pavig Co., 18,1 U. S. 324, 341; Smith v.
Jlorceei:, 182 Massachusetts 232, 2:34, 235.
But the prolriety of deferring a good deal to the tribunals
oi the spot is not the only ground for caution. If every
unemnber of this Bench clearly aigreed 'that burying grlunds
vere centers of safety and thought the Board 'f"Suil)'rvis ors
and lhe Sulreme Court of California w'olly wrong, it would
not, displose of the caie. There are other tiings .to he con-,
sidereal. Opinion sill may be divided, anl if, on the hyI othesis tha-t the danger is .rcal, the ordinance would be valid,
e should not overt hrow it merely because of our adherence
to the other belief. Simila arguments were pressed up1on

Opinion of the Court.

216 U. S.

Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S. 606, 608, 609. Again there may
have been other grounds fortifying the ordinance besides those
recited in the preamble. And yet again the extent to which
legislation may modify and restrict the uses of property consistently with the Constitution is not a question for pure
abstract theory alone. Tradition and the habits of the coininunity count for more than logic. Since, as before the makig of constitutions, 'regulation of burial and prohibition of
it in certain spots, especially in crowded cities, have been
familiar to the Western World. This is shown sufficiently,
hy the cases cited by the court below; e. g. Coates v. New
York, 7 Cow. 585. Kincaid's Appeal, ,66 Pa. St. 411. Sohier
v. Trinity Church, 109 Massachusetts, 1, 21. Carpenter v.
Yeadon, 158 Fed. Rep. 766; S. C., 86 C. C. A. 122. The
plaintiff must wait until there is a change of practice or at
least an established consensus of civilized opinion before it
can expect this court to overthrow the rules that the lawmakers and the court of his own State uphold.
Judgment affirmed.
