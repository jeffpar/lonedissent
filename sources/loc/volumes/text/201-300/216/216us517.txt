BOARD OF ASSESSORS OF THE PARISH OF ORLEANS, THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS, v. NEW
YORK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

No. 112.

Argued January 27, 1910.-Decided February 28, 1910.

Where a policy-holder simply withdraws a portion of the reserve on
his policy for which the life insurance company is bound, and there
is no personal liability, it is not a loan or credit on which the company can he taxed as such, and this is not affected by the fact that
the policy-holder gives a note on which interest is necessarily
charged to adjust the account.
To tax such accounts as credits in a State where the company hag
made the advances would be to deprive the company of its property without due process of law. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
New Orleans, 205 U. S. 395, distinguished.
Even if a State can tax a bank deposit that is created only to leave
the State at once, a statute purporting to levy a tax upon all property within the State should not be construed, in the absence of
express terms or a direct decision to that effect by the state court,
as intending to include such a deposit; and so held as to the statute
of Louisiana involved in this case.
158 Fed. Rep. 462, affirmed.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.

to which the terms of the act apply. The case is on all fours
with Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, 205 U. S. 395;
although complainant seeks to make a subtle distinction.
The term "loan" has not been applied to these transactions
by the taxing power, but by complainant itself. It calls them
loans. As to what are loans, see Freeman v. Brittin, 17 N. J.
Law (2 How.), 231; Omaha Bank v. Mutual Benefit Co., 81
Fed. Rep. 938; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Curry, 61 L. R. A.

Thesaurus Die. of Eng. Language, p. 619; Standard Dictionary, verbo, "Interest," third definition; Bouvier's Law Dict.
verbo "Loan"; also see 7 Pet. 107.
In this case money is, delivered from the company to the
assured; there is an obligation to return this money in one of
two ways; and interest is paid.
The payment is to be made in either cash or by forfeiture of
the policy. As to the taxability of these loans see Alabama
Gold Life Ins. Co. v. Lott, 54 Alabama, 499, 505. These transactiofis are loans, and, as such, taxable. Whether it is good
governmental policy to tax them is a question for the legislature, and not for the courts. See Travelers' Ins. Co. v. Assessors, 47 So. Rep. 439.
The construction of a state statute by the Supreme Court
of that State is binding upon this court to the extent of the
precise question decided, but. not further. Southern R. Co. v.
Simpson, 131 Fed. Rep. 705, and 16 How. 275; 85 Fed. Rep.
180, 123 Fed. Rep. 480; but obiter dicta of the state court as to
facts .in a case which was never brought before it, and the
record of which its members never saw, are entitled to no
weight.

"Cash on halnd and in bank" belonging to complainant is,
under the Travelers' case, supra, taxable by the statute, and
no Federal constitutional provision interferes therewith.
The legislature has the.pow'er to tax these loans. The company can be sued in Louisiana. Service upon its agent in
Louisiana is as effective as upon its president in New York.

being in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment and

d(elivered the opinion of the court.
This is a bill in equity to restrain the collection of a tax
from tile plaintiff, the appellee, on the ground that the tax
is coot r.rv ti tihe Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiff had
a1 dTc,
'111(t tie (defenldalits appealed to this court. 158

plhliritiff '(1r

as the ;cIi

discretion to receive a sum not exceeding that present value,
on the terms that on the settlement of any claim under the
policy the sum so received shall be deducted with interest, (the
interest representing what it is estimated that the sum.would
have earned if retained by the plaintiff); and that on failure
to pay any premium or the above-mentioned interest the sum
received shall be deducted from the reserve value at once.
This is called a loan. It is represented by what is called a
note, which contains a promise to pay the money. But as
the plaintiff never advances more than it already is absolutely
bound for under the policy, it has no interest in creating a
personal liability, and therefore the contract on the face of
the note goes on to provide that if the note is not paid when
due it shall be extinguished automatically by the counter
credit for what we have called the reserve value of the policy.
In short, the dlaim of the policy-holder on the one, side and
of the company on the other are brought into an account
current by the very act that creates the latter. The so-called
liability of the policy-holder never exists as a personal liability, it never is a debt, but is merely a deduction in account
from the sum that the plaintiffs ultimately must pay. In
settling that account interest will be computed on the item
for the rason that we have mentioned, but the item never
could be sued for, any more than any other single item of a
mutual account that always shows a balance against the
would-be plaintiff. In form it subsists as an item until the
settlement, because interest must be charged on it. In substance it is extinct from the beginning, because, as was said
by the judge below, it is a payment, not a loan. A collateral
illustration of the principle will be found in Starratt v. Mullen,
148 Massachusetts, 570, and cases there cited.
Instead of receiving an advance the policy-holder may
draw upon the reserve value for a premium due, again giving
a note, but the transaction is similar in legal characteristics
to that which we have described. It is unnecessary to set out
the documents at length, because, although the same language

is not used in all, there is no nice question of construction,
no doubt possible as to the effect and import of the contracts.
In none of the cases is there a loan and therefore there are no
credits to be taxed. In Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. New
Orleans, 205 U. S. 395, so far as appeared, the Insurance
Company made loans, properly so called, to its policy-holders,
and the question now before the court was not raised or
discussed.
What we have said disposes of the item of $568,900. The
other consists of a bank account of $50,700, kept separate
from a small account for current expenses, admitted to be
taxable. The account in question consists of deposits made
,solely for transmission to New York and not used or drawn
against by any one in Louisiana. We shall not inquire
whether it would or would not be within the constitutional
possibilities for a State to tax a person outside its jurisdiction
for a bank deposit that only became his or came into existence
as )roperty at the moment of beginning a transit to him,
and that thereafter left the State forthwith. It isenough
to say we should not readily believe that the Supreme Court
ol the State wot(l interpret the statutes of Louisiana as haying ilhat intent. See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Newark,
62 N. J. Law, 74. The Louisiana cases cited as contrary and
as showing the purpose of the legislature to reach such a
d e posit as this do not seem to us to sustain the appellants'
