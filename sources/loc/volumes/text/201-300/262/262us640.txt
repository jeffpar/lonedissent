CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

Nos. 574, 467.

Motion to modify decrees submitted May 21, 1923.

Denied June 4, 1923.-Opinion rendered June 11, 1923.
Where lower federal courts have entertained suits of which they had
no jurisdiction, as federal courts, and appointed receivers, the
jurisdiction of this Court, on appeal, is to correct their errors in
assuming jurisdiction and granting relief; it has no jurisdiction,
in ordering the suits dismissed, to allow compensation, expenses and
counsel fees to the receivers, or to direct a party to take proceedings in a state court having jurisdiction of the property in question,
for the purpose of protecting creditors who filed their claims in the
federal court. P. 641.
Motion denied.

Opinion of the Court.

Levin, the receivers appointed by the federal court for
Minnesota, applied for modification of the decrees. They
ask approval of the disbursements for expenses of the
receivership paid by them out of monies realized from
assets of the Lion Bonding & Surety Company. They ask
approval of charges made by counsel employed in certain ancillary proceedings which these counsel propose
to deduct from funds collected in another district. They
ask that payment be directed of other additional expenses
incurred in connection with the original receivership and
the ancillary receiverships, aggregating $3,384.55. They
also ask that they and their general counsel be paid compensation for services rendered during the two years
which have elapsed since their appointment as receivers.
The amounts involved in these several requests aggregate
nearly $30,000. There are still some assets of the corporation within the District of Minnesota and in two
other districts in which Hertz and Levin were appointed
ancillary receivers. The aggregate value of these assets
appears to be less than the aggregate amount now
claimed. The receivers pray for a general direction that
payment be made out of funds of the insolvent estate
now being administered by the state court.
The receivers also call attention to the fact that the
time allowed creditors for filing claims under the decree
of the Nebraska court elapsed May 1, 1922; that many
creditors filed their claims only in the federal court; that
these claims will be barred from sharing in the distribution to be made, unless an order is entered allowing such
claims to be filed in the state court; and they ask that
this Court direct the Department of Trade and Commerce
of Nebraska to take such proceedings in the state court
as may be necessary to secure to such creditors the right
to share in the assets of the corporation.
This Court is without power to grant any part of the
relief sought. The District Court was without jurisdic51826"-23--41

tion as a federal court to appoint receivers in, or otherwise to entertain, the Karatz suit. For this reason, among
others, the Hertz suit, a dependent bill, was dismissed.
As the lower federal courts lacked jurisdiction, they are
necessarily without power to make any charge upon,
or disposition of, the assets within their respective districts.' Even where the court which appoints a receiver
had jurisdiction at the time, but loses it, as upon supervening bankruptcy, the first court cannot thereafter make
an allowance for his expenses and compensation. He
must apply to the bankruptcy court.2 Where a case is
dismissed for want of jurisdiction as a federal court, there
is not even power to award costs against the defeated
party.' The case at bar is unlike Palmer v. Texas, 212
U. S. 118, 132, upon which the receivers rely. In that
case the costs and expenses of a receiver erroneously appointed by the federal court were directed to be paid out
of funds realized in that court. There the Circuit Court
had jurisdiction as a federal court; but the decree appointing the receiver was reversed, because it was erroneous.

Statement of the Case.

Obviously, this Court has no power to direct the Department of Trade and Commerce of Nebraska to apply
to the state court for the order allowing creditors to prove
their claims in that court. Our jurisdiction is limited in
this proceeding to the correction of the errors committed
by the lower federal courts in taking jurisdiction and in
granting relief. The only course open to the creditors,
as to the receivers and their counsel, is to apply to the
state court.
Motion denied.

AMERICAN BANK & TRUST COMPANY ET AL.
v. -FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ATLANTA
ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIF H CIRCUIT.

No. 717. Argued April 30, May 1, 1923.-Decided June 11, 1923.
1. It is within the statutory powers of a federal reserve bank to
collect checks on state banks within its district, which are not
members of the federal reserve system, or affiliated with it through
establishment of an exchange balance, and which refuse to assent
to clearance at par, provided the checks be payable on presentation
and can in fact be collected consistently with the legal rights of
the drawees without paying an exchange charge. P. 646.
2. Loss of income resulting to country banks from the exercise of
this right without malice or coercion, is damnum absque injuria.
P. 648.
284 Fed. 424, affirmed.
APPEAL from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals
affirming a decree made by the District Court after final
hearing, in a suit brought by numerous state banks
against the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and its
officials. The case was here before on a decree sustaining
a demurrer to the bill. 256 U. S. 350.
