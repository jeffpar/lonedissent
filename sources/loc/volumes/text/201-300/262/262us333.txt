Syllabus.

properly includes those derived from dumps and tailings
placed and remaining upon the mining claims or connected with a going mine, we do not determine; but we
do hold that the proceeds from the tailings in question,
under the facts here disclosed, are not included within its
terms. The court below should have so construed the
statute and rendered judgment for the plaintiff. See
Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154 U. S. 362,
390-391; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co.,
244 U. S. 499, 507. This disposition of the case makes
it unnecessary to adjudicate the questions raised under
the Fourteenth Amendment.
The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the
case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with
this opinion.
Reversed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.
Opinion of the Court.

262 U. S.

APPEAL from an order of the District Court discharging
a writ of habeas corpus and remanding the appellant to
custody.

Mr. Henry E. Davis, with whom Mr. L. H. Ellis was
on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. Rufus S. Day, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Mr. Solicitor General Beck was on
the brief, for appellee.
MR.JUSTICE

SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The appellant was convicted in the Federal District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama of a felony
and sentenced to imprisonment. The record of the District Court recites that "a jury of good and lawful men "
was duly empaneled, sworn and charged. After sentence
appellant moved to amend the record entry to show that
only eleven men sat as jurors in the case and offered testimony in support of the motion. The court rejected the
proof on the ground that oral testimony was not admissible to modify or amend the record and, first reciting that
after hearing the evidence and arguments and being of
opinion that the record of the judgment entry was as it
should be and did not need amendment, denied the motion. Appellant then applied to this Court for a writ of
mandamus to require the district judge to correct the
record in the particulars just stated, setting forth in his
petition the evidence offered and rejected. The writ was
denied, Ex parte Riddle, 255 U. S. 450, this Court saying
(p. 451):
"He [appellant] might have saved the point by an exception at the trial or by a bill of exceptions to the denial
of his subsequent motion, setting forth whatever facts or
offers of proof were material, and then have brought a

writ of error. Nalle v. Oyster, 230 U. S. 165, 177. In
such cases mandamus does not lie. Ordinarily, at least,
it is not to be used when another statutory method has
been provided for reviewing the action below, or to reverse a decision of record. Ex parte Morgan, 114 U. S.
174; Ex parte Park Square Automobile Station, 244 U. S.
412, 414. In this case the facts were more or less clearly
admitted at the argument but the record does not establish them and the extent of agreement or dispute with
regard to them does not change the remedy to be sought."
Appellant then took the case by writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Riddle v.
United States, 279 Fed. 216, where the judgment so far as
it concerns appellant was affirmed.
The point was not saved in a bill of exceptions, and it
was not considered by the Court of Appeals. After the
rendition of the judgment by that court, appellant sued
out a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the
Northern Division of the Northern District of Georgia,
seeking release from imprisonment on the ground that the
jury which convicted him was illegally constituted of less
than twelve men. That court, on the return of the appellee and after hearing, discharged the writ and remanded appellant to custody, from which order the case
comes here by appeal.
That the trial court had jurisdiction to try and punish
the appellant for the offense with which he was charged
is not disputed. The attempt is collaterally to impeach
the record, showing upon its face that a lawful jury was
*duly empaneled, sworn and charged. Appellant's remedy,
as suggested in the mandamus proceeding, was by writ of
error. He did not avail himself of it and whatever may
have been the cause or excuse for not doing so, habeas
corpus cannot be used as a substitute. Frank v. Mangum,
237 U. S. 309, 326, and cases cited; In re Lennon, 166
U. S. 548, 552; In re Coy, 127 U. S. 731, 758-759. The

writ of habeas corpus is not a proceeding in the original
criminal prosecution but an independent civil suit, Ex
parte Tom Tong, 108 U. S. 556, 559, in which the record
of the trial court is not open to collateral attack but imports absolute verity. See Ex parte Tobias Watkins, 3
Pet. 193, 202-203, 207; In re Lennon, supra, p. 553;
Grignon's Lessee v. Astor, 2 How. 319, 340-342; Matter
of Gregory, 219 U. S. 210, 213-214, 218; 2 Black on Judgments, § 625; 1 Id. § 254.
The power to inquire into facts outside the record,
allowed under some circumstances, In re Mayfield, 141
U. S. 107, 116, cannot be extended to such as are inconsistent with the record.
The Frank Case, relied upon by appellant, does not
decide otherwise. The language quoted (237 U. S.331)
to the effect that the court may "look behind and beyond
the record . . . to a sufficient extent to test the juris-"
diction of the . . . court " and "inquire into jurisdictional facts, whether they appear upon the record or
not " was not meant to abrogate the rule established by
prior decisions that the record may not be contradicted
collaterally at least, where, as here, jurisdiction of the
cause or parties is not involved; and this is demonstrated
by the cases cited in support of the statement. In
Cuddy, Petitioner,131 U. S.280, 286, the Court, sustaining the propriety of the inquiry there permitted, said:
"Such evidence would not have contradicted the record."
In the Mayfield Case, supra, it was said that the inquiry
might involve "an examination of facts outside of, but
not inconsistent with, the record." 141 U. S.116. Nor is
there anything to the contrary in the other two cases
cited.
The court below was right in ruling that it was without authority to review or set aside the action of the trial
court, for, as this Court said in Sargeant v. State Bank of
Indiana, 12 How. 371, 385: "
.whatever may be

the powers of a superior court, in the exercise of regular
appellate jurisdiction, to examine the acts of an inferior
court, the proceedings of a court of general and competent jurisdiction cannot be properly impeached and reexamined collaterally by a distinct tribunal, one not acting in the exercise of appellate power."
The order of the District Court denying the writ is
Affirmed.

STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 269.

Argued March 5, 6, 1923.-Decided May 21, 1923.

Just compensation for copper taken by the United States for war
purposes under the Act of June 3, 1916, c. 134, §§ 120, 123,
39 Stat. 215, is to be measured by the market value of the copper
at the time of the taking, and not by higher prices which the owner
was obliged to pay under long time purchase contracts. P. 340.
56 Ct. Clms. 362, affirmed; motion to remand denied.
