1. A State may, consistently with the Federal Constitution, impose
a tax upon the net income of property, as distinguished from the
net income of him who owns or operates it, although the property
is used in interstate commerce. P. 420.
2. The Income Tax Law of North Carolina directs that the "net
operating income" of railroads within the State be determined
upon the basis of accounts to be kept according to the method
established by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and lays a
tax upon the "net income," to be ascertained by deducting from
"net operating income" only uncollectible revenue, certain taxes,
and amounts paid for car hire, thus treating the railroad property
within the State as the thing of which the income is taxed, and
taking no account of other income of the corporation owning the
railroad and making no deduction of its capital charges. Held, That
the statute, considering this distinction, does not in effect, depart
from the Commission's definition of net income, nor, as applied to

railroad taxes of the State, make an aggregate burden violating
the commerce clause; nor does it violate that clause by departing
from the standard form of accounts prescribed by the Interstate
Commerce Commission under the Transportation Act, 1920. P. 421.
3. The above statute is not obnoxious to the equal protection clause,
either in refusing to public service corporations, including railroads,
deductions of interest on funded debt, rentals and worthless debts,
which are allowed to other corporations and individuals in calculating net income, or in not requiring certain short line railroads
to keep the accounts required of other railroads. P. 423.
4. The Constitution of North Carolina does not forbid taxing the
iet income of property operated as a railroad as distinguished
from the net inome of the company owning the railroad P. 424.

the North Carolina Constitution, in that the permissible deductions in computing net income of public service corporations are
different from, and not so great as, those allowed individuals or

alleged to be unconstitutional, will not be dismissed upon the
ground that a plain, adequate and complete remedy exists, in

MR. JusTIcE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Constitution of North Carolina (Article V, § 3, as
amended January 7, 1921) authorizes the General Assembly to tax incomes at a rate not exceeding six per cent.
The Income Tax Act of March 8, 1921 (Revenue Act, c.
34, Schedule D, §§ 100-904, as amended by c. 35, Public
Laws 1921) laid upon corporations a tax equal to three
per cent. of the entire net income as therein defined and
upon individuals a progressive tax not exceeding that percentage. For the purpose of ascertaining the taxable income the statute divides taxpayers into three classesindividuals, ordinary corporations and public service corporations (including railroads). The statute, in terms,
taxes only net income. For railroads and other public
service corporations required to keep accounts according to the method established by the Interstate Commerce Commission, it makes those accounts the basis
for determining the "net operating income" (§ 202 as
amended); and it directs that, in order to ascertain the
"net income," there shall be deducted from the net operating income (a) uncollectible revenue; (b) taxes for

the income year, other than income taxes, and war profits
and excess profits taxes; (c) amounts paid for car hire.
Whether the statute is unconstitutional, because it fails
to include among the deductions from income allowed
public service corporations the capital charges, including
other rentals paid, is the main question for decision.
The first year's tax under the act was payable in 1922,
with respect to the net income received during the calendar year 1921. To enjoin its enforcement these four corporations brought suit in the federal court for the Eastern District of North Carolina -against the Commissioner
of Revenue and others. Each plaintiff owns and operates
a line of railroad within the State, and is an interstate
carrier. Each assails the statute on the grounds that it
violates the commerce clause, the Fourteenth Amendment and the state constitution; and only on these
grounds. Each case was heard upon the merits. And in
each a final decree was entered dismissing the bill. Appeals were taken under § 238 of the Judicial Code; and
orders of the District Court stayed collection of the taxes
pending the determination of the appeals. Since the
cases are properly here on federal questions, all questions
presented by the record whether involving federal law or
state law must be considered. Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts,

as burdening interstate commerce. Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217. It
is conceded by appellants that classification of public
service corporations, and specifically of railroads, for purposes of taxation does not violate the Fourteenth Amend-

ment; Bell's Gap R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S.
232, 237; Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, 260 U. S. 519; and
by the State, that an arbitrary classification is obnoxious
to the equal protection clause. Southern Ry. Co. v.
Greene, 216 U. S. 400. The contentions are that the statute, in fact, taxes gross income; that the classification as
made by itis unreasonable; and that for these, and other,
reasons it violates both the federal and the state constitution. All the contentions are, in our opinion, unsound.
To appreciate the objections urged, and to present the
reasons for holding them groundless, it is necessary to
show the incidence of the tax. This may be done by examining how the assessment of $13,133.09 made upon the
Seaboard Air Line, and here assailed, was calculated.
The Seaboard being an interstate carrier, the accounts
were kept as required by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Interstate business was apportioned, as customary, according to mileage. The results of operations
within the State calculated according to the statute were
these:
$8, 457, 328. 52
Operating revenues .....
Operating expenses .....

The tax assessed ($13,133.09) is about one-six hundred
and fiftieth (w--)
of the total operating revenues
($8,457,328.52).
That the calculation is -correct, in accordance with the
statute, is not disputed. That is, the net income earned,
in 1921, by the Seaboard's lines in North Carolina was as
calculated $437,769.52. The Seaboard insists that it had
no net-income taxable in North Carolina; but, on the con•trary, a loss, of which $254,290.22 was apportionable to
North Carolina. The loss is figured in this way:

Opinion of the Court.

Thus the State takes, as the entity to be taxed, the railroad property operated by the Seaboard within the State.
Therefore, it takes, as the primary basis for the tax, only
operating revenues; that is, the gross receipts from operating such property. The Seaboard, on the other hand,
assumes, as the entity which should be taxed, the company in respect to its North Carolina interests. Therefore the Seaboard takes, as the primary basis for the tax,
in addition to the operating revenues of the lines within
the State, North Carolina's proportion of the non-operating income of the company derived from other property
owned by it, wherever situated. For the Seaboard, like

There is apparently some error in the items which is not however
material to the result.
gFor the Atlantic Coast Line the calculation in accordance with
the statute shows a net income of $1,389,565.25. According to the
company's contention the net income was $333,205.09.
For the Norfolk Southern the calculation in accordance with the
statute, it is said, shows a net income of $653,882.17. (The correct
figures would seem to be $603,003.51.) According to the company's
contention there was a deficit of $424,338.92.
For the Southern Railway the calculation in accordance with the
statute shows a net income of $2,384,068.71. According to the company's contention the net income on one calculation was $554,724.41

most other railroad systems, is, to some extent, a holding
company, as well as an operating company; and, as holding company, receives dividends from other concerns, interest on bonds of other concerns, and rental from property owned but not operated. As the State treats the
operated property as the entity, it does not concern itself
with interest charges and the rentals paid, just as it does
not concern itself with a mortgage upon the real estate
"when it lays the ad valorem tax. On the other hand, as
the Seaboard treats the company-the person-as the
entity to be taxed, it undertakes to ascertain the net income of the company. This includes as gross income, a
proportion of the receipts from property not within the
State and includes among the deductions from the gross
income of the company, the capital charges.
That a State may, consistently with the Federal Constitution, impose a tax upon the net income of property,
as distinguished from the net income of him who owns
or operates it, although the property is used in interstate
commerce, was settled in Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37,
44, 52. There an Oklahoma statute was sustained which
laid the tax upon the net income of Oklahoma oil property owned by a citizen and resident of Illinois. The Federal Constitution which permits to be taxed the net income of property owned by an individual, although a citizen of another State, obviously does not preclude such a
tax where the property is owned or operated by a corporation. It is a common provision in state income tax laws
to tax the net income of property within the State which
is owned, or operated, by non-residents.' The differences
between the parties arise, in the main, not from differ'The Federal Government taxes the net income of property owned

or business carried on within the United States by a citizen resident
abroad. DeGanay v. Lederer, 250 U. S. 376. The New York income

ence in the method of determining what is net income,
but from difference as to what is the subject of the tax.
In other words, they differ as to the thing of which the
net income is to be ascertained. This will appear from
an examination of the several grounds on which the
validity of the statute is assailed.
First. The contention that the statute is obnoxious to
the commerce clause rests upon the argument that the
State's definition of net income differs from that adopted
by the Interstate Commerce Commission; that the State
is without power to depart from the Commission's definition so far as concerns interstate commerce; and that,
since the statutory definition differs, the act is unconstitutional. A conclusive answer to that argument is found
in the fact that the State adopts (without modification)
the commission's definition for the net income of that
which it taxes. For treating as the entity to be taxed,
the railroad property operated by the company within
the State, it appears that every item which the railroad
claims the statute wrongly disallowed as a deduction is
of such a character, that it is either clearly a capital
charge (as distinguished from an operating charge) or
reasonably may be deemed such as a matter of accounting." The question of law thus presented is not one which
involves enquiry into the intricacies of railroad account'To prove that the statute, in fact, taxes some part of the gross
earnings, attention is called specifically to some minor items which
the statute does not allow as deductions. But these stand in no different position than the major items-interest on funded debt and
leased line rentals-discussed above. Prominent among these lesser
items is "joint facility rents" which, in the case of the Seaboard,
amounted net to $21,816.81. Joint facility rents paid were $34,480.98; those received (credited as non-operating income) were
$12,664.17. This is rental paid for railroad facilities--like tracks,
terminals and roundhouses. They are needed by the carrier as a part
of the plant and, not being owned, are rented from others. The fact
that they are used jointly with others, is, of course, immaterial. This
rent, like the rent of a leased line, is paid to secure control of the

ing. Under the commerce clause it is essential that a
state tax shall not directly burden interstate commerce
and that it shall not discriminate against interstate commerce. With these essentials the North Carolina act
complies. It is not assessed on gross receipts. 6 Compare
Peck & Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 165; Pullman Co. v. Richardson, 261 U. S. 330. It does not discriminate against
interstate commerce. For the taxable net income of other
public service corporations which are wholly intrastate is
determined also without allowing capital charges as a deduction. That there is no basis for the claim that the
commerce clause is violated by the burden resulting from
the aggregate of the several North Carolina railroad taxes
was settled in Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, supra.
Another, and more technical, argument in support of
the contention that the statute violates the commerce
clause as applied to interstate carriers is based upon the
cases which sustain the power of the Interstate Commerce
Commission to prescribe a uniform system of accounting.!
property operated. Hire of freight cars might have been treated in
the same way, but the State, for reasons satisfactory to it, permitted
that financial charge to be deducted, and to that extent reduced the
tax.
'The term "net income," in law or in economics, has not a rigid
meaning. Every income tax act necessarily defines what is included
in gross income; what deductions are to be made from the gross to
ascertain net income; and what part, if any, of the net income, is
exempt from taxation. These details are largely a matter of governmental policy. As to them States differ; and there is apt to be difference of view in the same States at different times; and at the
same time a different definition of taxable net income for different
classes of taxpayers. Obviously such differences in detail do not
render obnoxious to the commerce clause a state income tax which
is otherwise unobjectionable.

States, 99 U. S,402, 420, 427,

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. DAUGHTON. 423
413

Opinion of the Court.

It is said that, since the statute in ascertaining net income
purports to follow the standard form of accounts prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, but in
fact departs therefrom, the statute invades the province
of Congress and conflicts with the policy expressed in
Transportation Act, 1920. There is in fact no such divergence in the accounting. But if there had been, it
would not follow that every departure from the Commission's standard classification would render unconstitutional a state income tax act. The function of determining whether a tax burdens interstate commerce was not
conferred upon the Commission. Its sole function is the
regulation of carriers. For this purpose it has been empowered by Congress to require of them a uniform system
of accounting. The financial results of their operations
as therein disclosed are useful for many purposes. But
they are not made conclusive for all. Moreover, the Commission's standard form is not immutable. Railway accounting is in process of development.'
Second. The contention that the statute is obnoxious
to the equal protection clause rests upon the argument
that the State's definition of net income of public service
corporations (including railroads) is arbitrary. It is
alleged to be arbitrary because it allows to other corporations and to individuals, certain deductions which
'See Groesbeck v. Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic Ry. Co., 250
U. S. 607, 614; 3 I. C. C. 289, 343. Power to prescribe a mandatory
accounting system was first conferred upon the Commission by the
Hepburn Act (June 29, 1906, c. 3591, § 7, 34 Stat. 584, 593). In
1888 a recommendatory classification of operating revenues, expenses
and charges was issued by the Commission; and between that date
and 1908 the form was revised from time to time. On June 1, 1908,
the Commission ordered carriers to make reports in the form prescribed and furnished by the Commission. Thereafter changes continued to be made from time to time. A comprehensive and detailed classification of income accounts was issued effective July 1,
1912. This was superseded by the revised classification effective
July 1, 1914, which is now in force.

are denied to public service corporations; namely, interest
on funded debt, rentals, and certain worthless debts
(§ 306, pars. 2, 3, 6 and 7). That the differentiation
results from the difference in the subject of the tax and,
hence, is not arbitrary has been pointed out above. But,
in any event, the differentiation would not render the
statute unconstitutional. The State might, consistently
with the equal protection clause, have subjected only
public service corporations to the income tax, or it might
have laid upon them a higher income tax than upon
others; as it laid upon railroads a higher franchise tax
than it did upon other corporations. Compare Southern
Ry. Co. v. Watts, 260 U. S. 519.
The classification is also assailed as arbitrary on the
ground that § 202 defining net income applies only to
corporations required to keep records "according to the
standard classification of accounting of the Interstate
Commerce Commission "; that there are in the State corporations which are not required by law to keep their
accounts according to the Commission's form, but which
own railroads of standard gauge operated by steam, and
have obtained authority to act as limited common carriers.
In support of this contention, two railroads with short
lines are instanced. They are owned by lumber companies and are taxed, not as railroads, but as if part of the
lumber corporation. So far as appears the North Carolina
authorities might require them to file accounts according
to the Commission's classification, if they deemed this
advisable. But obviously the State might reasonably
classify such railroads differently from ordinary carriers.
Third. The claim that the statute violates the state
constitution rests mainly on the contention that the tax is
not upon the net income.' As shown above, the assump-

incomes provided the rate . . . shall not

tion is erroneous. Only the net income of the property
operated as a utility is taxed. There is nothing in the
constitution of the State which precludes taxing the net
income of the property so operated, as distinguished from
the net income of the company. There is no inconsistency between §§ 101 and 202 of the statute. It would
seem from the decisions of the Supreme Court of North
Carolina that the uniformity clause applies to income
taxation; but that court has repeatedly held that the
uniformity clause does not prevent reasonable classification."0 The contention that the uniformity clause is violated because the permissible deductions in the case of
public service corporations are different from (and not
so great as), those allowed individuals or other corporations 1 is unfounded, for reasons stated above. So is the
contention that the statute is retroactive and void, because it was not enacted until March, 1922, but lays a
tax based upon the net income of the calendar year.
On behalf of the State it was urged that the bill was
properly dismissed by the District Court because there is
under the laws of North Carolina a plain, adequate, and

other public corporations are allowed to deduct, as an operating
expense, the cost of tools and small equipment. Individuals and
other corporations are not. Ordinary corporations and individuals
are allowed to deduct rentals and interest paid. Compare the limited deduction for interest paid under the Federal Corporation Tax
