STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 269.

Argued March 5, 6, 1923.-Decided May 21, 1923.

Just compensation for copper taken by the United States for war
purposes under the Act of June 3, 1916, c. 134, §§ 120, 123,
39 Stat. 215, is to be measured by the market value of the copper
at the time of the taking, and not by higher prices which the owner
was obliged to pay under long time purchase contracts. P. 340.
56 Ct. Clms. 362, affirmed; motion to remand denied.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Claims.
Mr. Alfred G. Reeves and Mr. FredericD. McKenney,
with whom Mr. Russell H. Robbins was on the brief, for
appellant.
Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Mr. Solicitor General Beck, Mr. Assistant Attorney General Lovett and Mr. J. Robert Anderson, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, were on

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Between September 28, 1917, and February 1, 1918, the
United States obtained from appellant 12,542,857 pounds
of copper and paid 231/2 cents per pound therefor. By

Opinion of the Court.

its petition, appellant asks judgment for $424,196.54, being 3.381977 cents per pound, in addition to the price
paid. The Court of Claims made findings of fact, and as
a conclusion of law held that appellant was not entitled
to recover, and dismissed the petition. From that judgment this appeal is taken.
The Court of Claims found that the market price of
copper was 231/2 cents per pound. The United States
insists that payment of the market price was just compensation. The appellant claims that there was no express contract of sale; that the copper was taken pursuant to mandatory orders, and that it did not waive its
right to just compensation. It submits that the finding
of the Court of Claims, that after September 20, 1917,
the market price of copper was 231/2 cents per pound, must
be read as referring to a mere fiat price fixed by the
United States, and that it does not mean the market price
as fixed by supply and demand and other elements in normal trading in copper. It asserts that the necessary cost
of the copper to it was 26.881977 cents per pound, and
demands that price.
It appears from the findings that appellant purchased
ores, minerals and metals, had them smelted and refined,
and sold the refined products. It was not a mine owner,
operator, producer or refiner. On September 20, 1917,
at close of business, it had on hand 43,851,042 pounds
of copper. It had purchased 34,687,579 pounds as unrefined copper under long term contracts, and 9,163,463
pounds as refined copper in the open market. The average cost to appellant was 26.881977 cents per pound. Out
of the stock then on hand, it had sold 31,308,183 pounds
at 26.34389 cents per pound. There remained 12,542,857
pounds.
It further appears that some time before September
21, 1917, an agreement was made by the War Industries
Board with copper producers fixing a price of 231/2 cents

per pound for copper, and this agreement was approved
by the President on that date. September 28, 1917,
Vogelstein, who controlled appellant, attended a meeting
of copper producers and government representatives and
placed in nomination the persons who were chosen at that
meeting as members of a committee to act for the copper
producers in carrying out the agreement of September
21st, and to coiperate with government representatives
in securing performance of the agreement and to take
the necessary measures to that end. The United Metals
Selling Company was the sales agent for copper producers,
and the plan adopted for obtaining the copper for the
United States was for the War and Navy Departments to
send orders and shipping directions to the Selling Company. The orders were sent to the producers' committee,
which returned them to the Selling Company with the
name of the producer or dealer on whom the orders should
be made. Thereupon the Selling Company placed its own
order with the producer or dealer named, requesting the
shipment to be made, and stating the price to be paid as
23Y2 cents per pound. The Selling Company from time
to time, beginning April 6, 1917, made a number of contracts for the furnishing of copper to the United States.
The first two, respectively dated April 6 and April 21,
covered 45,100,000 pounds at 16.6739 cents per pound.
Later contracts covered 297,826,734 pounds at 23 cents
per pound. Between September 28, 1917, and February
1, 1918, the period in which appellant's copper here involved was obtained, about 283,000,000 pounds were furnished the United States under these contracts. In appellant's petition it is stated that since September 21,
1917, it sold and delivered to the United States at least
25,000,000 pounds of copper, which cost it substantially
231/2 cents per pound, the price it received from the
United States. Appellant's contention that there was
no market price other than that fixed by the fiat of

the United States is without support. The price so found
uniformly prevailed during the period in question. Appellant coperated with others having copper to sell in
putting into effect and maintaining that price. The finding of the Court of Claims is plain and cannot be read
as referring to a mere fiat price. It is not inpaired, but
is supported and confirmed by other findings. The appellant is bound by it.
It contends that when the price was fixed at 231 cents
per pound, it unavoidably had on hand the 12,542,857
pounds of copper in question; that this copper was
requisitioned and taken upon mandatory orders pursuant
to §§ 120 and 123 of an Act approved June 3, 1916, c. 134,
39 Stat. 213, 215, and that it protested against the price.
It moves to remand the case with directions to find facts
with reference to these claims. Assuming all these matters of fact in favor of appellant and considering the case
as if .they had been so found by the Court of Claims, the
United States' contention that appellant has received just
compensation must be sustained. The market price was
paid. The market value of the copper taken at the time
it was taken measures the owner's compensation. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. ,United States, 261 U. S. 299;
United States v. Chandler-DunbarWater Power Co., 229
U. S. 53, 80, 81; Boom Co. v. Patterson,98 U. S. 403, 407;
United States v. New River Collieries Co., 276 Fed. 690,
affirmed this day, infra, 341. The higher prices, if any,
paid by appellant for the copper it was compelled to take
on long time purchase contracts are not evidence of the
value of the copper at the time it was obtained by the
United States. The United States is under no obligation
to make good the loss. Appellant would be entitled to
the gain if it had purchased at less than the market price
at the time of taking.
The motion to remand is denied, and the judgment
appealed from is affirmed.
