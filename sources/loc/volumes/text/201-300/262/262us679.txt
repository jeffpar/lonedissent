COMPANY v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION
OF THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA ET AL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE
OF WEST VIRGINIA.

No. 256. Argued January 22, 1923.--Decided June 11, 1923.
1. A judgment of the highest court of a State which upholds an
order of a state commission fixing the" rates of a public utility
company over the objection that the rates are confiscatory and the
order hence violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, is reviewable
here, on the constitutional question, by writ of error. P. 683.
2. In estimating the value of the property of a public utility corporation, as a basis for rate regulation, evidence of present reproduction costs, less depreciation, must be given consideration. P.

3. A public utility corporation, challenging as confiscatory rates
imposed by a state commission, is entitled, under the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to the independent judgment
of the court as to both law and facts. Id.
4. Rates which are not sufficient to yield a reasonable return on the
value of the property used, at the time it is being used to render
the service of the utility to the public, are unjust, unreasonable and
confiscatory; and their enforcement deprives the public utility company of its property, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

ing risks and uncertainties; but it has no constitutional right to
profits such as are realized or anticipated in highly profitable enterprises or speculative ventures. P. 692.
6. The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in
the financial soundness of the utility, and should be adequate, under
efficient and economical management, to maintain its credit, and

ERROR to a judgment of the. Supreme Court of Appeals
of West Virginia, sustaining an order of a state commis•sion fixing water rates, in a suit brought by the plaintiff
in error to set the order aside.

Mr. Alfred G. Fox, with whom Mr. Joseph M. Sanders
was on the briefs, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Russell S. Ritz for defendants in error.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of
West Virginia herein does not declare valid any statute of
the State or any authority exercised under the State,
which is repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws
of the United States.
The most that can be claimed is that the Commission,
acting under lawful authority in reaching the conclusion
from a disputed state of facts, found and fixed the value
of plaintiff's property for rate making purposes at an
amount less than some other tribunal may have fixed
and determined from a like state of facts. A judgment
based upon such a state of facts does not raise such a
federal question as gives a right of review from this
Court to the highest court of the State by a writ of error.

BLUEFIELD CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM. 681
679

Argument for Defendants in Error.

The Public Service Commission and the Supreme Court
of Appeals acted under valid state authority. The authority or law under which these respective tribunals
exercised jurisdiction not being repugnant to any federal
law, what conclusions they may have reached from a
given state of facts which furnishes the basis for the
judgment complained of herein, does not present a question subject to be reviewed by writ of error. Such questions can be reviewed only on petition for a writ of certiorari. Zucht v. King, 260 U. S. 174; Stadelman v.
Miner, 246 U. S. 544; Philadelphia& Reading Coal Co.
v. Gilbert, 245 U. S. 162; Ireland v. Woods, 246 U. S. 323.
It is not here contended that a public utility is not entitled to a fair return upon the fair and reasonable value
of all of its plant and property then used and useful in
the public service, but we submit that the fair and reasonable value of a public utility's plant and property is not
to be ascertained by adopting only one method of valuation to the exclusion of all other known methods and elements of value. A valuation of a public utility, such as
would be fair to the public as well as the utility, should
take into consideration the original cost or investment
in the utility; the market value of its stocks or bonds, if
any; the probable earning capacity of the property; the
various rates it has received and the rate it is receiving;
the amounts necessary to meet operating expenses; the
ability of the utility to adequately perform the public
service; the history of the operations of the utility; and
perhaps other elements; and after taking all bf these into
consideration, fix a value that will be fair both to the
public and to the utility. Snyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466;

Argument for Defendants in Error.

262 U. S.

If by taking one element or method of value a conclusion is reached which is out of all proportion with a conclusion that may be reached by taking other methods,
then that measure or method should be adopted which
will, after taking into consideration all of the elements
of value, make a fair and reasonable value on the utility's
property, used and useful in the public service.
The reproduction theory of public utility valuation
has been usually resorted to by the public to safeguard
itself against values of public utilities, based upon inflated and watered stock investments, purporting to represent original cost. Practically all, if not all, of the decisions of this Court, in which this theory of valuation
was even considered, were cases of this character; and
even in them this Court has never held that the reproduction new theory at present prices was an exclusive
method by which public utility values are to be determined. Smyth v. Ames, supra; Whitten, Valuation Public Service Corporations, c. V, p. 82, et seq.; 2 Wyman,
Public Service Corporations, c. 32; Coal & Coke Ry. Co. v.
Conley, 67 W. Va. 129; Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S.
352.
If determining public utility values for rate-making
purposes is to be accomplished by using the reproduction
new theory at present prices, to the exclusion of every
other element and method of values, then it may well be
seen to what uncertain, as well as unfair, consequences
it may lead. If the market is abnormally low and a valuation on this theory is made at such a time, without
taking into consideration past costs or other elements of
value, it would be manifestly unfair to the utility. Likewise, if this theory of valuation is used at a time of abnormally high prices in the market, such as was produced by the World War, and all other methods and elements of values are excluded, then it would be most unfair to the public, who would be expected to pay rates

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Plaintiff in error is a corporation furnishing water to
the city of Bluefield, West Virginia, and its inhabitants.
September 27, 1920, the Public Service Commission of
the State being authorized by statute to fix just and
reasonable rates, made its order prescribing rates. In
accordance with the laws of the State (§ 16, c. 15-0, Code
of West Virginia) the company instituted proceedings in
the Supreme Court of Appeals to suspend and set aside
the order. The petition alleges that the order is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, and deprives the
company of its property without just compensation and
without due process of law and denies it equal protection
of the laws. A final judgment was entered denying the
company relief and dismissing its petition. The case is
here on writ of error.
1. The city moves to dismiss the writ of error for the
reason, as it asserts, that there was not drawn in question
the validity of a statute or an authority exercised under
the State, on the ground of repugnancy to the Federal
Constitution.
The validity of the order prescribing the rates was
directly challenged on constitutional grounds, and it was
held valid by the highest court of the State. The prescribing of rates is a legislative act. The commission is an
instrumentality of the State, exercising delegated powers.
Its order is of the same force as would be a like enactment
by the legislature. If, as alleged, the prescribed rates are
confiscatory, the order is void. Plaintiff in error is entitled to bring the case here on writ of error and to have
that question decided by this Court. The motion to dismiss will be denied. See Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v.

Russell, 261 U. S. 290, and cases cited; also Ohio Valley
Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, 253 U. S. 287.
2. The commission fixed $460,000 as the amount on
which the company is entitled to a return. It found that
under existing rates, assuming some increase of business,
gross earnings for 1921 would be $80,000 and operating
expenses $53,000, leaving $27,000, the equivalent of 5.87
per cent., or 3.87 per cent. after deducting 2 per cent.
allowed for depreciation. It held existing rates insufficient to the extent of $10,000. Its order allowed the company to add 16 per cent. to all bills, excepting those for
public and private fire protection. The total of the bills
so to be increased amounted to $64,000. That is, 80 per
cent. of the revenue was authorized to be increased 16
per cent., equal to an increase of 12.8 per cent. on the.
total,-amounting to $10,240.
As to value. The company claims that the value of the
property is greatly in excess of $460,000. Reference to
the evidence is necessary. There was submitted to the
commission evidence of value which it summarized substantially as follows:
a. Estimate by company's engineer on
basis of reproduction new, less depreciation, at prewar prices .......

It was shown that the prices prevailing in 1920 were
nearly double those in 1915 and prewar time. The company did not claim value as high as its estimate of cost
of construction in 1920. Its valuation engineer testified
that in his opinion the value of the property was $900,000,-a figure between the cost of construction in 1920,
less depreciation, and the cost of construction in 1915
and before the war, less depreciation.
The commission's application of the evidence may be
stated briefly as follows:
As to " a ", supra. The commission deducted $204,000
from the estimate (details printed in the margin),' leaving approximately $421,000 which it contrasted with the
estimate of its own engineer, $397,964.38 (see "d", supra).
It found that there should be included $25,000 for the
Bluefield Valley Water Works plant in Virginia, 10 per
cent. for going value, and $10,000 for working capital.
If these be added to $421,000 there results $500,600.
This may be compared with the commission's final figure,
$460,000.

Opinion of the Court.

262 U. S.

As to "b" and "c", supra. These were given no weight
by the commission in arriving at its final figure, $460,000.
It said:
"Applicant's plant was originally constructed more
than twenty years ago, and has been added to from time
to time as the progress and development of the community required. For this reason, it would be unfair to
its consumers to use as a basis for present fair value the
abnormal prices prevailing during the recent war period,
but when, as in this case, a part of the plant has been constructed or added to during that period, in fairness to the
applicant, consideration must be given to the cost of such
expenditures made to meet the demands of the public."
As to "d", supra, The commission taking $400,000
(round figures) added $25,000 for Bluefield Valley Water
Works plant in Virginia, 10 per cent. for going value,
and $10,000 for working capital, making $477,500. This
may be compared with its final figure, $460,000.
As to "e", supra. The commission on the report of its
statistician found gross investment to be $500,402.53. Its
engineer applying the straight line method found 19 per
cent. depreciation. It applied 81 per cent. to gross investment and added 10 per cent. for going value and
$10,000 for working capital, producing $455,500.2 This
may be compared with its final figure, $460,000.
As to "f", supra. It is necessary briefly to explain how
this figure, $452,520.53, was arrived at. Case No. 368
was a proceeding initiated by the application of the company for higher rates, April 24, 1915. The commission
made a valuation as of January 1, 1915. There were
presented two estimates of reproduction cost less depreciation, one by a valuation engineer engaged by the com-

3As to "e". $365,445.13 represents investment cost less depreciation. The gross investment was found to be $500,402.53, indicating
a deduction on account of depreciation of $134,957.40, about 27
per cent. as against 19 per cent. found by the commission's engineer.

pany and the other by a valuation engineer engaged by
the city, both "using the same method." An inventory
made by the company's engineer was accepted as correct by the city and by the commission. The method
"was that generally employed by courts and commissions in arriving at the value of public utility properties
under this method", and in both estimates "five year
average unit prices " were applied. The estimate of the
company's engineer was $540,000 and of the city's engineer, $392,000. The principal differences as given by the
commission are shown ii the margin.' The commission
disregarded both estimates and arrived at $360,000. It
held that the best basis of valuation was the net investment, i. e., the total cost of the property less depreciation. It said: "The books of the company show a total
gross investment since its organization, of $407,882.00,
and that there has been charged off for depreciation from
year to year the total sum of $83,445.00, leaving a net
investment of $324,427.00. . . . From an examination of the books . . . it appears that the records of
the company have been remarkably well kept and preserved. It, therefore, seems that when a plant is developed under these conditions the net investment which
of course means the total gross investment less depreciation is the very best basis of valuation for rate making purposes and that the other methods above referred to should

be used only when it is impossible to arrive at the true
investment. Therefore, after making due allowance for
capital necessary for the conduct of the business and
considering the plant as a going concern, it is the opinion
of the commission that the fair value for the purpose of
determining reasonable and just rates in this case of the
property of the applicant company, used by it in the public service of supplying water to the City of Bluefield
and its citizens, is the sum of $360,000.00, which sum is
hereby fixed and determined by the Commission to be the
fair present value for the said purpose of determining the
reasonable and just rates in this case."
In its report in No. 368, the commission did not indicate
the amounts respectively allowed for going value or working capital. If 10 per cent. be added for the former, and
$10,000 for the latter (as fixed by the commission in the
present case) there is produced $366,870, to be compared
with $360,000, found by the commission in its valuation
as of January 1, 1915. To this it added $92,520.53 expended since, producing $452,520.53. This may be compared with its final figure, $460,000.
The State Supreme Court of Appeals holds that the
valuing of the property of a public utility corporation and
prescribing rates are purely legislative acts not subject to
judicial review except in so far as may be necessary to
determine whether such rates are void on constitutional
or other grounds; and that findings of fact by the commission based on evidence to support them will not be
reviewed by the court. Bluefield v. Water Works Co., 81
W. Va. 201, 204; Coal and Coke Co. v. Public Service
Commission, 84 W. Va. 662, 678; Charleston v. Public
Service Commission, 86 W. Va. 536.
In this case (89 W. Va. 736) it said (p. 738):
"From the written opinion of the commission we find
that it ascertained the value of the petitioner's property
for rate making [then quoting the commission] 'after

BLUEFIELD CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM.

Opinion of the Court.

maturely and carefully considering the various methods
presented for the ascertainment of .fair value and giving
such weight as seems proper to every element involved
and all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the
record.'"
The record clearly shows that the commission in arriving at its final figure did not accord proper, if any, weight
to the greatly enhanced costs of construction in 1920 over
those prevailing about 1915 and before the war, as established by uncontradicted evidence; and the company's
detailed estimated cost of reproduction new, less depreciation, at 1920 prices, appears to have been wholly disregarded. This was erroneous. Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission,
ante, 276. Plaintiff in error is entitled under the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the independent judgment of the court as to both law and facts.
Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, 253 U. S.
287, 289, and cases cited.
We quote further from the court's opinion (pp. 739,
740):
"In our opinion the commission was justified by the
law and by the facts in finding as a basis for rate making
the sum of $460,000.00 .
.
In our case of Coal &
Coke Ry. Co. v. Conley, 67 W. Va. 129, it is said: 'It
seems to be generally held that, in the absence of peculiar
and extraordinary conditions, such as a more costly plant
than the public service of the community requires, or the
erection of a plant at an actual, though extravagant, cost,
or the purchase of one at an exorbitant or inflated price,
the actual amount of money invested is to be taken as the
basis, and upon this a return must be allowed equivalent
to that which is ordinarily received in the locality in
which the business is done, upon capital invested in similar enterprises. In addition to this, consideration must
be given to the nature of the investment, a higher rate

being regarded as justified by the risk incident to a hazardous investment.' •
"That the original cost considered in connection with
the history and growth of the utility and the value of the
services rendered constitute the principal elements to be
considered in connection with rate making, seems to be
supported by nearly all the authorities."
The question in the case is whether the rates prescribed
in the commission's order are confiscatory and therefore
beyond legislative power. Rates which are not sufficient
to yield a reasonable return on the value of the property
used at the time it is being used to render the service are
unjust, unreasonable and confiscatory, and their enforcement deprives the public utility company of its property
in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is so
well settled by numerous decisions of this Court that citation of the cases is scarcely necessary. "What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of
that which it employs for the public convenience."
Smyth v. Ames, (1898) 169 U. S. 466, 547.
"There must be a fair return upon the reasonable value
of the property at the time it is being used for the
public. .
"And we concur with the court below in holding that
the value of the property is to be determined as of the
time when the inquiry is made regarding the rates. If
the property, which legally enters into the consideration
of the question of rates, has increased in value since it
was acquired, the company is entitled to the benefit of
such increase." Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., (1909)
212 U. S. 19, 41, 52.
"The ascertainment of that value is not controlled by
artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas, but there
must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a
proper consideration of all relevant facts." Minnesota
Rate Cases, (1913) 230 U. S. 352, 434.

BLUEFIELD CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM. 691

Opinion of the Court.

"And in order to ascertain that value, the original cost
of construction, the amount expended in permanent im-

provements, the amount and market value of its bonds
and stock, the present as compared with the original cost
of construction, the probable earning capacity of the
property *underparticular rates prescribed by statute, and
the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all
matters for consideration, and are to be given such weight
as may be just and right in each case. We do not say
that there may not be other matters to be regarded in
estimating the value of the property." Smyth v. Ames,
supra, 546, 547.
The making of a just return for the use of

it be more than its cost. The property is held in private
ownership and it is that property, and not the original
cost of it, of which the owner may not be deprived
without due process of law." Minnesota Rate Cases,
supra, 454.
In Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v.
Public Service Commission, supra, applying the principles of the cases above cited and others, this Court said:
"Obviously; the Commission undertook to value the
property without according any weight to the greatly
enhanced costs of material, labor, supplies, etc., over
those prevailing in 1913, 1914 and 1916. As matter of
common knowledge, these increases were large. Competent witnesses estimated them as 45 to 50 per centum
S.It is impossible to ascertain what will amount
to a fair return upon properties devoted to public service
without giving consideration to the cost of labor, supplies,
etc., at the time the investigation is made. An honest
and intelligent forecast of probable future values made
upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential.
If the highly important element of present costs is wholly
disregarded such a forecast becomes impossible. Estimates for to-morrow cannot ignore prices of today."

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.
Opinion of the Court.

262 U. S.

It is clear that the court also failed to give proper consideration to the higher cost of construction in 1920 over
that in 1915 and before the war, and failed to give weight
to cost of reproduction less depreciation on the basis of
1920 prices, or to the testimony of the company's valuation engineer, based on present and past costs of construction, that the property in his opinion, was worth
$900,000. The final figure, $460,000, was arrived at substantially on the basis of actual cost less depreciation
plus ten per cent. for going value and $10,000 for working capital. . This resulted in a valuation considerably
and materially less than would have been reached by a
fair and just consideration of all the facts. The valuation cannot be sustained. Other objections to the valuation need not be considered.
3. Rate of return. The state commission found that
the company's net annual income should be approximately $37,000, in order to enable it to earn 8 per cent.
for return and depreciation upon the value of its property as fixed by it. Deducting 2 per cent. for depreciation, there remains 6 per cent. on $460,000, amounting to
$27,600 for return. This was approved, by the state
court.
The company contends that the rate of return is too
low and confiscatory. What annual rate will constitute
just compensation depends upon many circumstances and
must be determined by the exercise of a fair and enlightened judgment, having regard to all relevant facts.
A public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it
to earn a return on the value of the property which it
employs for the convenience of the public equal to that
generally being made at the same time and in the same
general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding
risks and uncertainties; but it has no constitutional
right to profits such as are realized or anticipated in

BLUEFIELD CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM. 693
679

Opinion of the Court.

highly profitable enterprises or speculative ventures.
The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and
should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it
to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of
its public duties. A rate of return may be reasonable at
one time and become too high or too low by changes
affecting opportunities for investment, the money market and business conditions generally.
In 1909, this Court, in Willcox v. ConsolidatedGas Co.,
212 U. S. 19, 48-50, held that the question whether a rate
yields such a return as not to be confiscatory depends
upon circumstances, locality and risk, and that no proper
rate can be established for all cases; and that, under the
circumstances of that case, 6 per cent. was a fair return
on the value of the property employed in supplying gas
to the City of New York, and that a rate yielding that
return was not confiscatory. In that case the investment
was held to be safe, returns certain and risk reduced almost to a minimum-as nearly a safe and secure investment as could be imagined in regard to any private manufacturing enterprise.
In 1912, in Cedar Rapids Gas Light Co. v. Cedar
Rapids, 223 U. S. 655, 670, this Court declined to reverse
the state court where the value of the plant considerably
exceeded its cost, and the estimated return was over 6
per cent.
In 1915, in Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238
U. S. 153, 172, this Court declined to reverse the United
States District Court in refusing an injunction upon the
conclusion reached that a return of 6 per cent. per annum
upon the value would not be confiscatory.
In 1919, this Court in Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, 250
U. S. 256, 268, declined on the facts of that case to approve a finding that no rate yielding as much as 6 per

Opinion of the Court.

262 U. S.

cent. on the invested capital could be regarded as confiscatory.

Speaking for the Court, Mr. Justice Pitney

said:
"It is a matter of common knowledge that, owing
principally to the world war, the costs of labor and supplies of every kind have greatly advanced since the ordinance was adopted, and largely since this cause was last
heard in the court below. And it is equally well known
that annual returns upon capital and enterprise the world
over have materially increased, so that what would have
been a proper rate of return for capital invested in gas
plants and similar public Utilities a few years ago furnishes no safe criterion for the present or for the future."
In 1921, in Brush Electric Co. v. Galveston, the United
States District Court held 8 per cent. a fair rate of return.'
In January, 1923, in Minneapolis v. Rand, the Circuit
Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit (285 Fed. 818,
830) sustained, as against the attack of the city on the
ground that it was excessive, 71/2 per cent., found by a
special master and approved by the District Court as a
fair and reasonable return on the capital investmentthe value of the property.
Investors take into account the result of past operations, especially in recent years, when determining the
terms upon which they will invest in such an undertaking. Low, uncertain or irregular income makes for
low prices for the securities of the utility and higher rates
of interest to be demanded by investors. The fact that
the company may not insist as a matter of constitutional
right that past losses be made up by rates to be applied
in the present and future tends to weaken credit, and the
fact that the utility is protected against being compelled
to serve for confiscatory rates tends to support it. In
'This case was affirmed by this Court, June 4, 1923, ante, 443.

Syllabus.

this case the record shows that the rate of return has been
low through a long period up to the time of the inquiry
by the commission here involved. For example, the average rate of return on the total cost of the property from
1895 to 1915, inclusive, was less than 5 per cent.; from
1911 to 1915, inclusive, about 4.4 per cent., without allowance for depreciation. In 1919 the net operating income was approximately $24,700, leaving $15,500, approximately, or 3.4 per cent. on $460,000 fixed by the
commission, after deducting 2 per cent. for depreciation.
In 1920, the net operating income was approximately
$25,465, leaving $16,265 for return, after allowing for depreciation. Under the facts and circumstances indicated
by the record, we think that a rate of return of 6 per cent.
upon the value of the property is substantially too low to
constitute just compensation for the use of the property
employed to render the service.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of
West Virginia is reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS concurs in the judgment of reversal for the reasons stated by him in Missouri ex rel.
