BIANCHI ET AL. v. MORALES ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR PORTO RICO.

No. 934. Motion to affirm or advance, and to vacate stay, submitted
April 16, 1923.-Decided May 7, 1923.
1. The court may affirm a decree dismissing a suit, without putting
the parties to the expense of printing the full record, when the
facts stated and admitted in the motion papers make it plain
that the suit cannot be maintained. P. 171.
2. The law of Porto Rico providing for summary foreclosure of
mortgages without allowing other defenses than payment, but
leaving the mortgagor plenary opportunity to assert other objections

by separate suit, clearly does not deprive him of property without
due process of law. Id.
Affirmed.
APPEAL

from a decree of the District Court of the

United States for Porto Rico, dismissing, for want of
jurisdiction, a bill to restrain summary foreclosure proceedings.

BIANCHI v. MORALES.
170

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a bill in equity filed in the District Court to
restrain proceedings under the Mortgage Law of Porto
Rico to foreclose a mortgage. That law gives a summary
suit in which, speaking broadly, no defence is open except
payment, Mortgage Law Regulations, Art. 175, and it is
contended that this deprives the plaintiffs, (appellants,)
of their property without due process of law. The statutes give a separate action to annul the mortgage in
which any defence to it may be set up, and also provide for
a cautionary notice, Mortgage Law, Art. 42; Mortgage Law
Regulations, Art. 91, which the Supreme Court of Porto
Rico regards as a sufficient substitute for an injunction.
American Trading Co. v. Monserrat, 18 P. R. 268. See
Romeu v. Todd, 206 U. S. 358. The bill was dismissed
by the District Court for want of jurisdiction. The appellees move that the decree be affirmed.
The facts stated and admitted in the motion papers
make it so plain that the bill cannot be maintained that
we shall affirm the decree below without putting the parties to the expense of printing the full record. Apart
from other matters urged by the appellees the constitutional objection is simply another form of the objection
to the separation between possessory and petitory suits
familiar to countries that inherit Roman law and not
wholly unfamiliar in our own. The United States, the
States, and equally Porto Rico, may exclude all claims of
ultimate right from possessory actions, consistently with
due process of law. Grant Timber & Manufacturing Co.
v. Gray, 236 U. S. 133. Central Union Trust Co. v. Garvan, 254 U. S. 554. Before these decisions it had been
strongly intimated by Chief Justice White that the foreclosure by summary process allowed by the law of Porto
Rico was valid, Torres v. Lathrop, Luce & Co., 231 U. S.
171, 177, and a decision to the same effect was rendered by

In view of these decisions we are of opinion

that the constitutional question raised was only colorable
and that the decree dismissing the bill was right.

APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.

Nos. 560-566.

Argued December 6, 7, 1922.-Decided May 7, 1923.

1. The tax imposed by Laws of Minnesota, 1921, c. 223, on the
business of mining iron ore, measured by a percentage of the value
of the ore mined or produced, is an occupation tax. P. 176.
2. The mining of ore, even when substantially all of the ore mined is
immediately and continuously loaded on cars and shipped into
other States to satisfy existing contracts,-is not interstate commerce and is subject to local taxation. P. 177.
3. The facts that the Minnesota tax, supra, applies only to those
engaged, as owners or lessees, in mining or producing ores on their
own account, and not to those who do mining work for them
