Argunent for Plaintiffs in Error.

219 U. S.

BONNER v. GORMAN, ADMINISTRATOR.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.
No. 102.

Submitted February 23, 1909.-Decided April 5, 1909.

When parties have been fully heard in the regular course of judicial
proceedings an erroneous decision does not deprive the unsuccessful

party of his property without due process of law within the meaning
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Where the Federal question is raised for the first time on the second
appeal and the state court refuses to consider it, it comes too late.

Unless a decision upon the Federal question is necessary to the judgmefit, or was in fact made the grouno of the judgment, this court has
no jutisdiction to review the judgment of the state court.

TH facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. James-P. Clarke, Mr. Rufus J. Williams and Mr. J. R.
Beasley, .for plaintiffs" in error:
There can be no reasonable doubt of the existence of a Federal question in this case.
But whether there is a Federal question or not will be determined by this court for itself upon an examination of the
record. Freeland v. Williams, 131 U. S. 405; Davidson v. New
Ofleans, 96 U. S. 97.
The Supreme, Court of 'Arkansas having denied a constitu1onal right this court has jurisdiction to review the judgment.
Boyd v. Thayer,: 143 U. S. 135.
Raising the, Federal. question for the first time in the appellate state court, if it be there considered, or necessarily involved
in the decision, gives the right of review in this court. Railfoad

In every judicial proceeding a fair trial is an indispensable

Unless the party to be affected has an opportunity of being
heard respecting the justice of the judgment sought it is not
due process. Railroad Tax Cases, 13 Fed. Rep. 722.
No judgment of a court is due process of law if rendered without jurisdiction. Scott v. McNeal, 1541. S. 34.
Mr. John Gatling, for defendants in error:
A real and not a fictitious Federal question is essential to
the jurisdiction of this court over the judgments of state courts.

matter in which the Federal question is alleged to have been
involved was made. Caperton v. Bower, 14 Wall. '216.

decided in the Supreme Court of the State, yet if so, it was not

Not only the judgment but the evidence clearly shows that
the plaintiffs in error were represented by counsel, so there was
no want of due process or any fraud in the judgment. If it
was erroneous, the remedy is by appeal.
The Federal question was raised too late. It was first suggested on the second appeal to the Supreme Court of the State,
and then only on a motion to advance and affirm as a delay
case. Union Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Kirchoff, 169 U. S. 110.

, MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the

court.
In 1893 L. P. Featherstone qualified as administrator of the
estate of Mary A. Cole, deceased, in the Probate Court of St.
Francis County, Arkansas, with E. Bonner, one of the plaintiffs
in error, as one of the sureties on his bond. In 1894, Featherstone, as administrator, filed his first settlement, and moved
from Arkansas to Texas in 1895. Some time after he left the
State, .Henry P. Gorman, the defendant in error, was appointed
by the Probate Court administrator in succession, and on February 1, 1898, he filed his first settlement, a second settlement
in 1901, and in 1903 his third settlement. July 19, 1899, two

of Featherstone's bondsmen, said E. Bonner and W. H. Coffey,
oppeared in the Probate Court in obedience to its order and
filed the final settlement of Featherstone as administrator, in
which there appeared to be a balance due to him df $23.57.
To this settlement Gorman, administrator, and one of the heirs
of the estate, appeared and filed exceptions. These exceptions
were sustained by the Probate Court January 29, 1900, and a'
balance of $991.28 found due from Featherstone as administrator, and he was ordered to pay the same over to Gorman, as
the administrator in succession. From this order and judgment
of the Probate Court, Featherstone and his sureties, E. Bonner
and Coffey, took an appeal to the Circuit Court, which appeal
was dismissed by that court at the March term, 1901, for some
informality as the state Supreme Court says.
February 12, 1900, suit was brought in the Circuit Court of
St. Francis County by Gorman, administrator, against said
BonneT and Coffey, to enfowce the payment of the said judgment of $991.28. In this suit Bonner and Coffey filed an answer and a cross-complaint, to which Gorman, as administrator,
filed a demurrer, which was sustained by the court, and judgment entered in favor of administrator Gorman against said
sureties for $991.28. From this judgment the sureties appealed
to the state Supreme Court, where it was affirmed October 10,
1903. Bonner v. Gorman, 71 Arkansas, 480.
The court ruled, as sufficiently stated in the headnote, that
"in a suit against the sureties of an administrator to recover
the amount that had been adjudged by the Probate Court
to be due by him to the estate, it is no defense that the Probate
Court erred in finding that any amount was due by such administrator, as the error should have been corrected -on appeal."
To restrain the enforcement of this judgment, E. Bonner
filed a bill in the Chancery Court of St. Francis County, Arkansas, at the December term, 1903. To this bill administrator
Gorman and the heirs filed a demurrer on May 9, 1904, which
was overruled by the court, and they then filed an answer.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

213 U. a

The Chancery Court rendered a decree in favor of plaintiff E.
Bonner,, enjoining Gorman, as administrator, and the heirs at
law of Mary A. Cole, from executing that judgment. From
this decree Gorman and the heirs at law appealed to the state
Supreme Court, where it was, on October 22, 1906, reversed,
annulled and set aside, and the cause remanded to the Chancery
Court, with directions to dismiss the complaint for want of
equity. Gorman v; Bonner, 80 Arkansas, 339.
The rulings of the court were that "under the code a defendant cannot permit judgment to go against him upon a legal liability, and then enjoin the judgment in equity upon -equitable
grounds known before the judgment at law was rendered; a
judgment of the Circuit Court against an administrator and his
bondsmen will not be enjoined in equity on the ground that it
was based on a void or fraudulent probate judgment, as that
was matter of defense which might have been pleaded in the
Circuit Court." The court also added that "it is not alleged or
shown that there was any fraud in the procurement of the judgment at law, and we see no valid reason why it should be enjoined."
At the December term, 906, of the Chancery Court a decree
was entered upon, and in accordance with, the mandate of the
Supreme Court, whereupon the said E. Bonner and E. L. Bonner, the latter being the surety. on the injunction bond, prayed
an appeal to the Supreme Court, which was granted. Gorman, administrator, and others, then appellees, filed a motion
to advance this appeal and affirm the case as a delay case, and
the Supreme Court granted the motion to advance and affirmed
the decree. The Supreme Court rendered a per curiam opinion,
which is to be found in Bonner v. Gormn, 101 S. W. Rep. 1153.
This memorandum stated that "The only question in the case
is whether the.decree is in conformity to the mandate of this
court. The record has been carefully looked into and the decree found to be in strict accord with the mandate and opinion
of the court and-there-is nothing new for consideration. Ordinarily this would stamp this case as a delay case and it should

Opinion of the Court.

be advanced and affirmed and under the practice in such cases
the ten per cent penalty would be added. But it is evident from
the record that the appellant has brought this case here in order
to seek a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United
States. It will be with the Chief Justice to decide whether
there is a Federal question herein, but when a case is manifestly brought here in good faith to obtain 6 review in the Federal Supreme Court, although there is nothing in it for this
court to consider, yet such object prevents it being the class of
cases where the penalty should be inflicted."
A writ of error from this court was allowed May 9, 1907, the
petition for the writ* containing an assignment of errors, of
which one was that the judgment of the Probate Court was null
and void, and all other judgments based upon it were void also,
so that the Bonners, appellants, by. their enforcement, were
deprived of their property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The record was filed
here June 3, 1907 and the case submitted February 23, 1909.
No Federal question was raised in this case prior to the trial
and judgment on the merits. The only suggestion that such a
question was involved was put forward after the state Supreme
Court had affirmed on the second appeal the judgment rendered by the Circuix Court in strict obedience to its Mandate.
Compliance with the mandate was in fact the only question
open to and determined by the higher court.
It is firmly established that when parties have been fully
heard in the regular course of judicial proceedings an erroneous
decision of the state court does not deprive the unsuccessful
party of his property without due process of law within the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,
Central- Land Company v. Laidley, 159 U. S. 103, 112, and,
that where a Federal question is raised on a second appeal and
the state court refuses to consider it, it comes too late. Union

state courts, unless a decision upon a Federal question was nec-.

the writ of error must be dismissed." Arkansas Southern Railroad Company v. German National Bank, 207 U. S. 270; California Powder Works v. Davis, 151 U. S. 389; St. L., I. M. &

UNITED STATES v. DICKINSON.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST
CIRCUIT.
No. 362. Argued January 4, 5, 1909.-Decided April 5, 1909.
The writ of certiorari cannot be granted under the act of March 3, 1891,
c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, in a criminkl case at the instance of the United
States whatever the supposed importance of the questions involved.
United States v. Sanges, 144 U. S. 310, distinguished.
The power of this court to issue the writ of certiorari under § 14 of the
Judiciary Act of 1789, now § 716, Rev. Stat., is not a grant of appellate jurisdiction to review for correction of mere error.
The act of March.2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246, giving an appeal to the
Government in certain criminal cases cannot be extended beyond
its terms, or construed so as to extend the power of certiorari under
the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, to bring up a criminal
case for the correction of mere error at the instance of the United
States.
