Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

213 U. S.

MAIORANO v. BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD
COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 103.

Argued March 5, 8, 1909.-Decided April 5, 1909.

The construction of a state statute by the highest court of the State
must be accepted by this court even though similar statutes of other
States have been differently construed by the highest courts of those
States.
A treaty between the United States and a foreign government within
the constitutional limits of the treaty making power is, by the dxpress words of the Constitution, the supreme law of the land binding
alike on national and state courts and must be enforced by them in
the litigation of private rights.
While undoubtedly the giving of actions for injury and death results
in care and security against accidents to travelers the protection and
security thus afforded are too remote to be considered as elements
in. contemplation of the contracting powers to the treaty of 1871 between Italy and the United States.
3y a fair construction, Articles 2, 3 and 23 of the treaty with Italy of
1871, 17 Stat. 845, do not confer upon the non-resident alien relatives of a citizen of Italy a right of action for damages for his death
in one of the States of this Union although such an action is afforded
by a statute of that State to native resident relatives, and although
the existence of such an action might indirectly promote his safety;
and so held as to the statute of Pennsylvania, it having been so con-โข
strued by the highest court of that State.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. George Calvert Bradshaw (by special leave), with whom
Mr. William Henry Seward Thomson and Mr. Walter V. R.
Berry were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The claim of plaintiff in error is based not alone upon the

treaty with Italy, but upon the treaty and the Pennsylvania

statute. The error committed in the Pennsylvania court was
by wrongly interpreting the meaning of this treaty and its effect
upon the Pennsylvania law. Deni v. Penna.R. R., 181 Pa. St.
521.
The purpose and effect of fatal accidents acts is to protect
human life. Stewart v. B. & 0. R. R. Co., 168 U. S. 445; Mulhall
v. Fallon, 176 Massachusetts,. 266; Kellyville Coal Co. v. Petraytis, 195 Illinois, 217; Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. V.
Osgood, 73 N. E. Rep. 285, 286; Trota v. Johnston, 28 Ky. Law
Rep. 853. This being so, the giving to the wife or heirs of the
deceased an action to recover damages for his wrongful death
is a plain, ordinary and efficacious means of protecting and securing his life from negligence. He cannot sue if killed, but his
heirs can; and the value of his life can be measured by his earning power, and the defendant compelled to pay accordingly.
It makes no difference to the negligent defendant who sues, or
upon what theory the action is maintained. It must pay for
its negligence, and the fact that the action exists is the cause
compelling the defendant to exercise care and use every means
possible to prevent accidents.
Under Article 3 of the treaty with Italy, all the remedies
known to the law by which security and protection are afforded
to the persons of Americans are, by force of this article of the
treaty, intended to be granted to Italian subjects.
The action for death, while it may be a new right of action
in legal theory and not a survival of the right which existed in
the husband, is but a substitute for his action and is founded
upon the injury done to him, and cannot be maintained except
as a substitute for his right of action; nor can it be maintained
unless it can be shown that there has been a wrong and injury
committed against the deceased. The widow in her action.
brings but a substitute -for the right of action which would have
belonged, to her husband and did belong to her husband before
his decease. -He may settle or prosecute his claim to judgment,
and if so, she has no action. It is only where there has been no

widow has any standing to maintain her action; and the Pennsylvania courts have distinctly repudiated the idea that the
widow can maintain an action where the husband has released
or settled his claim. Hill v. Pennsylvania Railroad,178 Pa. St.
227; Northern Pacific R. R. Co.. v. Adams, 192 U. S. 440.
The right of free access to the courts, as granted by Article
23 of this treaty, means, among other things, the right to
maintain actions at law in the same way as citizens.
Mr. Johns McCleave, with whom Mr. John S. Wendt was on
the brief, for defendant in error:
Fixed and received construction of the statute laws of a
State by its own courts, constitute a part, of such statutory law.

The Federal courts will respect state court decisions and will
regard them as conclusive in all cases upon the constructio4 of
their own constitution and laws. Brown v. Runnells, 5 How.
139; Bucher v. Railroad Co., 125 U. S. 583; Garnley v. Clark,
134 U. S: 348.
The right to recover for injury to the person resulting in death
is of very recent origin and depends wholly upon statutes of the
different States. The questions growing out of these statutes
are new, and many of them unsettled. Each state court will
construe its own statute on the subject and differences are to be
expected. Dennick v. Railroad Company, 103 U.. S.11; Zeiger
v. Penna. R. R. Co., 151 Fed. Rep. 348; Fulko v. Schuylkill
Stone Co., 163 Fed. Rep. 124.
The treaty between the United States and the Kingdom of
Italy does not amend or alter the.eatutes of Pennsylvania, so
as to give a non-resident alien a right of action for the death of
a relative under such statutes.
In Pennsylvania, no right of, action has been given to Carmine Maiorano to recover damages for his own death. If one
is injured and brings suit to recover for the injury in his lifetime, and subsequently dies as a result of the injury, it is true
the right of action survives in the name of the administrator of

the decedent by virtue of ยง 18, of the act of April 15, 1851;
but where death results from the injury before any suit is
brought, the right of action of the injured man dies with him,
and does not survive to his administrator or other personal
representative. In such case the right of action is given by the
act of April 26, 1855, to the persons therein enumerated to
recove the pecuniary value to them of the life that has been
taken away. The action is not for the injury to the dead man,
but it is to restore compensation for his death to those who
were pecuniarily interested in the continuance of the life. It
is a new and distinct right of action created by the statute, and
vested in the parties named by force of the statute, and does
not come to them by way of succession or inheritance from the
dead man, because the dead man had no such right. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Zebe, 33 Pa. St. 318, 329; Fink v. Garman,
40 Pa. St. 95; Books v. Borough of Danville, 95 Pa. St. 158, 166;.

Railroad Company, 165 Pa. St. 339, 345; McCafferty v. Railroad Co., 193 Pa. St. 339, 345.
Punishment of the wrong-doer is not the object of the act,
but restoration to the'widow and children of the means of support, of which the wrong-doer has deprived them, in taking
away the life of their bread-winner.
Plaintiff can show, therefore, no right existing in her under
the statutes of Pennsylvania, and never being a sojourner or

of Italy and the United States.
MR. JUSTICE MOODY delivered the opinion of the court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.

213 U. S.

The plaintiff was a resident of Italy and a subject of the King
of Italy. By the statutory law of the State of Pennsylvania
(Act of April 15, 1851, P. L. 669, pars. 18 and 19, as amended
by the Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, par. 1), the right to
recover damages for death occasioned by unlawful violence or
negligence is in certain cases conferred upon the husband, wife,
children or parents of the person killed. By its literal terms
the benefits of the statute are extended to all such surviving
relatives, irrespective of their condition. It has, however, been
held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in the case of Deni
v. PennsylvaniaR. R. Co., 181 Pa. St. 525, as well as in the case
at bar, that this statute does not give to relatives of the deceased, who are non-resident aliens, the right of action therein
provided for. There is nothing in this case to take it out of, th.e
general rule that the construction of a.state statute by the highest court of the State must be accepted by this court. It is,
therefore, not material that similar statutes have been differently construed, as, for instance, in Mulhall v. Fallon, 176 Massachusetts, 266, and Kellyville Coal Co. v. Petraytis,195 Illinois,
217.
The plaintiff rests her right to recover not upon this statute
alone, but upon certain provisions of a treaty between the
United States and the King of Italy, ratifications of which were
exchanged on November 18, 1871. 17 Stat. 845. She asserts
that the effect of the treaty was to confer upon the plaintiff the
same right to recover damages for the death of her husband
that she would have enjoyed by the statute of the State of.
Pennsylvania if she had been a resident and citizen of tlhat
State. The contention of the plaintiff in this respect was denied
by the trial court, which granted a judgment of nonsuit, which
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, and is now
here on writ of error. The only question for our decision is
whether a proper interpretation and effect were allowed to the
treaty.
We do not, deem it necessary to consider the constitutional
limits of the treaty-7,aaking power. A treaty, within those

limits, by the express words of the Constitution, is the supreme
law of the land, binding alike National and state courts, and
is capable of enforcement, and must be enforced by them in
the litigation of private rights. Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199;
United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cr. 103,110; Fosterv. Neilson,
2 Pet. 253, 314; Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U. S. 483; per Mr.
Justice Miller, in Head-money Cases, 112 U. S. 580, 598, quoted
with approval by Mr. Chief-Justice Fuller in In re Cooper, 143
U. S. 472, 501; United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407, 418;
Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U. S. 258.
We put our decision upon the words of the treaty. By a fair
interpretation of them, did they directly confer upon the plaintiff the right which she seeks to maintain? We are of the opinion that they did not.
Three articles only are relied on as material. They are:
Article 2.
"The citizens of each of the high contracting parties shall
have liberty to travel in the States and Territories of the other,
to carry on trade, wholesale and retail, to hire and occupy
houses and warehouses, to employ agents of their choice, and"
generally to do anything incident to, or necessary for trade,
upon the same terms as the natives of the country, submitting
themselves to the laws there established."
Article 3.
"The citizens of each of the high contracting parties shall
receive, in the States and Territories of the other, the most
constant protection and security for their persons and property,
and shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and privileges
as are, or shall be, granted to the natives, on their submitting
themselves to the conditions imposed upon the natives."
Article 23.
"The citizens of either party shall have free access to the
courts of justice, in order to maintain and d3fend their Own
rights, without any other conditions, restrictions, or taxes than.
VOL. ccxI-18

such as are imposed upon the natives. They shall, therefore,
be free to employ, in defense of their rights, such advocates,
solicitors, notaries, agents and factors as they may judge
proper, in all their trials at law; and such citizens or agents
shall have free opportunity to be present at the decisions and
sentences of the tribunals in all caves which may concern them,
and, likewise, at the taking of all examinations and evidences
which may be exhibited in the said trials."
Article 23 bestows upon citizens of either power, whether
resident or non-resident, free access to the courts, "in order to
maintain and defend their own rights," with the ancillary
privileges of suitors. ,This article does not define substantive
rights, but leaves them' to be ascertained by the law governing
the courts and administered and enforced in them.
Articles 2 and 3 deal with the rights of the citizens, of one
party sojourning in the territory of the other. There seems to
be nothing pertinent to the case in Article 2. But special stress
is laid upo'n Article 3, which stipulates for the citizens of each,
in the territory of the other, equality with the natives of rights
and privileges in respect of protection and security of person
and property. It cannot be contended that protection and
security for the person or property of the plaintiff herself have
been withheld from her in the territory of the United States,
because neither she nor her property has ever been within that
territory. She herself, therefore, is entirely outside the scope
of the article. The argument, however, is that if the right of
action for her husband's death is denied to her, that he, the
husband, has not enjoyed the equality of protection and security for his person which this article of the treaty assures to
him. It is said that if compensation for his death is withheld
from his surviving relatives, a motive for caring for his safety
is removed, the chance of his death by unlawful violence or
negligence is increased, and thereby the protection and security
of his'person are materially diminished. The conclusion is
drawn that a full compliance with the treaty demands that,
f6r his protection and security, this adtion by his surviving

MAIORANO v. BALTIMORE & OHIO R. R. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

relative should lie. The argument is not without force. Doubtless one reason which has induced legislators to give to surviving relatives an action for death has been the hope that care
for.life would be stimulated. This thought was dwelt upon in
Mulhall v. Fallon, supra, in considering a statute which made
the amount recoverable dependent upon the degree of culpability of the negligent person. Another reason for such legisla-'
tion, quite as potent, was the desire to secure compensation
to those who might be supposed to suffer directly and materially by the death. This thought seems to have been uppermost
in Pennsylvania, according to the courts of that State. See
Chambers v. B. & 0. R. R. Co., 207 U. S. 142, and cases cited.
Without dwelling further upon the purpose and effect of legislation of this kind, and assuming that both might be calculated
in some degree to increase the protection and security of persons
who may be exposed to dangers, we are of opinion thatthe protection and security thus afforded are so indirect and remote
that the contracting powers cannot fairly be thought to have
had them in contemplation.
If an Italian subject, sojourning in this country, is himself
given all the direct protection and security afforded by the laws
to our own people, including all rights of actions for himself or
his personal representatives to safeguard the protection, and security, the treaty is fully complied with, without going further
and giving to his non-resident alien relatives a right of action.
for damages for his death, although such action is afforded to
native resident relatives, and although the existence of such
an action may indirectly promote his safety.
