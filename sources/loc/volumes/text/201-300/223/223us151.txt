affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy
to some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the
-State that it establish its right to exist as. a State, repub-"
lican in form.
As the issues presented, in, their very essence, are, and
have long since by this court been, definitely determined to
be political and governmental,. and embraced within the
scope. of the powers conferred upon Congress, and not
therefore within the reach of judicial power, it follows that
the case presented is not within our jurisdiction,, and the
writ of error must therefore be, and it is, dismissed for
,want of jurisdiction.
Dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

Pacific .States Telephone Co'. v,"Oregon, ante, p. 11 8,tfollowed to the
effect that the determination of whether the government of a State
is republican in form withmn the meaning Of § 4 ofArt. IV of the"

Where the record does not contain the petition for rehearing but the

THEi facts, which involve the constitutionality under
§ 4,of Art. IV of the Federal Constitution of the initiative
and referendum provision of the 'constitution of the State
of Oregon, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Ralph R. Duniway, with whom Mr. T. J. Geisler
was on the brief, for plaintiff in .error:
The initiative and referendum amendment, Art. IV,
§ 1, of the Oregon constitution, adopted June 2, 1902, is
'invalid, as it changes the former republican form of government of the State of Oregon into a pure democracy, in
violation of § 4, Art. IV, ofthe Co'nstitution of the United
States, which guarantees to every State in this Union a
republican form of government. Crampton v. Zabriskie,

Whether the constitutional amendment to a state constitution violates the Federal Constitution is a judicial

The fact that a constitution (Oklahoma) containing
similar provisions to Art. IV, § 1, but not similar to
Art. IV, § la and Art. XI, § 2, was submitted to Congress,

cannot make such provisions valid. Gunn v. Barry, 15

The framers of the Constitution of the United States
established a republican form of government by means
of electing representatives of the people to carry on the
government, as distinguished from a, democracy. Minor
v. Happersett,21 Wall. 162, 175.
The power left to the legislature by the Oregon amendment is merely permissive. The legislative power may be
taken away entirely by the electors under the initiative
and referendum amendment.
By later .constitutional amendments the power of the
legislature has already been materially curtailed, if it can
be done.
See Art. IX, § la as to poll or head taxes; and the
amendment and Art. XI, § 2, attempting to take away
power to legislate as to liquor and give it to the people;
amrendment, now Art. XI, § 10, attempting to delegate
to the electors of counties unlimited power to go into debt
to build permanent roads within the county; all passed
November 8, 1910.
If these initiative and referendum amendments are
valid, the legislature can be abolished and, all the legislative functions of the State performed by the electors under
the initiative and referendum amendments.

Under this "Oregon system" the electors can call a
measure a constitutional amendment, and it is beyond the
reach of legislature or courts.
The electors can enact constitutional amendments as
easy as they can enact statutes. The only difference in
the enactment is naming the act a constitutional amendinent instead of a statute.
The veto power of the Governor has been curtailed by
the initiative and referendum amendment, Art. IV, § 1.
State v. Kline, 50 Oregon, 431; Kadderly v. Portland,44
Oregon, 118; Oregon v. Pacific States Telephone Co., 53
Oregon, 164.
It would be but a short step further for the electors to
abolish the state courts and try lawsuits by secret ballot
under the initiative and referendum amendment. The
same statutory proceeding of filing statements for cornplaint and answer and having a ballot title to be voted for
and a -hearing by buying space in the state panphlet could
be used. Laws of Oregon, 1907, p. -398.

has been upheld by the Supreme Court of Oregon in Acme

That Oregon is now a pure democracy is clear.
i2e, liberty and property are protected in Oregon by
the good sense of the electors as expressed directly at an
election, and in no other way.
The checks and balances of the republican ' form of
goverpnent for the protection of the .individual and
minority -are abolished in Oregon.

for an indestructible union of indestructible republican
States. Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 730. The "'Oregon system" is an attempt of an individual State to change its
republican form of government into a pure democracy
without the amendment of the United States Constitution
permitting that to be done.
The South Dakota initiative and referendum, for instance, is only the right to petition the legislature, and is
not revolutionary at all. It does not conflict with the
United States Constitution. The revolutionary initiative
and'referendum of Oregon does.
Oregon under the initiative and referendum and recall
has a system in which it is hard to get'the courts to decide
a case against the vote of the plurality of the people supported by clamor among politicians and newspapers for
a given decision. Such a method of enacting law is not
due process of law. Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall..

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the
court:
Following the' incorporation into the constitution of the
State of Oregon in 1902 of the initiative and referendum
amendment referred to in the case of Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, just decided, two other
amendments to the constitution were adopted by that
method, designated, the first as Article IV, § la, and
the second as Article XI, § 2. The pertinent provisions
of Article IV, § la, and of Article XI, § 2, are in the
margin.'
1 Aricle

IV, section la. The initiative And referendum powers reserved to the people by this constitution are hereby further reserved
to the legal voters of every municipality and district, as to all local,
special and municipal legislation, of every character, in or for their respective municipalities and districts. The manner of exercising said
powers shall be prescribed by general laws, except that cities and
towns may provide for the manner of exercising the initiative and
referendum powers as to their municipal legislation. Not more than
ten per cent of the legal voters may be required to order the referendum
nor more than fifteen per cent to propose any measure, by the initiative, in any city or town.
Article XI, section 2. Corporations may be formed under general
laws, but shall not be created by the legislative assembly by special
laws. The legislative assembly shall not enact, amend, or repeal any
charter or act of incorporation for any municipality, city, or town.
The legal voters of every city and town are hereby granted power to

The legislature (Feb. 25, 1907, Laws of 1907, chap.
226, p. 398), authorized municipalities to provide by
ordinance for carrying into effect the initiative and referendum powers reserved by the amendment to the Constitution just quoted. The city of Portland adopted
ordinance No. 16311, providing the methods by which
the initiative and referendum powers of the city should be
exerted. We quote in the margin I from the opinion of the
enact and amend their municipal charter, subject to the constitution
and criminal laws of the State of Oregon. (1 Lord's Oregon Laws,
pp. 91, 118.)
'On April 7, 1908, an initiative petition, containing, the required
number of signatures, was filed with the council, requesting the city
to build a bridge across the Willamette river, from Broadway street
in East Portland to the west side of the river, whereupon the City of
Portland took steps to obtain plans and specifications for building
said bridge. On May 8, 1908, the auditor notified the mnayor of the
-filing of-said petition, and requested him to comply with his duties
under the charter in regard thereto. On October 20, 1908, the petition, containing a sufficient number of signatures, was presented to the
council at a legally called meeting, and'at said date the council requested the opinion of the city attorney as to the validity thereof.
On October 27, 1908, the *attorneyfiled his opinion, affirming its validity, and thereafter, on. November 11, 1908, the council passed an
ordinance (No. 18,531) submitting to a vote of the people an amendment to the city charter, providing for the construction of said bridge
and for issuing bonds in'
the sum of not.to exceed $2,000,000 to pay for
the same, designating said proposed amendment as § 11812 of Art. VI
of Chap. 3, and on November 25, 1908, the council passed a resolution,
submitting the proposed amendment to a vote of the people at a
special election on April 23, 1909. Thereafter, on February 17, 1909,
the council passed an ordinance (No. 18,976), amending ordinance
No. 18,531, so as to fix the date ef the election on May 8, 1909, in-

stead of April 23, as originally specified.. On March 31, 1909, the
council passed an ordinance (No. 19,174) expressly repealing ordinance No. 18,531 as amended, and no special election was held under
any ordinance or resolution. On March 31, 1909, the same date as
that of the repealing ordinance, a resolution was passed, authorizing
the'submission of the charter amendment to a vote of the people at
the general election to be held June 7, 1909. More than twenty days

Opinion of the Court.

Supreme Court of Oregon in this case the facts concerning the action taken by the municipality leading up to the
adoption of an ordinance which forms the subject-matter
of this controversy.
The ordinance in question was entitled "To amend
Article VI of chapter 3 of the Charter of the City of
Portland . . . by inserting a section in said Article VI of chapter.3 after section 118 and before section 119
thereof, which shall be designated in the Charter as section one hundred and eighteen and a half (11812) of
Article VI of chapter 3.'_ Omitting details, the amendment conferred upon the council of the city authority
to issue and dispose.of bonds of the city not exceeding
-two millions of dollars, to be sold, as occasion might require, to enable the Executive Board of the city of Portland to construct in the name of the city of Portland a*
bridge with proper approaches and terminals "across the
Willamette river in said city from Broadway street at or
near its intersection with Larrabee street on the east
side of said river.
.
." The amendment gave power
to the Executive Board in building the authorized bridge
to "erect and construct .
.
subject to such regulations'as may be imposed by the United States, piers, abutments and other necessary supports in the bed of the Willamette river for the foundation of such bridge." Again, as
stated by the Supreme Court of Oregon, pursuant to the
submission to voters as above stated, "on June 7th the.
election was held, at which there were cast for the amendment 10,087 votes, and against it 6,061, and on June.21st
the mayor proclaimed that the amendment had been
adopted." Following the adoption of the ordinance, on
October 27, 1909, the council passed an ordinance
prior to the election the auditor of the city-published the proposed
charter amendment, with the ballot in full, in the city's official newspaper, as required by law, and also sent out and distributed copies of
said amendment to the voters of the city. -.
VOL. CCXXIIi-11

Opinion of the Court.

223 U. S.

(No. 20208), authorizing the issue and sale of two hundred
and fifty, thousand dollars of the bonds provided for.in the
amendment to the charter for the purpose of obtaining
funds to commence the construction of the bridge. On
the promulgation of this ordinance the present suit was
begun by the plaintiff in error in a state court with the
object of enjoining the sale of the bonds and preventing
the carrying out of the amendment of the city charter
which had been adopted in pursuance of the vote as above
stated. The right to stand in judgment for this purpose
was based upon the interest of the complainant as a citizen and taxpayer. The complaint stated a multitude of
grounds, assailing in every conceivable form the power to
authorize the voters of the municipality to resort to the
initiative for the purpose of amending the charter; and the
repugnancy of the delegation of that power and of the
charter amendment adopted in pursuance of it to many
provisions of the state constitution and the Constitution
of the United States. The regularity of the proceedings
taken to adopt the amendment was also elaborately assailed. The city answered. The case was submitted to the
trial court on bill and answer, and resulted in the dismissal
of the bill. The case was taken to the Supreme Court of
the State, where that judgment was affirmed. The court
delivered two opinions, one on the first hearing and the
other on a rehearing. The first carefully disposed of the
many objections made to the power under the state constitution to confer on the voters of the municipality the
authority to amend the charter and to the regularity of
the proceedings leading up to the adoption of the amendment, and to the proceedings culminating in the adoption
of the assailed ordinance. The various contentions concerning these subjects, based upon the Constitution of the
United States, were also disposed of in the course of the
opinion. We have not examined the petition for the rehearing, as it was omitted in printing the record, but it is

KIERNAN v. PORTLAND, ORE.
223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

inferable, from the elaborate opinion which was delivered
on the rehearing, that the main grounds urged for a rehearing were based on the absence of power in a State to
adopt the methods of initiative and referendum, and the
effect of doing so on the continued existence of a government republican in form. We think this is the reasonable
inference, as those subjects were elaborately reviewed by
the court on the rehearing.
The errors assigned are numerous and involve assumed
state and Federal questions so interwoven as to cause it to
be difficult to separate them or state with precision the,
questions of a Federal nature which they embrace. We
need-not, however, undertake to do so, as all the questions
which it is deempd arise for consideration are in the argument reduced to eight propositions, which are in the
margin.' Coming to test these propositions, we think on
their face it is apparent they are disposed of by either or
11.

Can the State of Oregon legally adopt the initiative and referen-

dum amendment to its constitution, Article IV, section 1, attempted
to be adopted June 2, 1902?
2. Can the electors of the State of Oregon legally adopt the further
initiative and referendum amendments to its constitution, Article IV,
section 1-A, and Article XI, Section 2, attempted to be adopted
June 4, 1906, by virtue of said Article IV, Section 1?
3. Can the electors of the City. of Portland legally adopt the pretended section 118!/ of the charter of the City of Portland, which is
printed above in this brief, by virtue of the above-mentioned initiative
and referendum amendments to the Oregon constitution?
4. Can the City of Portland legally issue bonds, tax plaintiff in
error, and build said Broadway Bridge across the navigable Willamette
River owned by the State of Oregon, by virtue of the said section 118Y2
of charter, attempted to be adopted at said city election under said
system of government?
• 5. The Supreme Court of Oregon committed error in
deciding that
the pretended section 118Y2 is invalid in so far as it attempts to impose
the care and maintenance of the Broadway Bridge upon Multnomah
County and then holding that saidI clause is severable from the rest of
the section, and the remainder of the section is valid, as thereby the

both of one or two considerations- (a) the necessary operation and effect of the opinion in Pacific States Telephone
& Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, just announced, or (b) the conclusive effect on questions of a local and state character
resulting from the action of the court below, and hence that
none of them have a foundation sufficiently substantial
to support the exertion of jurisdiction.
In saying this we are not unmindful that one of the assignments is based upon the contention that as the Willamette River was navigable, there was no power to build a
bridge over it without the consent of the Government of
the United States. But in the first place, we are unable
to perceive upon what theory the complainant possessed
the right to raise such a question, and in the second place,
the ordinance which empowered the bridge expressly exSupreme Court of Oregon attempted to legislate and authorize the
taxation of plaintiff in error and deprived him of the law of the land.
6. The Supreme Court of Oregon committed error in deciding that
the granting of a franchise and building a bridge across the Willamette
river, owned by the State of Oregon and controlled jointly by -the
United States of America and the State of Oregon, is a municipal purpose instead of a state purpose and can be granted by the electors of
the City of Portland in amending the charter of the City of Portland
under the said "Oregon system," as said decision denied to plaintiff in
error the law of the land.
7. The Supreme Court of Oregon committed error in deciding that
the Council and electors of the City of Portland can enact a charter
amendment to the charter of the City of Portland, under said "Oregon
system," by which the city could issue bonds in a large amount and
tax the property of plaintiff in error for the payment of the bonds as a
municipal' purpose, when it is a state purpose, and it is not within the
constitutional power of the people of the State of Oregon. to delegate
the power to tax without limitation and exercise state powers to the
electors of a municipality, and the attempt to do so is in violation of
sectimh I of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States; also in violation of sections 3 and 4 ol Article IV of the
Constitution of the United States of America, as such grant of power
would be for the State of Oregon to commit state suicide and dissolve
the State of Oregon into as many smaller States as there are munici-

acted that it should be built in conformity to the requirements of the authorities of the United States. It is to be
observed that both sides refer to and insert in their printed
arguments an act of the legislature of Oregon passed since
this writ of error was sued out (Jany. 18, 1911, Gen. Laws,
1911, c. 6, p. 23). Nothing could be more complete and
comprehensive in the manifestation of a purpose, so far
as there was power to do so, to cure*any and every possible defect. Its title is an indication of its purpose and
scope:
"An act to authorize the construction of a bridge known
as the Broadway bridge, to be built across the Willamette
River in the city of Portland in the State of Oregon and to
cure any errors or irregularities in the passage of the
amendment to. the charter of the city of Portland -authorpalities within the State and to change the republican government of
the State of Oregon into a confederacy of cities within the State of
Oregon, and tends to destroy our system of government created and
guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States of America.
8. The Supreme, Court of Oregon erred in,holding and deciding that
plaintiff, a citizen of the United, States, must-conform his conduct and
hold his property in state matters and tax matters, to a rule of conduct
or law enacted by mere numbers: of people and assemblages of people
within the borders of a municipality because it is not in accordance
With due process of law and is in violation of the law of the land to
require any citizen of the United States to conform his conduct, and
hold his property in state matters and in tax matters, to a rule of conduct or law, enacted directly by mere numbers of people or assemblages
of people within a municipal corporation,' and is contrary to section 1
of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
of America, sections 3 and 4 of article IV of the Constitution of the
United States of America; and also is contrary. to the implied provisions of the Constitution of the United States that government of the
several States shall be representative in form and that the several
States shall create and maintain representative legislative assemblies,
and that the citizens of the United States shall be protected in their
rights.of enjoyment of life, liberty and property by the law of the land
which is an inherent attribute of citizenship of the United States,
which no State or its people may impair.
