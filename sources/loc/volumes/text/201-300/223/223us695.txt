RIPLEY v. UNITED STATES.
UNITED STATES v. RIPLEY.
APPEALS FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

Nos. 498, 499. Submitted December 22, 1911.-Decided March 11, 1912.
Where the power of the Government over the contract is complete
and its agent's decision is conclusive, a corresponding duty exists
that the agent's judgment should be exercised reasonably, and with
due regard to the rights of both contracting parties; and in this case,
as the Court of Claims has found that the agent's decision was a
gross mistake and in bad faith, the contractor is entitled to recover the damages actually sustaihed by him by reason thereof.
Where there is no provision in the contract for an appeal from the
decision of the agent in charge, the contractor does not have to
appeal to a higher officer from the decision of the agent whose judgment and decision is expressly made final by the contract.
For the contractor to recover damages caused by an improper decision
of the Government's agent in charge, the burden is on him, and this
court must base its decision on the record.
Where the contract provides that the decisions of the engineer in charge
are final, they are so in the absence of fraud or gross mistake implying fraud; and, in the absence of a finding to the effect that there was
fraud, the contractor cannot recover damages on the ground that
such decisions were erroneous.

damages of a public work consequent upon the action of

the agent in charge.
By the act of June 13, 1902, 32 Stat. 340, Congress
appropriated $250,000 for the completion of the work of
improving the harbor of Aransas Pass, Texas. The contract was awarded to Henry C. Ripley. It provided for

the completion of a jetty, having a brush foundation, to
be covered with a layer of stone, on which Was to be built
a superstructure, with sloping sides and a top width of ten
feet. This superstructure waS to be formed of a core or
mound of riprap, "and when in the judgment of the
United States agent in charge, this mound has become
sufficiently consolidated, its gaps shall be filled and its
crest leVelled-; . . . large blocks shall then be bedded
in the crest of the mound. ' '
It was provided that"Where the contract contemplates the placing of the
materials in the work, the material shall be placed securely and carefully where directed'by the U. S. Agent in
charge.
"All material furnished and work done under this contract shall, before being accepted, be subject to a rigid
inspection by an inspectdr appointed on the part of the
Government, and such as does not conform to the specifications-set forth in this contract shall be rejected. The
decision of the Engineer Officer in charge as to quality and
quantity shall be final."
The contract also provided that the work should be
executed under the supervision of the engineer officer in
charge or his duly authorized agent. The United States
was to employ one or more inspectors, and the contractor,
without additional compensation, was bound to furnish
facilities for the inspection of work and material. The
contractor was to furnish extra labor at cost prices, as
determined by the engineer, and should furnish board
and lodging to Government employs at reasonable rates
satisfactory to the engineer.. If the work was not diligently prosecuted the contract might be annulled, or the
engineer in charge, "with the prier sanction of the Chief
of Engineers, may-waive for a reasonable period the limit
originally set for the completion of the work and remit the
charges for the expenses of superintendence and inspec-

tion for so much time as in the judgment of the engineer
officer in charge. may actually have been lost on account
of . . . violence of the elements, or by epidemic, or
local or State 'quarantine restrictions, or other unforeseeable causes of delay arising from no fault of the contractor,
and which actually prevented him from commencing or
completing the work within the period required by the
contract."
Claimant entered upon the performance of the contract
August 18, 1903, and completed 2,100 feet of jetty when
operations ceased about September 17, 1904, owing to the
exhaustion of -the appropriation.
About the time work began, without fault on the part
of the contractor or of the United States, there was a delay of about thirty days, due to the fact that contractor's
tug, while in charge-of a licensed pilot, was grounded on a
sand bar. The Government apparently incurred expenses
for inspection during this period 'and deducted that
amount from Ripley's account.
Owing to -an epidemic of yellow fever the force of the
contractor was disorganized, and work was necessarily
suspended for thirty days. The Government did not
charge him with inspection expenses during the fifteen
days the quarantine was in force, in a city through which
the cars hauling the material were prevented from passing.
And the court held also that Ripley was not chargeable
with the inspection expenses. for the other fifteen days,
during which his. force was scattered as a result of the
epidemic.
During the progress of the work, a large number of
blocks were rejected by the inspector as not conforming to
,specifications. "Many. of those so rejected were afterwards accepted, but ninety of the stones offered as crest
blocks were rejected as such, and were accepted and used
as riprap and paid for as such. The difference in the
amount paid claimant for said stones used as riprap and

the amount he 'would have received if they had been used
as crest blocks" was allowed him by the Court of Claims.
It found that "he was compelled to furnish other crest
blocks to take the place of those rejected, which caused a
delay of ten days to claimant in the. completion of the
work."
It appears that the rejection of these blocks was due
to: a difference in the method of measurement, the inspector insisting that the blocks should be measured at
the narrowest, thinnest and shortest points. The contractor contended- that mean or average measurements
should be taken, claiming that this was the understanding
of himself. and the officer who drew the specifications.
The engineer at Galveston thereupon suggested that the
matter should be referred to the Chief of Engineers in
Washington; and later a supplementary agreement was
drawn, which permitted the use of blocks "which would
make the work as stable, or .more stable, than if the
dimensions conformed strictly to the letter of the specifications. In consideration of which change the contractor
agrees to accept $5.00 per ton for all blocks received under
the supplementary agreement. which would. have been
rejected under the original specification."
The plaintiff's claim for additional compensation for
extra labor furnished the Government and for board and
lodging furnished 'its employ6s was rejected by the court,
as also his claim for damages for double handling caused
by the inspector's refusal to permit him to unload certain
material on the jetty.
The contractor's principal claim, however, was for damage caused by the delay resulting from the refusal of the
inspector in charge to peimit crest blocks to be laid after
the core had fully consolidated. As long as the jetty was
uncov.ered by these blocks it was subject to the rough action of the waves, and the plaintiff's employ~s were deprived of the advantage of working in still water on the

lee side of the jetty. The work began August 18, 1903,
and the court found as a fact "that in December, when
plaintiff had completed 200 feet of the core, he requested
permission to lay the blocks. This was refused, on the
ground that the core had not been consolidated. *3y the
end of December he had completed 500 feet, and again
requested permission to lay the blocks. The inspector
refused and continued to*refuse permission to lay the
blocks until May 1, 1904, at which. time 1,500 feet of the
core ha& been repaired.and completed."
"Commencing in October, 1903, the contractor began
to lay the slope stones, and from December, 1903, until
May, 1904, it was manifest that large parts of the work
done by him were fully settled and consolidated. If the
claimant had been permitted to lay the crest blocks from
the time on, as the work progressed,. there would have resulted an additional protection, which 'would have enabled him to work sixty days more within the period between that time and May 7, 1904, when the first crest
block was laid."
"The total cost to claimant of performing the contract,
exclusive of the cost of the granite and the cost of transport and fitting up and repairs to barges, was $63,780.
The total number of days from the beginning to the completion of said work was- 392, making an average daily
cost to the contractor of $162.70. The work was completed on September 17, 1904. The number of days of
actual work performed was 131, of which 58 was subsequent to the 30th day of April, 1904." "Claimant, under
the requirements of the specification, personally superintended the work for the whole time. The value of his
personal services while so doing was $750 per' month, but
it does not appear that at this particular time he had any
other enterprise under way or any other employment."
The court entered judgment for plaintiff for $14,832.05

large blocks and riprap, delay caused by such rejection,
value of ten days' services of plaintiff during the delay,
remission of expenses for additional fifteen days during
yellow fever epidemic, remission of expenses while tug was
grounded on a sand bar, value of contractor's time during
60 days' delay occasioned by refusal to permit crest blocks
to be laid,. $1,500, and average daily expense $162.70, and
remission of inspection charges during the 60 days' delay.
After the case Was argued here it was twice remanded
(220 U. S. 491; 222 U. S. 144), and the Court of Claims
made the following additionar findings of fact:
"When denying permission to the claimant to lay the
crest blocks, as stated in finding 7, the assistant engineer,
who was an experienced officer of the Government in
such work, and who was acting as inspector in immediate
charge of the work, knew that large parts of the core
theretofore completed by the claimant had fully settled
and consolidated -and were ready for the crest blocks to
be laid thereon.
"2. The refusal'of said assistant engineer, as inspector
in immediate charge of the work, to allow crest blocks
to be laid when he knew that parts of the core had settled
and consolidated as aforesaid, was gross error and an act
of bad faith on his payt.
"3. There was no protest made to the engineer in charge,
whose office was in Galveston, or to the Chief of Engineers,
whose office was in Washington, respecting the refusal, of
,said assistant engineer to permit the laying of crest blocks
as aforesaid. - The claimant made. frequent complaints to
said assistant.,engineer about the delays'so caused by his
refusal to permit the laying of crest blocks.
•.a"Claimant Visited the office of the engineer in charge
at Galveston about once a month, and while there complaini~d generally that said a9sistant engineer, as inspector
in immediate charge of the work, was too strict with him
in construing-the specifications and contract. No appeal,

either written or otherwise, was taken or asked by the
claimant to either the engineer in charge or to the Chief
of Engineers, because of the said refusal to permit the
laying of crest blocks."
Mr. William H. Robeson, Mr. Benjamin Carter and Mr.
F. Carter Pope for appellant.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General John Q. Thompson and
Mr. Philip M. Ashford for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE LAMAR, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff sued the United States in the Court of
Claims for damages sustained by him while carrying out a
contract to build a jetty in the harbor of Aransas Pass,
Texas. There were nine items in his claim which aggregated $45,950. The court rendered judgment in his favor
for $14,732.05. Both parties appealed-the contractor
on the ground that he was awarded too little, and the
United States on the ground that he was not entitled
to recover anything whatever. The principal contention
related to the right of the plaintiff to recover damages
occasioned by the refusal of the inspector to permit blocks
to be laid on the jetty as the work progressed. The contract provided that these blocks should be put in place
when "in the judgment of the United States agent in
charge" the core or mound had sufficiently consolidated.
Until the agent determined that the core had settled, the
contractor had no right to' do this part of the work. No
matter how long the delay or how great the damage, he
was entitled to no relief unless it appeared that the refusal
was the result of "fraud or of such gross mistake as would
imply a fraud." Martinsburg & P. R. Co. v. March, 114
U. S.. 549; United States v. Mueller, 113 U. S. 153.
But the very extent of the power and the conclusive
character of his decision raised a corresponding duty that

223 U. S.

the agent's judgment should be exercised-not capriciously
or fraudulently, but reasonably and with due regard to
the rights of both the contracting parties. The finding
by the court that the inspector's refusal was a gross mistake and an act of bad faith necessarily, therefore, leads
to the conclusion that the contractor was entitled to recover the damages caused thereby.
The defendant claims that the plaintiff lost his right to
recover because he failed to appeal to the Engineer in
Charge at Galveston, or to the Chief of Engineers, in
Washington. But there was -no requirement or provision
for appeal in the contract. The clause relied on by the
Government relates to the duty of inspection and acceptance, making the decision of the Engineer in Charge
conclusive as to the quality and quantity of work and
material. That part of the agreement had no reference
to the settlement of the core. Whether it had suffi-ciently
consolidated involved the determination of a matter of
fact, varying from day to day. The contractor had to act
or refrain from acting when the decision was made. That
matter was expressly left to "the judgment of the United
States agent in charge." The contractor in submitting
to his decision did not lose his right to recover damages
occasioned by the refusal to permit the crest blocks to be
laid, when, as found by the court, this refusal was gross
error and fn act of bad faith.
The court, therefore, declared in plaintiff's favor on
this issue. He appeals, however, on the ground that the
court only allowed him $11,908.90, being for expenses and
loss of time for sixty days, insisting that he was entitled to
recover $28,953 as damages directly caused by this delay.
This claim is based on the fact that there were 392 days
between the beginning and the completion of the work.
But on account of Sundays, holidays and storms, there were
only 131 working days. Of these, 58 were after April 30,
1904-when, for the first time, the inspector permitted

223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the crest blocks to be laid. The contractor contends that
as it only took him 58 days after May 1, when. the permission was given, to complete the work, and, as the court
finds, that he was delayed for 60 days before the permission was given, it is evident that he could have finished
the work before May 1, and is therefore entitled to recover
the value of his own time and all the expenses for inspec-,
tion and labor which were incurred after that date.
The findings of fact do not require any such conclusion.
Prior to May 1 the contractor worked 73 days out of 247.
But it does not appear how many of these workings days
there were between August 18, 1903, when he began construction, and December, 1903, when he first applied for
permission to lay the crest blocks. Neither%is it shown
how many workings day there were between the date of
the first' refusal and the first permission to lay the blocks;
nor on how many of such working days the contractor was
able to do labor of another character on the jetty. In
the absence of such data it is impossible to verify plaintiff's
calculations. The burden was on the contractor. If theevidence would have sustained his present claim he was
bound to have applied, in due season, for additional findings of fact by the court. Our decision must be predicated
on what appears in the present record. Inasmuch as the
court found that $162.70 was the average daily expense,
and assessed plaintiff's damage at 60 times that amount, it
is evident that it considered that the contractor had been
delayed for 60 average days, and not for 60 working-days.
He is, therefore, entitled to judgment for $9,762 expenses,
$646.92 inspection charges, and $1,500 found to have been
the value of his own time for that period of sixty days.
The other findings in his favor for items aggregating
$2,822, must be reversed, and the cross appeal of the
Government sustained.
The greater part of this sum was for loss and delay
arising from the inspector's rejection of 90 large blocks

as not complying with the specifications. The fact that
the court gave judgment in Ripley's favor indicates that
it was of opinion that the agent had made an improper
decision. But so far as appears his only error was in construing the contract strictly, according to its terms, instead
of adopting a method of mean or average measurement
for which the contractor contended. The supplemental
agreement was not retroactive so as to give the plaintiff a
cause of action for the prior rejection, even though thereafter a different method of measurement was permitted.
The balance of the amount allowed the plaintiff was by
way of returning the expenses of inspection which had
been charged against him, during the suspension of the
work while the tug was grounded on the bar and the
contractor's force disorganized on account of the yellow
fever epidemic. The contract provided that the expenses
of inspection might in some cases be remitted but this
could only be with the prior consent of the Chief of Engineers. There is no finding that such consent was given.
But the error in entering judgment in Ripley's favor as
to any of these items,, and the propriety of disallowing the
others for which he sued arises from the fact that the
officer's decision was binding. All these claims relate to
matters which under the contract were submitted to
the engineer. There is no finding that he acted in bad
faith. Indeed, it is not even found that the decisions were
erroneous, though that is implied. But the contract did
not contemplate that the opinion of the court should" be
substituted for that of the engineer. In the absence of
fraud, or gross mistake implying fraud, his decision on
all these matters was conclusive.
On the findings of fact the plaintiff is entitled to recover
$11,908.90, with interest as provided in Rev. Stat., § 1090.
The judgment of the Court of Claims must be so modified
