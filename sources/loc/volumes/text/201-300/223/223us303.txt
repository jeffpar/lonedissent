POWERS v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.

No. 152.

Argued January 22, 1912.-Decided February 19, 1912.

The objection that there was no venire facias summoning the grand
jury is waived unless seasonably taken.
When the case gets to this court if the indictment shows that the
grand jury was duly selected and sworn, it is enough to show the
proper swearing of the grand jury. Crain v. United States, 162
U. S. 625, distinguished.
Where the conviction is a general one, one good count is sufficient to
warrant affirmance. Dunton v. United States, 156 U. S. 185.
In this case the statements in the record as to the calling and impaneling of the petit..jury sufficiently disclose, upon proceedings
in error, that the petit jury was sworn.
Where the accused voluntarily becomes a witness in his own behalf
before -a commission, it is not essential to the admissibility of his
testimony that he be 'first Warned that what he' says may be used
against him. Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613.
Where the record does not show that the accused on the preliminary
hearing claimed, his privilege under the Fifth Amendment or was
ignorant of it but does show that he testified voluntarily and understandingly, his testimony cannot be excluded when subsequently
offered at his trial.
A defendant testifying voluntarily, thereby waiving his privilege, may
be fully cross-examined as to the testimony given, and in this ase
held that the cross-examination did not exceed the proper limits.
Section 860, Rev. Stat., has no bearing on the introduction in the same
criminal proceeding -of testimony of accused given voluntarily.
Tucker v. United Stdtes, 151 U. S. 164.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a sentence after
kconviction

for violating §§ 3258, 3279, 3281 and 3242 of

the -Revised Statutes of the United States, are stated in
the opinion.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

223 U. S.

Mr. S. H. Sutherland, with whom Mr. R. A. Ayers was
on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
There can be no grand jury for a United States court
unless ordered by the judge, and the only method of summoning a grand jury is by venire facias. Rev. Stat.,
§§ 803, 810; 4 Fed. Stat. Ann. 742-744; United States v.
Antz, 16 Fed. Rep. 119; United States v. Reed, 2 Blatchf.
435.
The grand jury which returned this bill of indictment
was never sworn, and therefore. could not return a true
bill of indictment. Under Amendment V no court of the
United States has authority to try a person without an
indictment returned by a grand-jury for an offense of this
kind. Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1; Rowe v. State, 20 So.
Rep. (Ala.) 459; 2 Sawy. C. C. 667; Bishop Criminal
Procedure, § 1357; Barker v. State, 39 Arkansas, 180; Lyman v. People, 7 Brad. (Ill.) 345; Foster v. State, 31 Mississippi, 421; Abram v' State, 25 Mississippi, 589; Stokes
v. State, 24 Mississippi, 621; 4 Bl. Com. 302; 1 Chit. Crim.
L. 178; Cooley's Const. L. 318.
It takes both impaneling and swearing to constitute a
grand jury. Whatever is essential in a criminal proceeding
to deprive a person of his liberty must appear of record
and nothing is taken by intendment or implication.
'Ball's Case, 140 U. S. 118; Hopt V. Utah, 110 U. S. 574;

No inference that they were sworn can be drawn from
the word impaneled., Layman v. People, 7 brad. (Ill.

The admission of Powers before the commissioner was
not such an admission as amounted to a judicial confess ipn; it is essential it be made of the free will of the party,
and with full and perfect knowledge of the nature and
consequences of the confession. 1 Greenl. on Ev., § 216.
A party has no right to cross-examine any witness, except as to facts and circumstances connected with the
matter stated in his direct examination. If he wishes to
examine him as to other matters, he must do so by making the witness his own and calling him in the subsequent
progress of the cause. Phila. & Trenton Ry. Co. v. Stimpson, 14 Pet. 448; Miller v. Miller, 92 Virginia, 510; 1
Greenl. on Ev. 445.
The defendant could stop at any place he chose and the
cross-examination could only go to facts and circumstances

connected with the direct examination. Cooley's Const.
Lim., 6th ed., 384-386. His constitutional privilege protects him from cross-examination on any point not touched
in his examination in chief. State v. Lurch, 12 Oregon, 99;
6 Pac. Rep. 408; State v. Bacon, 13 Oregon, 143; 8 Pac.

Pac. Rep. 264.
If the defendant after going on the stand in his own behalf refused to answer any question on cross-examination
he could not be punished for it. The remedy in this case
for the Government would be to strike out his evidence in
chief.
Powers going on the stand before the commissioner and
giving testimony did not waive the constitutional privilege
as to such testimony at a later stage.

Cullen's Case, 24

Gratt. (Va.) 624. "For this evidence was clearly extorted
by compulsion through fear of imprisonment.
The waiver of the privilege must always be made understandingly and willingly, and generally after being fully
warned by the court. Cullen v. Commonwealth, 24 Grat.
624; 1 Greenl. on Ev., § 451.
The confession by the defendant was made under such
circumstances that it was not admissible evidence even
-had it been made out of court. Brain v. United States,
,supra; United States v. Ball, 81 Fed. Rep. 837.
The guaranty must have a broad and liberal construction in favor of the party and rights which it was intended
to secure. Counselman v. Hitchcock, supra; Boyd v.

fendant of his privilege was not a breach Of the privilege.
Furthermore, this defendant in fact resisted giving
the
answer and did so only under compulsion. There was
nothing to show that, he was not fully cognizant of his
rights. Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 623.
The warning as to. the privilege is not essential. Wigmore on Evidence, § 2269.
IUnless defendant's privilege was violated
at the preliminary hearing, it was not violated at all, for Colly's
quotation at the Anal trial, of what defendant had previously said, was no new breach of the' privilege.
Defendant could 'not have' been compelled to testify
personally at his final trial, 'even though he voluntarily
testified at the preliminary hearing.
The testimony below was that of Colly, not of the
defendant. The defendant was not on the witness stand.
No new pressure was exerted'on him. If his former admissions were not improperly extorted by the commissioner, it was competent for Colly to testify as to them, just
as to formal confessions. Wilson v. United States, 162
U. S. 613, 623; Hardy v. United States, 186 U. S.224, 228;

The admissions of the defendant- were not improperly
'obtained at the preliminary hearing before the commissioner, because they fell within his waiver of privilege.
No objection on the score of relevancy was taken to
this testimony either before the commissioner or on the
trial; and, in the discretion of the court, it was plainly
relevant, both as bearing on the defendant's explanation
of his presence at the still particularly charged, Wood v.

The controversy whether the waiver of privilege by a
defeiidant extends to all things relevant to the issue, as
held in Guy v. State, 90 Maryland, 29; Lawrence v. State,

of proper cross-examination, as was perhaps intimated
(though not decided) in Spies v. Illinois, 123 U. S. 131, 180;
Fitzpatrick v. United States, 178 U. S. 304, 314; Sawyer v.
United States, 202 U. S. 150, 165, is deemed immaterial
here because the field of the direct examination was the
whole fact of guilt or innocence, and any cross-examination
that was relevant was necessarily within that field. Indeed, this is generally the case where the witness claiming
the privilege is the defendant. Wigmore, § 2276, p. 3155.
The error, if any, was harmless.
There is nothing to indicate that the defendant was
in the least degree prejudiced by the alleged error, and the
discretion of the trial court should not be disturbed. Holt

MR. JUSTICE DAY

delivered the opinion of the court.

Plaintiff in error (hereinafter called defendant) was convicted in the District Court of the United States for the
Western District of Virginia under an indictment charging
him with the violation of §§ 3258, 3279, 3281 and 3242
of the Revised Statutes of the United States. He was
sentenced to a fine of $100 and to be imprisoned for a
period of thirty days.
The indictment contained seven counts, charging the
defendant substantially as follows: That he had in his'
possession a still and distilling apparatus for the production of spirituous liquors without having had such still
and apparatus registered (first count); that he carried- on
the business of a distiller of spirituous liquors without
having given bond (second count), and with the intent
to defraud the United States of the tax on such liquors
(third count), and also carried on the business of aretail
liquor dealer without having paid the special tax therefor
(seventh count); that, he worked in a distillery for the
production of spirituous liquors upon which no "Registered Distillery" sign was displayed (fourth count), and
that he delivered raw material, namely, meal, to (sixth
count), and conveyed distilled spirits from (fifth count),
such distillery.
The case comes to this court, because of the alleged
violation of a constitutional right, in compelling the defendant to be a witness against himself. This contention
is developed in the bill of exceptions, which shows that
at a preliminary hearing before a United States commissioner, after a witness for the Government had testified
that he had seen the defendant beating apples at a "still

POWERS v. UNITED STATES.
223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

place" near the home of one Preston Powers, and about
four miles from defendant's home, the defendant, without
counsel and not having been instructed by the commissioner, voluntarily, in his own behalf, testified that he
had beaten apples about thirty steps from the still place;
that Preston Powers had hired him for seventy-five cents
a day, and had set him to work beating apples, but that
he had no interest in the apples, the product from them
or the still, and no control of the still, and had merely
been hired by the day at a fixed price; that thereupon
M. P. Colly, deputy marshal, asked him if he had not
'worked at a distillery within two years of the warrant in
this case, at another time and place, which question the
defendant refused to answer until informed by the commissioner, and by the deputy marshal, that unless he did
so he would be committed to jail', and he then testified
that "he had worked at a distillery and made some brandy
last- fall near his house, and he paid Preston Powers to
assist him"; that upon the trial of the case in the District
Court that court, over the objection of the defendant,
admitted 'the testimony of Colly, who repeated the proceedings before the commissione', including the testimony
of defendant, and that the court refused to strike out
Colly's testimony or to instruct the jury to disregard it,
upon the motion of defendant's counsel, to all of which,
at the time, counsel for defendant duly excepted.
The contentions of the defendant are that the judgment
should be reversed for the following reasons:
ist. There was -no venire facias summoning the grand
jury whch found this purported indictment.
2nd. The said grand jury, was not sworn and consequently could ot find an indictment.
3rd. The indictment was defective and the demurrer
should have beeri sustained to the fourth and sixth counts.
4th. The petit jury that tried this case was not sworn
nor summoned.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

223 U. S.

5th. The testimony of Coly was illegal and incompetent
testimony, and should have been rejected when offered,
and'if received striken out on counsel's motion.
As to the first, that there was no venirefacias summoning
the grand jury, there'is nothing in the record to show that
this objection, if tenable at all, was taken before plea or,
indeed, at any time during the trial. Objections of this
character are waived unless seasonably taken. United
States v. Gale, 109 U. S. 65; Agnew v. United States, 165
U. S. 36; Rodriguez v. United States, 198 U. S. 156; McInerney v. United States, 147 Fed. Rep. 183.
The same observation applies to the second assignment
of error; that the grand jury is not shown by the record
to have been sworn. The indictment recites that the
grand jury was selected, impaneled, sworn and charged,
and that they on their oaths presbnt, etc. At this stage
of the proceedings this is enough to show the proper swearing of the grand jury. In Crainv. United States, .162 U. S.
625, cited by counsel for defendanti the record was destitute of any showing that the accused was arraigned or
pleaded to the indictment. See Pointer v. United States,
151 U. S. 396, 418.
As to the assignment of error that there were certain
'defective counts in the indictment, the conviction was a
general one, and, even if the counts were defective, as
alleged, one good count, sufficient to sustain the sentence,
is all that is required to warrant the affirmation of a
judgment in error proceedings. Dunbar v. United States,
156 U. S. 185.
As to the. objection that the petit jury was not sworn:
The record discloses that they were "called and empaneled," and, "being selected and tried in the manner
prescribed by law, the truth of and upon the premises
to speak, and having heard the evidence, the arguments
of counsel, and charge of the judge, retired to consider
their verdict, and upon their oaths do say," etc. We
f

POWERS v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

think that this sufficiently discloses, upon proceedings
in error after conviction, that the petit jury was duly
sworn.

The chief objection contended for in argument concerns the admission in the District Court of the testimony
of the defendant before the commissioner. The admission
of this testimony is -claimed to have worked a violation
of the defendant's constitutional rights under the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution, which protects him

against self-incrimination. It appears* from the bill of
exceptions that the defendant voluntarily took the stand
and testified in his own behalf. This he might do under
the Federal statute (March 16, 1878, 20 Stat. 30, c. 37),
making the defendant a competent witness, "at his own
request, but not otherwise." We are of the opinion that
it was not essential to the admissibility of his testimony
that he should first have been warned that what he said
might be used against him. In Wilson v. United States,
162 U. S. 613, Wilson was charged with murder. Before
a United States commissioner, upon a preliminary hearing,
he made a statement which was admitted at the trial.
He had no counsel, was not warned or told of his right to
refuse to'testify, but there was testimony tending to show
that the statement Was voluntary. At pages 623, 624, this
court said:
"And it is laid down that it is not essential to the admissibility of a confession that it should appear that the
person was warned, that what he said would be used
against him, but on the contrary, if the confession was
voluntary, it is sufficient though it appear that he was
not so warned. Joy on Confessions, * 45, * 48, and cases
cited.
. . . . He [Wilson] did not testify that he did
not- know that he had a right to refuse to answer the
questions, or that, if he had known it, he would not have
answered..
.
. He did not have the aid of counsel;

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

223 U. S.

and he was not warned that the statement might be used
against him or advised that he need not answer. These
were matters which went to the weight Or 'credibilityI of
what he said of an incriminating character, but as he Was
not confessing guilt but the contrary, we think that, under'
all the circumstances disclosed, they were not of themselves sufficient to require his answers to be excluded on
the ground of being involuntary as matter of law."
In the present case, it does not appear that the witness
claimed his privilege, or was ignorant, of it, or that if he
had known of it would not have answered-indeed, the
record shows that his testimony was entirely voluntary
and understandingly given. Such testimony cannot be
excluded when subsequently' offered at his trial.
As to the contention tiat the cross-examination before
the commissioner shown in the bill of exceptions, was im,properly extorted. from the witness under threat of commitment, an examination of the bill of exceptions, we
,,think, requires an answer overruling thisexception. There
is.some difference. of opinion expressed in the authorities,
but the rule recognized in this court is that a defend-ant, who voluntarily takes the stand in his own behalf,
thereby waiving his privilege, may be subjected to a crossexamination concerning his statement. "Assuming the
position of a. witness, he is entitled to all its rights and
protection, and is subject to all its criticisms and burdens"
and may be fully cross-examined as to the'testimony
-voluntarily given. Reagan v. United States, 157 U. S. 301,
305. The rule is thus stated in Brown v. Walker, 161

S. 591, 597:
"Thus, if the witness himself elects to waive his privilege, as he may doubtless' do, since the privilege is for his
protection and not for that of other parties,, and discloses
his criminal connections, he is. not permitted'to stop, but
.must go on and make a full disclosure. 1 Greenl. Ev.,

"So, under modern statutes permitting accused persons.
to take the stand in their own behalf, they may be subjected to cross-examination upon their statements. State
v. Wentworth, 65 Maine, 234;:State v. Witham, 72 Maine,
531; State v. Ober, 52 N. H. 492; Commonwealth v. Bonner;

72 N. Y. 393."
But it is contended by the defendant that the bill of
exceptions shows that the alleged cross-examination was
entirely irrelevant and improper, and not a legitimate
cross-examination of the defendant's testimony in his
own behalf.' It appears that Powers testified, being
charged with illegal conduct concerning the distillation
of spirits, as already stated, that he was at a place about
thirty steps from the still, beating apples, as testified by
the Government's witness; that Preston Powers had hired
him to work for him at the price of seventy-five cents a
day, and that he put him to beating apples; that the witness had no interest in the apples or the product thereof
and no interest in the still, but was merely hired to work
by the day at the price of 75 cents. Having taken the
stand in his own-behalf, and given the testimony above
recited, tending to' show that he was not guilty of the
offense charged, he was required to submit to crossexamination, as any other witness in the case would be,
concerning matter pertinent to the examination in chief.
The cross-examination,, in the answer elicited, tended to

Opinion of the Court.

223 U. S.

show that defendant had worked at a distillery the fall
before with Preston Powers, the man he alleged he was
working for at beating apples on the occasion when the
Government witness saw him near the still, and had made
brandy near his house, and had paid Preston Powers to
assist him. This, we think, might be regarded as having
some relevancy to the defendant's claim as to the innocent
character of his occupation at the time charged. It had
a tendency to show that defendant knew the character
of the occupation in which he was tKen engaged, having
worked before with Preston" Powers at a distillery and
made brandy with him, and' did not exceed the limits of
a proper cross-examination of the witness. As to the
suggestion that § 860 of the Revised Statutes prevented
the introduction of the testimony given by defendant
before the commissioner, that section, providing that no
pleading nor any discovery or evidence obtained from a
party by means of a judicial proceeding, shall be used in
evidence against him in a criminal proceeding, can have
no bearing, where, as in the present case, the accused
voluntarily testified in his own behalf in the course of
the same proceeding, thereby himself opening the door to'
legitimate cross-examination. See Tucker v. United States,
151 U. S.164, 168.
Judgment affiimed.
