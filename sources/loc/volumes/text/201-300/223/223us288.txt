COLLINS v. THE STATE OF TEXAS.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF THE STATE
OF TEXAS.
No. 165.

Argued January 25, 26, 1912.-Decided February 19, 1912.

Where the party attacking the constitutionality of a statute has not
suffered, the court will not speculate whether others may suffer.
Under its police power a State may constitutionally prescribe conditions to insure competence in those practising .the healing art in its
various branches, including those in which drugs are not administered-such as osteopathy. Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114.
The Texas statute of 1907, establishing a Board of Medical Examiners,
and conditions under which persons will be licensed to practise
osteopathy, does not deprive one who refuses to apply for a license
,thereunder of his property without due process of law, or deny him
the equal protection of the law.
In this case the writ of error to review a judgment denying plaintiff
in error his release on habeas corpus is not dismissed but determined
on the merits, as the single constitutional question goes to the
jurisdiction of the state court, and has arisen as plainly as it ever
will. Bailey v. Alabama, 211 U. S. 452, distinguished.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of certain
provisions of the statute of Texas establishing the Board of
Medical Examiners, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Millard Patterson,with whom Mr. Jo. F. Woodson,
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The statute deprives plaintiff in error of his property
without due process of law, and denies him the equal protection of the law.
The last two clauses 'of the Fourteenth Amendment
are restrictions upon the exercise of arbitrary and capricious power over persons and property when exercised
by the State through any of its agencies. Ex parte Vir-

Biggs, 46 S. E. Rep. 401.
The words "bona fide" and "reputable" in the description of the medical school of which one is to be a
graduate mean, as stated in section seven of the act,
that it shall be a school having a course of ingtruction as
high as the better class of medical schools in the United
States.
The acts, under the facts of this case, discriminate
against plaintiff in error as an osteopath, and violate the
Fourteenth Amendment, in that they discriminate in
favor of nurses who practise not only nursing, but treat
minor ailments; in favor of masseurs who, in their particular spheres of labor, treat diseases, light disorders
and injuries, and charge therefor money and other compensation; and also discriminate in favor of druggists,
who prescribe remedies and charge therefor.
If Chapter 123 applies to an osteopath who practises
only as such, it discriminates against osteopaths in providing for the issuance of a verification license to legal
practitioners of medicine who were practising .under. the
provisions of previous laws, or under diplomas of reputable
and legal colleges of medicine, there being no provision
in the law for the issuing of a verification license to osteopaths.
The acts are in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment
in discriminating against osteopaths in requiring that they
should have a diploma from a bona fide medical school
before they can present themselves for examination before the Medical Board of Examiners for a license to pracVOL. ccxxiii-19

tise, and in requiring them to accept a license to practise
medicine.
To require plaintiff to obtain a diploma from a medical
college as defined in said act, and to require him to pass
an examination in the scientific branches of medicine
before he could be granted a license to practise osteopathy
is a direct discrimination in favor of those medical schools
requiring a knowledge of materia medica, therapeutics,
chemistry and the practice of medicine, in contravention
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Watson, v. Maryland,

N. Wilkerson, Mr. Timothy J. Scofield and Mr. Frank J.

The acts do not violate the privileges or immunities
elause; that provision applies only to those privileges and
immunities which are incident to citizenship of the United
States as distinguished from citizenship of the several
States. Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 74; Bartmeyer

secure the objects sought to be attained by it and is not
patently unreasonable. Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S.606.
The act does not violate the equal protection clause.

of the character involved herein, and the details of such
legislation rest primarily within the discretion of the
state legislature. Cases supra.
The classification made in the statute is not arbitrary,
unreasonable or oppressive, and was within the legislative
power of the State, as having a fair relation to the objects
of the statute. Within the sphere of its operation it affects
alike all persons similarly situated.
Plaintiff in error does not, and cannot on the record
in this case, contend that the Board of Medical Examiners
of Texas has been guilty of any unfair or unjust action
toward him. His contentions are based upon fancied
inequalities of the statute which arise only on his own
theory of how the act would have, been construed by the
board had he in fact requested from it authority to uractise,
or the right to take an examination as provided by the
act.
While the construction of the act by the Court of
Criminal Appeals of the State of Texas may not, perhaps,
be in all respects conclusive upon this court, that construction is one toward which this court will lean. Cases supra,
and see Atchison &c. Railroad Co. v. Matthews, 174 U. S.
96, 101; Marchant v. Penna. R. R. Co., 153 U. S. 380;

The act will be taken in this court as construed by the
Court of Criminal Appeals of the State of Texas to include in the "practise of medicine" the practise of osteopathy. 57 Tex. Crim. 2.
The act must also be taken as not in conflict with the
constitution of Texas. Reetz v. Michigan, 188 U. S. 505.
The object of the statute is to protect the sick and
afflicted from the pretensions of the ignorant, the unskilled
and the unscrupulous. The statute was passed to protect
the health and promote the welfare of the people of Texas,

COLLINS v. TEXAS.

and to'protect them from imposition and fraud. It seeks
to prohibit and punish fraud, deception, charlatanry and
quackery in the practice of healing, to prevent empiricism,
and to bring the practice under such control that, as far
as possible, the ignorant, the unscientific, the unskilled,
and the unscrupulous practitioner may be excluded. Cases

State, 115 Tennessee, 427;"People v. Blue Mountain Joe,
129 Illinois, 370; State v. Bair, 112 Iowa, 466; Commonwealth v. Jewelle, 199 Massachusetts, 558; People v. Phippin, 70 Michigan, 6, 19.
In construing the act consideration mugt be given to
the purpose of the legislature, and to the mischlef intended
to be guarded against. Whether it is fair and reasonable
and a valid exercise of the police power, or arbitrary and
capricious must be determined in the light of the object
sought to be attained by the act. 1 Kent's Comm. 462; 2
Sutherland's Stat. Const. (2d ed. by Lewis), §§ 379--376,
456.
There is no vested right to practise either the medical
or legal profession, free from supervision and regulation

Michigan, 6; 22 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 9,

The statute does not infringe the provisions of the ex
post facto clause; see cases supra; Eastman v. State, 109

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is a writ of error to the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals upon a judgment denying the plaintiff in error a
release by habeas corpus. The plaintiff in error is held
upon an information charging him with practising medicine for money by treating a named patient for hay fever
by osteopathy, without having registered his authority
as required by a Texas statute of April 17, 1907, c. 123
(Gen. Laws, 1907, p. 224). He denies the constitutionality'
of the act.
The statute establishes a Board of Medical Examiners
and requires "all legal practitioners of medicine in this
State, who, practising under the provisions of previous
laws, or under diplomas of a reputable and legal college
of medicine, have not already received license from a
State Medical Examining Board of this State" to prove
their diplomas, or existing license, or exemption existing
under any law; whereupon they are to receive a verification- license. § 6. By § 7 applicants not licensed under
§ 6 must pass an examination, conditioned among other
things on their being graduates of "bona fide reputable
medical schools;" schools to be considered reputable
"whose entrance requirements and courses of instruction
are as high as those adopted by the better class of medical
schools of the United States, whose course of instruction
shall embrace not less than four terms of five months each."
By § 9 the examinations are to be fair to every school of
medicine, are to be conducted on the scientific branches
of medicine only, and-are to include anatomy, physiology,
chemistry, histology, pathology, bacteriology, physical
diagnosis, surgery obstetrics, gynecol9gy, hygiene, and

COLLINS v. TEXAS.

Opinion of the Court.

medical jurisprudence. Those who pass are to be granted
licenses to practise medicine. By § 10 nothing. in the act
is to be construed to discriminate against any particular
system, and the act is not to apply to dentists legally
registered and confining themselves to dentistry, nurses
who practise only nursing, masseurs, or surgeons of the
United States Army, Navy, &c., in the performance of
their duties.
The only other material sections of the act are §§ 13
and 14, the former of which declares that "any person
shall be regarded as practising medicine within the meaning of this act. . . . (2) Or who shall treat or offer
to treat any disease or disorder, mental or physical, or
any physical deformity or injury by any system or method
or to effect cures thereof and charge therefor, directly or
indirectly, money or other compensation." By § 14 any
person practising medicine in violation of the act is punished by fine and imprisonment, and is not to recover
anything for the services rendered.
The facts charged against the plaintiff in error are admitted. It also is admitted that before the passage of the
statute he had spent $5,000 in fitting up his place, and
was deriving a net income from his calling of at least the
same sum. He held a diploma from the chartered American School of Osteopathy, Kirksville, Missouri, after a
full two years' course of study there, but it does not appear that he presented this.diploma to the Board of Medical Examiners or attempted to secure either a verification
license or license in any form. The Board in passing upon
qualifications does not examine in therapeutics or ma-.
teria medica, which, it will be observed, are not mentioned
in the act. On these facts we are of opinion that the plaintiff in error fails to show that the statute inflicts any wrong
upon him contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States. If he has not suffered
we are not called upon to speculate' upon other, cases, or

to decide whether the followers of Christian Science or
other people might in some event have cause to complain.
We are far from agreeing with the plaintiff in .error that
the definition of practising medicine in § 13 is arbitrary

or irrational, but it would be immaterial if it were, as its
only object is to explain who fall within the purview of the
act. That it does, and of course we follow the Texas
court in its decision that the plaintiff in error is included.
It is true that he does not administer drugs, but he practises what at least purports to be the healing art. The
State constitutionally may prescribe conditions to such
practice considered by it to be necessary or useful to
secure competence in those who follow it. We should
presume, until the Texas courts say otherwise, that the
reference in §4 to the diploma of a reputable and legal
college of medicine, and the confining in § 7 of examina-

tions to graduates of reputable medical schools, use the
words medicine and medical with the same broad sense
as § 13, and that the diploma of the plaintiff in error would
not be rejected merely because it came from a school of
osteopathy. In short, the statute says that if you want
to do what it calls practising medicine you must have
gone to a reputable school in that kind of practice. Whatever may be the osteopathic dislike of medicines, neither

the school nor the plaintiff in error suffers a constitutional
wrong if his place of tuition is called a medical school by
the act for the purpose of showing that it satisfies the statutory requirements. He cannot say that it would not
have been regarded as doing so, because he has not tried.
Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 124.
An osteopath professes, the plaintiff in error professes,

as we understand it, to help certain ailments by scientific manipulation affecting the nerve centres. It is intelligible therefore that the State should require of him

a scientific training. Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S.
114; Watson v. Maryland, 218 U. S. 173. He like others

COLLINS v. TEXAS.

223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

must begin by a diagnosis. It is no answer to say that
in many instances the diagnosis is easy--that a man
knows it when he has a cold or a toothache. For a general
practice science is needed. An osteopath undertakes to
be something more than a nurse or a masseur, and the
difference rests precisely in a claim to greater science,
which the State requires him to prove. The same considerations that justify including him justify excluding
the lower grades from the law. Watson v. Maryland, 218
U. S. 173, 179, 180. Again, it is not an answer to say that
the plaintiff in error is prosecuted for a single case. If
the legislature may prohibit a general practice for money
except on the condition stated, it may attach the same
conditions to a single transaction of a kind not likely to
occur otherwise than as an instance of a general practice.
A distinction between gratuitous and paid for services
was made in the Maryland statute sustained in Watson v.
Maryland, 218 U. S. 173, 178. Finally, the law is not
made invalid as against the plaintiff in error by the fact
that he had an established business when the law was
passed. Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114. Reetz v.
Michigan, 188 U. S. 505, 510.
The objections that prevailed against a writ of error
like this in Bailey v. Alabama, 211 U. S. .452, do not exist
here. There as here it was attempted to interrupt the
ordinary course of a trial by habeas corpus, and there as
here the State allowed the attempt and discharged the
writ on the merits. But in that case it did not appear
that the constitutional question relied upon had arisen
or necessarily would arise, although afterwards it did.
219 U. S. 219. But here the facts are admitted, the question appears as plainly as it ever will, and is supposed to
go to the jurisdiction of the court. Therefore we have
discussed the case on the merits; perhaps more than it
needed in view of the decisions cited and others that establish the right of the State to adopt a policy even upon

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.
No. 624. Argued January 16, 1912.-Decided February 19,-1912.'
In estimating for taxation the proportion of income of a corporation
doing interstate business, a State cannot include income from investments in bonds and lands outside of the State. Fargo v. Hart,
193 U. S. 490.
.The Oklahoma tax on gross revenue of corporations of 1910, as far as
it affects express companies, is not a property tax but a tax on all
revenue, including that *received from interstate commerce, and as
such ls an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Galveston, Harrisburg& San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217.
Where a state statute requires that a corporation doing both interstate and intrastate business return its gross receipts from all
sources, the taxing feature of the statute cannot be construed as
relating -only to receipts from intrastate commerce, and sustained
separately in that respect.
Complainant in an equity suit to restrain the collection of a state tax,
on gross receipts, on the ground that the act'is unconstitutional because it includes receipts from interstate commerce, is not bound,
in order to maintain the bill, to tender so much as would have
fallen on intrastate receipts. People-s Bank v. Marye, 191 U. S.
272, distinguished.
The court cannot, reshape a taxing statute which includes elements
beyond the State's power of taxation simply because it embraces
elements that it might have reached had the statute been drawn
with a different measure and intent.
