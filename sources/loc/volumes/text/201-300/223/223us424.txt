which reference has been made, Congress intended to
cover and did cover all pearls in the two paragraphs and
did not leave a class of pearls unenumerated. The words
in paragraph 436 are to be taken as describing a condition
in antithesis to that described in paragraph 434, under
which, if strung or set, imported pearls are dutiable as
jewelry. Such an interpretation provides a simple and
workable test, permitting certainty and impartiality in
administration which should preeminently characterize
the operation of tariff laws, and fulfills, as we believe, the
purpose of Congress.
We conclude that the similitude clause has no application and that upon the facts shown the pearls imported
in this case were dutiable under paragraph 436 at ten per
cent.
Judgment affirmed.
FERRIS v. FROHMAN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 44. Submitted November 7, 1911.-Decided February 19, 1912.
Although complainant may assert his own common-law copyright to
his play, if he alleges that defendant has obtained a copyright for
the play sought to. be enjoined, and the defendant stands upon the
copyright and is enjoined, a Federal right is set up and denied, and
this court has jurisdiction to review the judgment, under § 709,
Rev. Stat.
Under the lw as it existed in 1894, after a play had been performed in
England, t,. - rights of the owner to protection against the unauthorized production in England is only that given by the statutes;
but the deprivation of common-law rights by force of the statutes
was limited by territorial bounds within which the statute was
operative.
Public representation in this, or in another, country of a dramatic
composition, not printed and published, does not deprive the owner
of his common-law right save by operation of statute.

FERRIS v. FROHMAN.
223 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

At common law the public performance of a play is not an abandonment to public use.
The purpose and effect of the copyright law is not to render fruits of
piracy secure; and a copyright does not protect one producing a
play which is substantially a copy of an unprinted and unpublished
play, the common-law property right whereof is in another.
238 Illinois, 430, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the right of authors to unpub-

lished dramatic compositions and productions on the stage,
are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Charles H. Aldrich, with whom Mr. Charles R.
Aldrich, Mr. CharlesG. McRoberts and Mr. L. E. Chipman
were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
Plaintiff in error properly claimed below that the play
which he was presenting and against which the injunction was sought, was protected by copyright under §4952,
Rev. Stat., and that the assertion of common-law rights
in r. drama which had been copyrighted in England by
its authors who were citizens of Great Britain was in
conflict with the copyright arrangements between Great
Britain and this country and the act of March 3, 1891.
The final decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois was
against these claimed rights and a Federal question is
therefore involved. Erie R. R. Co. v. Purdy, 185 U. S. 148,
153; C., B. & Q. Ry. Co. v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 561, 580, 581;

v. Fowler, 91 U. S. 143.
There could have been no decision in favor of the plaintiff below that did not in effect deny the right claimed
under the copyright laws of the United States by the defendant below. In such case there is a Federal question
whether mentioned in the opinion of the court below or not.

The statute 5 & 6 Vict., c. 45, § 20, makes public performance of a dramatic work with the author's or owner's
consent equivalent to the first publication of a book.
And in England it is held that performance in the
United States with the owner's consent terminates the
author's playright in England and makes the performing
right publici juris. Boucicault v. Chatterton, 5 L. R. Ch.

The performing right or playright had no existence at
common law separate and apart from the manuscript of
the author, but dates its origin from 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 15,
and in this country from the act of Congress, August 18,
1856, 11 Stat. 138. Boucicault v. Chatterton, L. R. 5 Ch.

The English act was passed to give the right of performance and was brought about by the decision in Murray v.
Elliston, 5 B. & Ald. 657; Chappell v. Boosey, 21 Ch. Div.
232, 241.'
The public performance of a drama is in all respects
analogous to the right to multiply copies of a book. It is
not a common-law right distinct from the manuscript.

The claim that this proposition should be limited by
adding the words "in the same country," or equivalent
words, as contended by counsel for defendant in error, is
without foundation.
Copyright in a book or drama is the exclusive right of
the owner to multiply and dispose of copies; this is where
the drama is treated as a book. Playright is the exclusive
right of public performance of the dramatic or musical
composition. There is no reason why one should cease
upon publication, or when devoted to unrestricted public
use, and not the other.
Mr. Levy Mayer for defendants in error:
This court has no jurisdiction of the present writ of
error. Appleby v. Buffalo, 221 U. S. 524; Waters-Pierce

The public performance in England of a manuscript
play which under the British statutes is made a publication and deprives the author of his common-law right of
exclusive representation, does not deprive the author of
such common-law right in this country where public
performance is not deemed a publication. Crowe v. Aiken,

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Illinois;
The suit was brought by Charles Frohman, Charles
Haddon Chambers, and Stephano Gatti (defendants in
error), to restrain the production of what was alleged to be
a piratical copy of a play known as "The Fatal Card." Its
authors were Charles Haddon Chambers and B. C. Stephenson, British subjects resident in London, who con-

posed it there in 1894. The firm of A. & S. Gatti, theatrical
managers of London,. of which the complainant Gatti is
the surviving partner, became interested with the authors
and on September 6, 1894, the play was first performed in
London. It was registered under the British Statutes on
!October 31,1894, and again on November 8,1894. Charles
Frohman, of New York, by agreement of June 13, 1894,
obtained the right of production in this country for five
years. On March 25, 1895, Frohman acquired all the interest of Stephenson in the play in and for the United
States, and it was extensively represented under his supervision. It was not copyrighted here.
George E. McFarlane made an adaptation of this play,
called it by the same name, and transferred it to the plaintiff in error, Richard Ferris, of Illinois, who copyrighted it
in August, 1900, under the laws of the United States, and
later caused it to be performed in various places in this
country. The adapted play differed from the original in
various details, but not in its essential features.
The Superior Court of Cook County found that the complainants were the sole owners of the original play; that it
had never been published or otherwise dedicated to the
public in the United States or elsewhere; and that the
Ferris play was substantially identical with it. Ferris
was directed to account, and was perpetually restrained
from producing the adaptation which he had copyrighted.
The Appellate Court for the First District reversed the
decree (131 Ill. App. 307), but on appeal to the Supreme
Court of Illinois this decision was reversed and the decree
of the Superior Court was affirmed. 238 Illinois, 430.
The defendants in error contest the jurisdiction of this
court upon the ground that the bill was based entirely
upon a common-law right of property, and insist that the
upholding of this right by the state court raises no Federal
question. But the complainants sued, not simply to
maintain their common-law right in the original play,

FERRIS v. FROHMAN.
223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

but by virtue of it to prevent the defendant from producing the adapted play which he had copyrighted under
the laws of the United States. They challenged a right
which the copyright, if sustainable, secured. R. S. 4952.
It was necessary for them to make the challenge, for they
could not succeed unless this right were denied. Ferris
stood upon the copyright. That it had been obtained
was alleged in the bill, was averred in the answer, and
was found by the court. The fact that the court reached
its conclusion in favor of the complainants, by a consideration, on common-law principles, of their property
in the original play does not alter the effect of the decision.
By the decree Ferris was permanently enjoined "from
selling, producing, or
in any manner using, .
the said defendant's copyrighted
performing . . .
play hereinbefore referred to for any purpose." The
decision thus denied to him a Federal right specially set
up and claimed within the meaning of § 709 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States. This court, therefore, has
jurisdiction. C., B. & Q. Ry. Co. v. Drainage Commiesioners, 200 U. S. 561, 580, 581; McGuire v. Commonwealth,
3 Wall. 382, 385; Anderson v. Carkins, 135 U. S. 483, 486;
Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 9; Northern Pacific R. R.
Co. v. Colburn, 164 U. S. 383, 385, 386; Green Bay &c.
Canal Co. v. Patten PaperCo., 172 U. S. 58, 67, 68.
The substantial identity of the two plays was not disputed in the appellate courts of Illinois and must .be
deemed to be established. The contention was, and is,
that after the public performance of the original play in
London in 1894, the owners had no common-law right,
but only the rights conferred by the British statutes; and
that Frohman's interest (save the license which expired
in 1899) was subsequently acquired. Hence, it is said,
the play not being copyrighted in the United States was
publici juris here and the adapter was entitled to use it
0
as common material.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

223 U. S.

Performing right was not within the provisions of 8 Anne,c. 19, which gave to authors the sole liberty of printing
their books. Coleman v. Wathen, 5 T. R. 245. The act
of 1833, known as "Bulwer-Lytton's Act," conferred
statutory playright in perpetuity throughout the British
dominions, in the case of dramatic pieces not printed and
published; and for a stated term, if printed and published. 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 15. By § 20 of the Copyright
Act of 1842, 5 & 6 Vict., c. 45, it was provided that the
sole liberty of representing any dramatic piece should be
the property of the author and his assigns for the term
therein specified for the duration of copyright in books.
The section continued: "and the Provisions hereinbefore
enacted in respect of the Property of such Copyright, and
of registering the same, shall apply to the Liberty of representing or performing any Dramatic Piece or Musical.
Composition, as if the same -were herein expressly re~nacted and applied thereto, save and except that the first
public Representation or Performance of any Dramatic
Piece or Musical Composition shall be deemed equivalent,
in the Construction of this Act, to the first Publication of
any Book." Mr. Scrutton, in his work on copyright (4th
ed., p. 77), states that it is "probable, though there is no
express decision to that effect, that the court, following
-Donaldsonv. Beckett (2 Brom. Cases in Parl. 129), would
hold the common-law right destroyed: by the statutory
provisions after first performance in public." Compare
MacGillivray on Copyright, pp. 122, 127, 128. And it
may be assumed, in this case, that after the play had been
performed the right of the owners to protection against
its unauthorized production in England was only that
given by the statutes.
Further, in the absence of a copyright convention,
there is no playright in England in the case of a play, not
printed and published, where the first public performance
has taken place outside the British dominions. This

FERRIS v. FROHMAN.
223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

results from § 19 of the act of 7 & 8 Vict., c. 12, known as
the International Copyright Act, which provides:" Neither
the Author of any Book, nor the Author or Composer
of any Dramatic Piece or Musical Composition,
which shall after the passing of this Act be first published
out of Her Majesty's Dominions, shall have any Copyright therein respectively, or any exclusive Right to the
public Representation or Performance thereof, otherwise
than such (if any) as he may become entitled to under
this Act." The provision applies to British subjects as
well as to foreigners, and the words "first published"
include the first performance of a play. In Boucicault v.
Delafield (1 H. & M. 597), the author of the play known
as "The Colleen Bawn" filed a bill to restrain a piratical
production. It appeared that the play had first been
represented in New York, and by reason of that factthere being no copyright convention with the United
States-it was held that, under the statute above quoted,
there was no playright in England. To the same effect is
Boucicault v. Chatterton (5 Ch. Div. 267), where the author
unsuccessfully sought to restrain an' unauthorized performance of "The Shaughraun," an unprinted play which
had first been represented here.
The British Parliament, in thus fixing the limits and
conditions of performing rights, was dealing with rights
to be exercised within British territory. It is argued that
the English authors in this case, by the law of their domicile, were without common-law right and in its stead secured the protection of the British statutes which cannot
avail them here. But the British statutes did not purport
to curtail any right of such authors with respect to the
representation of plays outside the British dominions.
They disclose no intention to destroy rights for which
they provided no substitute. There is no indication of a
purpose to incapacitate British citizens from holding their
intellectual productions secure from interference in other
VOL. ccxxiii-28

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

223 U. S.

jurisdictions according to the principles of the common
law. Their right was not gone simpliciter, but only in a
qualified sense for the purposes of the statutes, and there
was no convention under which the authors' work became public property in the United States. See Saxlehner
v. Eisner, 179 U. S. 19, 36; Saxlehner v. Wagner, 216 U. S.
375, 381. When § 20 of the act of 5 & 6 Vict., c. 45, provided that the first public performance of a play should be
deemed equivalent, in the construction of that act, to
the first publication of a book, it simply defined its meaning with respect to the rights Which the statutes conferred.
The deprivation of the common-law right, by force of
the statute, was plainly limited by the territorial bounds
within which the operation of the statute was confined.
The present case is not one in which the owner of a
play has printed and published it and thus, having lost
his rights at common law, must depend upon statutory
copyright in this country. The play in question has not
been printed and published. It is not open to dispute
that the authors of "The Fatal Card" had a commonlaw right of property in the play until it was publicly performed. Donaldson v. Beckett, 2 Bro. Cases in Parl. 129;
Prince Albert v. Strange, 1 MacN. & G. 25; Jefferys v.
Boosey, 4 H. L. C. 815, 962, 978. And they were entitled
to protection against its unauthorized use here as well
as in England. Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 657; Paige
v. Banks, 13 Wall. 608, 614; Bartlett v. Crittenden, 5 McLean, 32; Crowe v. Aiken, 2 Biss. 208; Palmer v. De Witt,
2 Sweeny, 530; 47 N. Y. 532.
What effect, then, had the performance of the play in
England upon the rights of the owners with respect to
its use in the United States? There was no statute here
by virtue of which the common-law right was lost through
the performance of the unpublished play. The act of
August 18, 1856 (11 Stat. 138, c. 169), related only to
dramatic compositions for which copyright had been

FERRIS v. FROHMAN.
223 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

obtained in this country; its object was to secure to the
author of a copyrighted play the sole right to its performance after it had been printed. Bouccault v. Fox, 5
Blatchf. 87, 97, 98. The same is true of the provisions of
the Copyright Act of July 8, 1870 (16 Stat. 198, 212, 214;
R. S. 4952, 4966), 'and of those of the act of March 3, 1891
(26 Stat. 1106, 1107), which were in force when the transactions in question occurred and this suit was brought.
The fact that the act of March 3, 1891, was applicable to
citizens of foreign countries, permitting to our citizens the
benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as
its own citizens (§ 13), and that proclamation to this
effect was made by the President with respect to Great
Britain (27 Stat. 981), did not make the British statutes
operative within the United States. Nor did thdt fact
add to the provisions of the act of Congress so as to make
the latter destructive -of the common-law rights of English
subjects in relation to the representation of plays in this
country, which were not copyrighted under that act and
which remained unpublished. These rights, like those of
our own citizens in similar case, the act of 1891 did not
disturb.
The public representation of a dramatic composition,
not printed and published, does not deprive the owner of
his common-law right, save by operation of statute. At
common law, the public performance of the play is not
an abandonment of it to the public use. Macklin v. Richardson, Ambler, 694; Morris v. Kelly, 1 Jac. & W. 481;
Boucicault v. Fox, 5 Blatchf. 87, 97; Crowe v. Aiken, 2
Biss. 208; Palmer v. De Wilt, 2 Sweeny, 530, 47 N. Y.
532; Tompkins v. Halleck, 133 Massachusetts, 32. Story
states the rule as follows: "So, where a dramatic performance has been allowed by the author to be acted at
a theatre, no person has a right to pirate such performance, and to publish copies of it surreptitiously; or to
act it at another theatre without the consent of the author

223 U. S.

or proprietor; for his permission to act it at a public
theatre does not amount to an abandonment of his title
to it, or to a dedication of it to the public at large."
2 Story, Eq. Jur., § 950. It has been said that the owner
of a play cannot complain if the piece is reproduced from
memory. Keene v. Wheatley, 9 Am. Law Reg. 33; Keene v.
Kimball, 16 Gray, 545. But the distinction is without
sound basis and has been repudiated. Tompkins v. Hal'leck, supra.
And, as the British statutes did not affect the commonlaw right of representation in this country, it is not material that the first performance of the play in question
took place in England. In Crowe v. Aiken (1870), supra,
the play "Mary Warner" had been composed by a British
subject. It was transferred to the plaintiff with the
exclusive right to its representation on the stage in the
United States for five years from June 1, 1869. It had
not been printed with the consent either of the author or
of the plaintiff. It was first publicly performed in London
in June, 1869, and afterwards was represented here. The
court (Drummond, J.), held that the plaintiff by virtue
of his common-law right was entitled to an injunction
restraining an unauthorized production. In Palmer v.
De Witt (1872), supra, the suit was brought to restrain
the defendant from printing an unpublished drama called
"Play," composed by a British citizen resident in London.
The plaintiff on February 1, 1868, had purchased the exclusive right of printing and performing the play in the
United States. On February 15, 1868, it was first performed in London. It was held that the common-law
right had not been destroyed by the public representation
and the plaintiff had judgment. In the case last cited,
and apparently in that of Crowe v. Aiken, the transfer to
the plaintiff antedated the public performance, but neither
decision was rested on that distinction. In Tompkins
v. Halleck (1882), supra, an unpublished play called

Syllabus.

"The World" had been written in England where, after
being presented, it was assigned by the author to a purchaser in New York. It was acted in that city and then
transferred to the plaintiffs with the exclusive right of
representation in the New England States. The plaintiffs'
common-law right was sustained and an unauthorized performance was enjoined.,
Our conclusion is that the complainants were the owners
of the original play and exclusively entitled to produce it.
Their common-law right with respect to its representation
in this country had not been lost. This being so, the play
of the plaintiff in error, which was substantially identical
with that of the complainants, was simply a piratical composition. It was not the purpose or effect of the copyright
law to render secure the fruits of piracy, and the plaintiff
in error is not entitled to the protection 6f the statute. In
other words, the claim of Federal right upon which he relies.
is without merit.
