Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

MILLER v. KING, SUBSTITUTED FOR THE FIRST
NATIONAL BANK OF FAYETTE, IDAHO.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON.
No. 153.

Argued January 22, 23, 1912.-Decided February 19, 1912.

While a national bank cannot act as trustee and hold land for third
persons, under § 5136, Rev. Stat., it may do those acts that are
usual and necessary in making collections of commercial paper and
evidences of debt.
A national bank, under § 5136, Rev. Stat., may be assignee of a judgment to collect and distribute the amount thereof where the assignment is not made merely to enable it to sue in its own name.
Under the law of Oregon, a national bank holding a chose in action
as trustee to collect and distribute may sue in its own name.
Quwre: Whether any but the Government can raise the question that
a national bank in acting as trustee violates § 5136, Rev. Stat.

was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
A national bank cannot act as trustee under an express

clearly ultra vires and are not binding upon either the bank

MR. JUSTICE LAMAR

delivered the opinion of the court.

Miller, the plaintiff in error, was the attorney of Helmick
in an action against Porter. The judgment obtained in
that suit was assigned by Helmick to the First National
Bank of Fayette, Idaho, which executed an instrument
reciting that it would hold any money collected subject
to the order of Helmick. At the time of making the
assignment Helmick gave verbal instructions to pay part
of the money when collected to Lauer. The bank placed
the judgment in the hands of Miller, who collected the
money, and,. claiming to act as attorney for Helmick,
paid over the proceeds to the Moss Mercantile Company,
which asserted that the cause of action had been transferred to it prior to the rendition of the judgment. The
bank thereupon brought suit against Miller for the recovery of the money thus collected by him and paid over
to a third party. The defendant answered, denying that
the bank had title; alleging that it had paid no consideration for the transfer; that it was intended to defraud
creditors; setting up that Helmick had revoked the assignment and had given Miller a release. There was, however,
no claim that the charter of the bank prevented it from
taking the transfer or prosecuting the suit.
There were several trials of the case, and ultimately,
with the consent of Helmick and Lauer, the bank assigned
the judgment to King. He was substituted as plaintiff,
and recovered a judgment against Miller. The case was

taken to the Supreme Court, where it was contended that
a national bank could not act as trustee of an express
trust so as to be able to institute and maintain a suit
under the statute of Oregon, which provides that the trustee of an express trust may sue without joining the person
for whose interest the action is prosecuted. The judgment was affirmed, and no Federal question is presented
in the writ of error here except on the theory that, under
'Revised Statutes; § 5136, a national bank could not act
as trustee of an express trust, and that therefore the suit
was absolutely void, and could not pr6ceed to judgment
in the name of the substituted plaintiff.
A national bank cannot act as a technical trustee and
hold land for the benefit of third persons. It cannot, for
example, act as trustee under a railroad mortgage, nor
take title to property to be held for the life of the grantor,
with remainder to his children. Every such transaction
would be voidable at the instance of the Government.
Kerfoot v. Farmers' Bank, 218 U. S. 281. But under Revised Statutes, §536, "it may exercise all such incidental
powers as shall be necessary to carry on banking," and it
may therefore act as a fiduciary and occupy a trust relation in matters connected with that business. It may
do those acts and occupy those relations which are usual
or necessaxy in making collections of commercial paper
and other evidences of debt. It is both usual and proper
for the legal title to negotiable instruments to be vested
in a bank by mere endorsement for purposes of collection,
holding the proceeds as the endorser directs. There is no
difference ia law if the title is conveyed by a lengthier
and more formal instrument. In both cases the bank
takes the legal title for the purpose of demand and collection. In a proper case, there is no reason why it might
not go, further and institute suit thereon in its own name
for the recovery of what may be due. If the transfer was
made, or the suit was being maintained, for purposes not

Opinion of the Court.

authorized by the charter of the bank, and if the defendant was in a position where his rights were prejudiced
thereby, it would be incumbent on him to raise that defense -at the outset of the litigation, or as soon as he
learned that fact.
In this case the assignment was made in order that the
bank might collect the money, pay part to Lauer, and, in
effect, hold the balance on deposit to the credit of Helmick.
The judgment was not transferred to the bank for the
mere purpose of enabling it to bring suit in its own name.
At the time of the transfer no suit was contemplated, and,
indeed, none was necessary, because the money was immediately paid by Porter. Suit only became necessary
when the amount collected by Miller was later improperly paid over by him to the Moss Mercantile Company.
There was nothing in this transaction which was so disconnected with the banking business as to make it in
violation of Rev. Stat. § 5136, even if the defendant could
raise such question. Kerfoot v. Bank, 218 U. S. 281. The
laws of Oregon permitted an action to be maintained by
the bank in its own name. There is no Federal question
before us which authorizes a reversal, and the judgment is
Affirmed.
