PER CURIAM: This suit was brought to recover the sum of

from June, 1900, to April 1, 1906, to wit: For attendance on
court while actually in session during the terms, with the judge
presiding and judicial business actually. transacted in court, as
provided by §§ 574, 638 and 828, Rev. Stat., and chapter II,
§ 2, Bankruptcy Act (30 Stat. L. 545), 107 days at $5.00 per
day."
The Court of Claims filed its findings of fact and conclusion
of law April 20, 1908, as follows:
"Findings of fact.
"I. During the times hereinafter mentioned the claimant,

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Per Curiam.

212 U. S.

Edwin E. Marvin, was clerk of the District and Circuit Courts
of the United States for the District of Connecticut.
"II. For services on behalf of the United States during the
period from July. 1, 1900, to April 1, 1906, the claimant made
up his supplemental accounts duly verified, and presented the
same to the United States court for approval in the presence
of the district attorney, and orders approving the same as being
just and according to law were entered of record. Said accounts were then presented to the Attorney General and the
accounting officers of the Treasury Department for payment,
and the payment of the items embraced in Finding III was
refused.
"III. 'Said items, the payment of which was so refused,
were alleged to be for attendance on court while actually in
session during the terms, or when business was transacted 'in
court upon order of the judge, and were for 107 days at $5.00
per day, making $535.
"The business so transacted was the reference by the clerk
to the referee of voluntary petitions in bankruptcy filed during
the absence of the judge from the district. No written orders
were received by the clerk to open the court for the purpose of
making said references, or for any other purpose; the judge
was not personally present, and no writs, orders or decrees
were received from the judge sitting in chambers. The journal
made by the claimant does not show that the court was open
on any of the days for -which per diems are claimed. The
claimant, after learning of the decisidn of the Court of Claims
in the Owen case (41 C. Cls. R. 69), went back in his District
Court journal and on the last day of every month over which
his account extended interlined the days in such month upon
which he had made references, merely stating them as days in
which court business in bankruptcy proceedings was transacted.
"Conclusion of law.
"Upon the foregoing findings of fact the court decides, as a
conclusion of law, that, under the Owen case (41 C; Cls. R. 69),

UNITED STATES v. MARVIN.
212 U. S.

Per Curiam.

and the Finnell case (185 U. S. 236), the claimant is entitled to
a judgment for five hundred and thirty-five dollars ($535)."
And entered judgment without an opinion. 42 Ct. Cls. 542.
The case was brought here by appeal and submitted on
printed arguments.
Counsel for appellee referred to a certified copy of the order
of court approving the account referred to in'Finding II, stating that it was attached to the account of claimant now on file
in the. Court of Claims. . That order contains, among other
things, "It is hereby certified that upon each day for which a
per diem is charged in this account the court was opened for
business and court business transacted in bankruptcy matters
as stated."
The G6vernment objects ofn the ground that the order is not
set forth in the findings, and moreover that the paragraph is of
no effect, "because'in the nature of a statement of a conclusion
of law."
The various applicable statutory provisions will be found in
United States v. Finnell, 185 U. S. 236, and in Owen v. United
States, 41 Ct. Cls. 69.
We concur with the Court of Claims that the two cases cited
govern the disposition of this-case, and, accordingly, affirm the
judgment.
