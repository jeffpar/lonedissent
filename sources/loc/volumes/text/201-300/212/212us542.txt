in any way inconsistent with the foregoing cases. The fellowservant doctrine was not there considered by the court.. The
plaintiff in that case was a section hand, Who received injuries
by jumping from a moving train in' obedience to the order of
the conductor. The only question before this court was whether
the act of the plaintiff was in itself, as matter of law, contributory negligence, and it was held that under the circumstances
disclosed in the evidence it was proper to submit the question
of contributory negligence to the jury. It does not appear in
thai case what was the negligence for which the plaintiff sought
to hold the defendant responsible.. In the trial court the defendant made two requests: First, that no negligence on the part
of the defendapt was shown; and,.second, that the plaintiff was
guilty of suclh, contributory negligence that he could nIot recover. The defendant saw fit to bring to this court only the
question of contributory negligence, and the opinion of the
court expressly stated that the discussion would be confined to
that question alone. An examination of the case, as it was exhibited tothe Circuit Court of Appeals, discloses that contributory negligence was the only question, passed upon by that
court. 56. Fed. Rep., 200.:

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF .THE UNITED STATES FOR

No. 49.

Argued December 9, 1908.-7Decided February 23, 1909.

After the Circuit Court of the United' States has'heard and passed on
evidence affecting- its jurisdiction, its judgment is open to review in
the appellate court by writ of error, but the judgment cannot be attacked collaterally as absolutely void.
.Even though the Circuit Court erroneously retains jurisdiction of a
criminal case. against an allottee Indian, its judgment is not void but

should. be corrected on appeal or by writ of error. and cannot be attacked in habea8 corpus proceedings...

Argument for Appellant.

In re Heff, 197 U. S. 488, as explained in In re Lincoln, 202 U. S. 178,
distinguished.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. A. E. Crane, with whom Mr. F. T. Woodburn was on the
brief, for appellant:
The statute under which the petitioner was prosecuted applies only to murders committed by Indians upon reservations
within States. The Federal courts have no jurisdiction of
offenses committed' by citizen Indians. United States v.
Kagama, 118 U. S. 375; State v. Smokalen, .79'Pac. Rep. 603;
Ur,'ted States v. Thomas, 151 U. S. 585; State v. Campbell, 55
N. W. Rep. 553.
The petitioner being a citizen of the United States and of the
State of Oregon at the time of the commission of the offense
charged in the indictment, the act of Congress, if it applies, was
unconstitutional and void as attempting to usurp the police
powers of the. State. The case of In re Heff, 197 U. S. 488, is
decisive of this point.
The petitioner, having taken an allotment of land in severalty and the preliminary patent having been issued therefor,
was a citizen of the United States and of the State of Oregon,
by virtue of the act of. Congress of February 8, 1887. In re
.Heff, 197 U. S. 488; In re Now-Ge-Zhuck, 76 Pac. Rep. 877;

Nebraska, 299; Boyd v. Nebraska, 143 U. S. 155; Guyatt v.
Kautz, 83 Pac. Rep. 9.
The act of March 3, 1885, applies only when the crime 'is
committed by a tribal Indian and when the offense is committed on an Indian reservation. To sustain an indictment under that act, it is. necessary. to prove that the defendant at the
time of the commission of the offense was a tribal Indian and
that the crime was committed upon an Indian reservation.
The Umatilla .Indian reservation had been allotted in severalty
to the members of the tribe at the time of the commission of

the offense and it was not an Indian reservation and the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction for that reason. Forty-Three
Cases of Brandy, 14 Fed. Rep. 539; United States v. Kagama,
118 U. S. 383; United States v. Richert, 106 Fed. Rep. 6; Draper
v. United States, 164 U. S. 240, 246; State v. Campbell, 55 N. W.
Rep. 553, 555.
When a court acts without authority its judgment and orders
are. regardedas nullities. They form no bar to a remedy sought
in opposition to them even prior to reversal.. The jurisdiction
of any court, exercising authority over a subject, may be inquired into when the proceedings of the former are relied upon.
When a court assumes to act where it has no jurisdiction, its
adjudications would be utterly void as an estoppel. In re Heff,
197 U. S. 488; Basso Case, 40 Ct. Cl. 202; In re Cuddy, 131 U. S.
280, 286; Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S. 168; In re Mayfield,
141 U. S. 107; Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457; Perry,
Admr., v. St. Joe & W. R. R. Co., 29 Kansas, 420, 423; Griffith
v. Frazir,8 Cranch, 23; Scott V.'McNeal, 154 U. S. 34; Thompson v. Tolmi, 2 Pet. 157, 163; Wise v. Withers; 3 Cranch, 331,
337; Rose v. Himley 4 Cranch, 241,.268; Cooper v. Newell, 173
U. S. 555; Dow v. Johnson, 100 U. S. 158.
If the Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction of the subjectmatter of the action, the acts and conduct of the petitioner
could not give it jurisdiction and do not estop him. Jurisdiction can only. be conferred by the sovereign authority which
organizes the court. A void judgment cannot be the basis of an
estoppel' State v. Jennings, 24 Kansas, 654; Gruner v. United
States, 11 How. 163; McKinnon v. Hall, 50 Pac. Rep. 1052;

Jackson, 13 Pet. 511.
If the-indictment in question in this case had alleged that
Toy Toy was an Indian to whom an allotment of land in severalty had been made and that he had received his preliminary
patent therefor, the judgment would have been void upon its

face and could have been questioned in this action. By a
failure to allege the facts, the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.

The Solicitor General for appellee:
Appellant and Columbia George have been convicted both in
the state and Federal courts of Oregon, and sentenced in the
Federal court to life imprisonment. After the lapse of four
years their counsel applied to this court for leave to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and on the denial of that motion, a petition for the writ on behalf of this appellant alone was
filed in the United States Circuit Court for the Western District of Washington. This course is simply a persistent effort
to thwart justice to the end that two doubly convicted criminals
should go unpunished.
The record affirmatively shows that the Circuit Court for
Oregon had jurisdiction and was authorized to hear and pass
upon the questions involved. Its decision was open to review
in the appellate court by writ of error, and defendants, having
chosen not to pursue that course, cannot now attempt to secure
a correction of the alleged errors through a writ of habeas
corpus. This court has repeatedly ruled that the writ of habeas
corpus 'cannot be made to perform the functions of a writ of
error. In re Eckart, 166 U. S. 481; Dimmick v. Tompkins, 194
U. S. 540; Riggins v. United States, 199 U. S. 547; Valentina v.
Mercer, 201 U. S. 131; Fflts v. Murphy, 201 U. S. 123; In re
Lincoln, 202 U. S. 178.
The decision of the Circuit Court cannot be impeached collaterally as absolutely void. The conviction here in the state
and Federal courts have carried the guilt of this defendant into
the region of fixed and established facts beyond the effect of
any alleged failure of jurisdiction, on a question raised years
afterwards, to overthrow. See United States v. ChandlerVOL. ccxii-35

The court has shown no disposition to extend the decision
in In re Heff, 197 U. S. 488, which must be considered in the
light of the facts of that case. In re Lincoln, 202 U. S. 178.
Notwithstanding the Heff decision,, Congress may exercise
police control over lands allotted in severalty as to which the
Indian title is extinguished, although the Indians may be citizens and the lands within the limits of a State. That may be
the effect of an agreement with the Indians ratified by Congress.
Dick v. United States, 208 U. S. 340. The act of May 3, 1885,
23 Stat. 340, providing for allotments in severalty on the
Umatilla reservation, produces the same effect. Notwithstanding the allotment it was the intention of Congress to maintain the reservation within reduced limits, and to preserve-the
tribal relations. That law was so construed by the Supreme
Court of Oregon in State v. Columbia George, 39 Oregon, 127,
188, 147; see also United States v. Flournoy Live Stock Co., 71
Fed. Rep: 576; S. C., 79 Fed. Rep. 886.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER

delivered the opinion of the

court.
Toy Toy and Columbia George, both Indians of the Umatilla
tribe, were jointly indicted in a state court-in Oregon for the
crime of murder in the first degree, committed on an Indian
woman on the United States Indian reservation in Umatilla
County, Oregon; were separately tried and convicted, and each
sentenced to death. Columbia George appealed from the judgment of conviction on the ground, among others, that-the state
court was without jurisdiction, inasmuch as the crime was
committed by Indians upon an Indian on an Indian reservation,
and that it was therefore within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Federal courts. In a careful opinion by Wolverton, J., the
Supreme Court of the State of Oregon upheld this contention,
and, reversing the judgment of the trial court, ordered the dis-

charge of the defendant. State v. Columbia George, 39 Oregon,
127. Thereupon defendants were indicted under § 5339 of the
Revised Statutes in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the District of Oregon, regularly tried and convicted of murder
(without capital punishment) and sentenced to imprisonment
for the term of their natural lives.
At October term, 1905, application was made to this court
for leave to file a petition for the writ of habeas corpus, which
was denied March 5, 1906. 201 U. S.641. Thereafter a petition for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Toy Toy only was
filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western
District of Washington. That court denied the petition, and
the case is now before this court on appeal.
The indictment in this case charged Columbia George and
Toy Toy, Indians, with the murder of Annie Edna, an Indian
woman, upon the Umatilla Reservation within the State and
District of Oregon.
On the face of the record the United States Circuit Court for
the District of Oregon, in which these Indians were last tried
and convicted, had jurisdiction of the offense and of the defendants. They were tried, found guilty and sentenced to the
,penitentiary for life. Five years thereafter Toy Toy applied
for the writ of habeas corpus, and alleged that the indictment,
arraignment, trial, judgment, sentence and commitment were
wholly null and void for want of jurisdiction over subjectmatter and person. The petition alleged:
"That the place where said Annie Edna was killed was a tract
of land which had once been a part of the Umatilla Indian
Reservation, in the State of Oregon, but that long prior to and
at the time of the death of the said Annie Edna the said tract
of land had been allotted to one Tatzhammer, and a patent for
the said land had been duly issued to her, by the United States,
as a member of the Umatilla tribe of Indians. And that the
said premises whereon said Annie Edna was killed, by reason
of said allotment and patent, ceased to be Indian country and
ceased to be a part of the said Umatilla Indian Reservation

in Oregon. That on the 16th day of September, 1899, your
petitioner, who was prior thereto a member of the Umatilla
tribe of Indians, received an allotment of land from what had
theretofore been a part of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in
Oregon, and received from the United States a preliminary
patent for said allotment, and by reason of said allotment and
patent of land, and by virtue of the'act of Congress, approved
February 8, 1887, your petitioner became, and at the time of the
killing of the said Annie Edna on the 24th day of August, 1900,
was, and at all times since has been a citizen of the United
States and of the State of Oregon, and subject to its laws.
"Your petitioner further states that he was born within4 the
territorial limits of the United States, and that at the time of
the killing of the said Annie Edna your petitioner had voluntarily taken up within the limits of the United States his residence, separate and apart from the Umatilla tribe of Indians,
and had adopted the habits of civilized life, and that for all of
the reasons heretofore given the act of Congress of March 3,
1885, is unconstitutional and void when applied to the facts
herein set out."
If such were the facts, and they made out a want of jurisdiction under the applicable statutes, which on the merits we
do not hold, the Circuit Court, nevertheless, was authorized to
hear and pass upon those questions in the first instance, and its
decision was open to review in the appellate court by writ of
error. But it could not be attacked collaterally as absolutely
void, and )iabeascorpus cannot be availed of as a writ of error.
"It is rarely that things are wholly void and without force
and effect as to all persons and for all purposes, and incapable
of being. made otherwise. Things are voidable which are valid
and effectual until they are avoided by some act; while things
are often said to be void, which are without validity until confirmed." 8 Bac. Abr. Void and Voidable; Ewell v. Daggs, 108
U. S. 143; Weeks v. Bridgman, 159 U. S. 541, .547; Louisville
Trust Co. v. Comingor, 184 U. S. 18, 25. In the latter case we
said, among other things:

Opinion of the Court.

"Jurisdiction as to the subject-matter may be limited in
various ways, as to civil and criminal cases; cases at common
law or in equity or in admiralty; probate cases, or cases under
special statutes; to particular classes of persons; to proceedings
in particular modes; and so on. In many cases jurisdiction
may depend on the ascertainrient of facts involving the merits,
and in that sense the court exercises- jurisdiction in disposing
of the preliminary inquiry, although the result may be that it
finds that it cannot go farther. And where, in a case like that
before us, the court erroneously retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits, its action can be corrected on review."
And see United States v. Shipp, 203 U. S. 563.
We are of opinion that the Circuit Court was right in denying
the application for the writ of habeas corpus and that its final
order must be affirmed.
It is true that the writ was granted in the case*of In re Heff,
197 U. S. 488, but the explanation of that case, given in the
case of In re Lincoln, 202 U. S. 178, deprives it of any weight
here.
Final order affirmed.
