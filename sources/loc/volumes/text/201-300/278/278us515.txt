274 U. S. 684, 689.) The action of the trial court here in
denying the motion to transfer was within its authority,
and does not call for our interference. Jurisdiction of the
court sitting in equity, having been rightfully invoked, was
not lost either because the interlocutory injunction was
denied in the exercise of judicial discretion or by the expiration of the patent pending final decree. This conclusion finds support in the principle that "a court of equity
ought to do justice completely and not by halves," and to
this end, having properly acquired jurisdiction of the cause
for any purpose, it will ordinarily retain jurisdiction for
all purposes, including the determination of legal rights
that otherwise would fall within the exclusive authority

of a court of law.

FROST, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME OF
MITCHELL GIN COMPANY, v. CORPORATION
COMMISSION OF OKLAHOMA ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 60.

Argued November 26, 1928.-Decided February 18, 1929.

1. By the statutes of Oklahoma, cotton gins operated for the ginning
of seed cotton for the public for profit are declared to be public
utilities in a public business, and no one may engage in the business
without first securing a permit from a public commission, which is
empowered to regulate the business and its rates and charges, as in
the case of transportation and transmission companies. Held: That
the right of one who has complied with the statutes and secured
his permit is not a mere license, but a franchise granted by the
State in consideration of the performance of a public service; and
as such it constitutes a property right within the protection of the
Fourteenth Amendment. P. 519.

2. While the franchise thus acquired does not preclude the State
from making similar valid grants to. others, it is exclusive against
attempts to operate a competing gin without a permit or under
a void permit, in either of which events the owner may resort to a
court of equity to restrain the illegal operation as an invasion of
his property rights, if it threaten an impairment- of his business.
P. 521.
3. An individual who obtained his permit to cperate a cotton gin
upon showing a public necessity therefor as required by the statute, held entitled to an injunction restraining the state commission from granting a permit to a corporation without such a
showing under a separable provision of the statute violating the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id.
4. A state statute regulating the business of ginning cotton for the
general public for profit, which permits an individual to engage
in such business only upon his first showing a public necessity
therefor, but allows a corporation to engage in the same business,
in the same locality, without such showing, discriminates against
the individual in violation of the equpl protection clause. The
classification attempted is essentially arbitrary because based upon
no real or substantial differences reasonably related to the subject
of the legislation. P. 521.
5. A co-operative ginning corporation formed under Oklahoma Comp.
Stats. 1921, § 5637, et seq., having a capital stock, which, up to
a certain amount, may be subscribed for by anyone; which is
allowed to do business for others than its members, and to make
profits and declare dividends, not exceeding 8% per annum, and
to apportion the remainder of its earnings among its members
ratably upon the amount of products sold by them to the corporation, is not a mutual association. P. 523.
6. A proviso added to an existing statutory provision by a subsequent legislature, and the effect of which if it were part of the
original enactment would be to render the whole unconstitutional,
may be treated as a separate nullity, allowing the original to
stand. P. 525.
7. In such case, one who sought and obtained property rights
under the original and valid part of the statute, is not estopped
from attacking the proviso. P. 527.

Opinion of the Court.

Commission of Oklahoma from issuing to a corporation
a license to operate a cotton gin, and to enjoin the corporation from establishing and operating one. At an earlier
stage there was an order, denying a preliminary injunction, which was affirmed by this Court, 274 U. S. 719.
Messrs. Robert M. Rainey and Streeter B. Flynn, with
whom Mr. Calvin Jones was on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. E. S. Ratliff, with whom Messrs. Edwin B. Dabney, Attorney General of Oklahoma, and J. D. Holland
were on the brief, for appellees.
Mr. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Appellant owns a cotton ginning business in the city
of Durant, Oklahoma, which he operates under a permit
from the State Corporation Commission. By a statute
of Oklahoma, originally passed in 1915 and amended from
time to time thereafter, cotton gins are declared to be
public utilities and their operation for the purpose of
ginning seed cotton to be a public business. Comp. Stats.
1921, § 3712. The commission is empowered to fix their
charges and to regulate and control them in other respects.
§ 3715. No gin can be operated without a license from
the commission, and in order to secure such license there
must be a satisfactory showing of public necessity. § 3714
as amended by c. 109, Session Laws, 1925. The only substantial amendment to this section made by the act of
1925 is to add the proviso: "provided, that on the presentation of a petition for the establishment of a gin to be
run co-operatively, signed by one hundred (100) citizens
and tax payers of the community where the gin is to be
located, the Corporation Commission shall issue a license
for said gin."
By an act of the State Legislature passed in 1917
(Comp. Stats. 1921, § 5599) co-operative agricultural or

518

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

horticultural associations not having capital stock or being
conducted for profit, may be formed for the purpose of
mutual help by persons engaged in agriculture or horticulture. Under a statute passed in 1919 (Comp. Stats.
1921, § 5637, et seq.) ten or more persons may form a
corporation for the purpose of conducting, among others,
an agricultural or horticultural business upon a co-operative plan. A corporation thus formed is authorized to
issue capital stock to be sold at not less than its par value.
The number of shares which may be held by one person,
firm or corporation is limited. Dividends may be declared
by the directors at a rate not to exceed eight per cent. per
annum. Provision is made for setting aside a surplus or
reserve fund; and five per cent. may be set aside for ed ucational purposes. The remainder of the profits of the
corporation must be apportioned and paid to its members
ratably upon the amounts of the products sold to the corporation by its members and the amounts of the purchases
of members from the corporation; but the corporation
may adopt by-laws providing for the apportionment of
such profits in part to non-members upon the amounts
of their purchases and sales from or to the corporation.
The Durant Co-operative Gin Company, one of the
appellees, was organized in 1926 under the act of 1919.
After its incorporation, the company made an application
to the commission for a permit to establish a cotton gin
at Durant, accompanying its application with a petition
signed by 100 citizens and taxpayers, as required by the
statutory proviso above quoted. Appellant protested in
writing against the granting of such permit and there was
a hearing. The commission, at the hearing, rejected an
offer to show that there was no public necessity for the
establishment of an additional gin at Durant, and held
that the proviso made it mandatory to grant the permit
applied for without regard to necessity. Thereupon ap-

Opinion of the Court.

pellant brought this suit to enjoin the commission from
issuing the permit prayed for and to enjoin the Durant
company from the establishment of a cotton gin at Durant, upon the ground that the proviso, as construed and
applied by the commission (see Mont. Bank v. Yellowstone County, 276 U. S. 499, 504), was invalid as contravening the due process and equal protection of the law
clauses ofthe Fourteenth Amendment. The court below,
consisting of three judges under § 266 Judicial Code,
denied the prayer for an injunction and entered a final
decree dismissing the bill. 26 F. (2d) 508.
1. We first consider the preliminary contention made
on behalf of appellees that appellant has no property right
to be affected by operations of the Durant company and,
therefore, no standing to invoke the provisions of the
Fourteenth Amendment or to appeal to a court of equity.
It already appears that cotton gins are declared by the
Oklahoma statute to be public utilities and their operation
for the purpose of ginning seed cotton to be public business. No one can operate a cotton gin for such purpose
without securing a permit from the commission. In their
regulation and control, the commission is given the same
authority which it has in respect of transportation and
transmission companies, and the same power to fix rates,
charges and regulations. Comp. Stats. 1921, §,§3712,
3713, 3715. Under § 3714 as amended, supra (laying the
proviso out of consideration for the moment) the commission may deny a permit for the operation of a gin where
there is no public necessity for it, and may authorize a new
ginning plant only ,after a showing is made that such plant
is a needed utility. Both parties definitely concede the
validity of these provisions, and, for present purposes at
least, we accept that view.
It follows that the right to operate a gin and to collect
tolls therefor, as provided by the Oklahoma statute, is not

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

a mere license, but a franchise, granted by the state in consideration of the performance of a public service; and as
such it constitutes a property right within the protection
of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Walla Walla v. Walla
Walla Water Co., 172 U. S. 1, 9; Californiav. Pacific Railroad Co., 127 U. S. 1, 40-41; Monongahela Navigation Co.
v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 328, 329; Owensboro v.
Cumberland Telephone Co., 230 U. S. 58, 64-66; Boise
Water Co. v. Boise City, 230 U. S. 84, 90-91; McPhee &
McGinnity Co. v. Union Pac. R. Co., 158 Fed. 5, 10-11.
. In Californiav. Pacific RailroadCo., supra, pp. 40-41, a
franchise is defined as "a right, privilege or power of public concern, which ought not to be exercised by private individuals at their mere will and pleasure, but should be
reserved for public control and administration, either by
the government directly, or by public agents, acting under
such conditions and regulations as the government may
impose in the public interest, and for the public security. . . . No private person can establish a public
highway, or a public ferry, or railroad, or charge tolls for
the use of the same, without authority from the legislature, direct or derived. These are franchises ....
The
list might be continued indefinitely."
Specifically, the foregoing authorities establish that the
right to supply gas or water to a municipality and its inhabitants, the right to carry on the business of a telephone
system, to operate a railroad, a street railway, city water
works or gas works, to build a bridge, operate a ferry, and
to collect tolls therefor, are franchises. And these are but
illustrations of a more comprehensive list, from which it
is difficult, upon any conceivable ground, to exclude a cotton gin, declared by statute to be a public utility engaged
in a public business, the operation of which is precluded
without a permit from a state governmental agency, and
which is subject to the same authority as that exercised
over transportation and transmission companies in respect

FROST v. CORPORATION COMMISSION.
515

Opinion of the Court.

of rates, charges and regulations. Under these conditions,
to engage in the business is not a matter of common right,
but a privilege, the exercise of which, except in virtue of a
public grant, would be in derogation of the state's power.
Such a privilege, by every legitimate test, is a franchise.
Appellant, having complied with all the provisions of
the statute, acquired a right to operate a gin in the city of
Durant by valid grant from the state acting through the
corporation commission. While the right thus acquired
does not preclude the state from making similar valid
grants to others, it is, nevertheless, exclusive against any
person attempting to operate a gin without obtaining a
permit or, what amounts to the same thing, against one
who attempts to do so under a void permit; in either of
which events the owner may resort to a court of equity to
restrain the illegal operation upon the ground that such
operation is an injurious invasion of his property rights.
6 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence, 3d ed., (2 Equitable
Remedies) §,§
583, 584; People's Transit Co. v. Henshaw,
20 F. (2d) 87, 90; BartlesvilleEl. L. & P. Co. v. Bartlesville I. R. Co., 26 Okla. 453; Patterson v. Wollmann, 5
N. D. 608, 611; Millville Gas Co. v. Vineland L. & P. Co.,
72 N. J. Eq. 305, 307. The injury threatened by such an
invasion is the impairment of the owner's business, for
which there is no adequate remedy at law.
If the proviso dispensing with a showing of public necessity on the part of the Durant and similar companies is
invalid as claimed, the foregoing principles afford a sufficient basis for the maintenance of the present suit, against
not only the Durant company, but the members of the
commission who threaten to issue a permit for the establishment of a new gin by that company without a showing
of public necessity.
2. Is, then, the effect of the proviso to deny appellant
the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the
Fourteenth Amendment? As the proviso was construed

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

and applied by the commission and by the court below, its
effect is to relieve all corporations organized under the act
of 1919 from an onerous restriction upon the right to engage in a public business which is imposed by the statute
upon appellant and other individuals, as well as corporations organized under general law, engaging in such business. That a greater burden thereby is laid upon the
latter than upon the former is clear. Immunity to one
from a burden imposed upon another is a form of classification and necessarily results in inequality; but not
necessarily that inequality forbidden by the Constitution.
The inequality thus prohibited is only such as is actually
and palpably unreasonable and arbitrary. Arkansas Gas
Co. v. RailroadComm., 261 U. S. 379, 384, and cases cited.
The purpose of the clause in respect of equal protection
of the laws is to rest the rights of all persons upon the
same rule under similar circumstances. Louisville Gas
Co. v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32, 37. This Court has several
times decided that a corporation is as much entitled to the
equal protection of the laws as an individual. Quaker
City Cab Co. v. Penna., 277 U. S. 389, 400; Kentucky
Corp'n v. ParamountExchange, 262 U. S. 544, 550; Gulf,
Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, 154.
The converse, of course, is equally true. A classification
which is bad because it arbitrarily favors the individual
as against the corporation certainly cannot be good when
it favors the corporation as against the individual. In
either case, the classification, in order to be valid, "'must
rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and
substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so
that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated
alike.' Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415;
Air-way Corp. v. Day, 266 U. S. 71, 85; Schlesinger v.
Wisconsin, 270 U. S.230, 240. That is to say, mere difference is not enough: the attempted classification 'must
always rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable

Opinion of the Court.

and just relation to the act in respect to which the classification is proposed, and can never be made arbitrarily
and without any such basis.' Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe
Ry. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, 155." Louisville Gas Co. v.
Coleman, supra, p. 37.
By the terms of the statute here under consideration,
appellant, an individual, is forbidden to engage in business unless he can first show a public necessity in the
locality for it; while corporations organized under the act
of 1919, however numerous, may engage in the same business in the same locality no matter how extensively the
public necessity may be exceeded. That the immunity
thus granted to the corporation is one which bears injuriously against the individual does not admit of doubt,
since by multiplying plants without regard to necessity
the effect well may be to deprive him of business which he
would otherwise obtain if the substantive provision of the
statute were enforced.
It is important to bear in mind that the Durant company was not organized under the act of 1917, but under
that of 1919. The former authorizes the formation of an
association for mutual help, without capital stock, not
conducted for profit, and restricted to the business of its
own members, except that it may act as agent to sell farm
products and buy farm supplies for a non-member, but as
a condition may impose upon him a liability, not exceeding that of a member, for the contracts, debts and engagements of the association, such services to be performed at
the actual cost thereof including a pro rata part of the
overhead expenses. Comp. Stats. 1921, § 5608. Under
this exception, the difference between a non-member and
a member is not of such significance or the 4uthority conferred of such scope as to have any material effect upon
the general purposes or character of the corporation as a
mutual association. As applied to corporations organized
under the 1917 act, we have no reason to doubt that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

278 U. S.

classification created by the proviso might properly be
upheld. American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, 179
U. S. 89; Warehouse Co. v. Tobacco Growers, 276 U. S. 71.
A corporation organized under the act of 1919, however,
has capital stock, which, up to a certain amount, may be
subscribed for by any person, firm or corporation; is
allowed to do business for others; to make profits and
declare dividends, not exceeding eight per cent. per annum; and to apportion the remainder of its earnings
among its members ratably upon the amount of products
sold by them to the corporation. Such a corporation is in
no sense a mutual association. Like its individual competitor, it does business with the general public for the
sole purpose of making money. Its members need not
even be cotton growers. They may be-all or any of
them-bankers or merchants or capitalists having no interest in the business differing in any respect from that
of the members of an ordinary corporation. The differences relied upon to justify the classification are, for that
purpose, without substance. The provision for paying a
portion of the profits to members or, if so determined, to
non-members, based upon the amounts of their sales to or
purchases from the corporation, is a device which, without
special statutory authority, may be and often is resorted
to by ordinary corporations for the purpose of securing
business. As a basis for the classification attempted, it
lacks both relevancy and substance. Stripped of immaterial distinctions and reduced to its ultimate effect, the
proviso, as here construed and applied, baldly creates one
rule for a natural person and a different and contrary rule
for an artificial person, notwithstanding the fact that both
are doing the same business with the general public and
to the same end, namely, that of reaping profits. That is
to say, it produces a classification which subjects one to
the burden of showing a public necessity for his business,
from which it relieves the other, and is essentially arbi-

FROST v. CORPORATION COMMISSION.

Opinion of the Court.

trary, because based upon no real or substantial differences having reasonable relation to the subject dealt with
by the legislation. Power Co. v. Saunders, 274 U. S. 490,
493; Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, supra, p. 39; Quaker
City Cab Co. v. Penna., supra, p. 402.
3. The further question must be answered: Are the
proviso'and the substantive provisions which it qualifies
separable, so that the latter may stand although the
former has fallen? If the answer be in the negative, that
is to say, if the parts of the statute be held to be inseparable, the decree below should be affirmed, since, in that
event, although the proviso be bad, the inequality created
by it would disappear with the fall of the entire statute
and no basis for equitable relief would remain. But for
reasons now to be stated wQ are of opinion that the substantive provisions of the statute are severable and may
stand independently of the proviso.
If '§ 3714 as originally passed had contained the proviso, the effect would be to render the entire section invalid, because then the result of upholding the substantive
part of the section notwithstanding the invalidity of the
proviso would have been to make applicable to the Durant
company and others similarly organized, the requirement in
respect of a showing of public necessity, although the legislative will contemporaneously expressed as part of the
same act was to the contrary. In this state of the matter,
to hold otherwise would be to extend the scope of the law
in that regard so as to embrace corporations which the
legislature passing the statute had, by its very terms, expressly excluded, and thus to go in the face of the rule
that where the excepting proviso is found unconstitutional
the substantive provisions which it qualifies cannot stand.
Davis v. Wallace, 257 U. S. 478, 484. "For all the purposes of construction it [the proviso] is to be regarded as
part of the act. The meaning of the legislature must be
gathered from all they have said, as well from that which

278 U. S.

is ineffective for want of power, as from that which is
authorized by law." State ex rel. McNeal v. Dombaugh,
20 Ohio St. 167, 174-175.
But the proviso here in question was not in the original
section. It was added by way of amendment many years
after the original section was enacted. If valid, its practical effect would be to repeal by implication the requirement of the existing statute in respect of public necessity
insofar as the Durant and similar corporations are concerned. But since the amendment is void for unconstitutionality, it cannot be given that effect, "because an
existing statute cannot be recalled or restricted by anything short of a constitutional enactment." Davis v. Wallace, suprai, p. 485.
To this effect also is Truax v. Corrigan,257 U. S. 312,
341-342. In that case there had been in force in Arizona,
both as a state and a territory, for many years, a general
statute granting authority to judges of the courts of first
instance to issue writs of injunction. The statute was
amended so as to except from its operation certain cases
between employers and employees. The amendment was
declared invalid as denying the equal protection of the
laws; but the general provision of the statute as it originally stood was upheld upon the ground that it had been
in force for many years and that an exception in the form
of an unconstitutional amendment could not be given the
effect of repealing it. And see Waters-Pierce Oil Company v. Texas, 177 U. S.28, 47.
Here it is conceded that the statute, before the amendment, was entirely valid. When passed, it expressed the
will of the legislature which enacted it. Without an
express repeal, a different legislature undertook to create
an exception, but, since that body sought to express its
will by an amendment which, being unconstitutional, is a
nullity and, therefore, powerless to work any change in

FROST v. CORPORATION COMMISSION.
515

527

Opinion of the Court.

the existing statute, that statute must stand as the only
valid expression of the legislative intent.
In passing upon a similar situation, the Supreme Court
of Michigan, speaking through Judge Cooley, in C'ampau v.
Detroit, 14 Mich. 276, 286, said: "But nothing can come
in conflict with a nullity, and nothing is therefore repealed
by this act on the ground solely of its being inconsistent
with a section of this law which is entirely unconstitutional
and void." In Carr,Auditor, v. "Stateex rel. Coetlosquet,
127 Ind. 204, 215, the state supreme court disposed of the
same point in these words: "We suppose it clear that no
law can be changed or repealed by a subsequent act which
is void because unconstitutional. . . . An act which
violates the Constitution has no power and can, of course,
neither build up nor tear down. It can neither create new
rights nor destroy existing ones. It is an empty legislative
declaration without force or vitality." See also People v.
ButlerStreet Foundry,201 Ill. 236, 257-259; People V. Fox,
294 Ill. 263, 269; McAllister v. Hamlin, 83 Cal. 361, 365;
State ex rel. Crouse v. Mills, 231 Mo. 493, 498-499; Ex
parteDavis, 21 Fed. 396, 397. The question is not affected
by the fact that the amendment was accomplished by
inserting the proviso in the body of the original section and
reenacting the whole at length. Truax v. Corrigan,supra;
People v. Butler Street Foundry, supra, pp. 258-259;
State ex rel. Crouse v. Mills, supra, p. 499.
4. It is true that appellant applied for and obtained a permit to do business under the statute to which it was sought
to attach the proviso in question. Is he, thereby, precluded
from assailing the proviso upon the ground that one who
claims the benefit of a statute may not assert its invalidity?
It is not open to question that one who has acquired rights
of property necessarily based upon a statute may not
attack that statute as unconstitutional, for he cannot both
assail it and rely upon it in the same proceeding. Hurley

278 U. S.

v. Commission of Fisheries, 257 U. S. 223, 225. But here
the proviso under attack, having been adopted by a subsequent act and being invalid, had no effect, as we have
already said, upon the provisions of the statute. As applied to this case, it began and ended as a futile attempt by
the legislature to bring about a change in the law which a
previous legislature had enacted. For this purpose, and
as construed and applied below, it was a nullity, wholly
"without force or vitality," leaving the provisions of the
existing statute unchanged. It necessarily results that
appellant's rights came into being and owed their continued existence wholly to that statute, disconnected from
the ineffective proviso, and it is that statute, so disconnected, which measures the extent to which he may enjoy
and defend such rights. In seeking and obtaining the
benefits of the statute, appellant proceeded without regard
to the proviso, neither affirming nor denying nor in contemplation of law acquiescing in its validity; and his action
cannot be made a basis upon which to rest a successful
claim of an estoppel in pais or of a waiver of the right to
maintain the constitutional challenge here made.
We conclude: That the proviso is unconstitutional as
contravening the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment; that the remainder of the statute is separable
and affords the sole rule in respect of the questions here to
be determined; that the corporation commission is without
power to issue permits to corporations organized under the
act of 1919 without a showing of public necessity; that the
Durant company is without authority to do business in.the
absence of a permit thus issued; and that appellant is
entitled to the relief for which he prays.
Decree reversed.

from the Corporation Commission a license to operate a
cotton gin in the City of Durant.* Later, the Durant
Co-operative Gin Company applied to the Commission
under that statute for a license to operate a gin in the
same city. In support of its application, it presented a
certificate of organization under Chapter 147 of the laws
of 1919 entitled "An Act providing for the organization
and regulation of cooperative corporations" (Oklahoma
Compiled Statutes 1921, Sees. 5637-5652), and a petition
signed by one hundred citizens and taxpayers of that
community requesting that the license be issued. Frost
objected to the granting of a license, on the ground that
there was no necessity for an additional gin in that city.
The Commission ruled that, upon the showing made, it
was obliged by § 3714 as so amended to issue a license,
without hearing evidence as to necessity; and indicated
its purpose to issue the license. Thereupon, Frost brought
this suit under § 266 of the Judicial Code against the
Commission, the Attorney General and the Durant Company to enjoin granting the license. A restraining order
issued upon the filing of the bill.
The case was first heard by three judges upon application for an interlocutory injunction and upon defendants'
motion to dismiss. Frost contended that his license had
conferred a franchise; that from it there arose 'in him the
property right to be protected against further local competition, unless existing ginning facilities were inadequate; that in the absence of a showing of necessity comThe stipulation of facts states: "That W. A. Frost is engaged in

petition by the Durant Company would be illegal; and
that to issue a license which authorized such competition
would take Frost's property without due process of law
and deny to him the equal protection of the law. The
District Court denied both the injunction and the motion
to dismiss; and it dissolved the restraining order. Upon
direct appeal by Frost, this Court affirmed the interlocutory decree per curiam in Frost v. Corporation Conmission, 274 U. S. 719, on the authority of Chicago Great
Western Ry. Co. v. Kendall, 266 U. S. 94, 100. Thereupon, the facts being stipulated, the case was submitted in
the District Court on final hearing to the same judges;
and a decree was entered dismissing the bill, 26 F. (2d)
508. This appeal presents the same questions which were
argued on the appeal from the interlocutory decree.
Under the Oklahoma Act of 1907 cotton gins were held
subject to regulation by the Corporation Commission.'
In 1915, the Legislature declared them public utilities
and restriction of competition was introduced by prohibiting operation of a gin without a license from the
Commission. That statute required that a license issue
for proper gins already established, but directed that
none should issue for a new gin in any community already
adequately supplied, except upon " the presentation of a
petition signed by not less than fifty farmer petitioners
of the immediate vicinity." Session Laws 1915, c. 176
(Oklahoma Compiled Statutes 1921, §§ 3712-3718).
Chapter 191 of the Session Laws of 1923 struck out of
§ 3714 the provision referring to farmers. But in 1925
there was inserted in lieu thereof the proviso "that on
the presentation of a petition for the establishment of a
gin to be run co-operatively, signed by one hundred (100)

citizens and taxpayers of the community where the gin
is to be located, the Corporation Commission shall issue
a license for said gin." Session-Laws 1925, c. 109. In
Choctaw
1926, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma held in.
Cotton Oil Co. v. Corporation Commission, 121 Okla. 51,
52, that a corporation organized under Chapter 147 of
the Laws of 1919 was run co-operatively within the meaning of § 3714 as so amended.
The attack upon the statute is rested mainly upon the
contention that by requiring issuance of a license to socalled co-operative corporations organized under the law
of 1919, the statute as amended in 1925 creates an arbitrary classification. The classification issaid to be arbitary, because the differences between such concerns and
commercial corporations or individuals engaged in the
same business are in this connection not material. The
contention rests, I think, upon misapprehensions of fact.
The differences are vital; and the classification is a reasonable one. Before stating why I think so, other grounds
for affirming the judgment should be mentioned.
First. The bill alleges, and the parties have stipulated,
that Frost was licensed under § 3714 of the Compiled
Statutes as amended by the Act of 1925. The stipulation
does not show that prior to the amendment he held any
license. His alleged property right to conditional immunity from competition rests wholly on the statute now
challenged. It is settled that one cannot in the same 'proceeding both rely upon a statute and assail it. Hurley v.
Commission of Fisheries, 257 U. S. 223, 225. Compare
Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Atty. General, 124 U. S.581, 598599; Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper Co., 244 U. S. 407,

Second. Frost claims that to grant a license to the Durant Company without a showing of public necessity
would involve taking his property without due process.
The only property which he asserts would be so taken is
the alleged right to be immune from the competition of
persons operating without a valid license. But for the
statute, he would obviously be subject to competition from
anyone. Whether the license issued to him under § 3714
conferred upon him the property right claimed is a question of statutory construction-and thus, ordinarily, a
question of state law. "Whether state statutes shall be
construed one way or another is a state question, the final
decision of which rests with the courts of the State."
Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U. S. 312, 316. In the absence
of a decision of the question by the highest court of the
State, this Court would be obliged to construe the statute;
and in doing so it might be aided by consideration of the
decisions of courts of other States dealing with like statutes. But the Supreme Court of Oklahoma has decided
the precise question in Choctaw Cotton Oil Co. v. Corporation Commission, 121 Okla. 51, 52. It held that a
license under § 3714 does not confer the property right
claimed, saying: "What property rights are taken from
petitioners by licensing another gin, under the foregoing
proviso? What rights of any kind could the licensing of
another gin affect? It does not disturb the property of
petitioners, nor prevent the free operation of their gins.
The only right which could be affected by such license is
the right of petitioners to operate their gin without competition, a right which is not secured to them either by the
state or federal Constitution, hence the contention as to
taking their property without due process of law cannot be
sustained." As no property right of Frost is invaded-his
suit must fail, however objectionable the statute may be.
Third. Frost claims that to issue a license to the Durant Company without a showing of necessity would

FROST v. CORPORATION COMMISSION.
515

533

BRANDEIS, J., dissenting.

violate the equality clause. Whether the license was
issued to Frost upon a showing of necessity does not appear. The mere granting of a license to the Durant Company later on different, and perhaps. easier, terms would
not violate Frost's constitutional right to equality, since
he has already secured his license under the statute as
written. The fact that someone else similarly situated
may hereafter be refused a license, and would be thereby
discriminated against, is obviously not of legal significance
here. Southern Railway Co. v. King, 217 U. S. 524;
Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, 225 U. S. 540; Jeffrey
Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, 235 U. S. 571; Arkadelphia Co. v. St.
Louis S. W. Ry Co., 249 U. S. 134, 149; Liberty Warehouse
Co. v. Tobacco Growers, 276 U. S. 71.
Fourth. Frost claims on another ground that his constitutional rights have been violated. He says that what
the statute and the Supreme Court of Oklahoma call a
license is in law a franchise; that a franchise is a contract;
that where a constitutional question is raised this Court
must determine for itself what the terms of a contract
are; and that this franchise should be construed as conferring the right to the conditional immunity from competition which he claims. None of the cases cited lend
support to the contention that the license here issued is
a franchise.! They hold merely that subordinate political

U. S. 1, 40-41, merely describes the types of enterprises which may
be made the subject of a franchise. The enterprises mentioned are
all of the type which require the use of public property so that the
permission of the State is required to condone what would otherwise
be a trespass. Further, it is not maintained that the State is restricted to the issuance of franchises for the carrying on of such
callings.

278 U. S.

bodies, as well as a legislature, may grant franchises; and
that violations of franchise rights are remediable, whoever
the transgressor. Moreover, the limited immunity from
competition claimed as an incident of the license was
obviously terminable at any moment. Compare Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, 242 U. S. 409. It was
within the power of the legislature, at any time after the
granting of Frost's license, to abrogate the requirement of
a certificate of necessity, thus opening the business to the
competition of all comers. It is difficult to see how the
lesser enlargement of the possibilities of competition by
a license granted under the 1925 proviso could operate as a
denial of constitutional rights.
It must also be borne in mind that a franchise to
operate a public utility is not like the general right to
engage in a lawful business, part of the liberty of the
citizen; that it is a special privilege which does not belong
to citizens generally; that the State may, in the exercise
of its police power, make that a franchise or special
privilege which at common law was a business open to
all;' that a special privilege is conferred by the State
upon selected persons; that it is of the essence of a special
privilege that the franchise may be granted or withheld
at the pleasure of the State; that it may be granted to
corporations only, thus excluding all individuals; 4 and
that the Federal Constitution imposes no limits upon the
State's discretion in this respect.5 In New Orleans Gas

claiming an exclusive franchise, sought to enjoin the competition of the defendant. The Court said (p. 659),
"'The right to operate gas-works, and to illuminate a
city, is not an ancient or usual occupation of citizens
generally. No one has the right to . . . carry on the
business of lighting the streets . . without special
authority from the sovereign. It is a franchise belonging
to the State, and, in the exercise of the police power, the
State could carry on the business itself or select one or
several agents to do so.' " The demurrer to the bill was
dismissed. In New Orleans Water-Works Co. v. Rivers,
115 U. S. 674, on similar facts in deciding for the plaintiff,
the Court said (p. 682), " The restriction, imposed by the
contract upon the use by others than plaintiff of the
public streets and ways, for such purposes, is not one of
which the appellee can complain. He was not thereby
restrained of any freedom or liberty he had before . . ."
One who would strike down a statute must show not only
that he is affected by it, but that as applied to him, the
statute exceeds the power of the State. This rule, acted
upon as early as Austin v. The Aldermen, 7 Wall. 694, and
definitely stated in Supervisors v. Stanley, 105 U. S. 305,
314, has been c6 nsistently followed since that time.
Fifth. Frost's claim that the Act of 1925 discriminates
unjustifiably is not sound. The claim rests wholly on the
fact that individuals and ordinary corporations must show
inadequacy of existing facilities, while co-operatives
organized under the Act of 1919 may secure a license
without making such a showing, if the application is
supported by a petition of one hundred persons who are
citizens and taxpayers in the community. It is settled
that to provide specifically for peculiar needs of farmers
or producers is a reasonable basis of classification, American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, 179 U. S. 89; Liberty
Warehouse Co. v. Tobacco Growers, 276 U. S. 71. And it
is conceded that the classification made by the Act of

OCTOBER TERM, 1928
BRANDEIS,

J., dissenting.

278 U. S.

1925 would be reasonable if it had been limited to co-operatives organized under Chapter 22 of the Laws of 1917.
Thus the contention that the classification is arbitrary is
directed only to co-operatives organized under the law of
1919. It rests upon two erroneous assumptions: (1) That
co-operatives organized under the law of 1919 are substantially unlike those organized under Chapter 22 of the
Laws of 1917; and (2) that there are between co-operative
corporations under the law of 1919 and commercial corporations no substantial differences having reasonable
relation to the subject dealt with by the gin legislation.
The assertion is that co-operatives organized under the
law of 1919, being stock companies, do business with the
gefheral public for the sole purpose of making money, as
do individual or other corporate competitors; whereas cooperatives organized under the law of 1917 are " for
mutual help, without capital stock, not conducted for
profit, and restricted to the business of their own members." The fact is that these two types of co-operative
corporations-the stock and the nonstock-differ from
one another only in a few details, which are without significance in this connection; that both are instrumentalities commonly employed to promote and effect co-operation among farmers; that the two serve the same purpose;
and that both differ vitally from commercial corporations.
The farmers seek through both to secure a more efficient
system of production and distribution and a more equitable allocation of benefits. But this is not their only purpose. Besides promoting the financial advantage of the
participating farmers, they seek through co-operation to
socialize their interests-to require an equitable assumption of responsibilities while assuring an equitable distribution of benefits. Their aim is economic democracy on
lines of liberty, equality and fraternity. To accomplish
these objectives, both types of co-operative corporations
provide for excluding capitalist control. As means to this

FROST v. CORPORATION COMMISSION.
515

BRANDEIS,

537

J., dissenting

end, both provide for restriction of voting privileges, for
curtailment of return on capital and for distribution of
gains or savings through patronage dividends or equivalent
devices.
In order to ensure economic democracy, the Oklahoma
Act of 1919 prevents any person from becoming a shareholder without the consent of the board of directors. It
limits the amount of stock which one person may hold to
$500. And it limits the voting power of a shareholder to
one vote. Thus, in the Durant Company, the holder of a
single share of the par value of $10 has as much voting
power as the holder of 50 shares. The Act further discourages entrance of mere capitalists into the co-operative
by provisions which permit five per cent of the profits
to be set aside for educational purposes; which require
ten per cent of the profits to be set aside as a reserve
fund, until such-fund shall equal at least fifty per cent of
the capital stock; which limit the annual dividends on
stock to eight per cent; and which require that the rest
of the year'9 profits be distributed as patronage dividends
to members, except so far as the directors may apportion
them to non-members.
The provisions for the exclusion of capitalist control of
the nonstock type of co-operative organized under the
Oklahoma Act of 1917 do not differ materially in character from those in the 1919 Act. The nonstock co-operative also may reject applicants for membership; and no
member may have more than one vote. This type of
co-operative is called a non-profit organization; but the
term is merely one of art, indicating the manner in which
the financial advantage is distributed. This type also is
organized and conducted for the financial benefit of its
members and requires capital with which to condtict its
business. In the stock type the capital is obtained by the
issue of capital stock, and members are not subjected to
personal liability for the corporation's business obliga-

538

J., dissenting.

278 U. S.

tions. In the nonstock type the capital is obtained. partly
from membership fees, partly through dues or assessments
and partly through loans from members or others. And
for fixed capital it substitutes in part personal liability of
members for the corporation's obligations.' In the stock
type there are eo nomine dividends on capital and patronage dividends. In the nonstock type the financial benefit
is distributed by way of interest on loans and refunds
of fees, dues and assessments. And all funds acquired
through the co-operative's operations, which are in excess
of the amount desirable for a "working fund," are to be
distributed as refunds of fees, dues and assesments. Both
acts allow business to be done for non-members; and
though the nonstock association may, it is not required,
to impose obligations on the non-member for the liability of the association. Thus, for the purposes here
relevant, there is no essential difference between the two
types of co-operatives.
The Oklahoma law of 1919 follows closely in its provisions the legislation enacted earlier in other States with a
view to furthering farmers' co-operation. The first emergence of any settled policy as to the means to be employed
for effecting co-operation among farmers in the United
States came in 1875 when, at the annual convention of
the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry, recommendations were formally adopted endorsing "Rochdale
principles"; and a form of rules for the guidance of prospective organizers was promulgated. These provided for
stock companies with shares of $5 each; that no member
be allowed to hold more than 100 shares; that ownership
6 Section 10 makes each member assume "original
liability, for
his per capita share of all contracts, debts, and engagements of the
association existing at the time he becomes a member and created
during his membership "; and "additional liability" for his pro rata
share of the liability of any other member, whose liability may become
uncollectible.

of a single share shall constitute the holder a member of
the association; that only 8 per cent "interest" shall be
paid on the capital; that the balance of the profits shall
go "either to increase the capital or business of the association, or for any educational or provident purposes authorized by the asociation," or be distributed as patronage dividends; and that the patronage dividends be distributed among customers, except that non-members
should receive only one-half the proportion of members.7
The need of laws framed specifically for incorporating
farmers' co-operatives being recognized, Massachusetts
enacted in 1866 the necessary legislation by a general law
which differed materially from that under which commercial organizations were formed. The statute provided for
co-operatives having capital stock.'
Before 1900, ten
other States had enacted laws of like character.' After

The type was called Rochdale because
it was this type of organization which the pioneers of the present
co-operation among English speaking peoples used there. This law
which served as a pattern for most of the co-operative incorporation
laws passed by other States prior to 1900 contained fewer of the
safeguards to assure preservation of co-operative principles than does
the Oklahoma Act of 1919. No limitation was placed on the quantum of stock per member or on the voting privileges; and no restriction was placed on the amount of dividends to be paid on stock, the
distribution of profits being left entirely to the by-laws and to the
directors, save for the requirement that a portion of the earnings go
into a reserve fund.

1900 many such statutes were passed. Now, only two
States lack laws making specific provision for the incorporation of farmers' co-operatives. ° Thirty-three States,
at least, have enacted laws providing for the formation of
co-operative associations of the stock type. All of them
permit a fixed dividend on capital stock, the doing of business for non-members, and the distribution of patronage
dividends." Some of them, recognizing the need for elasticity, impose the single requirement that earnings be apportioned in part on a patronage basis, and leave all. other
provisions for organization and distribution of profits to

in number."' The earliest law of this character was the
crude measure enacted in California in 1895."4 Statutes
of that type have been passed in about sixteen States; '"
but ten of these have also laws of the stock type.' The
enactment of state laws for the incorporation of nonstock
co-operatives and their extensive use in the co-operative
marketing of commodities, are due largely to the fact that,
prior to 1922, the Clayton Act, October 15, 1914, c. 323,

for all types of co-operative endeavor is evidenced by the fact that
prior to the passage of the Clayton Act (which offered substantial
advantages to non-stock corporations) several of California's largest
cooperatives did not incorporate under this or the similar act of 1.909
(chap. 26), but were organized on a capital stock basis, e. g., California Fruit Growers' Exchange, California raisin growers'. See

nut or fruit growers may act together in associations, corporate or otherwise, with or without capital stock, in collectively processing, preparing for market, handling and
marketing in interstate and foreign commerce, such products of persons so engaged. Such associations may have

Congress recognized the identity of the two classes of
co-operatives, and the distinction between agricultural
stock co-operative corporations and ordinary business corporations, also, by providing in the Revenue Act of 1926,
c. 27, Part III, § 231 (44 Stat. 9), that exemption from the
income tax was not to be denied "any such [co-operative]
association because it has capital stock, if the dividend
rate of such stock is fixed at not to exceed the legal rate
of interest in the State of incorporation or 8 per centum
per annum, whichever is greater, . . . , and if substantially all such stock is owned by producers . . . ; nor
shall exemption be denied any such association because
there is accumulated and maintained by it a reserve . . .
Such an association may market the products of nonmembers in an amount the value of which does not exceed
the value of the products marketed for members." This
exemption was continued in the Revenue Act of 1928,
c. 852, sec. 103 (45 Stat. 812).
More than two-thirds of all farmers' co-operatives in
the United States are organized under the stock type laws.
In 1925 there were 10,147 reporting organizations. Of
these 68.7 per cent were stock associations. In leading
States the percentage was larger. In Wisconsin the percentage was 80.0; in North Dakota, 87.0; in Nebraska,
91.3; and in Kansas, 92.0. Of the farmers' co-operatives
existing in Oklahoma in 1925, 87.6 per cent were stock
associations.1 9 The great co-operative systems of Eng19U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Technical Bulletin No. 40 (1928),

land, Scotland and Canada were developed and are now
operated by organization of the stock type.2" The nonstock type of co-operative is not adapted to enterprises,
which like gins require large investment in plant, and
hence considerable fixed capital." For this reason it was
a common practice for marketing co-operatives, which had
been organized as nonstock co-operatives in order to comply with the requirements of the Clayton Act above described, to form a subsidiary co-operative corporation with
capital stock to carry on the incidental business of warehousing or processing which requires a large investment
in plant.22 And the fact that even the marketing of some
products may be better served by the stock type of cooperative organizations is so widely recognized that most
of the marketing acts provide that associations formed
thereunder may organize either with or without capital
stock."

Experience has demonstrated, also, that doing business
for non-members is usually deemed essential to the success
of a co-operative. 4 More than five-sixths of all the farmers' co-operative associations in the United States do
business for non-members. In 1925, 86.3 per cent of the
reporting oganizations did so. In leading States the percentage was even larger. In Wisconsin the percentage
was 89.0; in Missouri 93.2; in Minnesota 94.1; in Nebraska 95.8; in Kansas 96.5; in North Dakota 97.0. In
Oklahoma 92 per cent of all co-operatives did business for
non-members.2" Of the cotton co-operatives in the United
States 93.9 per cent did business for non-members. In
Texas, where co-operative ginning has received successful
trial, 6 all the cotton co-operatives perform service for nonnessee, Laws 1923, c. 100, § 3; Texas, Laws 1921, c. 22, § 3; Utah,

24 It
is to be noted that statutes like the Bingham Cooperative
Marketing Act (Acts of Kentucky, 1922, c. 1) which provide solely
for the formation of marketing associations restrict the service of the
association (with the exception of storage) to the products of members. But such statutes do not purport to repeal earlier laws authorizing agricultural cooperation for other purposes which allow business
for non-members. That the legislatures recognize that the problems
of cooperative marketing and of other types of agricultural cooperation require different treatment is demonstrated by the retention of
general laws providing for agricultural cooperation after passage of
the standard marketing act. In Oklahoma, for example, in the same
year that the Act of 1917 was amended so as to embody some of the
features of the Bingham Act, the 1919 Act was amended in unimportant particulars, thus receiving express legislative recognition of its
continued usefulness. Laws of Oklahoma, 1923, c. 167, 181.

members. In Oklahoma, also, all of the cotton co-operatives reporting do busines for non-members.27
That no one plan of organization is to be labeled as
truly co-operative to the exclusion of others was recognized by Congress in connection with co-operative banks
and building and loan associations. See United States v.
Cambridge Loan & Building Company, 278 U. S. 55.
With the expansion of agricultural co-operation it has been
recognized repeatedly. Congress gave its sanction to the
stock type of co-operative by the Capper-Volstead Act
and also by specifically exempting stock as well as nonstock
co-operatives from income taxes. State legislatures recognized the fundamental similarity of the two types of cooperation by unifying their laws so as to have a single
statute under which either type of co-operative might
organize.2" And experts in the Department of Agriculture, charged with disseminating information to farmers
and legislatures, have warned against any crystallization
of the co-operative plan so as to exclude any type of cooperation.2"

21 See e. g., Maryland, Laws 1922, c. 197; New York, Laws 1926,
c. 231; Oregon, Supp. 1927, §§ 6954-976. The New York Law is
known as the Co-operatives Corporations Law, and consolidates all
prior acts for the formation of co-operative associations. Thus, marketing co-operatives, with or without capital stock, and other agricultural co-operatives, with or without capital stock, and with or without
restrictions as to business for non-members, are all organized under
the same act.

Division of Co-operative Marketing, in Department Circular No. 403

usefulness of this form of business organization." And at page 3,

That in Oklahoma a law authorizing incorporation on
the stock plan was essential to the development of co-opcration among farmers has been demonstrated by the
history of the movement in that State. Prior to 1917
there was no statute which specifically authorized the
incorporation of co-operatives. In that year the nonstock
law above referred to was enacted."
Two years passed
and only three co-operatives availed themselves of the
provisions of that Act. Then persons familiar with the
farmers' problems in Oklahoma secured the passage of
the law of 1919, providing for the incorporation of co-operatives with capital stock." Within the next five years
tions that make certain types necessary or valuable are taken into
consideration. Attempts to build co-operative associations according
to any special plan have met with failure in the past, and it is possible that in the future we shall see more rather than fewer types of
co-operative organizations."
30 That the draftsmen of this law were influenced by the restrictions of the Clayton Act is evidenced by the fact that some of the
language of § 2 of the 1917 Act is taken verbatim from § 6 of the
Clayton Act.
31The Oklahoma State Market Commission, Carl Williams, editor
of the Oklahoma Farmer-Stockman, and various farm organizations
lent their assistance to the legislature in drafting this law. See Second Biennial Report of Oklahoma State Market Commission (19191920), p. 5; Carl Williams, Letter to Division of Co-operative Marketing, Department of Agriculture, dated January 21, 1929. The
Oklahoma State Market Commission says of the 1919 Act (Marketing Bulletin, April 20, 1920, p. 5), "In organizing these new corporations, the farmers had a real basis on which to organize .. . The
law was written by men who understood the farmers condition and
had some practical knowledge of real cooperative marketing on a
business basis. The laws of Minnesota, Nebraska and other states
were studied. Conditions under which cooperative associations had
failed in the northern states and those which had succeeded were
taken into careful consideration. The best points from the laws of
the several states, which would be suitable for Oklahoma conditions
were incorporated and the features of these laws which were not
suitable were eliminated,"

202 co-operatives were formed under it; and since then
139 more. In the twelve years since 1917 only 60 nonstock co-operatives have been organized; most of them
since 1923, when. through an amendatory statute, this
type was made to offer special advantages for co-operative marketing.82 Thus over 82 per cent of all co-operatives in Oklahoma are organized under the 1919 stock act.
One hundred and one Oklahoma co-operative cotton gins
have been organized under the 1919 stock law; not a
single one under the 1917 nonstock law.8" To deny the
co-operative character of the 1919 Act is to deny the
co-operative character not only of the gins in Oklahoma
which farmers have organized and operated for their
mutual benefit, but also that of most other co-operatives
within the State, which have been organized under its
statutes in harmony with legislation of Congress and
pursuant to instructions from the United States Department of Agriculture. A denial of co-operative character
to the stock co-operatives is inconsistent also with the
history of the movement in other States and countries.
For the stock type of co-operative is not only the older
form, but is the type more widely used among English
speaking peoples.
There remains to be considered other circumstances
leading to the passage of the statute here challenged. As
was said in Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220
U. S. 61, 78, "When the classification in such a law is
called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be
conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state
of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed."
Here that presumption is reinforced by facts which have
been called to our attention. That evils exist in cotton
ginning which are subject to drastic legislative regulation

has recently been recognized by this Court. Crescent Oil
Co. v. Mississippi, 257 U. S. 129. The specific evils existing in Oklahoma which the statute here assailed was
enacted to correct was the charging of extortionate prices
to the farmer for inferior ginning service and the control
secured of the cotton seed." These conditions are partly
attributable to the fact that a large percentage of the
ordinary commercial gins in Oklahoma are controlled by
cotton seed oil mills; which make their service as ginners
incidental to that as crushers of seed; and are thereby
enabled to secure the seed at less than its value." That
34 Two of the leading farm newspapers in Oklahoma are the Oklahoma Cotton Grower and the Oklahoma Farmer-Stockman, the latter
edited by Carl Williams. In an editorial on February 1.0, 1926, the
Cotton Grower urges farmers to form co-operative gins as the only
way to obtain economy in ginning service. On March 1, 1927, the
Farmer-Stockman contains an editorial urging, as a partial solution
of the ginning problem, the placing of members on the Corporation
Commission who are interested in the farmer as well as in the commercial gin. On May 15, 1927, the same paper notes the great increase in co-operative ginning in the State, and says that it is due to
the extortionate prices charged by private ginners. On August 15,
1927, the Farmer-Stockman speaks of the meeting of the Corporation
Commission to fix rates for ginning as the "annual farce." It is
stated that the meeting is called a farce because the rate is always
set high enough so as to allow grossly excessive returns to the ginners
at the expense of the'farmers. The editor states that the only solution for the farmer is co-operation in ginning. On September 15,
1927, the same paper states that some privately owned gins have
averaged a profit of over 100 per cent on invested capital over a
period of three years. On October 15, 1927, the Farmer-Stockman
notes that poor ginning 'can cost the farmer at least four cents on each
pound of cotton.
85 The District Court said (26 F. (2d) 508, 519-520): "The ordinary commercial ginner within the State of Oklahoma may gin either
as an individual, a copartnership, or a corporation; no statute, rule,
or provision of law restricts him in any wise in the enjoyment of the
full proceeds of the earnings under the rate fixed. He usually is
engaged, not only in ginning cotton, but also in the purchase of seed

such control of gins may lead to excessive prices for the
ginning service was recognized in the Crescent Oil case.
The fact that, despite the regulatory provisions of the
Public Service law, a public utility is permitted to earn
huge profits indicates that something more than rate
regulation may be needed for the protection of farmers.
Certainly, it cannot be said that the legislature could not
reasonably believe that co-operative ginning might afford
a corrective for rates believed to be extortionate.

Dissenting opinion of Mr.

JUSTICE STONE.

I agree with what Mr. JusTIcE BRANDEIS has said.
But there is one aspect of the decision now rendered to
which I would especially direct attention. To me it
would seem that there are such differences in organization,
management, financial structure and practical operation
between the business conducted by appellant, a single
individual, and that conducted by a corporation organcotton, cotton seed after he has ginned the cotton, and frequently in
the purchase of the cotton after it is ginned for profit. A ginner has
a greater facility to purchase the seed than anyone else. As he gins
the cotton, he catches the seed as they fall from the stand, and has
the immediate means for storage and housing same. The patron, if
he does not elect to sell to the ginner, must receive them and haul
them away, when as a rule he has no place for storage for accumulating as much as a carload, so as to sell them to advantage. A great
per cent. of the gins so operated are owned and controlled by cotton
seed crushers, operating cotton seed oil mills within the state of Oklahoma; such operation of gins not being entirely for the purpose of
rendering a public service, but also for collecting cotton seed at 9
central point. Their gin business as ginners is incidental to that as
crushers of seed, to the end that they may be enabled to purchase
the seed under favorable conditions. See Choctaw Cotton Oil Co. v.
Corporation Commission, 121 Ol. 51, 247 P. 390; Planters' Cotton

ized as is appellee, as to justify the classification and discrimination made by the statute. But, assuming there
were no such differences, I fail to perceive any constitutional ground on which appellant can complain of a discrimination from which he has not suffered. His real and
only complaint is not that he has been discriminated
against either in the grant or enjoyment of his license,
but that in the exercise of his hon-exclusive privilege of
carrying on the cotton ginning business he will suffer
from competition by the corporate appellee which, under
.local law, may secure a like privilege with possibly less
difficulty than did appellant.
The proviso of the 1925 Act is held unconstitutional
solely on the ground that "an onerous restriction upon the
right to engage in a public business" was ".imposed by
the statute upon appellant" and others similarly situated,
which was not imposed on appellee. Appellant, if he
had been denied a license, or if his exercise of the privilege, when granted, were more limited by the statute than
that of appellee, might invoke the equal protection clause.
But he now requires no such protection for he has received
his license and is in full and unrestricted enjoyment of the
same privilege as that which the appellee seeks. This is
not less the case even if the statute be assumed to have
made it more difficult for him than for appellee to secure
a license.
Whether the grant appellant has received be called a
franchise or a license would seem to be unimportant, for
in any case it is not an exclusive privilege. Under the
Constitution and laws of Oklahoma the legislature has
power to amend or repeal the franchise, Constitution of
Oklahoma, Art. IX, § 47; Choctaw Cotton Oil Co. v.
Corporation Comm., 121 Okla. 51, and injury suffered
through an indefinite increase in the number of appellant's competitors by non-discriminatory legislation,
would clearly be damnum absque injuria. A similar in-

crease under the present alleged discriminatory statute
would seem likewise to afford appellant no legal cause for
complaint, for, a license not having been withheld from
him, his position is precisely the same as though the
statute authorized the grant of a license to him and to
appellee on equal terms. He is suffering, not from any
application of the discriminatory feature of the statute,
with which alone the Constitution is concerned, see Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, 235 U. S. 571, 576; Arkadelphia
Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., 249 U. S. 134,
149, but merely from the increase in the number of his
competitors, an injury which would similarly have resulted
from a non-discriminatory statute granting the privilege
to all on terms more lenient than those formerly accorded
appellant. Of such a statute, appellant could not complain and I can find no more basis for saying that constitutional rights are impaired where the discrimination
which the statute authorizes has no effect, than where the
statute itself does not discriminate.
Nor would appellant seem to be placed in any better
position to challenge the constitutionality of the statute
by recourse to the rule that the possessor of a nonexclusive franchise may enjoin competition unauthorized
by the state. Appellee's business is not unauthorized. It
is carried on under the sanction of a statute to which
appellant himself can offer no constitutional objection,
for even unconstitutional statutes may not be treated as
though they had never been written. They are not void
for all purposes and as to all persons. See Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U. S. 152, 160. For appellant to say that appellee's permit is void, and that its business may be
enjoined, because conceivably someone else may challenge
the constitutionality of the Act, would seem to be a departure from the salutary rule consistently applied that
only those who suffer from the unconstitutional application of a statute may challenge its validity. See

It seems to me that a fallacy, productive of unfortunate
consequences, lurks in the suggestion that one may maintain a suit to enjoin competition of a business solely
because hereafter someone else might suffer from an unconstitutional discrimination and enjoin it. But, more
than that, even if the license had been withheld from
appellant because he could not support the burden placed
upon him by the statute, I should have thought it doubtful whether he would have been entitled to have had
appellee's permit cancelled-the relief now granted. He
certainly could not have asked more than the very privilege which he now enjoys.
