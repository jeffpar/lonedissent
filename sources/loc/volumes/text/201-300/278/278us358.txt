for the agent's act in issuing the bill, even though the merchandise was not received. But respondent's liability
here is not predicated on the agent's authority to issue
bills which, so far as appears, he did not have, but upon
his authority to notify petitioner of the arrival or nonarrival of the merchandise which he clearly did have.
Congress, by enlarging, in a bills of lading act, the implied
authority of an agent to issue bills of lading, can hardly
be said to have dealt by implication with a general rule
of liability applicable in other classes of transactions not
involving bills of lading.

1. An order commanding a bankrupt to turn over to his trustee in
bankruptcy books or property which he is charged with wilfully
withholding but which he denies are within his possession or control, should be made only on clear and convincing evidence, exceeding a mere preponderance. P. 362.
2. In a civil proceeding to commit a bankrupt for contempt until he
shall deliver books or property to his trustee in bankruptcy as commanded by a turn-over order, the order cannot be attacked collaterally by evidence that the books or papers were not in the bankrupt's possession or control at the time when it was made. P. 363.

or property to a trustee, the court should make a new and
independent investigation and should consider all material
evidence relating to what preceded, as well as what followed, the referee's report, and from such investigation and
evidence determine whether or not the bankrupt's disobedience is wilful and contumacious, and whether or not the
bankrupt has the present ability to comply. In re Davison, 143 Fed. 673; In re Goodrich, 183 Fed. 106; In re

beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Levy & Co., 142 Fed.

Opinion of the Court.

Prela, made by the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, and affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. They were
heard together.
In the Oriel case, the order, the breach of which led
to the commitment, was against Oriel and Confino, directing them to turn over to their trustee in bankruptcy their
books for the year 1925. The turnover order was made
upon the report of the Referee, October 22, 1926. The
books directed to be turned over were a ledger, a purchase
book and journal, a cash book and a time book. The
petition was filed in August, 1926, the order to turn over
granted October 22, 1926, and the order of commitment
appealed from was entered March 8, 1927. The excuse
offered by the bankrupts for noncompliance was that the
books were not in their possession and had not been since
they moved from one store to another in January, 1926,
before the bankruptcy. It appeared that the only books
which were missing were the books of 1925. These were
necessary to sustain the entries in the books in 1926,
showing the basis for the figures for the books of that
critical year. The Court discredited the excuse of inability to comply. There was conflicting evidence, but
after an extended hearing, the Referee found that the
books of account were with the bankrupts or under their
control.- No appeal was taken from the turnover order,
and after a failure to comply therewith, a motion followed
for an order of contempt which committed them to jail,
there to be confined and detained until they purged themselves. On the motion to commit, the bankrupts at-.
tempted to introduce evidence on the issue whether at the
time of the turnover order they had the books in their
possession or under their control. The Referee and the
District Court refused to retry that issue on the ground
that the turnover order could not be collaterally attacked.

the custody of the books after the turnover order. The
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the action of the District Court. 23 F. (2d) 409.
In the Prela case, the bankrupt was directed to turn
over to his trustees merchandise and money amounting
in all to about $10,000. An appeal from the turnover
order was denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Failure to comply resulted in a contempt order similar to that
in the Oriel case. 23 F. (2d) 413. It was attempted
to introduce in the Prela case, as it had been in the Oriel
case, evidence to show that the original turnover order
was wrong and witnesses were called who had been
available at the original hearing but had not then been
subpoenaed.
The cases are brought here on the ground of error in
the District Court in holding that the turnover order
could not be collaterally attacked and that the only evidence which was relevant on the motion to commit for
contempt was evidence tending to show that since the
turnover order, circumstances had happened disclosing
the inability of the bankrupts to comply with the order.
It was urged that a finding of contempt required a greater
weight of evidence than a turnover order, and hence that
the former could not be predicated upon the latter without a reexamination of all the evidence. These rulings
present the question before us.
We think a proceeding for a turnover order in bankruptcy is one the right to which should be supported by
clear and convincing evidence. The charge upon which
the order is asked is that the bankrupt, having possession
of property which be knows should have been delivered by
him to the trustees, refuses to comply with his obligation
in this regard. It is a charge equivalent to one of fraud,
and must be established by the same kind of evidence
required in a case of fraud in a court of equity. A mere
preponderance of evidence in such a case is not enough.

ORIEL v. RUSSELL.
358

Opinion of the Court

The proceeding is one in which coercive methods by imprisonment are probable and are foreshadowed. The
Referee and the Court in passing on the issue under such
a turnover motion should therefore require clear evidence
of the justice of such an order before it is made. Being
made, it should be given weight in the future proceedings
as one that may not be collaterally attacked by an effort
to try over the issue already heard and decided at the
turnover. Thereafter on the motion for commitment the
only evidence that can be considered is the evidence of
something that has happened since the turnover order
was made showing that since that time there has newly
arisen an inability on the part of the bankrupt to comply
with the turnover order.
The proceedings in these two cases have been so long
drawn out by efforts on the part of the bankrupts to retry
the issue presented on the motion to turn over as to be,
of themselves, convincing argument that if the bankruptcy statute is not to be frittered away in constant
delays and failures of enforcement of lawful orders, the
rule we have laid down is the proper one.
The decision of the Court in the case of Gompers v.
Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 442, and the
discussion of Mr. Justice Lamar in that case, leave no
doubt that a motion to commit the bankrupt for failure
to obey an order of the Court to turn over to the receiver
in bankruptcy the property of the bankrupt is a civil contempt and is to be treated as a mere step in the proceedings to administer the assets of the bankrupt as provided
by law, and in aid of the seizure of those assets and their
proper distribution. While in a sense they are punitive,
they are not mere punishment-they are administrative
but coercive, and intended to compel, against the reluctance of the bankrupt, performance by him of his lawful
duty.

364

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

With reference to the character or degree of proof in.
establishing a civil fraud, the authorities are quite clear
that it need not be beyond reasonable doubt, because it
is a civil proceeding. Lalone v. United States, 164 U. S.
255, 257; United States v. American Bell Telephone Co.,
167 U. S. 224, 241; 5 Wigmore, Evidence (2d ed. 1923),
§ 2498, 2, 3, and the cases cited. The court ought not to
issue an order lightly or merely on a preponderance of the
evidence, but only after full deliberation and satisfactory
evidence, with the understanding that it is rendering a
judgment which is only to be set aside on appeal or some
other form of review, or upon a properly supported petition for rehearing in the same court.
A turnover order must be regarded as a real and serious
step in the bankruptcy proceedings and should be
promptly followed by commitment unless the bankrupt
can show a change of situation after the turnover order
relieving him from compliance. There is a possibility,
of course, of error and hardship, but the conscience of
judges in weighing the evidence under a clear perception
of the consequences, together with the opportunity of
appeal and review, if properly taken, will restrain the
courts from recklessness of bankrupt's rights on the one
hand and prevent the bankrupt from flouting the law on
the other. The cases on this subject are legion, with
varying views, but the following seem to us to lay down
more nearly the correct view. Toplitz v. Walser, 27 F.
(2d) 196; Epstein v. Steinfeld, 210 Fed. 236; Schmid v.
Rosenthal, 230 Fed. 818; Frederickv. Silverman, 250 Fed.
75; Reardon v. Pensoneau, 18 F. (2d) 244; United States
ex rel. Paleais v. Moore, 294 Fed. 852; In re Frankel, 184
Fed. 539; Drakeford v. Adams, 98 Ga. 772; Collier, Bankruptcy, 652 (Gilbert's ed. 1927).
There are contempt cases where under a decree for
alimony, it is necessary to resort to coercive measures to
secure compliance, and the issue of fact arises as to the

ability of the contemnor to pay what is owing. The rules
of evidence are much the same as here laid down for
bankruptcy. Smiley v. Smiley, 99 Wash. 577; Barton v.
Barton, 99 Kan. 727; Ex parte Von Gerzabek, 58 Cal.
App. 230; Hurd v. Hurd, 63 Minn. 443; Heflebower v.
Heflebower, 102 Ohio St. 674; Fowler v. Fowler, 61 Okla.
280.
The conclusive effect in a proceeding of this sort of an
order of "turnover" finds its analogy in the inquiry in
contempt proceedings for violating an injunction issued
by a court of general jurisdiction. Howat v. Kansas, 258
U. S. 181; Huttig Sash Co. v. Fuelle, 143 Fed. 363;
People v. Van Buren, 136 N. Y. 252; Hamlin v. New
York, N. H. & H. R. R., 170 Mass. 548; Ketchum v.
Edwards, 153 N. Y. 534, 538; Cape May Railroadv. Johnson, 35 N. J. Eq. 422; Saginaw Lumber Co. v. Griffore,
145 Mich. 287; Cline v. Whitaker, 144 Wis. 439; Hoskins
v. Somerset Coal Co., 219 Pa. 373; Hake v. People, 230 Ill.
274; Hilton v. Hilton, 89 N. J. Eq. 472; Root v. MacDonald, 260 Mass. 344.
A number of cases can be found in the decisions of the
Circuit Courts of Appeal and the District Courts indicating
a hesitation and great reluctance to issue orders of commitment where there is any reasonable doubt of the
ability of the bankrupt to comply with the turnover order.
Kirsner v. Taliaferro, 202 Fed. 51; Stuart v. Reynolds,
204 Fed. 709; In re*Haring, 193 Fed. 168. We think it
would be going too far to adopt the severer rule of criminal cases and would render the bankruptcy system less
effective. We find ourselves in general accord on this
subject with the remarks of the late Circuit Judge McPherson, of the Third Circuit, who used the following
language in the case of Epstein v. Steinfeld, 206 Fed. 568
[p. 569]:
"In the case in hand, the consequence is that, as the
order to pay or deliver stands without sufficient reply, it

remains what it has been from the first-an order presumed to be right, and therefore an order that ought to be
enforced. In the pending case, or in any other, the court
may believe the bankrupt's assertion that he is not now in
possession or control of the money or the goods, and in
that event the civil inquiry is at an end; but it is also
true that the assertion may not be believed, and the bankrupt may therefore be subjected to the usual pressure that
follows willful disobedience of a lawful command, namely,
the inconvenience of being restrained of his liberty. No
doubt this may be unpleasant; it is intended to be unpleasant, but I see no reason why the proceeding should
be condemned, as if it interfered with the liberty of the
citizen without sufficient reason or excuse. I have known
a brief confinement to produce the money promptly, thus
justifying the court's incredulity, and I have also known it
to fail. Where it has failed, and where a reasonable interval
of time has supplied the previous defect in the evidence,
and has made sufficiently certain what was doubtful before, namely, the bankrupt's inability to obey the order,
he has always been released, and I need hardly say that he
would always have the right to be released, as soon as the
fact becomes clear that he can not obey. Actual or virtual imprisonment for debt has ceased, but imprisonment
to compel obedience to a lawful judicial order (if it appear that obedience is being willfully refused) has not yet
ceased and ought not to cease, unlessoit should be thought
expedient to destroy all respect for the courts by stripping
them of power to enforce their lawful decrees."
In the two cases before us, the contemnors had ample
opportunity in the original hearing to be heard as to the
fact of concealment, and in the motion for the contempt
to show their inability to comply with the turnover order.
They did not succeed in meeting the burden which was
necessarily theirs in each case, and we think, there-
