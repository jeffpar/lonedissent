tion of diverse citizenship. "A State is not a citizen.
And, under the Judiciary Acts of the United States, it is
well settled that a suit between a State and a citizen or a
corporation of another State is not between citizens of
different States; and that the Circuit Court of the United
States has no jurisdiction oT it, unless it arises under the
Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States."
Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Alabama, 155 U. S. 482, 487.
Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., 194 U. S. 48, 63.
Here the petition showed no diversity of citizenship between the real parties in interest-the State and the Construction Company. No other ground of jurisdiction was
asserted. Consequently there was no jurisdiction. The
judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed; that of the District Court will be affirmed.

WEST, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, v.
STANDARD OIL COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THU COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.

No. 71.

Argued October 24, 25, 1928-Decided January 2, 1929.

1. Authority of the Secretary of the Interior to determine whether
land claimed under a school land grant to a State was known to
be mineral when the survey was approved, may be exercised by
him directly without preliminary resort to a hearing before the

local land officers. P. 213.
2. Land comprised in a section numbered 36 was deeded by the
State of California as part of her school land grant, her title depending under the granting act of Congress upon the mineral
character of the land not having been known at the time when
the survey was approved. For the purpose of determining this
question purely in the interest of the United States, no claim under the federal laws having been advanced by any third party,
the Land Department ordered a hearing before the local land

officers. Subsequently, a Secretary of the Interior at the instance
of those claiming under the State himself gave a hearing and,
without specifying reasons, directed that the proceedings before
the local officers be dismissed. Held:
(1) That, assuming the Secretary had power to decide the question of known mineral character conclusively and thus end the
jurisdiction of the Department over the land, the making of this
finding of fact can not be implied in support of his order, the case
being unlike that of a judgment, or an administrative act passing
title, such as a patent. Pp. 213, 214.
(2) To ascertain whether such finding was actually made, matters
leading up to the order may be examined, such as the brief of counsel filed with the Secretary, the notice of the hearing, and the
stenographer's transcript of the proceedings. P. 214.
(3) The function of the Secretary was to determine the question
of fact whether the mineral character of the land was known when
the survey was approved, to the end that, in such case, the interests
of the United States might be protected, through legal proceedings
if necessary. It was not his duty to adjudicate generally upon the
rights of the State or her grantees; and a decision by him arrived
at without deciding this question of fact and which upheld their
claim because in his opinion other facts not questioned had operated
as a matter of law to estop the Government from disputing their
title, was beyond his authority. Pp. 218-220.
(4) The action of the Secretary having been based upon such unauthorized grounds, his successor was not thereby precluded from
reopening the original inquiry. P. 220.

CERTIORARI, 276 U. S. 613, to a decree of the Court of
Appeals of the District of Columbia, which affirmed a
decree of the Supreme Court of the District enjoining the
Secretary of the Interior from continuing proceedings in a
local land office brought for the purpose of ascertaining
whether certain land in California comprised in a school
section was known to be mineral when the survey of the
section was approved.

proved, can be made only by the Department of the
Interior. Until the matter is closed by final action, the
proceedings of an officer of the Department are as much
open to review or reversal by himself or his successor as
are the interlocutory decrees of a court open to review
upon the final hearing. New Orleans v. Paine, 147 U. S.
261; Michigan Land Co. v. Rust, 168 U. S. 589.
The Secretary of the Interior has repeatedly exercised
authority to review and reverse, upon the same record,
the decisions of a preceding Secretary. Parcherv. Gillen,

L. D. 441.
The order of 1904 relieving certain lands from suspension was not an adjudication of their non-mineral character.
The regulations of March 6, 1903, providing that a
State would not be permitted to make selection in lieu
of land within a school section alleged to be mineral in
character, unless there were mineral actually discovered
upon the base land, was not a determination of the nonmineral character of the land in question and did not
operate to vest title in the State.
The equities in this case are adverse to the claim of
respondent.
Secretary Fall's order of dismissal' was not a determination of the non-mineral character of the land as of
January 26, 1903.
The brief and argument before Secretary Fall constitute respondent's answer to the charges then pending, and
are part of the pleadings in that case. This Court may
examine the pleadings and even the testimony to ascertain
what the order of dismissal meant. Russell v. Place, 94

Section 36 could not be alienated from the Government
except by an adjudication of its non-mineral character by
the Interior Department.
The only way in which testimony could be taken on
such an issue was before the local land office, .as there is
no provision either in the rules or the practice for taking
testimony before the Secretary. Therefore, if Secretary
Fall undertook to decide the case on the merits without
giving the Government a chance to present its evidence or
to be heard on its contention, he was exceeding his powers,
and any order or ruling made by him under these conditions is absolutely void. McDonald v. Mabee, 243 U. S.

Burke v. Southern Pacific Co., 234 U. S. 669.
The contest filed in this case followed the usual procedure and raised the sole issue whether or not the land
was known mineral land at the date of approval of the
survey, i. e., January 26, 1903, and whether or not the
title therefore had passed to the State.

The contest was formally decided by the Secretary.
That decision is the letter of June 9, 1921. It is in the
ordinary form of judgments rendered by the Department.

West v. Hitchcock, 205 U. S. 80.
Such decisions are judicial in character, partaking of
the nature of judgments. United States v. Schurz, 102

106 U. S. 447; Ellifson v. Phillips, 18 L. D. 299; Payne v.
New Mexico, 255 U. S. 367.
The judgment of the Secretary was a judgment on the
merits and the judgment so shows on its face. It conclusively implies a finding that the land was not known
mineral land at the date of the approval of the survey.

Neither the preliminary discussions nor the transcript

U. S. 80; De Cambra v. Rogers, 189 U. S. 119; Martin v.

The proceedings, however, do show a hearing and decision on its merits.
The Secretary had jurisdiction to decide the contest
even though there had been no previous trial in the local
land office and no hearing before the Commissioner.

The rule of the Department that school land would not
be considered mineral unless there was an actual exposure
of mineral, was not abrogated.
The equities are with respondent and the fact that these
equities were urged before the Secretary shows transferees
were seeking decision on the merits. Subsequent withdrawals could not alter the State's rights.
The judgment is not void because the Secretary considered certain evidence immaterial. A judgment can
never be attacked in a collateral proceeding for mere error.
The rule that judgments are impervious to collateral
attack on any ground, except that they are void, applies
to judgments of the Department of the Interior. United
States v. Schurz, 102 U. S. 378; Knight v. U. S. Land

Burke v. Southern Pacific, 234 U. S. 669.
Neither a patent nor an act equivalent to a patent can
be set aside except in a direct proceeding brought for
that purp6se. Burke v. Southern Pacific,supra; Noble v.
Union River Logging R. R., supra. Various kinds of acts
of the Department are equivalent to the issuance of a
patent. Such acts either operate to transfer the title of the
land from the United States to the claimant, or are a confirmation of a title that has already vested. Sometimes
such an act, which is equivalent to a patent, is a mere
certification of a list to the State, sometimes the mere
approval of a survey, sometimes the approval of a selection, sometimes the approval of a map, sometimes the
approval of a railroad right of way, sometimes an act of
Congress and sometimes a decision of the Department.
But whatever the act taken by the Department, it is held

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

to be the equivalent of a patent, provided there is no
further action for the Department to take. Shaw v.
Kellogg, 170 U. S. 312; Michigan Land Co. v. Rust, 168
U. S. 589; Chandler v. Calumet & Hecla Mining Co., 149

Curtis, 213 U. S. 339; Landeau .v. Hanes, 21 Wall. 521;
United States v. Schurz, 102 U. S. 378.
In this case, there was nothing further for the Interior
Department to do. There was no provision for the doing
of any further act in connection with the title. The grant
was a grant in praesenti. The title passed to the State,
unless the land was known mineral land at the date of the
approval of the survey. The United States filed a formal
proceeding to have it determined that the title had not
passed to the State. That proceeding came on for hearing
before the tribunal having jurisdiction to hear it. The
hearing was held and the judgment was rendered that the
title had passed from the United States and that the
State's title had vested. There was no other act that the
Department could take; there was no further paper for
it to sign; there was no entry to be made; there was
nothing further of any kind or character to be done. The
last act in the transmission of the title to the State had
been performed, and under the authorities cited, the title
had passed to the State.
The judgment having determined that the title had
passed to the State, the land is no longer a part of the
public domain, therefore the present Secretary has no
jurisdiction over it. His attempt to hold hearings or
make orders with reference to this land is beyond his
jurisdiction and may be enjoined as an unwarranted
clouding of title. Moore v. Robbins, 96 U. S. 530; Noble

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This suit was brought in October, 1925, by the Standard
Oil Company in the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia against Dr. Work, the then Secretary of the Interior, to enjoin the continuation of proceedings in the
local land office at Visalia, California, ordered by him with
a view to ascertaining and determining whether particular
lands were known to be mineral in character when the
survey of them was accepted. State of California,Standard Oil Co., Transferees, 51 L. D. 141. Upon his resignation, Secretary West was substituted as defendant. The
proceedings were of the kind commonly employed by the
Secretary of the Interior to ascertain the existence of alleged facts reported by a representative of the General
Land Office, because of which the title of one claiming public lands is questioned in the Department. The Register
and Receiver, after hearing the parties in interest, make
report of their findings. These are subject to an appeal,
on the evidence, to the Land Commissioner, and also to a
further appeal to the Secretary. Upon the ultimate findings, the Commissioner decides, subject to the supervision
and control of the Secretary, what action, if any, shall be
taken. Compare George W. Dally, 41 L. D. 295, 299.
Circular No. 460, February 26, 1916, 44 L. D. 572, prescribes the procedure.
The proceedings here involved concern Section 36,
Township 30 South, Range 23 East, Mount Diablo B. &
M.-that land being in Elks Hills, Kern County, California. Section 36 is one of the sections in each township which, if not mineral or otherwise disposed of, was

granted by Congress to the State of California in aid of
public schools, by Act of March 3, 1853, c. 145, § 6, 10 Stat.
244, 246. Under patents issued by the State in 1910, and
mesne conveyances, the Standard Oil Company claims
title to part, and an interest in the rest, of the section.
Drilling on this land, begun in 1918, has been followed by
extensive oil mining operations. The proceedings werebased on a charge that on January 26, 1903, the date of
the approval of the survey, the land was known to be
mineral in character. If the land was then known to
be mineral, the title confessedly did not pass by the Act.
For Congress excluded mineral land from the grant. Mining Co. v. ConsolidatedMining Co., 102 U. S. 167; Mullan
v. United States, 118 U. S. 271, 276. See also Wyoming v.
United States, 255 U. S. 489, 500; Work v. Louisiana,
269 U. S. 250, 257-8. If it was not then known to be
mineral, the legal title passed to the State on that date.
For the land was within one of the sections in place
designated in the granting Act. United States v. Morrison, 240 U. S. 192; United States v. Sweet, 245 U. S. 563.
The Act of 1853 here involved, like those granting school
lands to many other States,' makes no provision for determining what part of the land is thus excluded from the
grant. It.does not provide for the issue of patents or for
any equivalent action by the Department to evidence the
transfer of title to the State. No patent to the State, or

Opinion of the Court.

evidence of title or interest in another, has in fact been
issued by the Secretary of the Interior. Nor has there been
in the Department any contest between the State and
another claimant which might have resulted in a determination of the character of the land. Whether this land was
known to be mineral at the date of the survey must, therefore, be established otherwise. The Standard Oil Company contends that its non-mineral character had, before
Secretary Work's order, been established by a final determination in the Department; that thereby the Department lost jurisdiction over the land; and that, for this reason, continuation of the proceedings should be enjoined.2
It is true that among the several officers of the Land Department action had repeatedly been taken having some
relation to the character of the land prior to the order of
Secretary Work. The survey, which was approved January 26, 1903, returned it as mineral. In 1904, a special
agent reported it as non-mineral. In 1908, it was temporarily withdrawn from agricultural entry pending
examination and classification by the United States Geological Survey. In 1909, the Director of the Geological
Survey classified it as oil land. In 1910, the Secretary
recommended its withdrawal for a petroleum reserve and
the recommendation was approved by the President. In
1912, it was placed in Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1.
On January 14, 1914, the proceedings in the land office
here involved were initiated. The papers having been
mislaid or misfiled in the local office, the proceedings lay
dormant; and process was not served until after March 2,
1921. Then the Register and Receiver were ordered by
the Land Commissioner, under Secretary Payne, to proceed in accordance with Circular No. .460. On June 9,

278 U. S.

1921, before further action thereon, Secretary Fall directed
the Land Commissioner to dismiss the proceedings and
notify all parties in interest of the dismissal.
On May 8, 1925, Secretary Work vacated Secretary
Fall's order and directed the Register and Receiver to proceed to a hearing of the charge that the land was known
to be mineral in character on January 26, 1903V If at
the time of Secretary Work's order the Department still
had jurisdiction of the land, he possessed the power to
review the action of his predecessor and to deal with the
matter as freely as he could have done if the dismissal of
the proceedings had been his own act or that of a subordinate official. For, so long as the Department' retains
jurisdiction of the land, administrative orders concerning
it are subject to revision. New Orleans v. Paine, 147 U. S.
261; Beley v. Naphtaly, 169 U. S. 353, 364; Lane v. Darlington, 249 U. S. 331; Parcher v. Gillen, 26 L. D. 34;
Aspen Consolidated Mining Co. v. Williams, 27 L. D. 1.
Compare Louisiana v. Garfield, 211 U. S. 70, 75. If, on
the other hand, either Secretary Fall's order of dismissal,
or some earlier action of the Government, terminated the
jurisdiction of the Department, Secretary Work's order
reinstating the proceedings was a nullity; and the Standard Oil Company is entitled to enjoin their continuance.

Lane v. Watts, 234 U. S. 525; Burke v. Southern Pacific
R. R. Co., 234 U. S. 669, 686.
In support of its contention that the jurisdiction had
ended, the Company relied in its bill upon two earlier
acts of the Department, besides Secretary Fall's order, as
constituting a final determination that the land was not
known to be mineral at the date of the approval of the

Opinion of the Court.

survey. The Supreme Court of the District did not pass
on the legal effect of the two other acts. Upon the stipulated facts it ruled and found: (1) That Secretary Fall
had jurisdiction to determine the known mineral character
of Section 36, without awaiting the trial by the local land
office and appeals from the findings there made. (2) That
the Secretary granted a hearing before himself for the purpose of determining the issues raised by the proceedings
and gave notice to all parties in interest of such hearing.
(3) That he had before him evidence which he had a right
to consider and which supported his dismissal of the proceedings. (4) That he dismissed the proceedings after a
consideration of the law and facts and directed that the
parties in interest be notified of the dismissal and that the
case be closed on the records. (5) That the order of dismissal was reduced to writing by his direction and was
a judicial determination of the known mineral character
of the land on January 26, 1903. (6) That the order of
dismissal reduced to writing was a judgment on the merits,
and its correctness could not be questioned by collateral
proceedings, except for fraud. A decree for a permanent
injunction was entered. That decree was affirmed by the
Court of Appeals of the District, 57 App. D. C. 329, 23 F.
(2d) 750. This Court granted a writ of certiorari, 276
U. S. 613.
Ordinarily, where an act granting public lands excludes
those known to be mineral, the determination of the fact
whether a particular tract is of'that character rests with
the Secretary of the Interior. See Cameron v. United
States, 252 U. S. 450, 464; Burke v. Southern Pacific R. R.
Co., 234 U. S. 669, 684-87. But compare Dunbar Lime
Co. v. Utah-Idaho Sugar Co., 17 F. (2d) 351. If such act
provides for the issue of a patent, whether it be to pass
the title or to furnish evidence that it has passed, the
patent imports that final determination of the non-mineral character of the land has been made. The issue of

the patent terminates the jurisdiction of the Department
over the land. See Barden v. Northern Pacific R. R., 154
U. S. 288, 327-331; Courtrightv. Wisconsin Central R. R.
Co., 19 L. D. 410; Heirs of C. H. Creciat, 40 L. D. 623.
And in the courts the patent is accepted, upon a collateral
attack, as affording conclusive evidence of the non-mineral
character. Smelting Co. v. Kemp, 104 U. S.636, 640, 641;
Barden v. Northern Pacific R. R., 154 U. S. 288, 327.
Similarly, if the granting act provides for other action by
the Secretary equivalent to a patent, such as approval of
a list of the lands, the approval ends the jurisdiction of
the Department, Cole v. Washington, 37 L. D. 387; Sewell
A. Knapp, 47 L. D. 152; and it, likewise, imports that the
necessary determination has been made. Chandlerv. Calumet & Hecla Mining Co., 149 U. S.79. Compare Fred S.
Porter, 50 L. D. 528, 532-533. Even where the granting
act does not require either the issue of a patent to the
grantee or such equivalent action, the Secretary may have
occasion to make a determination of the known mineral
character of the land, as when rights adverse to the grantee
are asserted under the mineral, leasing or other laws. See
Work v. Braffet, 276 U. S.560; Albert E. Dorif, 50 L. D.
219; Utah v. Lichliter, 50 L. D. 231; George G. Frandsen,
50 L. D. 516. In such event, the issue of the patent, or
other instrument evidencing title, likewise imports that
the determination has been made. Steel v. Smelting Co.,
106 U. S.447, 451. Compare State of Louisiana,30 L. D.
626. For, in every such case, the determination, of the
mineral character is a prerequisite to the authority exercised in the performance of a duty imposed. Smelting
Co. v. Kemp, 104 U. S. 636, 640-641.
The Standard Oil Company contends that Secretary
Fall determined that the land was not known to be mineral on January 26, 1903; and that this determination in
the informal hearing before him was legally an equivalent
of a determination of the fact in formal proceedings be-

fore the Register and Receiver under Circular No. 460.
We agree that if Secretary Fall had determined as a fact
that the land was not then known to be mineral, his order
dismissing the proceedings would have had the same legal
effect as if it had followed the more formal procedure prescribed by Circular No. 460. For the Secretary is not
obliged to employ proceedings in the local land office as the
means for making the determination as to the known
mineral character. He could himself hear the evidence in
the first instance. Nor is he obliged, in so ascertaining
the facts, to follow a procedure similar to that prescribed
for the local land office. See Knight v. U. S. Land Ass'n,
142 U. S. 161, 177-178. We assume, without deciding,
that if Secretary Fall had determined as a fact that the
land was not known to be mineral on January 26, 1903,
his order dismissing the proceedings would have ended the
jurisdiction of the Department over the land. And this
determination would, ordinarily, be conclusive on the
courts, even if there were demonstrable error in the admission, or appreciation of evidence. See Shepley v.
Cowan, 91 U. S.330, 340; Lee v. Johnson, 116 U. S.48, 49.
But we are of the opinion that Secretary Fall did not make
a determination of that fact.
Secretary Fall's order is embodied in a letter sent by his
direction to the Commissioner of the General Land Office,
which after referring to the proceedings before the Register 'and Receiver, says:
"The transferees of the State of California, representatives of the Department of Justice, and of the Navy Department appeared before Secretary Fall on June 8, 1921,
and presented the matter orally, whereupon, after consideration of the law and facts involved, the Secretary
verbally directed that the proceedings be dismissed. You
are therefore authorized and directed to dismiss the proceedings against the State of California and its transferees
in re said secs. 16 and 36. Notify all parties in interest
of the dismissal and close the case upon your records."

Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

The letter embodying Secretary Fall's direction to dismiss the proceedings does not state why he did so. The
Company argues that the dismissal was an order judicial
in its nature; that in form the order is a judgment on the
merits; that this judgment conclusively implies a finding
of the fact that the land was not known to be mineral at
the date of the approval of the survey; and that no evidence is admissible to contradict what the order imports.
It may be assumed that the hearing was conducted in the
judicial manner; that it was what is often called a quasijudicial proceeding. But the order of dismissal is not a
judgment.' Compare Dickson v. Luck Land Co., 242 U.
S. 371, 374. It was an administrative act. And, unlike
such administrative acts as a patent or the approval of
a list of lands pursuant to a duty imposed upon the Secretary, the order of dismissal does not carry the implication that all determinations essential to the passing of
title have been made. Since it does not, there may be inquiry in pais to ascertain whether Secretary Fall actually
made such a determination. To that end the occurrences
leading up to the entry of the order of dismissal may be
examined. Compare Parcher v. Gillen. 26 L. D. 34;
Harkraderv. Goldstein, 31 L. D. 87.
In the oral argument of counsel for the Company, in
this Court, there was perhaps a suggestion that Secretary
Fall actually passed upon the known mineral character of
the land as of January 26, 1903, when the survey was approved. But no such contention is made in the brief filed
here. And when the occurrences which preceded the making of the order are examined, it becomes clear that Secretary Fall made no determination of the contested issue of

be controlled by the same strict doctrine of res judicata which obtains
as to judgments of the courts. Osborn v. Knight, 23 L. D. 216, 218;

fact, which was to be the subject of a hearing before the
local officers if he deemed the issue material. He rested
his order of dismissal on a supposed rule of law; holding,
on the admitted facts, that the actual known mineral
character on January 26, 1903, was not of legal significance. In so ruling, he yielded to the argument of counsel
for the Standard Oil Company, who insisted that the then
known mineral character had become immaterial, because
the Government was estopped, by action taken prior to
1921, from questioning the Company's title. The brief
filed by counsel with Secretary Fall prior to his granting
the hearing; the notice of the proposed hearing before
Secretary Fall on June 8, 1921, given by the Department
to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Navy;
and the stenographic report of that hearing, establish that
this was the only matter considered by Secretary Fall.
That brief was entitled an " argument in support of the
request that the Secretary of the Interior decide that in
view of the previous action of the department and of its
regulations in force in January, 1903, the title to said section is vested in the State of California or its grantees." 5
The notice recited that the Standard Oil Company and the
Pan American Oil Company had" asked to be heard orally
in the matter of proposed proceeding by the Government
to determine whether or not said section passed to the
State of California under its school grant." The hearing
5The brief states: "There is no reason why this decision as to the
title of the State should not be made now without putting the State
to the enormous and costly burden of proof, such as was in issue in
the Elk Hills case. [United States v. Southern Pacific Company, 251
U. S. 1.] In other words, if the absence of clear proof of the mineral
character of the section in 1903 in the shape of discovery of mineral
was sufficient to characterize the land as nonmineral under the regulations and repeated decisions of the department, it will make no
difference that by the application of the principles of the Elk Hills
case it could be successfully shown that the land within the reasoning
of that decision was believed to be mineral land."

consisted of an oral statement by counsel for the Company, interrupted from time to time by questions or remarks. The statement was not a recital of evidence in
support of the factual assertion that the land was not
known to be mineral on January 26, 1903. It was an argument in support of the legal proposition that the proceedings should be closed without deciding that issue of fact,
because certain rules of law, arising from past action of
the Department, as well as controlling equities, estopped
the Government from denying that the title had passed.'
The prior action relied upon as vesting title in the State and its
transferees was: (1) The fact that the land was classified as nonmineral in 1904, when, upon receipt of a report from Special Agent
Ryan that it was non-mineral, it was relieved from suspension;
(2) the fact that, on March 6, 1903, the Department adopted an
administrative rule resecting school land grants that the State would
not be permitted to make lieu selections based on the alleged mineral
character of land within a school section, unless it proved that there
had been actual discovery or exposure of mineral thereon. Mr. Sutro
argued that since under this rule the State could not have made the
land the base for a lieu selection, it was legally entitled to retain it;
and having acted on the rule, its transferees were unaffected by later
decisions of this Court (Diamond Coal Co. v. United States, 233 U. S.
236; United States v. Southern Pacific Company, 251 U. S. 1) inconsistent with the rule. In closing he said:
"And I submit that in this case, where there is no fraud, no possible
allegation of fraud, where the State, five years after the classification
of this land, sold it in good faith to people who bought it in good
faith, and who held it for 10 years, and who have now invested some
millions of dollars in the land, that the time has passed when the
United States can assert its title thereto, and that the United States
is estopped by the judgment of this department that this was nonmineral land in 1904, and by its own regulations, which defined it as
nonmineral land in 1903. Now if you will ask me what it is I am
asking you to do, I will say it is this: I am asking the department to
close this case on the ground that the title is in the State, and there
is nothing further to investigate." Secretary Fall then said: " What
you are asking now is that if convinced that the rule is as you state
it, that instead of allowing this case to go to a hearing, and then in
event I would hold with you, so deciding at that time, that if I am

Opinion of the Court.

The conclusion that Secretary Fall did not determine the
known mineral character of the land on January 26, 1903,
is alone consistent with the stipulated facts.'
Most significant among the stipulated facts is the following: "It was the contention of the transferees from
the State, with which contention Assistant Secretary Finney disagreed at the hearing, that it could serve no purwith you that I should decide it at this time and prevent the delay in
the trial?" After some further discussion, Secretary Fall asked: "Is
Mr. Sutro's statement of the case practically admitted? " First
Assistant Secretary Finney answered: "I think that is substantially
the case." Whereupon the Secretary said: "The contest will be
dismissed."
7 The land lies within Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1; a part of it
is immediately adjacent to that involved in United States v. Southern
Pacific Company, 251 U. S. 1, which was rendered in 1919. The fact
that the proceedings were pending was not discovered by the Chief
of the Field Division of the Land Office until the close of 1920. In
February, 1921, the importance of taking immediate action to protect
supposed interests of the United States in the land was brought to the
attention of the Department of Justice and the Secretary of the Navy.
On March 2, 1921, the Commissioner of the General Land Office
directed the Register and Receiver and the Chief of the Field Division
to take prompt action to determine by proper proceedings whether
the land was known to be mineral at the date of the approval of the
survey. The advisability of protecting the supposed interests of the
Government, pending that determination, by an application for a
receiver and an injunction, was considered by the several departments.
That course was deemed inadvisable. Conference with representatives of the Company resulted in an agreement that it would endeavor
to secure from the Department of the Interior an early hearing and
determination with respect to the known mineral character of the
land; that, until such determination, there should be no further development thereon; and that the Government would not take any action
in court. Thereafter, on several days prior to May 26, 1921, Mr.
Oscar Sutro, representing the Standard Oil Company, presented to
Secretary Fall and the First Assistant Secretary, a request for an
early determination with respect to the title to Section 36. On May
26, he filed with the Secretary the brief above referred to. On May
28, 1921, the Secretary gave the Attorney General and the Secretary
of the Navy the notioe of hearing above referred to.

pose to take evidence in the local land office to determine
the question whether or not said section or the lands adjacent thereto showed structural and geological conditions
indicative in 1903 of the existence of oil on said section
under conditions justifying developments therefor for the
reason that said questions presented an immaterial question of fact and said question was not argued or discussed
at the proceedings held on June 8, 1921, or at any conferences prior thereto between the representatives of the
transferees and the Secretary of the Interior or the First
Assistant Secretary of the Interior, except as shown in the
brief and in the transcript of proceedings." [The stenographic report of the hearing above referred to.]
Thus, Secretary Fall did not hear evidence or make a
determination on the issue of fact as to the known mineral character of the land within the meaning of the decisions in Diamond Coal Co. v. United States, 233 U. S.
236 and Southern Pacific Co. v. United States 251 U. S.
1; and this because he deemed the fact in issue of no legal
significance. It is true that in making the ruling of law
that the Standard Oil Company's title was unassailable,
the Secretary undertook to pass upon the merits of its
claim to the land. For he concluded that, because of the
conceded facts, urged by the Company's counsel as creating
an estoppel, the United States was precluded from questioning the title of the State and its transferees. But that
decision could not end the jurisdiction of the Department,
unless Congress conferred upon the Secretary of the Interior authority to determine the validity of the Company's claim to the land, as a matter of law, without passing upon the contested issue of fact. To that question
we now address ourselves.
Where by the terms of an act, the Secretary is required,
upon application of the claimant, to issue a patent, as in
Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, 168 U. S.589, 592;
or to certify a list, as in Frasherv. O'Connor, 115 U. S. 102

WEST v. STANDARD OIL CO.

Opinion of the Court.

115-116; or to approve a location for a right of way, as
in Noble v. Union River Logging R. R. Co., 147 U. S. 165;
or to make a survey and approve a selection, as in Shaw
v. Kellogg, 170 U. S. 312, Congress, by implication, confers
upon the Secretary the power to make all determinations
of law as well as of fact which are essential to the performance of the duty specifically imposed. After issue of the
patent or other like instrument, his findings of facts are
conclusive, in the absence of fraud or mistake, not only
upon the Department, but upon the courts, De Cambra v.
Rogers, 189 U. S. 119; Love v. Flahive, 205 U. S. 195, 198;
and though his rulings on matters of law are reviewable
in the courts, Doolan v. Carr, 125 U. S. 618, 625; Wisconsin Central R. R. v. Forsythe, 159 U. S. 46, 61, they are
not subject to re-examination by the Department. Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72, 83-84. For in making such
determinations he acts as a special tribunal with judicial
functions. Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, 190 U. S. 316,
324.
But here no similar affirmative duty rested upon the
Secretary to the performance of which the determination
of the question of law was incidental. Secretary Fall
owed no active duty to the State or to any other claimant.
His duty in respect to the land was solely that owed to the
United States--the duty to preserve its interests therein.
The inquiry directed to be made in the local land office
had been ordered by a predecessor solely in the performance of that duty. If as a result of the inquiry it should
be found that the land was known to be mineral, the Government would, if necessary, bring legal proceedings for
possession and for damages or an accounting. If it should
be found that the land was not known to be mineral,
there would be no occasion for any further departmental
action. Secretary Fall had, of course, the power to vacate
the order of his predecessor that the Register and Receiver
proceed with the investigation. For it is within the dis-

cretion of every Secretary to decide what investigations
he shall pursue in the public interest; and no Secretary
is obliged to continue an inquiry which he believes to be
futile. But the question here is whether he can by action other than the final determination of fact, preclude
resumption of the inquiry in the Department, and thereby
vest the title of known mineral land in the State.
We think that Congress did not confer upon the Secretary of the Interior the power to pass generally upon the
right of the State to the land. When the Secretary has
the duty to issue a patent or to furnish other evidence of
title of a claimant, he must have authority to determine
the questions of law incident to the performance of that
duty. Litchfield v. Register, 9 Wall. 575, 577-578. But
here no such duty rested upon him. Compare Louisiana
v. Garfield, 211 U. S. 70, 77. Authority to determine as
a fact the known mineral character of the lands falls naturally to the Secretary as "the supervising agent of the
government to do justice to all claimants and preserve the
rights of the people of the United States" to public lands.
Knight v. U. S. Land Ass'n, 142 U. S. 161, 178. But
that authority does not carry the power to relinquish the
jurisdiction of the Department over the land without determining, as a fact, that it was non-mineral at the time
of the approval of the survey. Compare Work v. Louisiana, 269 U. S. 250, 261. The broad power of control and
supervision conferred upon the Secretary" does not clothe
him with any discretion to enlarge or curtail the rights of
the grantee, nor to substitute his judgment for the will of
Congress as manifested in the granting act." Payne v.
Central PacificRailway Co., 255 U. S. 228, 236. See, also,
.Burfenning v. Chicago, St. Paul &c. Ry., 163 U. S. 321;
Daniels v. Wagner, 237 U. S. 547, 558. To read into the
legislation, under such circumstances, authority to pass
upon the State's claim of right to the land, regardless of
its known mineral character, would create, by implication,

a power in direct contravention of the expressed intention
of Congress that mineral lands were not granted to the
State. Thus, the Secretary would be constituted an agent
rather for relinquishing than for preserving the rights of
the United States in the public lands. See Shaw v. Kellogg, 170 U. S. 312, 337-338.
When Secretary Fall undertook to determine, not as a
fact whether the land was known to be mineral in 1903,
but as a proposition of law that, because of other conceded facts, the Company's title had become unassailable,
he acted without authority; and the order of dismissal
based thereon did not remove the land from the jurisdiction of the Department.
