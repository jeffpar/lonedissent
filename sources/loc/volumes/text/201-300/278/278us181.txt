RUSSELL v. UNITED STATES.
177

Statement of the Case.

Our conclusion is that the objection was not seasonably
made and therefore that under our decisions, as also the
Ohio statute, it was waived. The question before stated
must be answered in the negative. A second or alternative question is propounded in the certificate, but an
answer to it is rendered unnecessary by the answer to the
other.
Question No. 1, Answered No.

RUSSELL

ET AL.

v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 58. Argued November 22, 1928.-Decided January 2, 1929,
1. The Revenue Act of 1921 limited the time within which income
and profits taxes imposed by the Act of 1918 might be
assessed, and within which suit might be brought to collect them,
to five years from the filing of the return. Section 277 of the
Revenue Act of 1924 preserves the same limitation generally, but
where assessment is made within the prescribed period, § 278
permits suit to be brought within six years from the assessment,
that section declaring, however, that it shall not authorize any suit
.barred by existing limitation, or "affect any assessment" made
before the date of the Act. Held, considering these and other
features of the 1924 Act, that the provision extending the time for
suit should be construed prospectively as relating only to assessments made after that Act was passed. P. 185.
2. Changes introduced by a later Act cannot authorize construction
of an earlier one not consonant with its language. P. 188.
22 F. (2d) 249, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 276 U. S. 612, to a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals which reversed a decree dismissing a bill
brought by the United States against the stockholders to
recover the amount of income and profits taxes which had
been assessed against a corporation before it was dissolved
and its assets distributed among the defendants.

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

Messrs. Douglas Arant and Wn. S. Pritchard, with
whom Messrs. Lee C. Bradley, Jr., and John D. Higgins
were on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Edwin G. Davis, with whom Solicitor General
Mitchell, Assistant Attorney GeneralMabel Walker Willebrandt, and Messrs. Sewall Key and J. Louis Monarch
were on the brief, for the United States.
Messrs. J. Robert Sherrod, Joseph D. Peeler, and Ward
Loveless; John E. Hughes; Louis 0. Van Doren, Win. R.
Conklin, and Edward S. Bentley; J. C. Murphy; and
Clarence N. Goodwin, filed briefs, as amici curiae, by
special leave of Court.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The United States by bill filed January 23, 1925, sought
to recover from petitioners, stockholders of the Pine Lumber Company, additional income and profit taxes for the
year 1918 assessed against that Corporation in March,
1924. The Company made a return to the Collector for
1918 on June 12, 1919, and afterwards paid the amount
indicated thereby.
Petitioners claimed the suit was barred under the limitation specified by the applicable statute. They succeeded in the District Court; but the Circuit Court of
Appeals held another view and reversed the decree dismissing the bill.
The statutory provisions which require special consideration are printed below.
Revenue Act, 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1083:
"Sec. 250 (d). Except in the case of false or fraudulent returns with intent to evade the tax, the amount of
tax due under any return shall be determined and assessed
by the Commissioner within five years after the return

was due or was made, and no suit or proceeding for the
collection of any tax shall be begun after the expiration
of five years after the date when the return was due or
was made .

Revenue Act, 1921, c. 136, Title II-Income Tax, 42
Stat. 227, 265:
"See. 250 (d). The amount of income, excess-profits,
or war-profits taxes due under any return made under
this Act for the taxable year 1921 or succeeding taxable
years shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within four years after the return was filed, and the
amount of any such taxes due under any return made under
this Act for prior taxable years or under prior income, excess-profits, or war-profits tax Acts, . . . shall be deter-

mined and assessed within five years after the return
was filed, . . . and no suit or proceeding for the collection

of any such taxes due under this Act or under prior income, excess-profits, or war-profits tax Acts, . . . shall

be begun, after the expiration of five years after the date
when such return was filed, but this shall not affect suits
or proceedings begun at the time of the passage of this
Act ..."
Revenue Act, 1924, c. 234, Title II [effective January
1, 1924] 43 Stat. 253, 299, 300, 301, 303, 352:

such Act as amended, for the taxable year 1921 and succeeding taxable years, and the amount of income taxes imposed by this Act, shall be assessed within four years
after the return was filed, -and no proceeding in court for
the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period.

Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

"(2) The amount of income, excess-profits, and warprofits taxes imposed by . . .the Revenue Act of 1918,
and by any such Act as amended, shall be assessed within
five years after the return was filed, and no proceeding in
court for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after
the expiration of such period."
"Sec. 278 (a) . . . (b) . . . (c)
"(d) Where the assessment of the tax is made within
the period prescribed in section 277 or in this section, [the
italicized words are unimportant here] such tax may be collected by distraint or by a proceeding in court, begun
within six years after the assessment of the tax. Nothing
in this Act shall be construed as preventing the beginning,
without assessment, of a proceeding in court for the collection of the tax at any time before the expiration of the
period within which an assessment may be made.
"(e) This section shall not (1) authorize the assessment of a tax or the collection thereof by distraint or by
a proceeding in qourt if at the time of the enactment of
this Act such assessment, distraint, or proceeding was
barred by the period of limitation then in existence, or
(2) affect any assessment made, or distraint or proceeding
in court begun, before the enactment of this Act."
"Sec. 280. If after the enactment of this Act the Commissioner determines that any assessment should be made
in respect of any income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax
imposed by the Revenue Act of 1916, the Revenue Act of
1917, the Revenue Act of 1918, or the Revenue Act of
1921, or by any such Act as amended, the amount which
should be assessed (whether as deficiency or as interest,
penalty, or other addition to the tax) shall be computed
as if this Act had not been enacted, but the amount so
computed shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same
manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations (including the provisions in case of delinquency in
payment after notice and demand) as in the case of the

RUSSELL v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

taxes imposed by this title, except as otherwise provided
in section 277."
[Title XI].
"Sec 1100. (a) The following parts of the Revenue
Act of 1921 are repealed, to take 'effect (except as otherwise provided in this Act) upon the enactment of this
Act, subject to the limitations provided in subdivisions
(b) and (c);
"Title II (called 'Income Tax') as of January 1,
1924; . . .
"(b) The parts-of the Revenue Act of 1921 which are
repealed by this Act shall (except as provided in sections
280 and 316 [316 is not important here] and except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Act) remain in
force for the assessment and collection of all taxes imposed by such Act, and for the assessment, imposition, and
collection of all interest, penalties, or forfeitures which
have accrued or may accrue in relation to any such taxes,
and for the assessment and collection, to the extent provided in the Revenue Act of 1921, of all taxes imposed by
prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax acts, and
for the assessment, imposition, and collection of all interest, penalties, or forfeitures which have accrued or may
accrue in relation to any such taxes. . ."
From the foregoing it appears: Under the Act of 1918
both assessment and suit within five years were necessary.
The Act of 1921 required that taxes imposed thereby
should be assessed within four years; that taxes payable
under the Acts of 1918, and earlier ones, should be assessed
within five years; and it limited the period within which
any suit might be brought to five years after the return.
With the exceptions specified by § 278, the Act of 1924
requires that assessment of taxes laid by it or the Act of
1921 and any suit to collect the same shall come within
four years after the return; also in respect of taxes due

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

278 U. S.

under the Acts of 1918, etc., that no assessment or suit
shall be permitted later than five years after the return.
The exceptions to the general rule of § 277 which are
specified by § 278, and here important, relate to those
cases only where there has been assessment but no suit;
and petitioners aver that these exceptions do not apply
where the assessment was made prior to June 2, 1924.
According to the general limitations contained in the
Acts of 1918, 1921, and 1924 the time within which suit
might have been brought upon the assessment of March,
1924, against the Pine Lumber Company expired June
12, 1924-five years after the return date. And unless
the Act of 1924 repealed the old limitation and established
another, petitioners must prevail. The United States
claim that § 278, Act of 1924, extended the limitation to
March, 1930-six years after the assessment. Petitioners
deny that the Act of June 2, 1924, should be so construed.
They maintain that it did not extend the period for suit
where an assessment had been made prior to its passage,
and say that § 278 (e), (2), expressly negatives the contrary theory.
When the Revenue Act of 1924 passed, many parties
were liable for taxes imposed by former Acts--1921, 1918,
etc.; against some there were assessments; others had not
been assessed. It made provision concerning taxes thereafter to accrue; also for those already due. It distinguished between existing assessments and those which
were to follow. It established a Board of Tax Appeals
and gave the right of appeal thereto whenever thereafter
the Commissioner should propose to assess for deficiency.
It thus created a radical distinction between assessments
prior to June 2, 1924, and later ones which, generally at
least, if objected to, could not be made without assent of
the Board. To secure proper action by the Board might
require considerable time, and this was provided for by
extending the limitation to six years after assessment.

RUSSELL v. UNITED STATES.
181

Opinion of the Court

But the taxpayer was afforded protection against any improper action by the Commissioner through an appeal before any assessment could be actually imposed-a new and
valuable right.
Section 1100, Act of 1924, kept in force "except as otherwise provided in sections 280 and 316 [316 is unimportant
here] and except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Act" those parts of the Act of 1921 which provided for
assessment and collection of taxes imposed by that Act or
earlier ones. Section 280 plainly relates only to assessments made subsequent to June 2, 1924; but counsel for
the United States maintain that within the meaning of
§ 1100 modification of the Act of 1921 was specifically
provided by ,§§ 277 and 278 when read in conjunction.
Section 277, as above shown, limits suits for taxes imposed by the Act of 1918 to five years after the return, except (§ 278) in certain cases where an assessment has been
made. In the excepted cases the period for suit is extended
to six years after the assessment. But § 278 further provides that it shall not authorize the collection of a tax
after the same has been actually barred by the applicable
statute, and further that it shall not affect any assessment
made prior to June 2, 1924.
Manifestly, but for § 278 petitioners would be free from
liability under the five year limitation in the Act of 1918,
continued by the Act of 1921. If § 278 refers only to assessments made after June 2, 1924, petitioners are 'not
liable.
If an assessment made before that date came within
the ambit of § 278, its effect would be retroactive; and certainly it would produce radical change in the existing
status of the claim against the petitioners--would extend
for some five years a liability which had almost expired.
United States v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 276 U. S. 160,
162 declares-" Statutes are not to be given retroactive
effect or construed to change the status of claims fixed in

Syllabus.

accordance with earlier provisions unless the legislative
purpose so to do plainly appears." No plain purpose to
change the status of the claim against petitioners as' it existed just before June 2, 1924, can be spelled out of the
words in § 278 or otherwhere.
Paragraph (e), (2), of § 278 expressly directs that that
section shall not affect any assessment made before June
2, 1924. Counsel for the United States maintain that to
extend the time for bringing suit thereon does not "affect"
an assessment within the meaning of the paragraph. We
cannot agree. Some real force must be given to the words
used-they were not employed without definite purpose.
The rather obvious design, we think, was to deprive § 278
of any possible application to cases where assessment
had been made prior to June 2, 1924.
The legislative history of the Act of 1924 lends support
to the conclusion which we have reached. The changes introduced into the Act of 1926 can not authorize construction of the earlier one not consonant with the language
there employed.
The judgment is reversed. The cause will be remanded
to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in
conformity with this opinion.
Reversed.
