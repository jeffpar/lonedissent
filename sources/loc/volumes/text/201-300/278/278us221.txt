a power in direct contravention of the expressed intention
of Congress that mineral lands were not granted to the
State. Thus, the Secretary would be constituted an agent
rather for relinquishing than for preserving the rights of
the United States in the public lands. See Shaw v. Kellogg, 170 U. S. 312, 337-338.
When Secretary Fall undertook to determine, not as a
fact whether the land was known to be mineral in 1903,
but as a proposition of law that, because of other conceded facts, the Company's title had become unassailable,
he acted without authority; and the order of dismissal
based thereon did not remove the land from the jurisdiction of the Department.
Reversed.

COGEN v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 89. Argued November 20, 1928.-Decided January 2, 1929.
An application by a defendant in a criminal case, after indictment and

before trial, for a summary order requiring the United States Attorney to return papers taken from the defendant without a warrant,
and for the suppression of all evidence obtained therefrom, held not
to be an independent proceeding; the order of the District Court
denying the application held interlocutory and not independently
appealable.
24 F. (2d) 308, affirmed.

277 U. S. 579, to a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals which dismissed a writ of error to an
order of the District Court denying an application for
return of papers and for suppression of evidence in a
criminal case.

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

Mr. Sanford H. Cohen for petitioner.
Solicitor General Mitchell, Assistant Attorney General
Mabel Walker Willebrandt, and Messrs. George C. Butte
and John J. Byrne were on the brief for the United States.
Mr. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Cogen, with others as codefendants, was indicted in the
federal court for southern New York on a charge of conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act. Before
the indictment, certain papers had been taken from his
person without a warrant. After the indictment and before trial, he applied to that court, in the criminal case,
for an order requiring the United States Attorney to return
the papers; and to suppress all evidence obtained therefrom, on the ground that the search and seizure had been
in violation of his constitutional rights. The application
was denied. Before the trial of the cause, Cogen sued out
a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals. It
dismissed the writ, holding that the order sought to be
reviewed was interlocutory and hence not appealable. 24
F. (2d) 308. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. 277
U. S. 579. The sole question for decision is whether the
order of the District Court is a final judgment within the
meaning of § 128 of the Judicial Code.
Cogen claims that it is final, contending that his application for surrender of the papers is a collateral matter,
distinct from the general subject of the litigation; and
that the order thereon finally settled the particular controversy. He argues that, being so, it falls, like the orders
in Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 203-204; Trustees v.
Greenough, 105 U. S. 527, 531; and Williams v. Morgan,
111 U. S. 684, 699, within the exception to the general rule
which limits the right of review to judgments which are

both final and complete. See Collins v. Miller, 252 U. S.
364, 370; Oneida Navigation Corp'nv. W. & S. Job & Co.,
252 U. S. 521.
It is true that the order deals with a matter which, in
one respect, is deemed collateral. As was said in Segurola v. United States, 275 U. S. 106, 111-112: " . . . a
court, when engaged in trying a criminal case, will not
take notice of the manner in which witnesses have possessed themselves of papers or other articles of personal
property, which are material and properly offered in evidence, because the court will not in trying a criminal
cause permit a collateral issue to be raised as to the source
of competent evidence. To pursue it would be to halt in
the orderly progress of a cause and consider incidentally
a question which has happened to cross the path of such
litigation and which is wholly independent of it." Hence,
a defendant will, ordinarily, be held to have waived the
objection to the manner in which evidence has been obtained unless he presents the matter for the consideration
of the court seasonably in advance of the trial; and he
does this commonly by a motion made in the cause for return of the property and for suppression of the evidence.
The rule is one of practice; and is not without exceptions.
See Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. 298, 305; Agnello
v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 34-35; Panzich v. United
States, 285 Fed. 871, 872.
It is not'true that the order on such a motion deals
with a matter distinct from the general subject of the litigation. Usually the main purpose of the motion for the
return of papers is the suppression of evidence at the
forthcoming trial of the cause. The disposition made of
the motion will necessarily determine the conduct of the
trial and may vitally affect the result. In essence, the
motion resembles others made before or during a trial to
secure or to suppress evidence, such as applications to

suppress a deposition, Grant Bros. v. United States, 232
U. S. 647, 661-662; Pullman Co. v Jordan,218 Fed. 573,
577; to compel the production of books or documents,
Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co.,
156 Fed. 765; for leave to make physical examination of
a plaintiff, Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S.
250; or for a subpoena duces tecum, Murray v. Louisiana,
163 U. S. 101, 107; American Lithographic Co. v. Werckmeister, 221 U. S. 603, 608-610. The orders made upon
such applications, so far as they affect the rights only of
parties to the litigation, are interlocutory. Compare
Alexander v. United States, 201 U. S. 117. It is only
when disobedience happens to result in an order punishing
criminally for contempt, that a party may have review
by appellate proceedings before entry of the final judgment in the cause. Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, 259 U. S.
107 110-111.
It is not true that the decision on such a motion for the
return of papers necessarily settles the question of their
admissibility in evidence. If the motion is denied, the objection to the admissibility as evidence is usually renewed
when the paper is offered at the trial. And, although the
preliminary motion was denied, the objection made at the
trial to the admission of the evidence may be sustained.
For as was said in Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. 298,
312-313: ". . . where, in the progress of a trial, it becomes probable that there has been an unconstitutional
seizure of papers, it is the duty of the trial court to entertain an objection to their admission or a motion for their
exclusion and to consider and decide the question as then
presented, even where a motion to return the papers may
have been denied before trial." Upon a review of the
final judgment against the defendant, both the refusal to
order return of the property and its admission in evidence
are commonly assigned as errors. See Weeks v. United
States, 232 IJ. S. 383, 387-389; Byars v. United States, 273

COGEN v. UNITED STATES.
221

Opinion of the Court.

U. S. 28, 29; Marron v. United States, 275 U. S. 192, 193194.1 Compare Adams v. New York, 192 U. S 585, 594.
Motions for the return of papers and the suppression of
evidence made in the cause in advance of the trial, under
this rule of practice, must be differentiated from independent proceedings brought for a similar purpose. Where
the proceeding is a plenary one, like the bill in equity
in Dowling v. Collins, 10 F. (2d) 62, its independent character is obvious; and the appealability of the decree
therein is unaffected by the fact that the purpose of the
suit is solely to influence or control the trial of a pending
criminal prosecution. Applications for return of papers
or other property may, however, often be made by motion
or other summary proceeding, by reason of the fact that
the person in possession is an officer of the court. See
United States v. Maresca, 266 Fed. 713; United States v.
Hee, 219 Fed. 1019, 1020. Compare Weinstein v. Attorney
General, 271 Fed. 673. Where an application is filed in
that form, its essential character and the circumstances
under which it is made will determine whether it is an independent proceeding or merely a step in the trial of the
criminal case. The independent character of the summary
proceedings is clear, even where the motion is filed in a
criminal case, whenever the application for the papers or
other property is made by a stranger to the litigation,
compare Ex parte Tiffany, 252 U. S. 32; Savannah v.
Jesup, 106 U. S. 563; Gumbel v. Pitkin, 113 U. S. 545; or
wherever the motion is filed before there is any indictment or information against the movant, like the motions
in Perlman v. United States, 247 U. S. 7 and Burdeau v.
McDowell, 256 U. S. 465; or wherever the criminal proceeding contemplated or pending is in another court, like
the motion in Dier v. Banton, 262 U. S. 147; or wherever

the motion, although entitled in the criminal case, is not
filed until after the criminal prosecution has been disposed
of, as where under the National Prohibition Act a defendant seeks, after acquittal, to regain possession of
liquor seized.! And the independent character of a summary proceeding for return of papers may be so clear, that
it will be deemed separate and distinct, even if. a criminal
prosecution against the movant is pending in the same
court. This was true in Essgee Co. v. United States, 262
U. S. 151, where the petition was entitled as a separate matter and was referred to by the court as a special
proceeding.
Motions for the return of property, made in connection
with a motion to quash a search warrant issued under
the National Prohibition Act, may be independent proceedings, but are not necessarily so. By Act of October 28,
1919, c. 85, Title II, § 25, 41 Stat. 305, 315 and Espionage
Act, June 15, 1917, c. 30, Title II, § 16, 40 Stat. 217, 229,
Congress made specific provision, by an independent proceeding, for the vacation of a warrant wrongfully issued
and for return of the property.3 Dumbrav. United States,
268 U. S. 435, was such a case. Steele v. United States,
No. 1, 267 U. S. 498, was also, so far as disclosed by the
record in this Court.' Because it appeared to be such, the
order therein denying the application was held in Steele v.
United States, No. 2, 267 U. S. 505, to be res judicata, on
the trial of the information filed after the seizure for un'In re Brenner, 6 F. (2d) 425; Dickhart v. United States, 16 F.
(2d) 345. See Mellet & Nichter Brewing Co. v. United States, 296
Fed. 765, 770.
' See Gallagher v. United States, 6 F. (2d) 758; United States v.
Casino, 286 Fed. 976.
4 The fact that, on the docket of the District Court, the motion to
vacate the search warrant appears to have been filed in the criminal
case and to have been disposed of there, has been brought to our
attention through the diligence of Cogen's counsel. But this fact was
not disclosed by the records or briefs in either of the Steele cases.

lawful possession of the liquor.' But a motion for the
return of property, although connected with a motion to
quash a search warrant, may, if made in the same court in
which a criminal proceeding is pending, be so closely
associated with the criminal proceeding as to be deemed a
part of it. Thus, where the motion to quash the search
warrant and for return of the property is made by a party
to the cause, is filed in the cause and seeks suppression of
the evidence at the trial, it is apparent that the motion to
quash the search warrant is an incident merely; that the
real purpose of the application is to suppress evidence;
and that it is but a step in the criminal case preliminary
to the trial thereof. Circumstances may make this clear,
even if the motion does not specifically pray for suppression of the evidence. In all such cases the order made on
the motion is interlocutory merely 6
Where in cases arising under the National Prohibition
Act a defendant seeks to obtain, by motion in advance of
trial, return of property which was not seized under a
search warrant, the interlocutory character of the order
entered thereon is ordinarily clear.7 This is true of the
order here in question. The motion was not for the return of papers seized under a search warrant. It was
filed in the criminal case after the indictment and before
5 Voorhies v. United States, 299 Fed. 275; In re No. 191 Front St.,
5 F. (2d) 282; In re Hollywood Cabaret, 5 F. (2d) 651; United
States v. Kirschenblatt, 16 F. (2d) 202, are cases of the same character. The motion filed in the criminal case passed on in Dowling v.
Collins, 10 F. (2d) 62, was assumed by the Circuit Court of Appeals
to be so. Compare Veeder v. United States, 252 Fed. 414.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 99. Argued December 3, 1928.-Decided January 2, 1929.
1. An interlocutory decree enjoining a state commission from carrying out an order restraining a railway company from removing
shops and division point from one place to another in the State,
leaves the company free to proceed with the removal pending
appeal, if the injunction was not suspended by a supersedeas bond.
P. 232.
2. Where such an interlocutory injunction was reversed on appeal
because improvidently granted, but the shops, etc., had been
removed meanwhile, and it seemed probable after the remand of
the case that the complainant would be entitled to a permanent
injunction, postponement of the question of restitution until final
hearing was within the discretion of the District Court. P. 233.
3. An order of a state commission preventing a railway company
from removing its shops and division point to another place in the
State, the effect of which will clearly impair interstate passenger

and freight service, is invalid under the commerce clause. P. 234.
