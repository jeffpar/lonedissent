SECURITY MORTGAGE COMPANY v. POWERS,
TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FIFTH CIRCUIT.
No. 32.

Argued October 12, 1928.-Decided December 10, 1928.

1. When it is asserted that real property, or its proceeds, in a bankrupt estate is subject to a lien for attorney's fees arising from a
loan contract secured by the land and made before the bankruptcy
proceedings were begun, the contract is to be construed and the
validity of the lien determined by the bankruptcy court, in accordance with the law of the State where the contract was made and
the land is situated; but whether the liability is enforceable in the
circumstances may raise federal questions peculiar to the law of
bankruptcy. P. 153.
2. Petitioner held promissory notes secured by land in Georgia. The
land was acquired from the debtor by one who assumed and agreed
to pay the debt and later was adjudicated a bankrupt. The notes
provided for 10% attorney's fees, "if collected by law or through
an attorney at law." After the adjudication, there was a default
in the payment of interest; petitioner notified the original debtor
of its election to declare the principal due, and took against the
original debtor only, without joining the bankrupt or the trustee,
the steps prescribed by § 4252 of the Georgia Code, which provides
that obligations to pay attorney's fees upon any note in addition to
interest "are void," unless the debtor fails to pay the debt on or
before the return day of the court to which suit is brought for
collection of the same, and which requires the holder to serve notice
on the debtor of his intention to sue and of the term of court. The
suit having resulted in a judgment against the original debtor for

principal, interest and attorney's fees, and declaring these amounts
a special lien on the property, and the property having in the
meantime been sold in the bankruptcy court and bought in by the
petitioner, the question arose whether credit for the attorney's fees
should be allowed the petitioner out of the proceeds of the sale,
which remained subject to the lien. Held:
(1) Enforcement of the lien for the attorney's fees was not precluded by § 63 of the Bankruptcy Act, upon the ground that the
liability remained contingent until after the bankruptcy adjudication. The lien was not contingent; and property subject to a perfected lien securing a liability still contingent at the time of bankruptcy is not discharged from the lien by the adjudicaton. P. 155.
(2) The contingent obligation to pay attorney's fees having been
part of the original loan transaction, and the consideration for the
lien having been the loan-a "present consideration "-and not
the attorney's services, allowance of the attorney's fees was not
excluded by § 67d of the Bankruptcy Act. P. 156.
(3) Secton 4252 of the Georgia Code does not mean that a
contract to pay attorney's fees shall be void until validated thereunder; it merely adds a statutory condition to the contract. P. 156.
(4) If the petitioner in this case, which knew that the bankrupt had assumed and become primarily liable for the debt, failed
to notify the trustee of its election to declare the debt due or of
the suit under § 4252, Georgia Code, or if its sole purpose in bringing that suit, knowing the defendant, the original debtor, to be
insolvent, was to increase by the amount of the attorney's fees the
claim payable in bankruptcy under the lien-it is not entitled to
credit for the attorney's fees. Pp. 157, 158.
3. Where the grounds upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals had
affirmed a judgment were found by this Court to be untenable, but
there were other reasons requiring the same results if facts, not
included in the stipulated record, were found to exist, the case was
reversed and remanded to the District Court with directions for
further proceedings. P. 159.
21 F. (2d) 965, reversed.

Court of Appeals which affirmed a judgment of the District Court, in bankruptcy, disallowing a claim for attorney's fees.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Florida Furniture Company was adjudicated
bankrupt in the Southern District of Florida. Among
its assets was real estate in Georgia, acquired by purchase
from the Hanson Motor Company. An ancillary receiver appointed in the Northern District of Georgia took
possession of this property. It was subject to a loan
deed (see Scott v. Paisley, 271 U. S. 632) given to secure
notes of the Hanson Company for $90,000 and interest,
which the Furniture Company had assumed and agreed
to pay. The trustee in bankruptcy applied for leave
to sell the property free from the lien. The secured notes
were held at the time of the adjudication and thereafter
by the Security Mortgage Company. An order was
served upon it to show cause why the trustees' application should not be granted. It appeared, but made no
opposition. Leave to sell was granted, preserving to the
lien creditor its rights in the proceeds of the sale. Under.
that order, the property was sold; and the Mortgage
Company became the purchaser at a price exceeding the
amount of all liens. It asked to be allowed as a credit
against the purchase price, among other things, the sum
of $9,442.40 for attorney's fees.
The secured indebtedness was represented by a principal note and ten coupon interest notes. Each note
contained the following clause: "With interest after
maturity until paid at eight per cent per annum with
all costs of collection, including ten per cent as attorney's
fees, if collected by law or through an attorney at law."
So far as appears, the Mortgage Company did not employ

an attorney until after it had been served with the order
to show cause, on the trustee's application for leave to
sell the property. There had been no default before
.the adjudication. Thereafter, a coupon interest note
matured and was not paid. Before the leave to sell was
granted, the Mortgage Company, because of this default,
gave notice to the Hanson Company of its election to
declare the principal note due. It also gave to the Hanson Company notice in writing that it intended to bring
suit in the City Court of Atlanta and to claim the attorney's fees, unless the the indebtedness was paid. Twelve
days later, the Mortgage Company brought such a suit
against the Hanson Company, without attempting to
join the bankrupt, the receiver, or the trustee. It does
not appear that notice of the acceleration of the principal note, or of the intention to sue, or of the bringing
of the suit against the Hanson Company was given to the
bankrupt, the trustee, or the receiver. Prior to the sale
of the property by the trustee, judgment was entered
against the Hanson Company for the principal and interest and for $9,442.40 attorney's fees. That judgment
declared those amounts to be a special lien upon the
property.
Over the objection of the trustee, the claim for attorney's fees was allowed by the referee as a credit against
the purchase price. The District Judge disallowed it
without writing an opinion. The certificate of the referee set forth the facts; and the parties stipulated that
the " certificate contains all of the facts necessary to a
clear understanding of the issue made on appeal to the
Circuit Court" of Appeals. That court affirmed the
judgment, 21 F. (2d) 965. This Court granted a writ of
certiorari, 276 U. S. 610. Whether disallowance of the
credit for attorney's fees was error is the sole question
for decision.

153

Opinion of the Court.

Under § 67 of the Bankruptcy Act the trustee takes
property subject to valid liens existing at the time of the
institution of the bankruptcy proceedings. The Mortgage Company makes no contention that the judgment
in the state court establishes as res judicata either the
claim for attorney's fees or the existence of the lien
therefor. It concedes that by no action in the state
court, and by no act of the Mortgage Company, could
a lien be attached to the property after it had passed to
the trustee, see Murphy v. Hofman Co., 211 U. S. 562;
and that the bankruptcy court must determine for itself
whether a lien exists and the amount of the indebtedness
secured thereby. See Hebert v. Crawford, 228 U. S. 204;
Chicago Board of Trade v. Johnson, 264 U. S. 1, 11. The
proceedings in the state court are relied upon merely to
show compliance with the condition which § 4252 of the
Georgia Code makes a prerequisite to the enforcement of
any contract to pay attorney's fees. See Stone v. Marshall & Co., '137 Ga. 544; Turner v. Peacock, 153 Ga.
870, 879.
The provision of the Georgia Code is this: "Obligations
to pay attorney's fees upon any note or other evidence of
indebtedness, in addition to the rate of interest specified
therein, are void, and no court shall enforce such agreement to pay attorney's fees, unless the debtor shall fail
to pay such debt on or before the return day of the court
to which suit is brought for the collection of the same:
Provided, the holder of the obligation sued upon, his
agent, or attorney notifies the defendant in writing, ten
days before suit is brought, of his intention to bring suit,
and also the term of the court to which suit will be
brought." The validity of the lien claimed by the Mortgage Company for attorney's fees must be determined
by the law of Georgia; for the contract was there made
and was secured by real estate there situate. Humphrey

v. Tatman, 198 U. S. 91. See Benedict v. Ratner, 268 U.
S. 353, 359. The construction of the contract for attorney's fees presents, likewise, a question of local law. See
Farmers Bank v. Fed. Reserve Bank, 262 U. S. 649, 660.
Whether the liability is, under the circumstances, enforceable against the proceeds of the sale raises federal questions peculiar to the law of bankruptcy. The character
of the obligation to pay attorney's fees presents no obstacle to enforcing it in bankruptcy, either as a provable
claim or by way of a lien upon specific property. The
obligation is held to be enforceable by action in personam
in the federal courts for Georgia, Perry v. John Hancock
Life Insurance Co., 2 F. (2d) 250.
The Mortgage Company contends that, although the
collection of the note was made not through the suit in
the state court, but through the uncontested sale in the
bankruptcy court, it should be deemed a collection "by
law or through an attorney" within the meaning of the
contract. Many decisions of the courts of the State lend
support to that contention. They hold that attorney's
fees are recoverable, not like costs as an incident of the
suit, but as a part of the principal debt; 1 that by the
giving of notice of intention to sue, the commencement
of the suit and the failure of the debtor to pay on or
before the return day, a vested right arises which a later
payment of the debt could not affect; 2 that the liability
for attorney's fees is not dependent upon the collection
having been made through a suit brought in compliance
with the Code; I and that it may be enforced against the

land held as security; although the debtor has become insolvent, McCall v. Herring, 116 Ga. 235, 238-239; or the
property has passed to an administrator, Harrisv. Powers,
129 Ga. 74; or to a receiver, Guarantee Trust and Banking
Co. v. American National Bank, 15 Ga. App. 778, 782784.' The trustee does not question that the Hanson
Company became personally liable for the attorney's fees,
despite the proceedings taken in bankruptcy. His objections go only to the enforcement of the liability against
the proceeds of the property sold.
First. The trustee contends that the credit for the
attorney's fees was precluded by provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. He insists that, at the time of the adjudication, the liability was contingent, since at the time there
had not been any default; and under § 63 of the Bankruptcy Act a contingent claim is not provable.5 But the
Mortgage Company does not seek to prove the claim in
bankruptcy. It asks to have it allowed as a part of the
principal debt, which is secured by a lien upon the property sold. The federal courts for Georgia have, in a series
of cases, refused to permit this to be done, on the ground
that the liability was contingent at the time of the adjudiIn Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Pattillo, 37 Ga. App. 398,
it was held that the holder of a secured note providing for attorney's
fees might, at the same time, sue at law in personam and proceed to
foreclose under a power of sale; and, that if the debt was not paid
before the return day of the suit, he might retain the attorney's fees
from the proceeds of a sale made under the power before entry of the
judgment. It is only when the default in payment was due to the
creditor's failure to perform a duty to realize upon collateral held
that the right to attorney's fees is denied. Compare Rylee v. Bank of
Statham, 7 Ga. App. 489, 495-498.
5For cases to that effect involving similar contracts for attorney's
fees under the laws of other States see: In re Roche, 101 Fed. 956
(Texas); In re Jenkins, 192 Fed. 1000 (So. Car.); British & American Mortgage Co. v. Stuart, 210 Fed. 425, 430 (Ala.). Compare

cation. See In re Weiland, 197 Fed. 116; In re Ledbetter,
267 Fed. 893; In re Hotel Equipment Co., 297 Fed. 842,
845; In re Stamps, 300 Fed. 162. Compare In re Gimbel,
294 Fed. 883. We find nothing in the Bankruptcy Act to
justify such a refusal. The lien was not inchoate at the
time of the adjudication. It had already become perfect
when the principal note and the loan deed securing it
were given. Property subject to a lien to secure a liability
still contingent at the time of bankruptcy is not discharged from the lien by the adjudication. The secured
obligation survives; and if it is that of a third person is
usually unaffected by the bankruptcy. When by the
happening of the event the contingent liability becomes
absolute, the lien becomes enforceable " though this occurs
after the adjudication.
Second. The trustee contends that allowance of the
credit is barred by § 67d, because the liability for attorney's fees not having become absolute until after the
adjudication, is excluded by the provision which allows
outstanding liens" to the extent of such present consideration only." The contention has support in In re Mobile
Chair Co., 245 Fed. 211.' But it was rejected, and we
think properly, in In re Rosenblatt, 299 Fed. 771. The
contingent obligation to pay attorney's fees was a part of
the original transaction. The consideration for the lien
was not the attorney's services, but the $90,000 advanced
by the Mortgage Company; and this was a present consideration. See Bank of Lumpkin v. Farmers Bank, 35
Ga. App. 340.
Third. The trustee contends that under the Bankruptcy Act the claim must be disallowed, because, by the

Opinion of th Court.

Georgia Code, the contract was void unless and until.the
statutory condition had been complied with; that, consequently, at the time of the adjudication, no valid contract existed; and that the bankrupt's estate can not be
affected by a validation, equivalent to the making of a
wholly new contract, occurring thereafter. This seems
to be the view taken by the federal courts for Georgia.
See In re Stamps, 300 Fed. 162, 164. The question depends primarily upon the construction of § 4252 of the
Georgia Code, and thus primarily upon the local law.
The language of the statute lends some color to the
trustee's contention. No case in a court of the State has
been called to our attention in which consideration of this
contention was had. Those which discuss the significance
of the word "void," as used in this section, throw little
light upon it.8 Despite the language employed, we are of
opinion that the Legislature did not contemplate validation of a void contract, but merely added a statutory condition to the written contract to pay attorney's fees.
Fourth. Two further possible objections to the allowance of the attorney's fees are suggested. The first is lack
of notice to the trustee of the action of the Mortgage
Company which resulted in the judgment in the state
court recovered against the Hanson Company. The principal note was payable in 1930, with a provision for acceleration in case of default. The Mortgage Company's
election to declare it immediately due, for default in payment of the interest coupon, was exercised after it had
been made a party to the trustee's application for leave
to sell-a proceeding which would presumably result in
payment of the debt. The referee did not find whether
8 Compare the statement in Johnson v. Globe Co., 11 Ga. App. 485,
that prior to notice the right to attorney's fees is "embryonic only"
with that in Mount Vernon Bank v. Gibbs, 1 Ga. App. 662, 666, that
upon payment before return day "the obligation to pay attorney's
fees becomes void."

278 U. S.

or not the Mortgage Company gave the trustee notice of
its election to accelerate the maturity of the principal; or
notice that the suit had been brought. The Mortgage
Company then knew that the bankrupt had agreed with
the Hanson Company to pay the note and that the property had become primarily liable for the debt. If it
failed to give the trustee notice of the election and of the
intention to bring suit, we think that it is not entitled to
the credit for attorney's fees. For, if he had been notified,
the trustee might have arranged to pay the note on or
before the return day of the suit against the Hanson
Company. The purpose of the Georgia statute is clear.
It is to protect the debtor, in spite of default, from any
liability for attorney's fees, un4ess he fails to pay after
the lapse of the ten days from receiving notice of intention to sue and such further time as must intervene between the commencement of the suit and the return day.
Harris v. Powers, 129 Ga. 74, 88; Edenfield v. Bank of
Millen, 7 Ga. App. 645, 648. The Legislature cannot
have intended that the creditor should be able to impose
the additional liability for attorney's fees, without giving
to the real debtor the notice and opportunity to pay which
the statute contemplated that a debtor should have.
This objection also involves primarily a question of local
law; and no decision directly in point has been found.
But decisions applying the Georgia statute to somewhat
similar situations support this conclusion.'
Fifth. The remaining suggested objection is this: The
trustee asserts that, at the time of the commencement of
the suit against the Hanson Company, it was absolutely
insolvent and without assets; and that the sole purpose of
bringing the suit against it was to increase, by the amount
of the attorney's fees, the claim payable in bankruptcy

Opinion of the Court.

under the lien. It is settled that the mere fact of the
debtor's insolvency under the state law does not prohibit
the rendering of a judgment for attorney's fees. "Such a
condition," says the court in Harrisv. Powers, 129 Ga. 74,
86, "may make it more difficult, and sometimes impossible, for a creditor to realize upon his judgment; but
he is not debarred from the privilege of obtaining it."
The case at bar presents, however, additional facts. It is
asserted that the suit against the Hanson Company was
brought, not for the purpose of collecting the debt, but
solely for the purpose of enhancing the amount which was
obtainable without suit, through the lien upon the proceeds of the property. If this is true, the statutory provision designed for the protection of the debtor was employed solely as a means of oppression. We will not assume, in the absence of a decision by a Georgia court, that
the Legislature intended to permit such use.
Neither of the two objections to the allowance of the
credit last discussed appear to have been considered by
the referee or by either of the lower courts. Nor does
the certificate of the referee contain the specific findings of
fact necessary to support either of them. The Court of
Appeals rests its .affirmance of the judgment denying the
credit for attorney's fees upon provisions of the Bankruptcy Act which we hold are not applicable, or upon a
construction of the Georgia statute which we deem erroneous. Under these circumstances, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed with directions to
remand the case to the District Court. But the District
Court shall be directed to treat the stipulation concerning
the certificate as failing to include elements essential to a
final adjudication; to determine whether or not either of
these two objections, which we hold meritorious if sustained by the facts, is so sustained; and if so sustained,
the credit for attorney's fees shall be disallowed. If the

No. 59. Argued October 26, 1928.-Decided January 2, 1929.
1. When, in a common law suit in a District Court, the issues have
been referred to a referee in accord with the local practice by consent of parties, and the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of
law have been approved and adopted by that court, the appellate
court may examine the findings and determine whether they support
the judgment. Rev. Stats. § 649. P. 163.
2. A bankruptcy rule of a District Court forbidding trustees in bankruptcy to retain as their attorney the attorney for creditors of the
bankrupt, is valid and has the force of law. Pp. 165-169.
3. A contract between an attorney for trustees in bankruptcy and an
attorney for creditors whereby the compensation to be allowed the
former by the court for his services for the trustees shall be shared
with the latter and such services shall be performed under the
latter's supervision, is contrary to public policy and professional
ethics, and is void, even though there was. no actual fraud and the
results were beneficial to the estate. Pp. 167, 171.
4. Upon review of a judgment recovered on such a contract by the
attorney who had acted for creditors against the one who had
acted for the trustees in bankruptcy, this Court can only reverse
the judgment and direct a dismissal of the action, leaving the
successful pariy to restore the fees in controversy to the bankrupt estate by appropriate steps in the bankruptcy court. P. 174.
