CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 59. Argued October 26, 1928.-Decided January 2, 1929.
1. When, in a common law suit in a District Court, the issues have
been referred to a referee in accord with the local practice by consent of parties, and the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of
law have been approved and adopted by that court, the appellate
court may examine the findings and determine whether they support
the judgment. Rev. Stats. § 649. P. 163.
2. A bankruptcy rule of a District Court forbidding trustees in bankruptcy to retain as their attorney the attorney for creditors of the
bankrupt, is valid and has the force of law. Pp. 165-169.
3. A contract between an attorney for trustees in bankruptcy and an
attorney for creditors whereby the compensation to be allowed the
former by the court for his services for the trustees shall be shared
with the latter and such services shall be performed under the
latter's supervision, is contrary to public policy and professional
ethics, and is void, even though there was. no actual fraud and the
results were beneficial to the estate. Pp. 167, 171.
4. Upon review of a judgment recovered on such a contract by the
attorney who had acted for creditors against the one who had
acted for the trustees in bankruptcy, this Court can only reverse
the judgment and direct a dismissal of the action, leaving the
successful pariy to restore the fees in controversy to the bankrupt estate by appropriate steps in the bankruptcy court. P. 174.

Opinion of the Court.

CERTIORARI,

276 U. S. 613, to a judgment of the Cir-

cuit Court of Appeals affirming a judgment recovered
against Well and Thorp on their contract with Untermyer. The contract provided that the compensation to
be received by Weil and Thorp as attorneys for the
trustees in a bankruptcy proceeding should be enjoyed in
part by Untermyer and that their services as such attorneys should be performed under his supervision. The
contract had been assigned by Untermyer to Neary.
Mr. A. Leo Weil, with whom Messrs. J. G. Milburn, Jr.,
and Louis Salant were on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Louis Marshall for respondent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In May, 1921, Neary, a citizen of New York-assignee
of Samuel Untermyer and acting for him-brought suit
in the Supreme Court of that State for more than $70,000,
against A. Leo Weil and Charles M. Thorp, citizens of
Pennsylvania. The defendants removed the cause to the
District Court for the Southern District of New York, on
the ground of diverse citizenship. In oral argument it was
conceded that Untermyer is the real party in interest as
plaintiff, so we shall hereinafter refer to him as such.
By his complaint, amended by leave of court to conform
to the evidence, Untermyer alleged that he had been retained as attorney and counsel for many creditors of one
Josiah V. Thompson, a Pennsylvania banker and coal
operator, to collect indebtedness amounting to millions of
dollars. To that end Untermyer retained the defendants,
Weil and Thorp, of Pittsburgh, to conduct bankruptcy
proceedings under his supervision, upon an agreement that
they were to accept $5,000 in full payment for their services. Such proceedings were accordingly instituted against

278 U. S.

Thompson on the petition of three creditors in the District Court of the United States for the Western District
of Pennsylvania and he was adjudicated a bankrupt.
Trustees were chosen and Weil and Thorp were selected
as their counsel.
Plaintiff's complaint avers that because of complications
which arose it was thereafter agreed that the compensation of the defendants for services in the bankruptcy proceedings should not be limited as stipulated, and that the
plaintiff and his firm, Guggenheimer, Untermyer & Marshall, should collaborate with the defendants under the
supervision of the plaintiff in the performance of services
to the trustees. Also that the defendants should retain,
out of allowances eventually made by the bankruptcy court
in payment for their services, such sum as the plaintiff
considered just and equitable, the remainder to be paid
to Untermyer himself. Pursuant to this agreement the
defendants continued to render services in the bankruptcy
proceedings under the general supervision of the plaintiff,
for which seven allowances were made and paid to them
out of the bankrupt estate, from July 18, 1919, to May 10,
1924. The complaint further alleges that, in pursuance
of the contract, the plaintiff fixed a fair and reasonable
division between plaintiff and defendants but that they
refused to pay the plaintiff the sums claimed under that
division.
Weil and Thorp filed separate answers. They denied
that there was any agreement, express or implied, between
the plaintiff and them regarding the performance of services after appointment of the trustees in bankruptcy, or
regarding the compensation for services performed by
them thereafter. They admitted receipt of the allowances
made to them by the court, but alleged that the services
rendered after their designation and confirmation as general counsel to the trustees were rendered in collaboration with other counsel and not in collaboration with or

WEIL v. NEARY.
160

Opinion of the Court.

under the direction of the plaintiff or his firm; also that
any services rendered by the plaintiff and his firm were
rendered as counsel to the creditors' committee and not
otherwise. They further said that any such agreement or
understanding as that alleged by plaintiff would have been
unprofessional, contrary to public policy, illegal and void.
There was no jury. The case was referred to a referee
as under the New York Practice Act, who concluded that
Weil and Thorp were jointly and severally indebted to
the plaintiff in the sum of $57,064, with interest from November 15, 1920. A judgment accordingly was directed.
Pursuant to a written stipulation signed and filed by the
parties the court ordered:
" That the trial of the above entitled action be and the
same hereby is referred to Allen Wardwell, Esq., as Referee, to hear, try and determine the same, with all the
powers to act and rule upon the said trial possessed by the
Court."
Requests for findings were submitted to the referee by
both sides. He marked his rejection,, modification or approval of each, and filed a report of his findings of fact
and conclusions of law. All were approved and adopted
by the court. A bill of exceptions, prepared by the defendants, was not allowed because tendered out of time.
In this situation the defendants concede that they are
bound by the findings.
The plaintiff contends that this Court may not examine
the findings to determine whether they support the judgment, and he relies on Campbell v. United States, 224
U. S. 99. That was a common law case in a District
Court at a time when no provision for waiver of a jury
or for findings of fact by such court had been made by
statute. Since then, §§ 649 and 700 of the Revised Statutes have been extended to District Courts. Now under
§ 649 if in a common law suit in a District Court the parties consent to refer the issues in accord with local practice

to a referee to make findings of fact and report conclusions
of law thereon which the court approves and adopts, the
appellate court may examine the findings and determine
whether they support the judgment. Shipman v. Straitsville Mining Co., 158 U. S. 356, 361; Chicago, Milwaukee
& St. Paul Ry. v. Clark, 178 U. S. 353, 364; Boogher v. Insurance Co., 103 U. S. 90, 97; Paine v. Central Vermont
R. R., 118 U. S. 152, 158; David Lupton's Sons Co. v Auto
Club of America, 225 U. S. 489, 493.
A summary of the findings follows:
In 1915, Untermyer was retained as attorney for from
90 to 95 per cent. of the creditors of Thompson to collect
his indebtedness out of his property, amounting to many
million dollars. The affairs were greatly involved, and it
was agreed among the creditors that the debtor's extensive
properties should be conserved so that they might be applied equitably to the payment of the claims. In January, 1915, application was made to a state court in Pennsylvania for receivers, and they were appointed, and this
held the estate together. But when the case was carried
to the Supreme Court of the State on error, the receivership was set aside, on the ground that it had been erroneously created. The defendants, Weil and Thorp, had no
interest in or connection with Thompson, his estate or his
creditors until after the close of the receivership, when,
in August, 1917, Untermyer employed Weil and Thorp
to secure the adjudication of Thompson as a bankrupt,
and retained the firm to initiate and carry through the
proceedings under his supervision, fixing their compensation at $5,000. This was accepted, and accordingly on the
petition of three of the creditors of Thompson, on September 10, 1917, he was adjudicated a bankrupt. Weil and
Thorp, after their employment by Untermyer and before the bankruptcy, had helped in the effort to sell the
properties under several plans, one of them called the
Young plan, with the hope that all the properties could

WEIL v. NEARY.
160

Opinion of the Court.

be sold; but the plans as such failed except that there
was carved out of the Young plan the sale of what was
called the Frick property.
At a meeting of the creditors, trustees were selected on
October 17, 1917, and their appointment was duly confirmed on the 18th. The defendants, Weil and Thorp,
were, on October 18th, elected general counsel for the
trustees upon their individual certifications in writing that
they did not represent any interests which would in any
way be antagonistic or adverse in the event that they were
so employed. Untermyer, who had appeared previously
in the record as counsel for the committee of creditors, was
not elected counsel for the trustees and did not so certify.
The certificate was filed by Weil and Thorp in accord with
Rule 5 of the Rules of Bankruptcy of the District Court of
the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania:
"Attorney for the Estate and His Duties. Unless specially authorized by the court, receivers and trustees in
bankruptcy shall not retain as -their attorney, the attorney
of the bankrupt, of the petitioning creditors, of the person
applying for the appointment of a receiver, or of any creditor, and trustees shall not retain as their attorney any
attorney who has obtained proxies or voted upon the election of such trustees, or who is an attorney for persons
holding such proxies." '
Immediately after the appointment of the trustees and
their counsel, they proceeded to conclude the Frick sale.
Its substantial terms had been negotiated by Untermyer
as counsel for the creditors' committee prior to the bankruptcy. On closing it a written application signed by
Weil, Thorp and Untermyer, was made to the bankruptcy
court for the payment out of the proceeds of separate and
exact compensation to Weil and Thorp, to certain associate counsel for the trustees and to Untermyer. This was
subsequently approved by the court. The expected sale

Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

of the rest of the Thompson property under the Young
option was never consummated, and the expected composition in the bankruptcy did not take place.
The affairs of the Thompson estate were very complicated, and Untermyer was the person most conversant
with their legal aspect. The trustees when selecting defendants as their counsel realized that they had been counsel for the committee of creditors under Untermyer.
It had become apparent that the defendants had to perform services in the settlement of the estate which exceeded those originally thought to be necessary. Thereupon the contract was made between Weil and Thorp on
the one hand, and Untermyer on the other, which is set
forth in the amended bill of complaint, and on which this
suit was brought. The defendants continued to render
services under the general supervision and with the active
assistance and collaboration of Untermyer and his firm.
The trustees realized large sums for the benefit of
creditors.
Allowances totalling more than $142,000 were made in
the bankruptcy proceedings and paid to the defendants as
follows:
September 3, 1918, July 2, 1919, and July 1, 1919 .........
June 1, 1920 ...........................................

October 27, 1920 .......................................

$30,500
45,466

68,093

On being informed of these payments, Untermyer, on
November 15, 1920, pursuant to the agreement decided
that of the total sum so received the defendants should retain 60 per cent., and pay the remaining 40 per cent. to
him. The defendants were duly notified of this decision,
but refused to pay Untermyer any part of such receipts.
On November 30, 1920, the firm of Weil and Thorp was
dissolved. Weil succeeded as counsel in the bankruptcy
proceedings, and further allowances were made to him,
$21,000 on May 10, 1924, and later $23,000. Although 40
per cent. of these were claimed by Untermyer, the referee

WEIL v. NEARY.
160

Opinion of the Court.

did not allow them. Untermyer had made no determination as to their division.
The referee held that the contract between Untermyer
and the defendants was limited to the preservation of the
estate and came to an end with the final disposition of
the properties by what was called the Piedmont sales and
did not apply to fees allowed Weil for services rendered
in the general administration of the estate, for which the
allowances of $21,000 and $23,000 had been made. Also
that the interests of the creditors represented by Untermyer were identical with those of the general creditors.
Upon the facts so found we are of opinion that the contract sued on is clearly contrary to public policy and does
not sustain the challenged judgment.
It is contended that in cases where a contract is attacked
because contrary to public policy, the burden of proof is
upon those who claim illegality, and that in such cases the
principle res magis valeat quam pereat applies. Hobbs v.
McLean, 117 U. S. 567; Valdes v. Larrinaga,233 U. S. 705,
709; Baltimore & Ohio S. W. Ry. v. Voigt, 176 U. S. 498;
Steele v. Drummond, 275 U. S. 199; 204, 206; Canal Co. v.

v. Townsend, 24 N. Y. 57; Ormes-v. Dauchy, 82 N. Y. 443;
Shedlinsky v. Budweiser Brewing Co., 163 N. Y. 437;
Lorillard v. Clyde, 86 N. Y. 384, 387. These cases state
with force the necessity for maintaining the right of freedom of contract and the objections to lightly interfering
therewith. But generally they turn on the construction
of words and on the rule that the presumption, where
there is an ambiguity, should be in favor of validity.
They have little value here. There is no doubt of the
meaning of the contract.
Untermyer was counsel for many creditors. He was
forbidden by Rule No. 5 before quoted to become counsel
for the trustees unless specially authorized by the court.
He represented 90 per cent. or more of the general creditors.

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

There is no presumption or finding that the bankruptcy
court especially authorized Untermyer to serve as counsel
for the trustees or knew that the allowances to Weil were
in part for Untermyer, or that he was to divide them between Weil and himself. Had there been evidence that
the court had such knowledge certainly the referee would
have found it. The point was crucial. Nor is it strange
that there was no such evidence. Untermyer's relations
to the bankruptcy and to the creditors were such that it
would have been difficult for the court to learn or infer
that he had changed his activities from work for the creditors to that of the trustees without direct announcement
of the change.
Many abuses have occurred in the bankruptcy practice
and none is more frequent than that by which the attorney for petitioning creditors becomes counsel for the trustees subsequently appointed. This mingling of interests,
frequently conflicting, is generally regarded by courts as
working to the detriment of one of the parties and to the
undue advantage of another. Experience has shown the
wisdom and necessity of separating the function and obligation of counsel by forbidding the employment in different interests of the same person. In this way only may
the court be advised how conflicting interests are represented. Rule No. 5 was adopted as an obvious safeguard.
The danger of giving entire freedom of selection of counsel
to the trustees lies in the temptation of the attorney for
some creditors when he becomes counsel for the trustees,
to use his function as representative of all the creditors,
unjustly to favor or oppose particular creditors or to induce the trustees to do so. Rule 5 leaves it to the court
to waive the restriction if with knowledge of the particular
circumstances it appears safe so to do, but if the court does
not know of a proposed departure, it has no means of protecting creditors from the danger the rule is intended to
avoid.

WEIL v. NEARY.
160

Opinion of the Court.

The validity and effect of Rule 5 came before the Circuit
Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit in W. J. Robertson's
Case, 4 F. (2d) 248. One Kaufman, as counsel for certain
creditors, had filed an involuntary petition for them. The
receiver presented a petition to the referee for the appointment of Kaufman as his attorney. On the back of the
petition there later appeared, written in lead pencil, the
word "Refused." Apparently in ignorance of the refusal,
Kaufman acted for the receiver without objection from
anyone. He filed several papers in behalf of the receiver,
and obtained orders on some of them, and in all these it
was recited that Kaufman was the attorney of the receiver. When a fee of $300 was asked for Kaufman, it was
disallowed by the referee. On appeal the District Court
affirmed the order. Of Rule 5, now under consideration,
the Circuit Court of Appeals said [p. 249]:
"The court is vested with authority to make this rule.
Section 2 (15) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (Comp. St.
§ 9586). It seems to us both wise and reasonable. ...
While on general principles the laborer is worthy of his
hire, and counsel should be paid a reasonable fee for services rendered, yet the apparent retention here was a plain
violation of the rule of court. It was the duty of the receiver to comply with the rules of court. Both he and the
petitioner ar6 attorneys and knew the rule. Otherwise a
petition for authority to retain Mr. Kaufman would not
have been presented. If the receiver and his counsel chose
to act in disregard of, or in opposition to, the rule, or upon
an unwarranted assumption that authority had been or
would be given, they are responsible for the consequences
of the refusal of authority."
It is clear that a rule of court thus authorized and made
has the force of law. Rio Grande IrrigationCompany v.

kinson v. Walker, 292 Fed. 395, State v. Lankford, 158
Ind. 34; Advance Veneer Lumber Co. v. Hornaday, 49 Ind.
App. 83.
Early in the bankruptcy proceedings on the conclusion
of the Frick sale the court allowed specific compensation
to the defendants, to certain associate counsel for the
trustees, and to Untermyer. This, it is suggested, shows
the court knew Untermyer was receiving compensation for
services to the trustees and approved such action. But
this incident has no such significance. It merely indicates
that the court approved an agreement between counsel
to pay the expenses of the trust incurred largely before
the bankruptcy, of which its indebtedness for Untermyer's
services in making the Frick sale, while he was acting as
counsel for the committee of creditors, was properly one.
It is entirely consistent with subsequent want of information by the court that Untermyer was serving as counsel
for the trustees.
The referee suggests that failure by Weil or Untermyer
to advise the court of the contract sued on ought not to
invalidate it, because if either had called attention to the
arrangement there would have been no objection by the
court. We quote from his opinion:
"The only objection that I can see to the contract was
that it does not seem in terms to have been made known
to the Court or tolthe Referee, but there is no reason to
suppose that had the plaintiff or the defendant, called the
attention of the Court to the arrangement as made, there
would have been any objection to the plaintiff sharing in
these fees. Certainly the Court's or the Referee's ignorance of the agreement did not tend to increase the allowances to counsel, nor is there anything but commendation by the Referee and the Court for the services rendered to the estate by counsel, in which the plaintiff bore
a considerable part, whether or not that fact was known
to the Court. In any event, it does not seem to me that

WEIL v. NEARY.
160

171

Opinion of the Court.

the defendants can now contend that the failure to bring
the matter to the attention of the Court on subsequent
allowances as they did on the Frick sale can be put forward to defeat the plaintiff's contention."
We can not concur in this view. We find no reason for
assuming that the District Court would not have made
serious objection to the contract had it known its terms.
Such an assumption would be unfair to the court. Certainly it was not for another court to determine whether
the situation justified a waiver of the rule. The referee
and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that it was the duty
of Weil to advise the court of the contract. We think it
was no more the obligation of Weil than it was of Untermyer. Both were engaging in the same violation of the
rule.
There were two issues in the present case. One was
whether the contract sued on was made. Weil said it was
not. Untermyer said it was, and the referee has found
with him. The other issue was whether the agreement
between Untermyer and Weil was contrary to public policy. The referee found that both participated in the
breach of the rule. Neither can be relieved from the resulting invalidity of the contract by charging that the
other ought to have told the court of it.
The controversy is not an ordinary one between the two
parties. The issue concerns the action of both Untermyer
and Weil towards the bankruptcy court. A question of
public policy is presented-not a mere adjudication of
adversary rights between the two parties.
Another feature of the contract that calls for condemnation is the provision that Untermyer shall have power to
supervise and direct Weil in the rendition of service to
the trustees. Of this, the court certainly could know
nothing. Weil's duty was to exercise his independent
judgment in respect of his duties. He could not abdicate
to Untermyer. The contract made the latter dominus

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

278 U. S.

litis, and operated as an intolerable imposition on the
judge of the bankruptcy court. This was contrary to
public policy; it was in direct conflict with the professional
and official duty of Weil as an officer of the bankruptcy
court and counsel for the trustees.
Still another reason for condemnation of this contract
is the provision under which the compensation allowed to
Weil was to be divided by Untermyer between the two.
The court made allowances to Weil without knowledge that
a part of them was to be received and enjoyed by Untermyer. It necessarily assumed that allowances were being
made to Weil and no one else. Instead of this they really
were made to Untermyer, the attorney for creditors, for
such division between Weil and himself as he might determine. The evils to which such a practice might lead
are manifest. It would, in effect, take from the court the
judicial function and vest it in an unrecognized stranger.
Both the Circuit Court of Appeals and the referee held
that this provision of the contract would not tend to increase the allowance to counsel. We are unable to follow
the argument. Certainly there would be a temptation to
both Untermyer and Weil to seek so to increase the allowance as to secure a generous provision for both. Motive
for excessive allowance could hardly be more direct.
For the protection of the estate and itself the bankruptcy court must rely largely on counsel for the trustees,
as also on counsel for creditors, to keep watch against unjust charges. Under this contract there would be an obvious incentive for counsel to do otherwise.
Complaints of those interested in the honest and effective administration of the bankruptcy law led this court
three years ago to adopt several new rules in respect to the
compensation of attorneys, receivers and trustees. Rule
42 requires that where an attorney applies for compensation from a bankrupt estate he shall file a petition under

WEIL v. NEARY.
160

Opinion of the Court.

oath setting forth a full and detailed statement of his services, and the amount claimed therefor, to be accompanied
by an affidavit of the applicant that no agreement has been
made, directly or indirectly, and that no understanding
exists, for a division of fees between the applicant, the receiver, the trustee, the bankrupt or the attorney of any of
them; and the rule directs that no allowance of compensation shall be made in the absence of such petition and
affidavit. These rules were adopted after the contract in
this case was made, and therefore have no direct application here. But they clearly show the previous abuses
which it was hoped to avoid by their adoption, and explain the necessity and reason for the earlier adoption of
Rule 5, in the Western District of Pennsylvania, which
does apply to the contract here and renders it illegal.
We have specially referred to Rule 5, under which the
illegality of the contract is clear, but we are not to be
understood as holding that without the rule the transaction under consideration would not be contrary to public
policy and void.
The chief argument that is pressed upon us to declare
the contract valid and to sustain the judgment based upon
it, is the success with which the plaintiff is found to have
worked out a useful settlement of the estate for the benefit
of the creditors, and the absence of any finding or showing
that there was actual fraud. But this is not a sufficient
answer to the charge of illegality. The contract is contrary to public policy-plainly so. What is struck at in
the refusal to enforce contracts of this kind is not only
actual evil results but their tendency to evil in other cases.
Even if the ultimate results in the management of the
Thompson estate were good, that could be no excuse for
a contract plainly illegal, because tending to produce the
recognized abuses which follow fraud and disloyalty by
agents and trustees. Enforcement of such contracts when

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

278 U. S.

actual evil does not follow would destroy the safeguards
of the law and lessen the prevention of abuses. Tool Co.
v. Norris, 2 Wall. 45; Woodstock Iron Co. v. Richmond
Extension Co., 129 U. S. 643; Oscanyan v. Arms Co., 103
U. S. 261; Meguire v. Corwine, 101 U. S. 108; Connors v.
Connolly, 86 Conn. 641; Richardson v. Crandall,48 N. Y.
348; Palmbaum v. Magulsky, 217 Mass. 306, 308. But
we must not be understood as implying that no harm resulted to the Thompson estate or its creditors.
We conclude that the contract set up by Untermyer in
the amended petition, framed to meet the evidence, is in
violation of public policy and professional ethics. Such
a transaction between counsel calls for judicial condemnation. This requires a reversal of the judgment of the
court below.
Where a party seeks to enforce a contract and it is found
to be invalid because contrary to public policy, the usual
result is that the court dismisses the action and leaves
the parties as it finds them. Weil, the defendant appearing pro se, announced to us in open court that he would
be entirely content with any disposition of the amount
sued for, provided it was not appropriated to the satisfaction of a contract deemed plainly illegal and void, and
the making of which he denied. He tendered his consent
to any disposition of the funds in controversy which this
Court might regard as proper. The difficulty with that
proposal is the want of power in this case to make a disposition of the funds with due regard to the bankruptcy
proceeding which is not now before this Court. We therefore must reverse the judgment below and direct a dismissal of the action, leaving Weil to take such steps as
may be appropriate to enable the bankruptcy court to
pass the funds in controversy to the creditors.
Judgment reversed.
