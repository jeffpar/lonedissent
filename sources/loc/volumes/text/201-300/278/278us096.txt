HUNT, GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA, ET AL. v. UNITED
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA.
No. 44.

Argued October 23, 1928.-Decided November 19, 1928.

1. When the numbers of wild deer on a national forest and game
preserve have increased to such excess that by over-browsing upon
and killing young trees, bushes and forage plants they cause great
injury to the land, it is within the power of the United States to
cause their numbers to be reduced by killing and their carcasses

to be shipped outside the limits of such reserves. P. 100.
2. This power springs from the federal ownership of the lands
affected, and is independent of the game laws of the State in
which they are situate. Id.
3. A direction for such killing and shipment, given by the Secretary
of Agriculture, was within the authority conferred upon him by
Act of Congress. Id.
4. Carcasses and parts of the deer so killed, should be marked before
being taken from the reserves, to show that the dleer were killed
there under authority of the Secretary of Agriculture. P. 101.

joined the Governor, the Game Warden, a county attorney and a sheriff, of the State of Arizona, from arresting
or prosecuting officers and agents of the United States
under the state game laws, for or on account of the killing, possession and transportation of deer under an order
made by the Secretary of Agriculture to protect a National
Forest and Game Preserve from the destructive effects
of over-browsing.
Mr. Earl Anderson, Assistant Attorney General of Arizona, with whom Mr. John W. Murphy, Attorney General, was on the brief, for appellants.
The bill is defective under the rule announced in New
Jersey v. Sargent, 269 U. S. 328. See Georgia v. Stanton,

A court of equity will not grant an injunction to restrain state officers from prosecuting under a state statute, *because there is an adequate remedy at law by
presenting a defense in such prosecutions.
This Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the action
because it is, in fact, a suit against the State. Fitts v.

If the Government may kill deer on the game preserve,
contrary to state game laws, the State would have a right
to prosecute persons for possessing the deer and removing
them from Arizona contrary to those laws. A State may
prosecute a person for the possession of the carcasses of
wild game contrary to the provisions of its laws, although
such game was lawfully taken under the laws of another
State. Ex parte Maier, 103 Cal. 476; New York v. Hesterberg, 211 U. S. 31; State v. Shattuck, 96 Minn. 45.
Even though the United States owns the lands upon
which the deer range, it may not take or kill the deer in
violation of the Arizona game laws. State v. Gallop, 126
N. C. 979; Percy v. Astle, 145 Fed. 53; Smith v. Odell,

The Federal Government has no better rights in the
game preserve than an ordinary citizen has on his private
lands. Light v. United States, 220 U. S. 523; United

State, 141 Tenn. 379.
We concede that under certain conditions or circumstances a property owner may kill game at a time different
from that prescribed by the state game laws. But he
must show that, at the tine of killing, the particular animals killed were injuring or about to injure his property.
Congress has set aside this preserve as a feeding
ground and park for the particular deer which the Government now seeks to slaughter. Act of June 29, 1906,

Opinion of the Court.

That Congress may legislate for the protection of the
public domain, even though that legislation may involve
an exercise of what is known as the police power, is
established. Camfield v. United States, 167 U. S. 518;
Utah Light & Power Co. v. United States, 243 U. S. 389;
McKelvey v. United States, 260 U. S. 353; United States
v. Alford, 274 U. S. 264.
The contention of the appellants that, because of the
game laws of the State of Arizona restricting the killing
of deer, the United States must remain inactive and allow
the forests on its public domain to be seriously damaged,
if not destroyed, is without any support in the decisions
of this Court.
State courts have held that a private proprietor may
kill wild game when necessary to protect his property, and
that state game laws, if construed to prevent it, would be
invalid. Aldrich v. Wright, 53 N. H. 398; State v. Ward,
170 Iowa 185; State v. Burk, 114 Wash. 370. Cf. Barrett
v. State, 220 N. Y. 423.
MR.

JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Kaibab National Forest and the Grand Canyon
National Game Preserve, covering practically the same
area, are situated north of the Colorado River in Arizona.
They were created by proclamations of the President under authority of Congress. During the last few years
deer on these reserves have increased in such large numbers that the forage is insufficient for their subsistence.
The result has been that these deer have greatly injured
the lands in the reserves by over-browsing upon and killing valuable young trees, shrubs, bushes and forage plants.
Thousands of deer have died because of insufficient for.age. Attempts were made under the direction of the
Secretary of Agriculture to remove some of the deer from

the reserves to other lands, but these entirely failed, as
did other means. The district forester, acting under the
direction of the Secretary of Agriculture, proceeded to kill
large numbers of the deer and ship the carcasses outside
the limits of the reserves. That this was necessary to
protect the lands of the United States within the reserves
from serious injury is made clear by the evidence. The
direction given by the Secretary of Agriculture was within
the authority conferred upon him by act of Congress.
And the power of the United States to thus protect its
lands and property does not admit of doubt, Camfield v.
United States, 167 U. S. 518, 525-526; Utah Power &
Light Co. v. United States, 243 U. S. 389, 404; McKelvey
v. United States, 260 U. S. 353, 359; United States v.
Alford, 274 U. S. 264, the game laws or any other statute
of the state to the contrary notwithstanding.
Appellants interfered with these acts of the United
States officials and threatened to arrest and prosecute any
person or persons attempting to kill or possess or transport such deer, under the claim that such officials were
proceeding in violation of the game laws of the State of
Arizona, the observance of which would have so restricted
the number of deer to be killed as to render futile the attempt to protect the reserves. Three persons who had
killed deer under authority of United States officials were
actually arrested. Thereupon suit was brought to enjoin
appellants from continuing or threatening such interference, arrest or prosecution. The court below, after a
trial, found for the United States and entered a decree
in accordance with the prayer of the bill, with the limitation, however, that the decree should not be construed to
permit the licensing of hunters to kill deer within said
reserves in violation of the state game laws. 19 F. (2d)
634.
While the Solicitor General does not concede the authority of the court to make this limitation, he is content

to let the decree stand. We, therefore, pass the matter
without consideration and accept the opinion and decree
below, with the modification that all carcasses of deer and
parts thereof shipped outside the boundaries of the reserves shall be plainly marked by tags or otherwise, in
such manner as the Secretary of Agricuture may by regulations prescribe, to show that the deer were killed under
his authority within the limits of the reserves.
Thus modified the decree is affirmed.

NEW YORK.
ON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS.

No. 16 Original. Argued October 29, 1928.-Decided November 19,
1928.
1. Section 266 of the ludicial Code, which provides that no injunction
restraining the enforcement of any statute of a State by restraining
the action "of any officer of such State" in the enforcement of such
statute shall be granted upon the ground of unconstitutionality of
such statute,. except upon a hearing and determination by a court
composed of three judges, does not apply where the action sought
to be enjoined is that of a municipal officer in performance of local,
as distinguished from state, functions. P. 103.
2. A case has not the force of a precedent on a question which,
though existent in the record, was not raised or considered by the
court. P. 105.
Rule discharged.

UPON RETURN tO a rule issued by this Court to three
judges who had convened as a district court under Jud.
Code, § 266, in an injunction suit, but had dissolved of
their own motion in the belief that the suit was not within
that section. The rule called upon them to show cause
why a writ of mandamus should not issue requiring them
to reconvene and proceed with the suit.
