No. 51.

Argued November 22, 1928.-Decided January 2, 1929.

1. The doctrine that a principal shall be held liable for the fraudulent
representations of his agent made within the scope of the agent's
authority, is not subject to an exception exonerating the principal
where the agent acts with the secret purpose to benefit only himself and without the knowledge or consent of the principal. Friedlander v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co.,. 130 U. S. 146, distinguished and
in part overruled. P. 353.
2. Plaintiff paid a draft attached to an "order notify bill of lading
in reliance upon notice and assurance that the goods had arrived,
given to him by an agent of the defendant railway company whose
duty it was to give such notices of arrival. It turned out
that the draft and bill had been forged by the agent himself and
by him negotiated for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff to
the agent's own advantage. Held that the'railway company was
liable for the deceit. P. 353.
3. Section 22 of the Bills of Lading Act, enlarging the implied authority of agents to issue bills of lading, has no bearing on the present.

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case is here on certiorari, 276 U. S. 612, to review
a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit, 21 F. (2d) 8,83, reversing a judgment for petitioner
of the District Court for southern Georgia.
At the trial by jury it appeared that respondent railway company has terminals for the receipt and delivery
of freight both at Charleston, S. C. and Savannah, Ga.;
that McDonnell was an employee of respondent at its
Savannah office, whose duty it was, and whose continuous practice it had been, to give notice to those engaged
in the cotton trade, including petitioner, a cotton factor
in Savannah, of the arrival of cotton at the Savannah
terminal under " order notify" bills of lading. There
was evidence from which the jury could have found that
on March 19, 1925, McDonnell, so acting, gave petitioner
notice of arrival of a shipment of cotton under a designated order notify bill of lading; that later, on the same
day, a local bank presented to petitioner the described
bill of lading, regular in form and properly endorsed, with
an attached draft on petitioner for $10,000, which petitioner paid in reliance upon the notice of arrival given
by the agent and the apparent regularity of the documents; that after presentation of the draft and before
payment McDonnell had again informed petitioner, in
response to an inquiry, that the cotton described in the
bill of lading had arrived. There was evidence also plainly

GLEASON v. SEABOARD RY.
349

Opinion of the Court.

indicating that petitioner would not have paid the
draft without that assurance. The draft and the bill of
lading, purporting to be issued by respondent at its
Charleston office, eventually proved to have been forged
and negotiated by McDonnell in Charleston, while temporarily absent from his duties in Savannah, and his entire course of conduct with respect to them, including his
false notice to petitioner, was in the successful pursuance
of a scheme to defraud petitioner of the amount paid by
it on the draft.
The second count of petitioner's declaration, and the
only one presently involved, set out a cause of action
in deceit by McDonnell acting as the agent of respondent
in giving the petitioner the false notice, and set up that
the petitioner was induced to pay the draft by the representation that the cotton had arrived. The court, disregarding any question of want of due care on the part
of respondent, instructed the jury that if it found that
the false notice by McDonnell to petitioner was given
within the scope of his authority and that petitioner had
in fact been induced by the false statement to take up
the draft, it should return a verdict for the petitioner.
Judgment on the verdict for petitioner was reversed by
the court of appeals on the ground that an employer is
not liable for the false statements of an agent made solely
to effect a fraudulent design for his own benefit and not
in behalf of the employer or his business, the court saying (p. 884): "Under the general rule prevailing in the
federal courts an employer is not liable for such conduct
of his employee, Friedlanderv. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co.,
130 U. S. 416
"
In the Friedlander case the action was brought to recover for the non-delivery of merchandise, purported to
have been received by the defendant carrier and covered
by a bill of lading issued by its agent, admittedly author27228-29-23

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

278 U. S.

ized to issue bills of lading in the usual course of business.
The bill had been fraudulently issued by the agent for his
own enrichment and the described merchandise had not,
in fact, been received by the defendant or its agent. The
court held that there was no implied authority in the
agent to issue bills of lading for merchandise not actually
received, and that there was consequently no contractual
obligation on the part of the carrier. As the only act
of the agent complained of, the issuance of the bill of
lading, was thus held not to be within the scope of his
authority, that holding was sufficient to dispose of the entire case. To this extent the case has been often cited
and followed. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Nat.
Park Bk., 188 Ala. 109, 119; Roy & Roy v. Northern
Pacific Ry Co., 42 Wash. 572, 576; contra, Bank of Batavia v. New York, etc. R. R. Co., 106 N. Y. 195. But the
court in the Friedlandercase went on to say (p. 425):
f . . . nor is the action maintainable on the ground of
tort. 'The general rule', said Willes, J., in Barwick v.
English Joint Stock Bank, L. R. 2 Ex. 259, 265, ' is that the
master is answerable for every such wrong of the servant
or agent as is committed in the course of the service and
for the master's benefit, though no express command or
privity of the master be proved.' See also Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co., 1 II. & C. 526. The fraud was
in respect to a matter within the scope of Easton's employment or outside of it. It was not within it, for bills
of lading could only be issued for merchandise delivered;
and being without it, the company, which derived and
could derive no benefit from the unauthorized and fraudulent act, cannot be made responsible. British Mutual
Banking Co. v. Charnwood Forest Railway Co., 18 Q. B.
D. 714."
The rule, applied in that case, that the authority of an
agent to issue bills of lading is impliedly conditioned upon
the receipt of the merchandise described in the bill, has

GLEASON v. SEABOARD RY.
349

Opinion of the Court.

now been modified by statute. Section 22 ' of the Federal

Bills of Lading Act, 39 Stat. 542, applicable to bills of
lading of common carriers in interstate and foreign commerce, provides that the carrier, in certain enumerated
cases, shall be liable on a bill so issued, even though the
merchandise is not received by the agent.
But the above quoted passage from that case, taken in
conjunction with other references in the opinion to the
fraudulent conduct of the agent for his own benefit, has
been regarded as authority for the broader rule applied
by the court below, and the present case must turn upon

the sufficiency of the rule thus announced. For there was
here no want of authority in the agent. His power to act
for his principal was not contingent upon any act or omission of another. From the verdict we must take it that
it was his duty unconditionally to answer the inquiry of
petitioner as to the arrival of the goods, and concededly, if
acting within the scope of his employment, the respondent
would have been liable, however flagrant the agent's act,
had it not been tainted by his selfish motive. Nelson Business College v. Lloyd, 60 Ohio St. 448; Aiken v. Holyoke
St. Ry. Co., 184 Mass. 269.
Auten, 68 Ark. 299.

Binghampton Trust Co. v.

The limitation upon the doctrine of respondeat superior
applied by the court below finds little support other than
in the passage quoted and in cases, chiefly in some of the
1Sec. 22. That if a bill of lading has been issued by a carrier or on
his behalf by an agent or employee the scope of whose actual or
apparent authority includes the receiving of goods and issuing of bills
of lading therefor for transportation in commerce among the several
States and with foreign nations, the carrier shall be liable to (a) the
owner of goods covered by a straight bill subject to existing right of
stoppage in transitu or (b) the holder of an order bill, who has given
value in good faith, relying upon the description therein of the goods,
for damages caused by the nonreceipt by the carrier of all or part of
the goods or their failure to correspond with the description thereof
in the bill at the time of its issue.

lower federal courts, purporting to follow it, see Harris,
Irby & Vose v. Allied Compress Co., 6 F. (2d) 7, 9; American Surety Co. v. Pauly, 72 Fed. 470, 482; Dun v. City
Nat'l Bank, 58 Fed. 174, 179; cf. Leachman v. Board of
Supervisors, 124 Va. 616, 624, but in those cases it was not
necessary to the decision. The state courts, including
those of Georgia where the cause of action arose, have
very generally reached the opposite conclusion, holding
that the liability of the principal for the false statement
or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope
of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or
motives. Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' Nat'l
Bank, 78 Ga. 574; McCord v. Western Union, 39 Minn.
181; Havens v. Bank of Tarboro, 132 N. C. 214; Reynolds
v. Witte, 13 S. C. 5, 15; Fifth Ave. Bank v. Forty-second
St., etc. R. R. Co., 137 N. Y. 231; Dougherty v. Wells,
Fargo & Co., 7 Nev. 368. The English courts, after hinting at a departure from the rule as thus stated, British
Mutual Banking Co. v. CharnwoodForest Ry., 18 Q.B. D.
714; cf. Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank, L. R. 2 Ex.
259, 265, have finally reached the same conclusion; Lloyd
v. Grace [1912] A. C. 716.
And we think that the restriction of the vicarious liability of the principal adopted by the court below is supported no more by reason than by authority. Undoubtedly formal logic may find something to criticize in a
rule which fastens on the principal liability for the acts of
his agent, done without the principal's knowledge or consent and to which his own negligence has not contributed.
But few doctrines of the law are more firmly established
or more in harmony with accepted notions of social policy
than that of the liability of the principal without fault of
his own. Shaw, C. J. in Farwell v. Boston and Worcester
RailroadCorporation,4 Metc. 49, 55; Bartonshill Coal Co.
v. Reid, 3 Macq., 266, 283. See Pollock, Torts (1887)
67, 68; Salmond, Jurisprudence, 2d ed. 1907, 381. The

Opinion of the Court.

tendency of modern legislation in employers' liability
and workmen's compensation acts and in the Bills of Lading Act cited, and of judicial decision as well, has been to
enlarge rather than curtail the rule.
Granted the validity and general application of the
rule itself, there would seem to be no more reason for creating an exception to it because of the agent's secret purpose to benefit himself by his breach of duty than in any
other case where his default is actuated by negligence or
sinister motives. In either case the injury to him who
deals with the agent, his relationship and that of the
principal to the agent's wrongful act, and the economic
consequence of it to the principal in the conduct of whose
business the wrong was committed, are .the same.
The arguments in favor of creating such an exception
are equally objections to the rule itself. Holmes, The
Common Law (1882) 231, n. 3. But as we accept and
apply the rule, despite those objections, we can find no
justification for an exception which is inconsistent both
with the rule itself and the underlying policy which has
created and perpetuated it. We think that the Friedlander case should be overruled so far as it supports such
an exception and that the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.
The court below also thought that Congress, by enacting § 22 of the Bills of Lading Act, to which we have referred, impliedly approved the rule now contended for by
legislating on the subject and creating an exception to the
rule, announced in the passage quoted from the Fiedlander
case, instead of abolishing it. But such a rule of statutory construction, whatever its scope and validity, has
no application to the present case. Section 22 deals only
with the former rule that agents having authority to
receive merchandise and issue bills of lading were without implied authority to issue the latter except on receipt
of the merchandise. It enlarged the agent's implied

278 U. S.

authority by imposing a new liability on the principal
for the agent's act in issuing the bill, even though the merchandise was not received. But respondent's liability
here is not predicated on the agent's authority to issue
bills which, so far as appears, he did not have, but upon
his authority to notify petitioner of the arrival or nonarrival of the merchandise which he clearly did have.
Congress, by enlarging, in a bills of lading act, the implied
authority of an agent to issue bills of lading, can hardly
be said to have dealt by implication with a general rule
of liability applicable in other classes of transactions not
involving bills of lading.
