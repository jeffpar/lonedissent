Statement of the Case.

commerce.
Judgment affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

BERWIND-WHITE COAL MINING COMPANY v.
CHICAGO AND ERIE RAILROAD COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE APPELLATE COURT, FIRST DISTRICT, STATE

OF ILLINOIS.
No. 92.

Argued December 3, 1914.-Decided December 14, 1914.

Filing with the Interstate Commerce Commission the book of rules as
to demurrage of the Car Service Association, of which the railroad
is a member, with a statement as to what its rates will be, held, in
this case, to be a compliance with the provisions of the Act to Regulate Commerce requiring filing of tariff sheets, no objection having
been taken as to form, and it appearing that the documents were adequate to give notice and that there was proof of posting.
Although cars billed for reconsignment may not have actually reached
the point named as destination, demurrage may attach for the time
held after reaching the point convenient to the belt line for transfer
where, under usual practice for many years, cars so billed were held
for reconsignment.
171 Ill. App. 302i affirmed.

THE facts, which involve questions of filing tariff sheets
under the Act to Regulate Commerce and the right of the
railroad company to collect demurrage, are stated in the
opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

Mr. Edward W. Rawlins, with whom Mr. William J.
Calhoun and Mr. Will H. Lyford were on the brief, for
defendant in error:
Defendant in error having filed with the Interstate
Commerce Commission its demurrage rules and statement
of charges, was not only entitled, but required to collect
demurrage charges in accordance therewith.
Even though the demurrage rules and charges filed with
the Interstate Commerce Commission were in certain respects informal, yet such fact would not excuse plaintiff in
error from paying the charges in question, as they were
the regular and usual charges for such service.
As to that portion of the demurrage charges which accrued prior to. the Hepburn Amendment, the question of
tariffs is not controlling.
The demurrage charges in question were properly assessed on the cars while they were being held in the yards
at Hammond, as those yards were the regular Chicago
holding yards for carload freight held for reconsignment.
In support of these contentions, see Blackhorse Tobacco
Co. v. Ill. Cent. R. R., 17 I. C. C. 588; Cudahy Packing CO.

The judgment which is under review awarded demur-

Opinion of the Court.

rage on carloads of coal shipped by the plaintiff in error
from West Virginia to Chicago, there to be reconsigned.
(171 Ill. App. 302.) There are only two alleged Federal
contentions:
1. That allowing the demurrage conflicted with the Act
to Regulate Commerce because no tariff on the subject was
filed or published. The fact is that the railroad had complied with the law as to filing tariff sheets and had also long
before the time in question filed a book of rules of the
Chicago Car Service Association, of which it was a member, relating to liability for demurrage and a few days after
had written the Commission a letter stating that the demurrage charge would be one dollar per day. The argu-.
ment is that such documents were not sufficiently formal
to comply with the law and hence afforded no ground for
allowing demurrage. But the contention is without merit.
The documents were received and placed on file by the
Commission without any objection whatever as to their
form and it is certain that as a matter of fact they were
adequate to give notice. Equally without merit is the insistence that there was no proof that the documents were
posted for public inspection. Texas & Pac. Ry. v. Cisco
Oil Mill, 204 U. S. 449; Kansas City So. Ry. v. Albers
Comm. Co., 223 U. S. 573, 594; United States v. Miller, 223
U. S. 599.
2. Conceding that a tariff concerning demurrage was
filed, it is insisted it only authorized demurrage at destination and the cars never reached their destination, but
were held at a place outside of Chicago. The facts are
these: The storage tracks of the railroad for cars billed to
Chicago for reconsignment were at Hammond, Indiana,
a considerable distance from the terminals of the company
nearer the center of the city, but were convenient to the
belt line by which cars could be transferred to any desired
new destination, and the holding on such tracks of cars
consigned as were those in question was in accordance with

a practice which had existed for more than twenty years.
Under these circumstances the contention is so wholly
wanting in foundation as in fact to be frivolous.
Affirmed.

YAZOO & MISSISSIPPI VALLEY RAILROAD COMPANY v. WRIGHT.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 218.

Argued December 2, 1914.-Decided December 14, 1914.

Where there is no contention as to the meaning of the Employers'
Liability Act, this court, in a case where the judgment of the District
Court has been affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, need only
determine whether plain error was committed in relation to the principle of general law involved.
In this case the only error pressed being that the court below held
that there was no assumption of risk by the injured party, and as it
is impossible to deduce any assumption from the facts stated, the
judgment is affirmed.
207 Fed. Rep. 281, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the validity of a judgment for
damages obtained by the administratrix of an employ6 of
a railroad company under the Employers' Liability Act,
are stated in the opinion.

Mr. H. D. Minor, with whom Mr. Charles N. Burch was
on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
As this case involves no violation of any safety appliance
act, the defense of assumption of risk is open as at common
law. Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, 233 U. S. 492; Southern,
Ry. v. Crockett, 234 U. S. 725.
The defense of assumption of risk was duly set up in both
courts below and in the assignments of error in this court.
