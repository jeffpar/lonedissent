COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 18. Argued October 27, 28, 1914.-Decided November 9, 1914.
-Under Rev. Stat., §§ 4952, 4970, as they were before the act of March 4,
1909, every reproduction of a copyrighted work must bear the statutory notice. One notice is not sufficient for several reproductions
on the same sheet, even though the several reproductions make one
harmonious whole.
Although a painting may be patentable as a design, if the owner elects
to copyright he must protect his copyright by repeating the statutory notice on every reproduction thereof.
191 Fed. Rep. 35, affirmed.

facts, which involve the construction of the copyright law as to the statutory notice of copyright upon
reproductions of paintings, are stated in the opinion.

The requirement of separate marking of each integer

In considering the requirement of the statute it should
be construed having in view the character of the property
intended to be protected. Amer. Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister, 207 U. S. 284.
To require a marking that destroys is unreasonable.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is a bill to restrain an alleged infringement of a
copyright under the law as it was before the act of March 4,
1909; c. 320, 35 Stat. 1075; viz. Rev. Stat., §§ 4952,
4970; act of June 18, 1874, c. 301, 18 Stat. 78. The work
alleged to be infringed was described as a painting repre-

senting sprigs of holly, mistletoe and spruce, arranged in
the form of an open cluster having substantially the outline of a square. It was exhibited in court, was a water
color painting in fact, and no doubt might have been
framed and used for the same purposes of pleasure as
other more considerable works of art. But it was so
designed that it could be reproduced in repetitions that
fitted and continued one another side by side and above
and below, and was reproduced in that way with twelve
repetitions upon strips of paper having much the look of
wall paper and intended to be used in covering or wrapping
boxes during the holiday season. Each strip bore a single
notice of copyright. The Circuit Court, assuming that
infringement was established, was of opinion that the
work was a painting capable of copyright and also a design patentable as such, but held that, as the appellant
had elected to copyright, the notice must be repeated on
each of the twelve squares, although they did not present
themselves as separate squares on the continuous strip.
182 Fed. Rep. 150. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reserving its opinion as to whether the sphere of copyright
and patent for design overlapped, agreed with the Circuit
Court that, if this was a painting, every reproduction of
it must bear the statutory notice, and affirmed the dismissal of the bill. -191 Fed. Rep. 35, 111 C. C. A. 567.
It seems to us that the case is disposed of by the statement. The thing protected and the only thing was the
painting, the whole of which was reproduced in a single
square. Every reproduction of a copyrighted work must
bear the statutory notice. American Tobacco Co. v.
Werckmeister, 207 U. S. 284, 294. It is suggested that it
is overtechnical to require a repetition of the notice upon
every square in a single sheet that makes a harmonious
whole. This argument tacitly assumps that we can look
to such larger unity as the sheet possesses. But that
unity is only the unity of a design that is not patented.

Statement of the Case.

The protected object does not gain more extensive privileges by being repeated several times upon one sheet of
paper, as any one would recognize if it were the Gioconda.
The appellant is claiming the same rights as if this work
were one of the masterpieces of the world, and he must
take them with the same limitations that would apply to a
portrait, a holy family, or a scene of war.
Decree affirmed.

MISSOURI, KANSAS AND TEXAS RAILWAY COMPANY v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 25.

Argued October 28, 29, 1914.-Decided November 9, 1914.

Whether the concession of lands in Indian Territory under § 9 of the
Land Grant Act of July 25, 1866, c. 241, 19 Stat. 236, was a grant in
prwsenti or a covenant to convey, it was dependent upon fulfilment
of the express conditions precedent that the Indian title be extinguished and when extinguished become public lands of the United
States; and those conditions have not been fulfilled.
A statute granting public lands or Indian lands which may become
public lands, will not be construed as including Indian lands afterwards allotted in severalty under a treaty made immediately before
the enactment of the statute, as to do so would be to accuse the
Government of bad faith with the Indian owners of the land.
Grants from the Government are to be strictly construed against the
grantee.
47 Ct. Cls. 59, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of § 9 of the
Land Grant Act of July 28, 1866, and the provisions
therein contained for grants of lands in Indian Territory
on the extinguishment of the Indian title, are stated in the
opinion.
