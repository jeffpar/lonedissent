Statement of the Case.

is a sense, doubtless, in which it may be said that the
State is interested in the question, but only a governmental sense. It is interested in the well-being of its
citizens, in the just and equal enforcement of all its laws;
but such governmental interest is not the pecuniary interest which causes it to bear the burden of an adverse
judgment. Not a dollar will be taken from the treasury
of the State, no pecuniary obligation of it will be enforced,
none of its property affected by any decree which may be
rendered."
Finally, this is an equitable action brought to establish
and enforce a trust in favor of plaintiff, with only an incidental prayer for a mandatory decree. It is not an
original proceeding by mandamus, of which the Federal
courts have no jurisdiction. Bath County v. Amy, 13

It seems to me that the decree should be affirmed.

AMERICAN WATER SOFTENER COMPANY v.
LANKFORD AND OTHERS, COMPOSING THE
STATE BANKING BOARD OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 418. Argued October 14, 15, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.
Decided on authority of Lankford v. Platte Iron Works, ante, p. 461.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

AMERICAN WATER CO. v. LANKFORD.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. C. Wilfred Conard, with whom Mr. L. J. Roach
was on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. Charles West, Attorney General of the State of
Oklahoma, for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA

delivered the opinion of the

court.
Appellant, on June 8, 1912, deposited with the Farmers'
and Merchants' Bank of Sapulpa the sum of $3,337.50.
The bank issued to appellant a certificate of deposit for
the sum in the usual form.
The bank, which, it is alleged, was entitled to the
benefits of the Oklahoma bank guaranty law, subsequently failed and was closed and taken possession of by
appellees, composing the State Banking Board. The
certificate of deposit was presented to the Banking Board
and payment demanded out of the Depositors' Guaranty
Fund or, if that fund should be insufficient, that there be
issued to appellant a certificate of deposit. Both demands
were refused and this suit was instituted to enjoin compliance with one or the other of the demands.
Motion was made by appellees to dismiss the bill on
the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of the
subject-matter of the action or of the persons of the defendants (appellees), the suit being one against the State of
Oklahoma without its consent in violation of the provisions of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States.
The motion was granted on the authority of the court's
opinion in Farishv. State Banking Board.
This appeal was then prosecuted.
The questions in this case are the same as those discussed and decided this day in Lankford, et al.,Composing

For reasons expressed in the dissenting opinion in

FARIH v. STATE BANKING BOARD OF THE
STATE OF OKLAHOMA.
STATE BANKING BOARD OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA v. FARISH.
APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
. FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.
Nos. 446, 447.

Argued October 14, 15, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.

Lankford v. Platte Iron Works, ante, p. 461, followed to the effect that
under the Eleventh Amendment the State Banking Board and Bank
Commissioner of Oklahoma are not subject to suit by depositors of
insolvent banks.
Although one may become subrogated to all the rights of a depositor
in an insolvent bank in Oklahoma, that does not give him the right
of suit against the state officers administering the Depositors' Guaranty Fund.
As the statute creating the State Banking Board of Oklahoma does not
give the Board power to waive the State's exemption from suit, an
