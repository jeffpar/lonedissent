SIZEMORE v. BRADY.
235 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

SIZEMORE v. BRADY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.
No. 59.

Submitted November 4, 1914.-Decided December 21, 1914.

The Original Creek Agreement of March 1, 1901, was not a grant in
prmsenti which invested the then living members.of the tribe and
their heirs with absolute rights that could not be recalled or impaired
by Congress without violating the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment.
Unless and until the Original Creek Agreement of 1901 was carried
into effect Congress possessed plenary power as before to deal with
the lands and funds to which it related as tribal property. Choate
v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665.
The Supplemental Creek Agreement of 1902 and the Act of May 27,
1902, repealing the provisions of the act of March 1, 1901, recognizing the tribal laws of descent and distribution, and declaring that the
descent and distribution of Creek lands and moneys should be in
accordance with the specified laws of Arkansas, were valid acts
within the plenary power of Congress to deal with Indians and their
tribal property.
An exertion of the administrative control of the Government over
tribal property of tribal Indians is subject to change by Congress
at any time before it is carried into effect and while tribal relations
continue.
The descent and distribution of a Creek Indian Allotment, not selected
or made until after the Supplemental Creek Agreement of 1902 went
into effect, are controlled under that agreement by Chapter 49 of
Mansfield's Digest of the Law of Arkansas.
Under Chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest of the Law of Arkansas a
paternal cousin of the intestate inherits real estate to the exclusion
of maternal cousins.
33 Oklahoma, 169, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the provisions in the Original and Supplemental Creek Agreements
regarding the descent and distribution of Creek Indian
Allotments, are stated in the opinion.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

Mr.. FrederickE. Chapin, Mr. Andrew B. Duvall and Mr.
James B. Diggs for plaintiffs in error:
Where an enrolled member, a'citizen of the Creek Tribe
or Nation of Indians, who dies prior to the going into effect
of the act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861, known as the
Creek Agreement, was, under the terms of such treaty,
entitled to receive an allotment, and died without haviz1
selected or received such allotment, the allotment such
citizen would have been entitled to under the treaty had
he lived to select and receive the same descends to his
heirs under the Original Creek Agreement. These heirs
are to be ascertained as of the date of the death of such
enrolled Creek citizen, and the right of the heirs of such
enrolled member or citizen of the Creek Nation to such
alloiment is a vested right, which cannot be impaired or
taken away by subsequent legislation. In support of these

was not intended to, operate on or affect the estates of
members or citizens of the Creek Tribe or Nation who
died prior to the going into effect of the Supplemental

Mr. Grant Foreman and Mr. James D. Simms for defendant in error:
A duly enrolled citizen of the Creek Nation who died
on March 1, 1901, without having selected an allotment of
land, died seized and possessed of no interest either legal
or equitable in the domain of the Creek Nation, and no
persons claiming to be his heirs at any time after his death
and before allotment had a vested right to land to be allotted in his name or right. They had a mere expectancy,
subject to be changed or extinguished by subsequent acts
of Congress. McKee v. Henry, 201 Fed. Rep. 74; Braun
v. Bell, 192 Fed. Rep. 427; Shellenbargerv. Fewel, 124 Pac.
Rep. 617.
The mere right to allot land of the Creek Nation was
not a vested right before it was exercised, because it was
subject at any time to be withdrawn. Gritts v. Fisher,
224 U. S. 640; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445;

Wade, 132 U. S. 34.
The lands of the Creek Nation before allotment were
held by thc Tribe for the common use of the members, and
no right in severalty could be asserted by any member.

Congress had full power to make laws of descent in Indian Territory, independently of the Indians or other people
residing there; but the Muskogee or Creek Tribe were under the special guardianship of Congress and it had plenary
authority over them. McKee v. Henry, 201 Fed. Rep. 74;

The selection or allotment of the land was the initiatory
step and was prerequisite to the vesting of any individual
title or interest in the land of the tribe. Hooks v. Kennard, 28 Oklahoma, 457; deGraffenried v. Iowa Land Co.,
20 Oklahoma, 687; McKee v. Henry, 201 Fed. Rep. 74;
Braun v. Bell, 192 Fed. Rep. 427; Hayes v. Barringer, 168
Fed. Rep. 221.
The purpose of § 28 of the Original Creek Agreement
was to establish a basis for the allotment of the lands of
the tribe. A legislative grant to any member or the vesting
of rights by any method other than by allotment is foreign
to the general purpose of the act and is not expressed nor
intended.
If decedent had no vested right in this land before allotment, no greater estate vested in his heirs.
Application of § 6 of the Creek Supplemental Agreement
changing the rule of descent of lands allotted after the act,
in the right of citizens dying before the act, is not to be
denied on the ground that it would operate retrospectively.
In view of the purpose to be accomplished and the state
of the subject-matter, the operation was not retrospective.
The power reposed in Congress and the legislation discloses
the intention to make all lands allotted to heirs after the
date of the act, descend according to the rule of descent
in force at the date of the aUotment, regardless of what
rule of descent was in force before, the act. Stephens v.
Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445; McKee v. Henry, 201 Fed.
Rep. 74; Braun v. Bell, 192 Fed. Rep. 427.
Allotment was necessary to segregate and vest a member's interest in lands of the tribe. Choate v. Trapp, 224
U: S. 665.
Reason for the amendment is found in § 6 of the Supplemental Agreement.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

235 U. S.

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This was a suit to determine conflicting claims to an

allotment selected and made after August 8, 1902, on
behalf of Ellis Grayson, a Creek citizen duly entitled to
enrollment, who died unmarried March 1, 1901, leaving as
his only surviving relatives three first cousins, one on the
paternal and two on the maternal side. All were Creek
citizens. In the papers evidencing the selection and approval of the allotment, as also in the ensuing tribal deed,
the beneficiaries were designated as the "heirs" of the
deceased, without otherwise naming them; and this was in
accord with the usual practice. The suit was brought by
the paternal cousin, who insisted that the title under the
allotment and tribal deed passed to him alone. The
others were made defendants and answered asserting an
exclusive right in themselves. Each side also advanced an
alternative claim that the three took the land in equal
parts. Two questions of law were involved: First, whether
the beneficiaries were to be ascertained according to the
Creek tribal law or according to an Arkansas law presently to be noticed; and, second, whether the governing
law preferred either paternal or maternal relatives when
all were of the same degree. The trial court, concluding
that the tribal law was-applicable and preferred maternal
relatives, gave judgment for the defendants; but the
Supreme Court of the State held that the Arkansas law
was controlling and preferred paternal relatives, so -the
decision below was reversed with a direction that judgment be entered for the plaintiff. 33 Oklahoma, 169.
The defendants then sued out this writ of error.
Anterior to the legislation which we must consider, the
Creek lands and funds belonged to the tribe as. a community, and not to the members severally or as tenants in
common. The right of each individual to participate in

SIZEMORE v. BRADY.

Opinion of the Court.

the enjoyment of such property depended upon tribal
membership, and when that was terminated by death or
otherwise the right was at an end. It was neither alienable
nor descendible. Under treaty stipulations the tribe
maintained a government of its own, with legislative and
other powers, but this was a temporary expedient and in
time proved unsatisfactory. Like other tribal Indians, the
Creeks were wards of the United States, which possessed
full power, if it deemed such a course wise, to assume
full control over them and their affairs, to ascertain who
were members of the tribe, to distribute the lands and
funds among them, and to terminate the tribal government. This Congress undertook to do. The earlier
legislation was largely preliminary and need not be
noticed.
The first enactment having a present bearing is that of
March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31' Stat. 861, called the Original
Creek Agreement, which went into effect May 25, 1901,
32 Stat. 1971. It made provision for a permanent enrollment of the members of the tribe, for appraising most of
the lands and allotting them in ,severalty with appropriate
regard to their value, for using the tribal funds in equalizing allotments, for distributing what remained, for, issuing
deeds transferring the title to the allotted lands to the
several allottees, and for ultimately terminating the
tribal relation. In § 28 this act directed that the enrollment, except as to*children, should include "all citizens
who Were living" on April 1, 1899, and entitled to enrollment under the earlier legislation, and then declared that
"if any such citizen has died since that time, or may
hereafter die, before receiving his allotment of lands and
distributive share of all the funds of the tribe, the lands
and money to which he would be entitled, if living, shall
descend to his heirs according to the laws of descent and
distribution of the Creek Nation, and be allotted and
distributed to them accordingly."

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

So much of that act as recognized the tribal laws of
descent and distribution was repealed by the act of
May 27, 1902,1 c. 888, 32 Stat. 245, 258, which also provided: "and the descent and distribution of the lands and
moneys provided for in said act [March 1, 1901] shall be in
accordance with the provisions of chapter forty-nine of
Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas in force in
Indian Territory." This was repeated, with a qualification not material here, in § 6 of the act of June 30, 1902,
c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500; called the Supplemental Creek
Agreement, which went into effect August 8, 1902. See
32 Stat. 2021; Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S.
286, 301.
Ellis Grayson was living April 1, 1899, and entitled to
enrollment. Had he lived he would have been entitled,
under the original agreement, to participate in the allotment and distribution of the tribal property. But he died
March 1, 1901, before the agreement went into effect and
without receiving any part of the lands or funds of the
tribe. In these circumstances the agreement contemplated that his heirs should take his place in the allotment
and distribution and should receive" the lands and money
to which he would be entitled, if living;" and it also contemplated that effect should be given to the Creek laws of
descent and distribution in determining who were his
heirs and in what proportions they were to take the property passed to them in his right. But, as before said, the
act of May 27, 1902, and the supplemental agreement
repealed the provision giving effect to the Creek laws of
descent and distribution and substituted in their stead the
laws of Arkansas embodied in Chapter 49 of*Mansfield's
Digest. This change went into effect before the allotment,
in question was selected or made, and has an important
' This act went into effect July 1, 1902. See Joint Resolution No. 24,

Opinion of the Court.

bearing here, because, according to the Creek laws,' the
maternal cousins were either the sole heirs or joint heirs
with the paternal cousin, while according to the Arkansas
laws 2 the paternal cousin was the only heir.
On the part of the maternal cousins it is contended that
the provisions in the original agreement relating to the
allotment and distribution of the tribal lands and funds
were in the nature of a grant in prcosenti and invested
every living member of the tribe and the heirs, designated
in the tribal laws, of every member who had died after
April 1, 1899, with an absolute right to an allotment of
lands and a distributive share of the funds, and that
Congress could not recall or impair this right without
violating the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. To this we cannot assent.
There was nothing in the agreement indicative of a purpose to make a grant in prcesenti. On the contrary, it
contemplated that various preliminary acts were to
precede any investiture of individual rights. The lands
and funds to which it related were tribal property and
only as it was carried into effect were individual claims to
be fastened upon them. Unless and until that was done
Congress possessed plenary power to deal with them as
tribal property. It could revoke the agreement and
abandon the purpose to distribute them in severalty, or
adopt another mode of distribution, or pursue any other
course which to it seemed better for the Indians. And
without doubt it could confine the allotment and distribution to living members of the tribe or make any provision
deemed more reasonable than the first for passing to the
relatives of deceased members the lands and money to
which the latter would be entitled, if living. In short, the
power of Congress was not exhausted or restrained by the

Indian Land Laws, 2nd ed., § 829.

adoption of the original agreement, but remained the same
thereafter as before, save that rights created by carrying
the agreement into effect could not be divested or impaired.
Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665, 671.
In principle it was so held in Gritts v. Fisher, 224 U. S.
640. There an act or agreement of 1902 had made provision for allotting and distributing the lands and funds of
the Cherokees in severalty among the members of the
tribe who were living on September 1, 1902, and an act of
1906 had directed that Cherokee children born after
September 1, 1902, and living on March 4, 1906 should
participate in the allotment and distribution. By enlarging the number of participants the later act operated to
reduce the distributive share to which each would be
entitled, and because of this the validity of that act was
called in question, the contention being that the prior act
confined the allotment and distribution to the members
living on September 1, 1902, and therefore invested them
with an absolute right to receive all the lands and funds,
and that this right could not be impaired by
subsequent
legislation. This court rejected ,the contention and said
(p. 648): "No doubt such was the purport of the act.
But that, in our opinion, did not confer upon them any
vested right such as would disable Congress from thereafter making provision for admitting newly born members of the tribe to the allotment and distribution. The
difficulty with the appellants' contention is that it treats
the act of 1902 as a contract, when 'it is only an act of
Congress and can have no greater effect.' Cherokee Intermarriage Cases, 203 U. S. 76, 93. It was but an exertion
of the administrative control of the Government over the
tribal property of tribal Indians, and was subject to change
by Congress at any time before it was carried into effect,
and while the tribal relations continued. Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445, 488; Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 294; Wallace v. Adas, 204 U. S. 415, 423."

451

Statement of the Case.

We have seen that the allotment in question was not
selected or made until after the supplemental agreement
went into effect. The heirs designated in chapter 49 of
Mansfield's Digest were therefore the tiue beneficiaries.
According to its provisions, as is conceded, the paternal
cousin was the sole heir.
Judgment affirmed.

MARYLAND STEEL COMPANY OF BALTIMORE
COUNTY v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 104.

Argued December 8, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.

Although parties to a contract may agree that time is of the essence
and may stipulate for liquidated damages, they may subsequently
so modify the requirements as to completion that performance within
the stipulated time becomes unimportant. Flynn v. Des Moines
Railway, 63 Iowa, 490, approved.
As the record in this case does not show that there was any culpable
delinquency in completion of a contract for the building of a vessel,
or .any detriment to the Government, but that the vessel wag delivered, tested, approved and paid for without protest on the part of
the Government on account of delay, and, as it does appear, the
Quartermaster General had, in his discretion, orally waived the time
limit in the contract, held,.that:
In a case of contract authorized by law necessarily entered into
and conducted by officers of the Government, they must necessarily have the power to make it effective in its progress as well as
in its beginning; and the oral agreement of the Quartermaster
General was within the scope of his official authority and amounted
to a modification of the contract. Salomon v. United States, 19
Wall. 17, followed. United States v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 205 U. S.
105, distinguished.
