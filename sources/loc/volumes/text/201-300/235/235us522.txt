LAWLOR v. LOEWE.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.

No. 358.

Argued December 10, 11, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.

Irrespective of compulsion or even agreement to observe its intimation,
the circulation of a "we don't patronize" or "unfair" list manifestly
intended to put the ban upon those whose names appear therein,
among an important body of possible customers, combined with a
view to joint action and in anticipation of such reports, is within the
prohibition of the Anti-trust Act of July 2, 1890, if it is intended to
restrain and does restrain commerce among the States. Eastern
States Retail Lumber Dealers Association v. United States, 234 U. S.
600.
This court agrees with the courts below that the action of the unions
and associations to which defendants belonged in regard to the use
and circulation of "we don't patronize" and "unfair dealer" lists,
boycotts, union labels and strikes, amounted to a combination and
conspiracy forbidden by the Anti-trust Act of July 2, 1890.
In this case, held that the trial court properly instructed the jury to the
effect that defendants, members of labor unions who paid their dues
and continued to delegate authority to their officers to unlawfully
interfere with the interstate commerce of other parties, are jointly
liable with such officers for the damages sustained by their acts.
Members of unions and associations are bound to know the constitutions of their societies; and, on the evidence in this case, the jury
might well find that the defendants who were members of labor

LAWIA)lR v. LOEWE.
235 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

unions knew how the words of the constitutions of such unions had
been construed in the act.
The use in this case of the word "proof" by the trial judge in its popular
way for "evidence," held, in view of the caution by the judge, not to
have prejudiced the defendants.
A verdict for damages resulting from an illegal combination in restraint
of interstate trade under the Anti-trust Act of 1890, may include
damages accruing after commencement of the suit but as the consequence of acts done before and constituting part of the cause of action declared on.
In this case, introduction of newspapers was not improper to show
publicity, in places and directions to bring notice home to defendants
and to prove intended and detrimental consequences of the acts complained of.
Letters from customers of a boycotted manufacturer, giving the boycott
as reason for ceasing to deal with him, held admissible in this case.
209 Fed. Rep. 721, affirmed.

THE facts in this case, which is known as the Danbury
Hatters' Case, involving the validity of a verdict for damages resulting from a combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade under § 7 of the Anti-trust Act, are stated
in the opinion.
Mr. Alton B. Parker, with whom Mr. Frank L. Mul-

holland was on the brief, for plaintiffs in error:
The trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury
as to the coercive character of the combination alleged
in the complaint, as to the legality of the Hatters' Union
label and as to the character of the boycott alleged.
.The combination charged falls within the class of restraints of trade aimed .at compelling third parties and
strangers involuntarily not to engage in the course of
trade except on conditions that the combination imposes (Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274) and the requests for instructions to this effect should have been

granted.
It was not unlawful to attempt to unionize, that is,
establish union conditions in, the plaintiffs' factory, by

means of a strike. It is the absolute right of every workman to exercise his own option in regard to the persons
with whom he will agree to work or with whom he will
continue to work, and, therefore, union workmen may
refuse to continue to work with those who are not members
of their union. Adair v. United States, 208 U. S. 161,

Co. v. Iron Moulders' Union, 150 Fed. Rep. 155, 172;
National Protective Ass'n v. Cumming, 170 N. Y. 315;
Allen v. Flood (1898), App. Cas. 1.
A strike does not become unlawful because it is the
result of orders by the officers of a labor union to which
the strikers belong. Thomas v. Cincinnati &c. R. R.,
62 Fed. 803, 817; Wabash Ry. v. Hannahan, 121 Fed.

Union, 147 Kentucky, 170, 174; Jose v. Metallic Roofing
Co. (1908), App. Cas. 514, 518.
The union label of the United Hatters is, in the States
where it is registered according to law, a statutory trademark, and the officers and agents of the United Hatters
have the same right to solicit trade for hats bearing their
label as any merchant has to solicit trade for goods bearing his trade-mark; and the plaintiffs cannot recover in
this action for damages resulting from the loss or diminution of business due solely to an unusual demand for
union-label hats. Laws for the registration and protection of trade-union labels are in force in at least forty-one
States and Territories (Spedden on the Trade Union
Label, p. 97), and the constitutionality of these statutes
has uniformly been upheld. 7 Labbatt's Master and
Servant, p. 8656, § 2786;.Perkinsv. Heert, 158 N. Y. 306.

label is not unlawful and is not a boycott, in the legal
sense of the term.
Members of a combination having a common interest
to subserve may inform one another of the names of those
whom they deem inimical; this does not constitute a
threat or intimidation and does not amount to coercion.

Van Orsdel, J., in American Federation v. Buck's Stove
Co., 33 App. D. C. 83, 123; Gray v. Building Trades Council, 91 Minnesota, 171.
In the legal sense of the term, the word threat does not
embrace every announcement of an intention to do an
act which will result in an injury to another; it embraces
only the announcement of an intention to do an unlawful
act. 7 Labbatt's Master and Servant, pp. 8448, 8458;

Tennessee (13 Lea), 507, 521; dissenting opinion by Caldwell, J., in Hopkins v. Oxley Stave Co., 83 Fed: -Rep. 912,
924.
And coercion, in ,the legal sense of the term, does not
embrace every constraint placed upon the free will of
another, but only such cotstraint as results from the announcement of an intention to do, or from the doing of,
an unlawful act to the prejudice of the person constrained. 7 Labbatt's Master and Servant, pp. 8448, 8458;
Parkinson Co. v. Building Trades Council, 154 California,
581.
Since the defendants in this case, although members
of local unions of hatters which were affiliated with the
national organization known as the United Hatters of
North America, did not participate in the acts of the officers and agents of the national association which are
relied upon to establish the allegation of the complaint,

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

235 U. S.

they can be held liable only on the ground that they had
knowledge of, and, having knowledge, acquiesced in,
those acts; membership in a local union and the payment
of dues are not alone sufficient to make the defendants
liable for the unlawful acts of the officers and agents of
the national association. Benton v. Minneapolis Tailoring Co., 73 Minnesota, 498; United States v. Cohen,
128 Fed. Rep. 615, affirmed, 145 Fed. Rep. 1, writ of
error denied, 200 U. S. 618; Lawlor v. Loewe, 187 Fed.
Rep. 522.
It was error for the trial court to permit the defendants
who testified to be cross-examined as to whether they
continued to pay dues after the service of the complaint,
whether they investigated the truth of the matters therein
alleged and whether they made any attempt to prevent
the election of the same officers as before. Lawlor v.
Loewe, 187 Fed. Rep. 522, 527.
It was error to admit in evidence articles and items from
newspapers published in the vicinity in which the defendants resided for the purpose of proving knowledge
of their contents by the defendants who were not shown
to have read the newspapers. Leeson v. Holt, 1 Stark.
186; Graham v. Hope, Peake's N. P. Cas. 154; Roberts v.
Spencer, 123 Massachusetts, 397; Clark v. Ricker, 14
N. H. 44, 48; Milbank v. Dennistoun, 10 Bosw. (N. Y.)
382, 393. Hence it was also error to admit in evidence
items from the Journal of the United Hatters and from
the American Federationist.
To make a newspaper publication admissible in evidence to show knowledge of their contents, the facts
therein stated must be established by independent evidence.
Newspaper publications are not admissible to prove
the truth of the statements therein contained. 13 Halsbury's Laws of England, p. 565, citing Bossinore (Lord) v.

The testimony of witness for the plaintiffs as to the
reason given by retail dealers in hats, who bought hats
from jobbers or wholesale dealers purchasing their goods
from the plaintiffs, for withdrawing their patronage from
these jobbers or wholesale dealers, was not admissible.
Tilk v. Parsons, 2 C. & P. 202; Lawlor v. Loewe, 187 Fed.
Rep. 522, 527.
Depositions containing no material nor relevant testimony but which merely disclosed the fact that the witnesses refused to answer questions on the ground that
their testimony might incriminate them were inadmissible and their admission in evidence constitutes prejudicial error. Philin v. Kenderline, 20 Pa. St. 354; Carne v.
Litchfield, 2 Michigan, 340; Garrett v. St. Louis Transit
Co., 219 Missouri, 65, 69.
The trial court erred in admitting evidence of, and allowing recovery for, damages accruing after the commencement of the action. The wrongful combination
or conspiracy alleged in the case at bar is a continuing
wrong of a temporary, removable character for which
successive actions may be maintained from time to time
as damages accrue. Obviously it is not distinguishable
in this respect from trespasses and nuisances which are
not of a permanent nature. The plaintiffs should therefore have been limited in their recovery to the damages
which had accrued at the time when the action was commenced., Denver City Water Co. v. Middaugh, 12 Colorado,

Mr. Walter' Gordon Merritt and Mr. Daniel Davenport
for defendants in error:
The court properly and adequately charged the jury
as to what constituted an unlawful restraint of interstate
trade under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act as applied to
the allegations and issues in this case. The testimony
clearly establishes a conspiracy in restraint of trade among
the States, and any act, though otherwise innocent, done in
carrying out that illegal conspiracy was unlawful and for
the damage to their business caused thereby the plaintiffs
are entitled to recover. Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274;
Aikens v. Wisconsin; 195 U. S. 194. The attempted distinc-"
tion between the primary and secondary boycotts is also
not pertinent, because the prohibitions of the Sherman
Anti-Trust Act extend to both alike. The act recognizes
no such distinction. Eastern States Lumber Dealers v.
United States, 234 U. S. 600. For the same reason the use
of "unfair" and "we don't patronize" lists by the defendants was unlawful under the Sherman Act. As defendants used ' the union label as an instrument to carry
out their conspiracy to restrain the plaintiffs' interstate
trade, the plaintiffs can recover for the damages which
resulted from such illegal use. And since the strike
of the plaintiffs' workmen, ordered by the officers of the
United Hatters, was a step in carrying out the conspiracy, it was unlawful and the damages which directly
and proximately resulted to the plaintiffs' business there-

from are recoverable in this action, even though the defendants did not intend to resort to interstate boycotting, unless the same became necessary to accomplish
their object of unionizing the plaintiffs' factory. Davis
v. United States, '107 Fed. Rep. 754.
Th6 charge of the court to the effect that the individual
defendants, members of the union, were liable under the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act, if they knew, or ought to have
known, or were in duty bound to know, that their union
and its officers were engaged in the conspiracy to restrain
the plaintiffs' interstate trade, was under the circumstances of the case correct. Rogers v. Vicksburg Ry., 194
Fed. Rep. 65; Martin v. Webb, 110 U. S. 7; Jones v.
Maher, 116 N. Y. Supp. 180. Where an agent is enabled
to commit unlawful acts through the negligence of his
principal, the latter may even be held criminally liable.
Clark & Sykes on Agency, p. 1141; Commonwealth v.
Morgan, 107 Massachusetts, 199. The officers of the,
union, in carrying out the conspiracy, were acting within
the scope of their employment and in furtherance of the
organization's purposes, and the defendants' conduct
warranted them in assuming that they were acting with
the defendants' authority and approv4l. Defendants are
.liable under the rule of resp6ndeat superior. Dicey on
Parties, p. 170; Meacham on Agency, par. 72; Clark &

Supreme Lodge v. Knight, 117 Indiana, 489.

The in-

dividual members of these associations are liable as principals for what their officers did in the .performance of
their constitutional duty to unionize all the shops in the
trade, even though they did not know of the particular
acts done or may have disapproved of or have forbidden
them. New York Central v. United States, 212 U. S. 481;

The Sherman Act is a highly remedial.statute and on its
face indicates an intent to apply those principles to all
associctions, which may violate it. Since the union was
authorized to engage in strikes, neither it nor its members can escape responsibility for illegal strikes conducted
in furtherance of its purposes. Taff Vale Ry. v. Amalgamated Society (1901), A. C., 426; Giblan v. National

The rule of respondeat superior applies to conspiracies
the same as to any other torts. Schultz v. Frankfort Co.,
139 N. W. Rep. 387. An agent has often no financial
resources, and in order to approximate justice, it is
necessary that the injured party should be allowed to
resort to the principal in order to find a full purse. Under
the statutes of Edward I, the injured party was required
to exhaust his remedy against the agent and could only
look to the principal for satisfaction of the deficiency.

LAWLOR v. LOEWE.

This shows that the basis of imputed liability is the necessity of finding a responsible party, for the protection of
society. 2 Pollock & Maitland, p. 533. The conditions
surrounding the organization of a modern labor union call
eloquently for the application of this line of reasoning.
If an individual corporation can be held liable for
the acts of ten thousand agents, there can be no reason
why one hundred thousand members of a single labor
union should not divide responsibility for the acts of
ten agents. If they are actually innocent of wrongdoing,
they can compel their fellow members to pro rate the
liability. Wooley v. Battei 2 C. & P. 417; Horbach v.
Elder, 18 Pa. St. 33; Vandiver v. Pollak, 19 L. R. A. 628

The plaintiffs are entitled to recover all damages which
are the proximate result of acts committed before the
suit was commenced, even though such damages continued or resulted therefrom after suit was commenced.

It was proper to cross-examine the defendants as to
whether, after the suit was commenced, they continued
paying dues and reelected the same officers who committed
the unlawful acts, since such evidence bore upon the intent and knowledge of the defendants relative to similar
transactions, it could properly have been admitted on

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of. the

court.
This is an action under the act of July 2, 1890, c. 647,
§ 7, 26 Stat. 209, 210, for a combination and conspiracy
in restraint of commerce among the States, specifically
directed against the plaintiffs (defendants in error), among
others, and effectively carried out with the infliction of
great damage. The declaration was held good on demurrer
in Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274, where it will be found
set forth at length. The substance of the charge is that
the plaintiffs were hat manufacturers who employed nonunion labor; that the defendants were members of the
United Hatters of North America and also of the American
Federation of Labor; that in pursuance of a general scheme
to unionize the labor employed by manufacturers of fur
hats (a purpose previously made effective against all but
a few manufacturers), the defendants and other members
of the United Hatters caused the American Federation of
Labor to declare a boycott against the plaintiffs and
against all hats sold by the plaintiffs to dealers in other
States and against dealers who should deal in them; and
that they carried out their plan with such success that
they have restrained or destroyed the plaintiff's commerce with other States. The case now has been tried,

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

235 U. S.

the plaintiffs have got a verdict and the judgment of the
District Court has been affirmed by the Circuit Court of
Appeals. 209 Fed. Rep. 721; 126 C. C. A. 445.
The grounds for discussion under the statute that were
not cut away by the decision upon the demurrer have been
narrowed still further since the trial by the case of Eastern
States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States,
234 U. S. 600. Whatever may be the law otherwise, that
case establishes that, irrespective of compulsion or even
agreement to observe its intimation, the circulation of
a list of 'unfair dealers,' manifestly intended to put the
ban upon those whose names appear therein, among an
important body of possible customers combined with a
view to joint action and in anticipation of such reports, is
within the prohibitions of the Sherman Act if it is intended to restrain and restrains commerce among the
States.
It requires more than the blindness of justice not to see
that many branches of the United Hatters and the Federation of Labor, to both of which the defendants belonged,
in pursuance of a plan emanating from headquarters made
use of such lists, and of the primary and secondary boycott
in their effort to subdue the plaintiffs to their demands.
The union label was used and a strike of the plaintiffs'
employgs was ordered and carried out to the same end,
and the purpose to break up the plaintiffs' commerce
affected the quality of the acts. Loewe v. Lawlor, 208
U. S. 274, 299. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that a combination and conspiracy forbidden by
the statute were proved, and that the question is narrowed
to the responsibility of the defendants for what was done
by the sanction and procurement of the societies above
named.
The court in substance instructed the jury that if these
members paid their dues and continued to delegate authority to their officers unlawfully to interfere with the

LAWLOR v. LOEWE.

Opinion of the Court.

plaintiffs' interstate commerce in such circumstances that
they knew or ought to have known, and such officers were
warranted in the belief that they were acting in the matters within their delegated authority, then such members
were jointly liable, and no others. It seems to us that
this instruction sufficiently guarded the defendants' rights,
and that the defendants got all that they were entitled to
ask in not being held chargeable with knowledge as matter
of law. It is a tax on credulity to ask anyone to believe
that members of labor unions at that time did not know
that the primary and secondary boycott and the use of
the 'We don't patronize' or 'Unfair' list were means expected to be employed in the effort to unionize shops.
Very possibly they were thought to be lawful. See Gompers v. United States, 233 U. S. 604. By 'the Constitution
of the United Hatters the directors are to use 'all the
means in their power' to bring shops 'not under our jurisdiction' 'into the trade.' The by-laws provide a separate
fund to be kept for strikes, lockouts, and agitation for the
union label. Members are forbidden to sell non-union
hats. The Federation of Labor with which the Hatters
were affiliated had organization of labor for one of its
objects, helped affiliated unions in trade disputes, and to
that end, before the present trouble, had provided in its
constitution for prosecuting and had prosecuted many
what it called legal boycotts. Their conduct in this and
former cases was made public especially among the members in every possible way. If the words of the documents
on their face and without explanation did not authorize
what was done, the evidence of what was done publicly
and habitually showed their meaning and how they were
interpreted. The jury could not but find that by the
usage of the unions the acts complained of were authorized, and authorized without regard to their interference
with commerce among the States. We think it unnecessary to repeat the evidence of the publicity of this par-

ticular struggle in the common newspapers and union
prints, evidence that made it almost inconceivable that
the defendants, all living in the neighborhood of the plaintiffs, did not know what was done in the specific case.' If
they did not know that, they were bound to know the
constitution of their societies, and at least well might be
found to have known how the words of those constitutions
had been construed in the act.
It is suggested that injustice was done by the judge
speaking of 'proof' that in carrying out the object of the
associations unlawful means had been used with their
approval. The judge cautioned the jury with special
care not to take their view of what had been proved from
him, going even farther than he need have gone. Graham
v. United States, 231 U. S. 474, 480. But the context
showed plainly that proof was used here in a popular
way for evidence and must have been understood in that
sense.
Damages accruing since the action began were allowed,
but only such as were the consequence of acts done before
and constituting part of the cause of action declared on.
This was correct. New York, Lake Erie & Western R. R.
v. Estill, 147 U. S. 591, 615, 616. We shall not discuss
the objections to evidence separately and in detail as we
find no error requiring it. The introduction of newspapers,
etc., was proper in large part to show publicity in places
and directions where the facts were likely to be brought
home to the defendants, and also to prove an intended
and detrimental consequence of the principal acts, not
to speak of other grounds. The reason given by customers for ceasing to deal with sellers of the Loewe hats,
including letters from dealers to Loewe & Co., were
admissible. 3 Wigmore, Evidence, § 1729 (2). We need
not repeat or add to what was said by the Circuit Court of
Appeals with regard to evidence of the payment of dues
after this suit was begun. And in short neither the ar-

RAILWAY COMPANY v. CITY OF COVINGTON.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KENTUCKY.

No. 28. Argued October 30, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.
Whether given commerce is of an interstate character or not is to be
determined by what is actually done, and if really and in fact between States mere arrangements of billing and plurality of carriers
do not enter into the conclusion.
An uninterrupted transportation of passengers between States, on the
same cars, under practically the same management and for a single
fare, constitutes interstate commerce although the track in each
State is owned by a separate corporation. Missouri Pacific R. R. v.
Kentucky, 216 U. S. 262, distinguished.
Although the State may not directly regulate or burden interstate
commerce, it may, in the exercise of its police power, in the interest
of public health and safety, and in the absence of legislation by Congress, enact regulations which incidentally or indirectly affect interstate commerce. Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352.
A municipal ordinance regulating the number of passengers to be carried in, temperature and method of loading and unloading, and other
details regarding, cars used in interstate transportation, may be valid
as to those regulations which are within the scope of the police power
of the State and only incidentally or indirectly affect interstate
commerce as to matters in regard to which Congress has not legislated, and invalid as to those regulations which directly affect, and
are a burden on, interstate commerce.
