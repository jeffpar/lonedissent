NEW YORK ELECTRIC LINES COMPANY v. EMPIRE CITY SUBWAY COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 63. Argued November 5, 6, 1914.-Decided November 30, 1914.
If it sufficiently appears that plaintiff in error raised the question of constitutionality of later legislation repealing that on which its contract
rested, as impairing the obligation of that contract, and that the
state court gave effect to the repealing legislation, the case is properly
here under ยง 237, Judicial Code.
Under such conditions, it is the duty of this court to determine for itself
whether a contract existed and whether its obligation has been impaired.
A street franchise which becomes operative upon the grant of the consent of the city is a property right. The grant is not a nude pact, but
rests upon an obligation, expressly or impliedly assumed, to carry on
the undertaking to which the grant relates. Such grants are made
and received with the understanding that the recipient is protected
by a contractual right from the moment the grant is accepted and
during the course of performance as contemplated, as well as after
that performance.
Grants of franchises are subject to the tacit condition that they may
be lost by non-user or mis-use'. The condition thus implied is a
condition subsequent.
A franchise is given in order that it may be exercised for the public good,
and failure to exercise as contemplated is ground for revocation and
withdrawal.
An indefeasible interest only becomes vested under a franchise which
has not only been duly granted, but has also been exercised in conformity with the grant.
Whether the authorities shall proceed in case of forfeiture of franchise
for non-user or mis-user by quo warrantoor, as in this case, by ordinance of repeal, the propriety of which can be adjudicated in a subsequent legal proceeding, is entirely a matter of state law.
In this case, held that as the right to use the streets was to be used
within a reasonable time or lost, and as it never had been used, an
ordinance'of the City of New York of May 11, 1906, revoking the
right of the plaintiff in error to lay wires in, and otherwise to use, the

streets of New York under a permission granted in 1878 did not contravene the impairment of obligation clause of the Federal Constitution.
Judgment based on 201 N. Y. 329, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve rights and obligations of a
corporation licensed by municipal ordinance to maintain
electric wires, and the validity under the impairment of
obligation clause of the Federal Constitution of a subsequent revocation of the license by the municipality owing
to mis-user and non-user, are stated in the opinion.

plaintiff in error:

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

This appeal necessarily involves a Federal question.
That the Federal question was raised and decided appears from the record and the opinion of the state court.
The Federal question was necessarily decided by the
state court.
The relator accepted and acted upon its franchise.
The relator's franchise includes the right to lay wires
in the streets for telephonic purposes, and to either use
them or to lease them to others for such purposes.
By reversing its own construction of the relator's contract, the State of New York has impaired the obligation
of the contract of the relator with the city and with the
State.
The -relator completed its formal acceptance of its
franchise from the city by duly filing the map which the
ordinance called for.
The relator has wholly complied with ch. 263 of the
Laws of 1892 and no issue of non-compliance has ever
been raised, nor can it be.
The relator is the real party in interest.
The application for the writ of mandamus was made
in good faith.
The relator has lost no rights by alleged laches arid no
statute of limitations is involved herein.
The relator has never assigned its franchise.
The city is estopped to question the relator's franchise
by the acceptance of taxes.
In support of these contentions see cases supra and

Mr. Edmund L. Mooney, with whom Mr. Charles T.
Russell and Mr. Frederick A. Card were on the brief, for
defendant in error:
The appeal should be dismissed as not involving a Fed-,
eral question.
No Federal question was raised or decided.
If any Federal question was raised, its decision was not
necessary to judgment.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

Non-user and abandonment is a non-Federal question.
There is no existing demand, occupation is not assured,
public interests do not require construction; all these are
non-Federal questions.
This proceeding is solely to enable relator to promote a
telephone business, which was beyond the scope of the
permission granted.
Relator was incorporated to conduct a subway conduit
business, not a telephone business.
Declarations and disclaimers in previous litigations and
acts of the parties furnish practical construction of the
franchise.
The permission granted to relator by resolution of
Common Council of April 10, 1883, was not accepted and
acted upon in fact, and is no longer in force.
The attempted transfer of the franchise to the Great
Eastern Co. was a breach of condition contained in the
resolution of permission.
The permission or the secondary franchise was lost by
non-user and abandonment.
Assuming that a formal acceptance would have been
sufficient, the acceptance in writing of the permission was
not a complete formal acceptance, in the absence of the
filing of a bona fide map, specifying anmount and position
of spaces.
The decision of the Federal question, if such be properly
raised, does not control the whole case. Other points
warrant affirmance.
A party applying for a peremptory writ of mandamus
admits the truth of the allegations in the opposing affidavits.
The relator is not the real party in interest.
The application is not made in good faith.
The relator lost whatever right it had by laches.

By leave of court Mr. Alfred B. Cruikshank filed a brief
as amicus curite, on behalf of Clifford L. Middleton.
MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of error to review the denial by the state
court of an application for a writ of peremptory mandamus directing the Empire City Subway. Company (Limited) to lease space in its conduits in the City of New York
to the plaintiff in error.
In the year 1884, the legislature of the State of New
York required that 'all telegraph, telephonic and electric
light wires' in certain cities-New York and Brooklynshould be placed under the surface of the streets (Laws of
1884, chap. 534). Under the authority of a statute passed
in the next year (Laws of 1885, chap. 499, amended by
Laws of 1886, chap. 503), the Board of Commissioners of
Electric Subways adopted a plan by which the City of
New York should enter into a contract with a company to
construct the necessary subways, etc., which other companies operating electrical wires should be compelled to
use, paying therefor a reasonable rent. Under contracts,
made accordingly and ratified by the legislature (Laws of
1887, chap. 716), subways, etc., were constructed by the
Consolidated Telegraph & Electrical Subway Company.
The board first-mentioned was succeeded by the Board of
Eleqtrical Control (Laws of 1887, chap. 716); and, in 1890,
the subways, conduits and ducts for low tension conductors, which had been thus provided, were transferred
to the Empire City Subway Company (I.4mited), the de-

fendant in error. The latter company, by contract with
the Board and the City, made in 1891 under legislative
authority (Laws of 1891, chap. 231), agreed to build,
maintain and operate subways, etc., as specified-it being
provided that spaces therein, upon application, should be
leased 'to any company or corporation having lawful
power to operate telegraph or telephone conductors in
any street' in the City of New York.
The plaintiff in error, The New York Electric Lines
Company, claiming to be entitled to space in these subways, made application therefor on or about June 10, 1910.
The request was refused and the present proceeding for a
peremptory mandamus was brought. The assertion of
right rested upon a permission granted by the City of
New York, through its Common Council, to the plaintiff
in error, on April 10, 1883, to lay electrical conductors in
the City's streets. This permission, the City by its Board
of Estimate and Apportionment, which had succeeded to
the powers of the former Common Council in the matter,
had formally revoked by a resolution adopted on May 11,
1906, reciting that whatever rights the company had secured under the permission in question had long since been
forfeited by non-user. The Court of Appeals of the State,
holding that the Board of Estimate ar.d Apportionment
had this power of revocation, and had duly exercised it,
affirmed an order refusing the writ of mandamus. Matter
of New York Electric Lines Co., 201 N. Y. 321. The plaintiff in error insists that the resolution thus sustained was
an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of its
contract with the City.
We think that it sufficiently appears that this question
was raised in the state court, and as the state court gave
effect to the iepealing resolution the case is properly here.
It is therefore the duty of this-caurt I determine for itself
whether a contraet existed and whether its obligation has
been impaired. Douglas v. Kentucky, 168 U. S. 488, 502;

Louisiana Railway & Navigation Co. v. New Orleans, decided this day, ante, p. 164.
The plaintiff in error was incorporated in the year 1882,
under a general law of the State of New York (Laws of
1848, chap. 265, as amended by Laws of 1853, chap. 471).
Its certificate of incorporation stated, among other things,
that it was incorporated for the purpose of 'owning, constructing, using, maintaining and leasing lines of telegraph
wires or other electric conductors for telegraphic and telephonic communication and for electric illumination, to be
placed under the pavements of the streets . . . of the
Cities. of New York and Brooklyn' and 'for the purpose of
owning franchises for laying and operating the said lines of
electric conductors.' Chapter 483 of the Laws of 1881
had authorized any company so incorporated 'to construct
and lay lines of electrical conductors underground in any
city,' provided that it 'first obtain from the common council' of such city the 'permission to use the streets' for the
purposes set forth. The permission in question, which as
already stated, was granted by the Common Council of
the City of New York, on April 10, 1883, was (omitting
parts not here material) as follows:
"Resolved, that permission be and hereby is granted to
the New York Electric Lines Company, to lay wires or
other conductors of electricity in and through the streets,
avenues and highways of New York City and to make connections of such wires or conductors underground by means
of the necessary vaults, test boxes and distributing conduits, and thence above ground with points of electric
illuminations or of telegraphic or telephonic signals in accordance with the provisions of an ordinance . . . approved

.

It was also resolved that the Company should not

Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

'transfer or dispose of the franchise hereby granted with.out the further authority of the Common Council.'
On April 24, 1883, the plaintiff in error presented to the
Common Council, and the latter spread upon its minutes,
a formal acceptance of the permission, which after the
recitals states:
"Now, therefore, the said New York Electric Lines
Company by these presents accepts the said franchise as
contained in the ordinance and resolutions'adopted by the
Honorable the Board of Aldermen, April 10, 1883, and
agrees to, assumes and obligates itself in the observance
of all the requirements, provisions, restrictions, conditions
and limitations contained in the said last mentioned ordinance as adopted April 10, 1883, as well also as to the
provisions, conditions and obligations of the said general
ordinance approved by the Mayor December 14, 1878."
The ordinance of 1878, referred to, .regulated the method
of laying wires under the streets, and provided that within
six months after the grant of permission, grantees should
file with the County Clerk 'maps, diagrams and tabular
statements indicating the amount and position of the
spaces proposed to be occupied by them.' In May, 1883,
the plaintiff in error, in asserted compliance with the ordinance, filed a map, diagrams and statement. It is
alleged in the affidavits presented on the application for
mandamus that the plaintiff in error secured inventions
and patent rights, that it had an office and factory, that
it prosecuted experimental work in relation to its project,
and expended in this way large sums of money. But, in
the actual construction of conduits or laying of wires,
nothing was done prior to the legislation of 1885 and 1886,
which as we have seen provided for a comprehensive plan
for the building of subways in which electrical conductors
should be placed.
Section 3 of the act of 1885 expressly made it obligatory
upon any company 'operating or intending to operate elec-

trical conductors,' and desiring or being required to place
its conductors underground, to file with the board of commissioners a 'map or maps, made to scale,' showing the
proposed plan of construction of its underground electrical
system and 'to obtain the approval by said board of said
plan' before any underground conduits should be constructed. The plaintiff in error did not submit a plan to
the board as required by the statute. In July, 1886, it
applied to the Commissioner of Public Works for a permit
to make the necessary excavations in the streets for the
purpose of laying conductors, and, on the application being
denied petitioned for a writ of peremptory mandamus to
direct the Commissioner to grant it. It was insisted in its
petition in that proceeding that it had 'never operated or
intended to operate electrical conductors,' its intention
having always been 'to lease to other persons, natural or
corporate, all of its electrical conductors, and not to operate itself any' of them; that the acts of 1885 and 1886
(above mentioned), relating to the construction of subways, did not apply to the plaintiff in error; and that, if
they were applicable, they violated the Federal Constitution being an impairment of its contract with the City and
operating to deprive the plaintiff in error of its property
without due process of law. The state court held that the
statutes in question were applicable to the plaintiff in error,
and were constitutional, and refused the mandamus.

This court affirmed the judgment (id., 145 U. S. 175),
saying (pp. 187, 188):
"'In no sense of the term do we think it can be safely
averred that the acts of 1885 and 1886 are not applicable
to the relator. . . . Neither can it be said that -the
acts of 1885 and 1886 have a retroactive effect, at least
so far as the relator -is concerned, since whatever rights it
obtained under the ordinance of 1883, which it accepted

as the basis of the contract it claims to have entered into,
were expressly subject to regulation, in their use, by the
highest legislative power in the State acting for the benefit
of all interests affected by those rights and for the benefit
of the public generally, so long as the relator's essential
rights were not impaired or invaded. New Orleans Gas
Company v. Louisiana Light Company, 115 U. S. 650;
Stein v. Bienville Water Supply Company, 141 U. S. 67."
And conceding for the purpose of the discussion, but
'without deciding,' that the plaintiff in error had a contract
with the City 'for the laying of its wires, and the construction of its underground electrical system,' this court
reached the conclusion that its rights had in no way been
impaired by the legislation under review.
This decision was rendered in May, 1892. Meanwhile,
pursuant to the statutes above mentioned, a plan of construction had been adopted by the board charged with
that duty, subways had been built, and the defendant in
error had entered into its contract to maintain and operate
them for low tension conductors, as specified, including
telegraph and telephone conductors. But for fifteen years
after the final decision in the case cited no application was
made by the plaintiff in error for space in these subways.
The first application for such space was made in June,
1907, and was not granted.
Nor, during this long period, was any attempt made by
the plaintiff in error either to build conduits or to place
wires under the City's streets, save that in December,
1905, it applied to the Commissioner of Water Supply,
Gas and Electricity for a permit to open the streets for
that purpose and, on its being denied, a proceeding was
begun to obtain a peremptory writ of mandamus. This
was refused, and the order to that effect was affirmed by
the Court of Appeals of the State. People, ex rel. New York
ElectricLines Co. v. Ellison, 188 N. Y. 523. The pertinent
legislation and the subway contracts were reviewed and

Opinion of the Court.

the requirement that electrical conductors should be placed
in conduits constructed in accordance with the adopted
plan, instead of the plaintiff in error being permitted to
build its own subways for such conductors, was sustained.
In arriving at this result, it was again assumed that the
plaintiff in error had a continuing right under the City's
permission, but this question was expressly reserved (id.,
p. 527).. A writ of error sued out from this court was
dismissed on motion of the plaintiff in error. .214 U. S.
529.,,

It was about the time when the last-mentioned proceeding was instituted that the City's permission was revoked
(May 11, 1906); and the state court, in its opinion in the
present case, said that the question 'remaining to be determined' was whether 'the relator, under the resolution
of the common council of April, 1883, has the right, as a
matter of law, to have its wires inserted in the ducts of the
Empire City Subway Company, notwithstanding the revocation of such resolution.' Did a 'bare acceptance' of the
permission operate to vest an irrevocable franchise? 201
N. Y. pp. 321,, 329. This question was answered in the
negative in the view that such a permission is 'a license
merely, revocable at the pleasure of the city, unless it has
been accepted and some substantial part of the work performed,' as contemplated by the permission, 'sufficient to
create a right of property and thus form a consideration
for the. contract.'
The plaintiff in error challenges this view, insisting that
by. irtue of the City's permission itis the grantee of an
irrevocable franchise in the City's streets; that this franchise, was derived from the State; that when the consent of
the City was given, as provided in the statute, the grant
became immediately operative and could not thereafter
be revoked or impaired by municipal resolution or ordinance; that the granted right, however named, is property,-and, as such, is inviolable; and that this position is

supported by numerous decisions both of the state court
and of this court, which are cited in the margin.' Thus in
Ghee v. Northern Union Gas Co., 158 N. Y. 510, 513, referring to the legal effect of the consent of the municipal
authorities under a statute empowering the corporation
to lay gas conduits in streets, on such consent, the court
said: "It operates to create a franchise by which is vested
in the corporation receiving it a perpetual and indefeasible
interest in the land constituting the streets of a municipality. It is true that the franchise comes from the
State, but the act of the local authorities, who represent
the State by its permission and for that purpose, constitutes the act upon which the law operates to create the
franchise." And in Louisville v. Cumberland Telephone
Co., 224 U. S. 649, 659, where a corporation was authorized to erect poles, etc., over the streets with the consent
of the General Council of the City, it was held that the
charter franchises became 'fully operative' when the
City's consent was obtained. "Such a street franchise
has been called by various names-an incorporeal hereditament, an interest in land, an easement, a right of waybut, howsoever designated, it is property." 224 U. S.,

ordinance granting the right to place and maintain upon
the streets of the city poles and wires of such a company is
the granting of a property right, has been too many times
decided by this court to need more than a reference to some
of the later cases." See also Boise Water Co. v. Boise City,
230 U. S. 84, 91. These municipal consents are intended
to afford the basis of enterprise with reciprocal advantages, and it would be virtually impossible to fulfil the
manifest intent of the legislature and to secure the benefits expected to flow from the privileges conferred, if, in
the initial stages of the enterprise when the necessary proceedings preliminary to the execution of the proposed
work are being taken with due promptness, or when the
work is under way, the municipal consent should be sub:
ject to revocation at any time by the authorities,-not
upon the ground that the contract had not been performed, or that any condition thereof, express or implied,
had been broken, but because as yet no contract whatever
had been made and there was nothing but a license which
might be withdrawn at pleasure. Grants like the one under consideration are not nude pacts, but rest upon obligations expressly or impliedly assumed to carry on the undertaking to which they relate. See The Binghamton
Bridge, 3 Wall. 51, 74; Pearsallv. Great Northern Railway,
161 U. S. 646, 663, 667. They are made and received with
the understanding that the recipient is protected by a contractual right from the moment the grant is accepted and
during the course of performance as contemplated, as well
as after that performance. The case of Capital City Light
& Fuel Co. v. Tallahassee, 186 U. S.401, to which the defendant in error refers, is not -opposed. There the complainant, upon the ground of an exclusive privilege, sought
to enjoin a municipality from operating its own electric
light plant; although ten years had elapsed since the complainant's grant, the complainant had done nothing whatever to establish an electric light business and under the

express terms of the statute the exclusive privilege had
not attached (186 U. S. 410).
But, while the grant becomes effective when made and
accepted in accordance with the statute and the grantee
is thus protected in starting the enterprise, it has always
been recognized that, as the franchise is given in order
that it may be exercised for the public benefit, the failure
to exercise it as contemplated is ground for revocation or
withdrawal. In the cases where the right of revocation in
the absence of express condition has been denied, it will
be found that there has been performance at least to some
substantial extent or that the grantee is duly proceeding to
perform. And when it is said that there is vested an indefeasible interest, easement, or contract right, it is plainly
meant to refer to a franchise not only granted but exercised in conformity with the grant. (See cases cited
supra.) It is a tacit condition annexed to grants of franchises that they may be lost by mis-user or non-user.
Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch, 43, 51; Chicago Life Insurance
Co. v. Needles, 113 U. S. 574, 580; Given v. Wright, 117
U. S. 648, 656. The condition thus implied is, of course, a
condition subsequent. The same principle is applicable
when a municipality under legislative authority gives the
permission, which brings the franchise into being; there is
necessarily implied the condition of user. The conception
of the permission as giving rise to a right of property in no
way involves the notion that the exercise of the franchise
may be held in abeyance for an indefinite time, and that
the right may thus be treated as a permanent lien upon
the public streets, to be enforced for the advantage of the
owner at any time, however distant. Although the franchise is property, 'it is subject to defeasance or forfeiture
-by failure to exercise it (People v. Broadway R. R. Co. of
Brooklyn, 126 N. Y. 29), or by subsequent abandonment
after it has been exercised (People v. Albany & Vermont
R. R. Co., 24 N. Y. 261).' If 'no time is prescribed, the

franchise must be exercised within a reasonable time.'
City of New York v. Bryan, 196 N. Y. 158, 164.
It follows that where the franchise has not been exercised within a reasonable time in accordance with the
condition which inheres in the nature of the grant, its
revocation upon this ground cannot be regarded as an
impairment of contractual obligation. The privileges
conferred may be withdrawn by such methods of procedure
as are consistent with established legal principles. This
rule, frequently recognized in cases where franchises have
been abused or misemployed (see Chicago Life Insurance
Co. v. Needles, supra; FarmersLoan & Trust Co. v. Galesburg, 133 U. S. 156, 179; New Orleans Water Works Co. v.
Louisiana, 185 U. S. 336, 347; Columbus v. Mercantile
Trust &c. Co. of Baltimore, 218 U. S. 645, 663; Dillon,
Munic. Corp., 5th ed., ยง 1311), must also be applicable
where they have been neglected, that is, have not been
used in due time. Whether in such cases, where there has
been a municipal permission for use of streets, the State
shall proceed directly by quo warranto, or whether it shall
authorize: the municipality to pass a resolution or ordinance of repeal or revocation leaving the propriety of its
course to be determined in an appropriate legal proceeding
in which the default of the grantee may be adjudicated,
is a question of state law with which we are not concerned.
The resolution in such case serves to define the attitude of
the public authorities, and to revoke the permission where
pufficient ground exists for such revocation. Whether
there has been such a mis-use or non-exercise of the franchise as to warrant its withdrawal is a matter for judicial
consideration.
In the present case, the plaintiff in error, insisting upon
its continuing right, despite the resolution of revocation,
applied for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel
the Subway Company-a quasi-public instrumentalityto furnish the desired space in its conduits. It had been

held by the state court that this was an available remedy
where a company had 'lawful power' to operate its conductors in the City's streets and had been denied the space
which the Subway Company by its contract with the City
had agreed to give. Matter of Longacre El. L. & P. Co.,
188 N. Y. 361. The question of 'lawful power' of the
plaintiff in error was considered and the application refused. It is true that it was stated that there was a license
only which by reason of non-performance had not ripened
into a contract right, but it is equally true that the nonperformance shown was available to defeat that right,
assuming it to have been created at the time of the grant,
and to make the resolution of revocation-which the state
court has held was adopted under state authority-entirely
proper.
For a long period of years after the final determination
of the validity of the statutes authorizing a comprehensive
scheme of subway construction, and after the contract
with the Subway Company had been made, the plaintiff
in error made no attempt to secure space and to exercise
the franchise now claimed. It treated that right as susceptible of practically indefinite retention unused. In the
circumstances disclosed, its excuses are unavailing. The
right conferred, assuming it to be a contract right, was to
be used within a reasonable time or lost. In view of the
state of the case as to non-exercise, it cannot be said that
its constitutional right has been infringed.
Judgment affirmed.
