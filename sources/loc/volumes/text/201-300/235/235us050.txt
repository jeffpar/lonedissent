statutes, as to which, we follow the decision of the state
court. Even if the court had overruled earlier decisions
it would have interfered with no vested rights of the
plaintiffs in error. Knox v. Exchange Bank, 12 Wall. 379,
383. Sauer v. New York, 206 U. S. 536. Moore-Mansfield
Construction Co. v. Electrical Installation Co., 234 U. S.
619, 626. But it does not appear to have done so, and
although its decision may have been unexpected, there was
plausible ground for it in the statutes. We go no further,
because there is no question before us of the kind that was
before the court in Muhlker v. New York & Harlem R. R.
Co., 197 U. S. 544, and Tampa Water Works Co. v. Tampa,
199 U. S. 241, 243, and in circumstances like these it is not
within our province to inquire whether the construction
was right. It is objected that less was allowed for the
land taken than was charged for the benefit, but it is
quite possible that the benefit was greater than the loss,
and we cannot inquire into the fact.

In order to bring a case to this court under § 237, Judicial Code, the
Federal right must have been set up and adjudicated against the

of § 10, of Art. I of the Federal Constitution must be by subtequent
legislation and not by mere change in judicial decision.
A certificate of the state court cannot bring an additional Federal
question into the record, if the record does not otherwise show it to

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of this court
under § 237, Judicial Code, to review the judgment of a
state court, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Newton D. Baker and Mr. John N. Stockwell for
defendant in error in support of the motion:
No Federal question is presented by the assignment of
errors, nor was any Federal question specifically set up in
the Supreme Court of Ohio.
No change in decision has in fact taken place.
No Federal question was decided in the Supreme Court
of Ohio, and the judgment rests upon independent grounds
of purely state law sufficient to support it.
Mr. William B. Sanders and Mr. Harold T. Clark for
plaintiffs in error in opposition to the motion:
The record clearly shows that the Supreme Court of
Ohio did consider whether or not the effect of its decision
would be to impair the obligation of the contract involved.
It was the contention of the railroads that under the
contract of September 13, 1849, the city of Cleveland
parted with its title to what was formerly known as
Bath Street. In reliance upon the validity of this contract
the railroad companies expended upwards of $1,000,000
in permanent improvements and betterments upon the
property covered by the contract. It was the ,contention
of the city that under the construction placed by the
Supreme Court of Ohio in the cases mentioned upon
the statutes of Ohio governing the making of contracts
between municipalities and railroad companies as to the

occupancy of streets and public grounds-th6 act of 1852
being the act before the court in those cases-the railroads
acquired under the contract of September 13, 1849, only
the right to the use and occupancy of Bath Street in so far
as it did not disturb the public use. The Ohio courts
approved the position taken by the city, and, although
recognizing the existence of the contract of September 13,
1849, sought so to limit it in its operation as to seriously
impair its value.
In order that a contract may be impaired, it is not
necessary that it should be wholly done away with.
Where it is claimed that a State by its subsequent legislative act as construed by the state courts has impaired
the obligation of a prior contract, the Supreme Court of
the United States has the right, even in a case which
comes to it upon a writ of error to a state court, to construe the contract and to determine whether its obligation has been impaired.

Opinion of the Court.

Memorandum opinion by MR. JUSTICE DAY, by direction of the court.
The original action was brought by the city of Cleveland, Ohio, to oust the railroad companies, now plaintiffs
in error, from the exclusive possession of Bath Street, in
that city. A number of'defenses were set up by the railroad companies, but we are concerned only with the alleged deprivation of Federal right, resulting from the
decision of the state court. In the court of original jurisdiction, the Common Pleas, judgment was rendered iii
favor of the city. Upon proceedings in error, that judgment was affirmed by the state Circuit Court, and in the
Supreme Court of the State of Ohio the judgment of the
Circuit Court was affirmed without opinion.
It is now undertaken to bring the case here, because of
alleged violation of rights under the Federal Constitution
arising by virtue of § 10 of Article I of that instrument,
preventing the impairment of contract rights by subsequent legislation.
In order to bring a case here under § 237 of the Judicial
Code (formerly § 709 of the Revised Statutes of the
United States), it is well settled that the Federal right
must have been set up and adjudicated against the claimant by the judgment of the state court. It is equally well
settled that the contention made and passed upon in the
state court cannot be enlarged by assignments of error
made to bring the case to this court. This proposition is
too well settled to need discussion. National Bank v.
Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353; Re Spies, 123 U. S. 131; Zadig V.
Baldwin, 166 U. S. 485; Oxley Stave Company v. Butler
County, 166 U. S. 648; Waters-Pierce Oil Company v.
Texas, 212 U. S. 112; Mallers v. Commercial Loan & Trust
Company, 216 U. S. 613; Appleby v. Buffalo, 221 U. S. 524.
It is equally well settled that an impairment of the
obligation of the contract, within the meaning of the

Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

Federal Constitution, must be by subsequent legislation,
and no mere change in judicial decision will amount to
such deprivation. Ross v. Oregon, 227 U. S. 150, 161;
Moore-Mansfield Construction Company v. Electrical Installation Company, 234 U. S. 619, 624; and cases cited on
p. 625. An examination of the record shows that the
Federal right set up in the Court of Common Pleas, and
considered in the Circuit Court, the latter judgment being
affirmed by the Supreme Court without opinion, concerned an alleged change of decision in the Supreme Court
of Ohio, construing a statute concerning the contract
upon which the railroad companies relied, the effect of
which, it was alleged, would be to do violence to the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. It was not set
up that subsequent legislation had impaired the obligation of the contract of the railroad companies. Therefore, in the light of the decisions, of this court above
quoted, no Federal right was alleged to be impaired within
the meaning of the Constitution of the United States, and
no such right was passed upon in the decisions of the
courts.
The contention is made that the presence of the Federal
right set up and denied as violative of this clause of the
Constitution is shown by the certificate of the Supreme
Court, contained in its journal entry affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court. An examination of the certificate, however, does not show that any contention
that contract rights were impaired by subsequent state
legislation, was passed upon adversely to the railroad
companies, but shows only that the contention was that
the claim of the city, in respect to the contract of September 13, 1849, sustained by the judgment of the Circuit
Court, and affirmed by the Supreme Court, was in contravention of the defendants' rights under said contract,
and impaired their rights under said contract, in violation
of the Constitution of the United States, particularly the

tenth section of Article I thereof; "which said claims fully
appear in the pleadings and record herein, and that such
claims were considered by the court and decided adversely
to said plaintiffs in error." The character of the claims
thus made we have already described. Moreover, a mere
certificate of this character cannot bring an additional
question into the record, where the record does not otherwise show it to exist. Marvin v. Trout, 199 U. S..212.
It follows that the writ of error must be dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES took no part in the consideration

and decision of this case.

UNITED STATES v. MAYER, JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 462.

Argued October 22, 23, 1914.-Decided November 16, 1914.

While their jurisdiction is exclusively appellate, Circuit Courts of
Appeals may issue writs which are properly auxiliary to their appellate power.
While this court may not be required through a certificate under § 239,
Judicial Code, to pass upon questions of fact or mixed questions of
law and fact, or to accept a transfer of the whole case, or to answer
questions of objectionable generality, a definite question of law may
be submitted even if decisive of the controversy.
The general principle obtains, in the absence of statuteproviding otherwise, that a court cannot set aside or alter its final judgment after
the expiration of the term at which it was entered unless the proceeding for that purpose was begun during that term; and this case
does not fall within the exceptions to that rule.
