SCOTTEN v. LITTLEFIELD.
235 U. S.

Argument for Appellee.

SCOTTEN v. LITTLEFIELD, TRUSTEE OF BROWN,
BANKRUPT.
APPEAL FROM CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 439. Motion to dismiss or affirm submitted October 13,1914.-Decided
December 14, 1914.
Bills of review are on two grounds: first, error of law apparent on the
face of the record without further examination of matter of fact;
second, new facts discovered since the decree, which should materially affect the decree and probably induce a different result.
An aspect of the claim involved cannot be held back when the case is
presented to the court and later made the subject of a bill of review.
Although the decision of the District Court which determined the case
sought to be reviewed is alleged to have been decided upon princip es
inconsistent with a subsequent decision by this court, the subseque at
decision will not lay the foundation for a bill of review for errors of
law apparent, or for new matter in pais discovered since the dec se
and requiring a different result.
213 Fed. Rep. 705, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the principles of law upon
which bills of review are granted and their application .to
this case, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Daniel P. Hays for appellee, in support of the
motion:
No appeal lies to this court from the decree dismissing
the bill of review. A bill of review cannot be filed after
the time to appeal has expired. At the time of filing the
bill of review the time to appeal had long since expired.
Thomas v. Harvey, 10 Wheat. 146.
There is no error of law apparent upon the face of the
record. The decree now said to be erroneous has been
affirmed by this court upon the direct appeal of and

against the attack of these appellants. First National
Bank v. Littlefield, 226 U. S. 78.
The error of law must be apparent upon the face of the
record and not upon evidence outside of the record.
Bu#iington v. Harvey, 95 U. S. 99.
The suggestion that this court has changed its rulings in
regard to reclamation proceedings and cases of the kind at
bar is not tenable. Littlefield v. Gorman, 229 U. S. 19,
Las no application to the facts presented in the case at
har, and see FirstNational Bank v. Littlefield, 226 U. S. 78;
Schuyler v. Littlefield, 232 U. S. 466.
It is no ground for filing a bill of review that the court
has changed its rulings. Tilghamv. Werk, 39 Fed. Rep. 680.
Mr. Thorndike Saunders for appellant, in opposition to
the motion:
This appeal is within this court's jurisdiction. It brings
up dismissal of bill of review to modify order of denying
reclamations of 300 shares U. S. Steel Co. stock. The
authoritative decision on which the case was decided was
subsequently reversed by this court, 229 U. S. 19, on
authority of Richardson v. Shaw, 209 U. S. 365. This
newly arisen fact is the basis of this bill of review. It is
not new law, nor is it a change of the ruling of the Supreme
Court. If this reversal had occurred before, the decision
below in this case would have been different.
Appellants' claims for the Steel Company stock were
severable from their claims for other stocks; they were so
treated by the master and by the District Court.
Appellants' counsel meanwhile presented the appeal
which was decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals and
subsequently appealed from their decision to this Supreme
Court.
Appellants could not trace their Steel Company shares
of stock; their claims were as to stock in control of bankrupts by restoration, as in Gorman. So considering the

Opinion of the Court.

remedies and the situation, they preferred to rest that
claim till final decision of the Gorman appeal.
Appellants joined the traced proceeds of their other stocks
with the First National Bank of Princeton in their appeal
to this court, and there was no waiver of these Steel Company stock claims.

JUSTICE DAY,

by direc-

This case presents another phase of the bankruptcy of
A. 0. Brown & Company, stock brokers in New York.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

See First National Bank of Princetonv. Littlefield, Trustee,
226 U. S. 110; Gorman v. Littlefield, 229 U. S. 19; Schuyler
v. Littlefield, 232 U. S. 707. This case is submitted on the
motion of appellee to dismiss, affirm, or place on the summary docket. The appellants filed a petition for reclamation in the bankruptcy court, which concerned among
other stocks three hundred shares of United States Steel
stock, which are now the subject-matter of this controversy. On April 20, 1911, the District Court confirmed
the report of the Master, and entered an -order dismissing
the petitions of appellants and of some other claimants.
Appellants appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals,
and that court affirmed the District Court, 193 Fed. Rep.
24. The case then came to this court, and the judgment of
the Court of Appeals was affirmed, 226 U. S. 110. On
August 4,1913, the bill of review with which the present
proceeding is concerned, was filed in the District Court.
This was more than two years after the original order in
the District Court, dismissing the reclamation proceeding,
was made. The District Court dismissed the bill of
review, 213 Fed. Rep. 701. That decree was affirmed in
the Circuit Court of Appeals, 213 Fed. Rep. 705. Then
the case was appealed here.
Both courts below put their decisions on the ground that
the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals from the
original order of the District Court in the reclamation
proceedings really involved the claim for the United
States Steel stock in its present aspect, and that if not
presented to the Court of Appeals when there on appeal
it could not be held back and made the subject of a bill of
review, as is now attempted to be done. We think this
decision was clearly right. Furthermore, the ground
alleged for the bill of review now is, that the principles
which determined the disposition of the Gorman Case,
229 U. S. 19 (decided May 26, 1913, a little more than
two years after the decree in the District Court) reversing

SCOTTEN v. LITTLEFIELD.
235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the Circuit Court of Appeals in the same case, 175 Fed
Rep. 769, would, had they been applied in this.case, have
required a different result in the District Court in dealing
with the original petition in reclamation, so far as the
three hundred shares of the United States Steel stock,
pledged with the Hanover National Bank, are concerned.
Bills of review are on two grounds; first, error of law
apparent dn the face of the record without further examination of matters of fact; second, new facts discovered
since the decree, which should materially affect the
decree and probably induce a different result. 2 Bates'
Federal Equity Procedure, 762; Street's Federal Equity
Practice, Vol. 2, ยง 2151.
If the decision in the Gorman Case would have required
a different result if the principles upon which it was decided had been applied in the original proceeding, which
we do not find it necessary to decide, such subsequent
decision will not lay the foundation for a bill of review for
errors of law apparent, or for new matter in pais discovered
since the decree and probably requiring a different result.

Jackson, afterwards Mr. Justice Jackson of this court);
Hoffman v. Knox, Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth
Circuit, 50 Fed. Rep. 484, 491 (opinion by Chief Justice
Fuller).
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
