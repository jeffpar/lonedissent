errands has an element of distinction which the employer
may recognize by agreeing that such service shall commence when the employee leaves his home on the duty assigned to him and shall continue until his return. And
agreement to that effect may be either express or be shown
by the course of business. In such case the hazards of the
journey may properly be regarded as hazards of the seryice and hence within the purview of the Compensation
Act.2

The decree of the Court of Appeals is reversed and that
of the Supreme Court of the District is affirmed.

CERTIoRARI* 287 U. S. 586, to review judgments of the
Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed the judgments
of the District Court solely upon the ground that the
bills of exceptions had not been properly authenticated
and that it was too late to send them back for amendment.
Mr. Lee M. Friedman, with whom Mr. Louis B. King
was on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Martin Witte, with whom Messrs. Lowell A.
Mayberry and Robert Gallagher were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of
the Court.
In these actions at law, tried together before District
Judge James A. Lowell and a jury, respondent obtained
judgments and petitioner appealed to the Circuit Court
of Appeals. The records on the appeals contained what
purported to be bills of exceptions signed by the attorneys
for the respective parties and initialed by the District
Judge as follows: "Allowed August 20, 1930, J. A. L.,
D. J." The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgments upon the sole ground that the bills of exceptions
were not sufficiently authenticated and that it was too late
to send the cases back for amendment as the term for
which the judgments were entered had expired and the
District Court had lost jurisdiction. 57 F. (2d) 44. This
Court granted certiorari.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

288 U.S.

There is no question that District Judge Lowell affixed
his initials to the bills of exceptions and intended in this
manner to authenticate them as allowed. Apparently in
connection with petitioner's application for a rehearing
in the Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Lowell addressed
a communication to the judges of that court stating that
the bills had been seasonably presented to him and that
he had signed them with his initials intending that they
should have full legal effect; he requested that the bills
should be returned to him for correction.1 There was also.
submitted to the Circuit Court of Appeals a certificate
by the clerk of the District Court in which it was stated:
"It has been the practice in this district for a long time
for judges, the clerk and deputy clerks and the bar to treat
as sufficiently allowed for appellate purposes bills of exceptions signed by the trial judge with either his full name
or his initials." The petition for rehearing was denied.
Under the statute of Westminster 2,13 Edw. I, c. 31, it
was essential that exceptions should be authenticated by
the seal of the trial justice. Enfield v. Hills, 2 Lev. 236;
2 Inst. 427, 428; 2 Bac. Abr., 326, 327; 2 Tidd's Pr., 789;
Nalle v. Oyster, 230 U. S. 165, 176; Krauss Bros. Co. v.
'District Judge Lowell's communication contained the following:
"It has been called to my attention that I signed the bills of exceptions in the above two cases with my initials only instead of with my
full signature. They were seasonably presented to me for allowance
and I told counsel for the Appellant presenting them, after examination of them, that I allowed them, did nothing more with respect to
them in counsel's presence and counsel departed. I later signed them
intending so to sign them that they should have their full intended
legal effect but not knowing any better I signed them only with my
initials; that was my personal mistake to which neither the Appellant
nor its counsel in any way contributed. I desire if I have the power
and your permission now to correct my personal inadvertence by completing my signature so that my allowance of each bill may have my
full signature and as of August 20, 1930. I therefore request, so far as
I properly may, that the record be returned to the District Court for
such correction by me as now within my power to make."

Opinion of the Court.

Mellon, 276 U. S. 386, 389, 390. In the practice of the
federal courts, however, it was held that a seal was unnecessary, the signature of the trial judge being sufficient.
Genere8 v. Campbell, 11 Wall. 193, 198; Herbertv. Butler,
97 U. 8. 319, 320. Compare Mussina v. Cavazos, 6 Wall.
355, 363; Young v. Martin, 8 Wall. 354, 357. -The Act of
June 1, 1872, c. 255, § 4 (17 Stat. 197, R. S., § 953)
expressly dispensed with the necessity of a seal but retained the requirement of the signature of the judge of
the court in which the cause was tried. Herbert v. Butler,
supra; Malony v. Adsit, 175 U. S. 281, 286, 287; Krauss
Bros. Co. v. Mellon, supra. As amended by the Act of
June 5, 1900, c. 717 (31 Stat. 270, 28 U. S. C. 776), the
statute provides for the signature of another judge of the
court in certain contingencies.'
Section 953 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of
June 5, 1900, c. 717, 31 Stat. 270, 28 U. S. C. 776, provides:
"A bill of exceptions allowed in any cause shall be deemed sufficiently authenticated if signed by the judge of the court in which
the cause was tried, or by the presiding judge thereof if more than
one judge sat at the trial of the cause, without any seal of the court
or judge annexed thereto. And in-case the judge before whom the
cause has heretofore been or may hereafter be tried is, by reason of
death, sickness, or other disability, unable to hear and pass upon the
motion for a new trial and allow and sign said bill of exceptions, then
the judge who succeds such trial judge, or any other judge of the court
in which the cause was tried, holding such court thereafter, if the
evidence in such cause has been or is taken in stenographic notes, or
if the said judge is satisfied by any other means that he can pass
upon such motion and allow a'true bill of exceptions, shall pass upon
said motion and allow and sign such bill of exceptions; and his ruling
upon such motion and allowance and signing of such bill of exceptions
shall be as valid as if such ruling and allowance and signing of such
bill of exceptions had been made by the judge before whom such cause
was tried; but in case said judge is satisfied that owing to the fact
that he did not preside at the trial, or for any other cause, that, he
can not fairly pass upon said motion, and allow and sign said bill of
exceptions, then he may in his discretion grant a new trial to the party
moving therefor."

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

288 U.S.

The statute does not prescribe the form of signature.
The manifest purpose is authentication by the proper
judge. In the absence of such authentication there is no
bill of exceptions which the appellate court may consider.
Malony v. Adsit, supra; Metropolitan Railroad Co. v.
District of Columbia, 195 U. S. 322, 330; McCuing v.
Bovay, 60 F. (2d) 375, 376; compare Christy v. Pridgeon,
4 Wall. 196, 201, 202. Appropriate disapproval of the
practice of signing by initials such important documents
as bills of exceptions, and insistence upon a method of
signature more in keeping with the formal character of
the proceeding, do not reach the question now presented.
That question is not whether the signature is informal but
whether there is a signature. If the attempted authentication by Judge Lowell be deemed to be merely informal
or irregular, but not a nullity, the defect could be disregarded or cured by amendment. R.S. § 954, 28 U. S. C. 777.
See, also, 28 U. S. C. 391. Thus, in Idaho & Oregon Land
Co. v. Bradbury, 132 U. S. 509, the clerk of the court
below in attempting to authenticate the record had appended the seal of the court but had failed to comply with
the rule of this Court in affixing his signature. The Court
said (p. 513): "The question presented is not one of no
authentication, but of irregular or imperfect authentication; not of jurisdiction, but of practice. It is therefore
within the discretion of this court to allow the defect to be
supplied." And as it appeared to be then "too late to
take a new appeal or writ of error," the Court permitted
the record to be withdrawn "for the purpose of having the
certificate of authentication perfected by adding the signature of the clerk." A defect or inaccuracy in mere
matters of form can be corrected notwithstanding the end
of the term. United States v. Mayer, 235 U. S. 55, 67.
The Circuit Court of Appeals felt constrained to reach
its conclusion, that the attempted authentication was a
nullity, by reason of the decisions of this Court in Origet

OHL & CO. v. SMITH IRON WORKS.

Opinion of the Court.

v. United States, 125 U. S. 240, 243, 244 and Kinney v.
U. S. Fidelity Co., 222 U. S. 283, 284. Neither of these
decisions is strictly in point. In the Origet case, at the
foot of a paper entitled "Bill of Exceptions," appeared
the 'following: "Allowed and ordered on file November
22, '83. A. B." Referring to the Act of 1872 (R. S.,
§ 953) the Court said: " This provision merely dispensed
with the seal. The necessity for the signature still remains. We can not regard the initials 'A. B.' as the signature of the judge, or as a sufficient authentication of
the bill of exceptions, or as sufficient evidence of its allowance by the judge or the court. Therefore the questions
purporting to be raised by the paper cannot be considered." In the Kinney case, the record did not contain
any bill of exceptions. There was a paper styled
"Exceptions to the charge to jury," which was initialed
"J. B. McP. trial judge" and signed by the plaintiff.
The Court said that this paper was "not a bill of exceptions," citing the Origet case, but the Court added that
"if it were to be treated as a bill of exceptions" it could
not avail, as all the matters in question "depended upon
examination of the evidence which is not in the record "
and hence the Court had "no means of determining
whether reversible error arose from the action of the
court on any of the subjects to which the paper refers."
Thus, in the Kinney case the present question was not
necessarily involved, and in the Origet case the Court was
unable to regard the initials as the signature of the judge.
In the instant case, it appears that the trial judge did
affix his initials in order to authenticate the bills of exceptions and he added the initials "D. J." for the obvious
purpose of referring to his office and characterizing his
action as official. So far as the statements in the opinions
of the Origet and Kinney cases may be taken to imply
that such an authentication by the trial judge is void
and that bills of exceptions so allowed cannot be consid-

ered, or the informality be corrected, the statements are
not approved.
The statute contains no indication that the word" sign"
is used in other than the ordinary sense. The statute
gives neither definition nor qualification. Signature by
initials has been held to be sufficient under the Statute
of Frauds 8 and the Statute of Wills and in other transactions.' It has been held in some States ' that a different
rule obtains in the case of the official signature of certain
judicial officers, but the Congress has not established such
a rule for the judges of the federal courts. Nor, in the
absence of special statutory requirement, is there a uniform custom in relation to official signatures. It may be
assumed that a requirement of the officer's signature,
without more, means that he shall write his name or his
distinctive appellation, but the question remains as to
what writing of that character is to be deemed sufficient
for the purpose of authenticating his official act. There
is no rule that he shall adhere to the precise form of his
name as it appears in his commission. The full name of

Opinion of the Court.

the officer may or may not be used. Not infrequently
Christian names are omitted, in part or altogether, or are
abbreviated or indicated by initials. In some of the most
important communications on behalf of the Federal Government, only the surname of the officer is used. When
an officer authenticates his official act by affixing his initials he does not entirely omit to use his name; he simply
abbreviates it, he uses a combination of letters which are
part of it. Undoubtedly that method is informal, but we
think that it is clearly a method of "signing." -It cannot
be said in such a case that he has utterly failed to "sign,"
so that his authentication of his official act, in the absence
of further statutory requirement, is to be regarded as
absolutely void.
We do not approve the signing of bills of exceptions
merely by the initials of the judge, but we regard the question as one of practice,-of regularity, not of validity. In
the instant cases, the District Judge authenticated his
allowance of the bills of exceptions by a form of signature
easily and actually identified as his. No one was misled
or injured. We perceive no reason why petitioner should
lose its right to have the rulings upon the trial appropriately reviewed by the appellate court, merely because
the District Judge failed to sign his full name. This is
precisely the sort of defect which the Congress has provided shall not impair the substantial rights of the parties.
28 U. S. C. 391. At most, in the interest of a better practice, the bills of exceptions could have been returned for
a more formal signature, but even that course was not
necessary.
The judgments are reversed and the causes are remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for hearing upon
the merits.
