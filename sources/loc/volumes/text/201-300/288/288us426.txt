CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THI
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 518.

Argued February 15, 1933.--Decided March 13, 1933.

1. Clause (2) of paragraph (e) of § 278 of the Revenue Act of 1924,
which declares that that section shall not "affect any assessment
made . . . before the enactment of this Act," does not render inoperative the provisions of paragraph (c) of the same section authorizing waivers, with respect to taxes of which the assessment had
been made but the collection had become barred prior to the date
of the Act. P. 428.
2. Waivers given after the date of the Revenue Act of 1924 with
respect to the collection of taxes barred before that date, are not
invalid under clause (1), paragraph (e) of § 278 of that Act. See

Opinion of the Court.

assessment waivers where the period for assessment had
expired before the effective date of the Act of 1924. This
case involves the effect of that section on collection
waivers where the period for collection had expired before
the effective date of the Act of 1924, but where the assessment had been timely and before the Act.
On May 13, 1929, Pacific Coast Steel Company brought
this action in the federal court for northern California,
to recover the amount paid as additional income and
excess profits taxes for the year 1917. The return for
that year was made, and the tax thereby shown to be due
was paid, on March 30, 1918. On December 9, 1922,
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined a deficiency of $257,443.30; and on February 9, 1923, he assessed that amount against the plaintiff. Thus the assessment was made within five years from the date of the
filing of the return and before expiration of the period
allowed therefor by § 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of
1921. Thereafter, by proceedings in the Bureau, the
amount of the claimed deficiency was reduced to $129,920.06 through credits of overpayments of other years.
For that amount the Commissioner made demand on
July 16, 1927; that is, more than five years after the date
of the taxpayer's return, in 1918. The Government relied,
as extending the period for collection, upon a waiver given
on December 7, 1925; that is, more than five years after
the return.
The District Court, without opinion, entered judgment
for the defendant. The Circuit Court of Appeals held
that the waiver, though in terms extending the time for
assessment, was effective to extend that for collection; and
that the waiver was valid under § 278 of the Revenue Act
of 1924. The judgment of the District Court was accordingly affirmed. 61 F. (2d) 73. This Court granted-certiorari, "limited to the question of the effect of section
278 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1924." 287 U. S.595.

Opinion of the Court.

The petitioner contends that clause (2) of paragraph
(e) of § 278, which states that the section shall not "affect
any assessment made, or distraint or proceeding in court
begun, before the enactment of this Act," renders paragraph (c) inoperative in the case at bar; that the waiver
therefore had no statutory authority and was of no effect.
The Government insists, in answer to this contention, that
even if clause (2) thus qualifies paragraph (c),' the waiver
is nevertheless valid either without express statutory authority or under the authority of the Revenue Act of 1921,
§ 250 (d),' which, it is argued, remained in force by virtue
of § 1100 (d) of the Act of 1924. We do not pass upon
this contention of the Government; for we are of opinion
that paragraph (c) is not rendered inoperative'by clause
(2) of paragraph (e).
The meaning of clause (2) was considered in Russell v.
United States, 278 U. S. 181. It was there pointed out
"(c) Where both the Commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to the assessment of the tax after the time prescribed
in section 277 for its assessment the tax may be assessed at any time
prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon." Act of June 2,
1924, c. 234, § 278 (c), 43 Stat. 253, 300.
'"(d) .

.

. the amount of any such taxes due under any return

made under this act for prior taxable years or under prior income,
excess-profits, or war-profits tax Acts ....

shall be determined and

assessed within five years after the return was filed, unless both the
Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax;

. . ."

Act of November

23, 1921, c. 136, § 250 (d), 42 Stat. 227, 265.
*"(b) The parts of the Revenue Act of 1921 which are repealed by
this Act shall (except as provided in sections 280 and 316 and except
as otherwise specifically provided in this Act) remain in force for . . .
the assessment and collection, to the extent provided in the Revenue
Act of 1921, of all taxes imposed by prior income, war-profits, or
excess-profits tax acts, and for the assessment, imposition, and collection of all interest, penalties, or forfeitures which have accrued or may
accrue in relation to any such taxes ...

§ 1100 .(b), 43 Stat. 253, 352.

Opinion of the Court.

that the distinction in the Act of 1924 between existing
and subsequent assessments derived significance from the
contemporaneous creation of the Board of Tax Appeals.
Assessments made after June 2, 1924, "generally at least,
if objected to, could not be made without assent of the
Board. To secure proper action by the Board might require considerable time, and this was provided for by
extending the limitation to six years after assessment."
278 U. S. at 186. Where an assessment was made before
the Act, the reason for the extension did not exist. In
the case of waivers, no such considerations exist to indicate that Congress intended to distinguish between assessments made before and those made after the Act. It
was held in the Russell case that to-apply paragraph (d),
extending the period for collection to six years after assessment, to an assessment made before the Act, would
"affect" that assessment, and hence was forbidden by
clause (2) of paragraph (e). Such an application, it was
said, "would be retroactive; and certainly it would produce radical change in the existing status of the claim
against the petitioners-would extend for some five years
a liability which had almost expired." 278 U. S. at 187.
In the case at bar no such effect follows upon a recognition of the waiver. The claim against the petitioners
was barred, it is true, at the time of the enactment of the
1924 Act; but even before the Act the claim was subject
to revival by waiver of the statute of limitations. We are
of opinion, therefore, that paragraph (c) does not "affect" the assessment in the case at bar so as to be
rendered inoperative by clause (2) of paragraph (e).
There remains the question of the effect of clause (1)
of paragraph (e), which provides that § 278 shall not
authorize an assessment or collection already barred at
the effective date of the 1924 Act. This is the same question considered in the McDonnell case, ante, p. 420, with
respect to assessment waivers, and for the reasons there

1. When instalments of war-risk insurance and disability compensation are paid to the guardian appointed under the state law, the

money ceases to be money of the United States; and if it be deposited by the guardian in a bank that becomes insolvent, R. S.

2. In respect of such moneys so paid and deposited, the guardian is
not an agency or instrumentality of the United States. P. 436.
