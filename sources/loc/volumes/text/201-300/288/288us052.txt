HAWKS ET AL. v. HAMILL ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 147. Argued December 9, 1932.-Decided January 9, 1933.
Claiming a perpetual franchise under Oklahoma statutes to maintain
and operate a toll bridge constructed by them over a navigable
stream, plaintiffs sued state and county officers, in the federal court,
to restrain threatened interference. Jurisdiction rested on diversity
of citizenship. The case did not involve any claim of federal right,
nor the right of the plaintiffs to remove the bridge. It depended
on the purely local question whether the franchise was void ab
initio under the state constitution. Held:
1. As construed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, the provision of the state constitution prohibiting "perpetuities," (Art. II,
§ 32,) includes franchises such as the perpetual franchise to operate
a toll bridge. P. 55.
2. The federal court will follow the clear and unequivocal opinion
of the state court to this effect, even though uttered after the date
of the franchise and as a considered dictum rather than a definitive
decision. P. 56.
3. Federal courts are especially reluctant to restrain the activities
of state officers where the rights set up by plaintiffs are strictly
local and jurisdiction has no other basis than the accident of residence,-the'case must be clear. P. 60.
58 F. (2d) 41, reversed.
District Court affirmed.

state and county officers and other persons from threatened interference with the maintenance and operation of

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. W. C. Lewis, Assistant Attorney General of
Oklahoma, and Purman Wilson, with whom Mr. J. Berry
King, Attorney General, was on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Charles B. Cochran, with whom Mr. Lessing
Rosenthal was on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The respondents, claiming to be the owners of a perpetual franchise to collect tolls for the use of a bridge
across the Canadian River, brought suit in the United
States District Court against the members of the State
Highway Commission of Oklahoma, the Attorney General of that State, the County Attorneys of McClain and
Cleveland Counties, and other persons, residents of the
neighborhood, to restrain a threatened interference with
the maintenance of the bridge or the collection of tolls.
The jurisdiction of the federal court was invoked upon
the ground of diversity of citizenship. The defendants
(petitioners in this court) made a motion, without
answering, to dismiss the complaint. The complainants
moved at the same time for an injunction pendente lite.
The District Court denied the motion for an injunction,
and granted the motion to dismiss. The Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the decree and
directed judgment in favor of the complainants for the
relief demanded in the complaint. 58 F. (2d) 41. A writ
of certiorari brings the case here.
The facts exhibited in the bill are. these. On April 22,
1911, the Oounty Commissioners of McClain County,
Oklahoma, adopted a resolution whereby there was
granted to-Carter and Halsell, or their assigns, a franchise
to construct and operate a toll bridge across the Canadian
River at the City of Purcell, the bridge to be erected within
the time prescribed 'by law. The tolls enumerated in a

schedule were not to be increased "by the bridge company," though they might be reduced. By the terms of the
resolution, the grant was to be "perpetual," subject only
to such limitations as were provided by law. The grantees were to be at liberty to transfer their rights and privileges to "any individual or corporation," with the same
effect as if the grant had been made to the assigns directly.
On May 16, 1911, the County Commissioners of Cleveland
County on the other side of the Canadian River adopted
a like resolution for the grant of a like franchise to the
same grantees. On May 18, 1911, Carter, one of the
grantees, together with Walling and Hamill, the present
respondents, caused a corporation, known as the PurcellLexington Toll Bridge Company, to be organized under
the laws of Oklahoma, with a corporate life of twenty
years. Thereafter in December, 1911, while the bridge
was in course of construction, the grantees of the franchises, together with the respondents, conveyed the bridge,
its approaches and all the rights and privileges embraced
within the franchises or either of them to the PurcellLexington Toll Bridge Company, its successors and
assigns. The corporate life of the Purcell-Lexington Toll
Bridge Company was to expire, as we have seen, on May
18, 1931. Before that time, and on April .2, 1931, the
bridge company conveyed to the respondents and to Carter, and their assigns, the bridge and the accompanying
franchises, the respondents receiving afterwards from
Carter an assignment of his interest, whatever it might
be. Thereupon the defendants, who are the petitioners
here, gave notice that on May 18, 1931, the bridge would
become a free bridge and part of the free highway system
of the State of Oklahoma. The members of the State
Highway Commission, the Attorney General, the County
Attorneys, as well as the neighboring residents, who, it
seems, are also the County Commissioners, announced a
purpose to prevent the collection of tolls by the respond-

ents, and to cause the bridge to be kept open for free
and unimpeded passage. This suit for an injunction
followed.
The District Court held that the County Commissioners were without authority to grant a franchise to
individuals except in trust for a corporation organized
under the bridge law; that the term of the corporate life
was also the limit of the duration of the privilege to
charge and levy tolls; that a perpetual franchise, if intended, would be void under Article II, § 32 of the Constitution of Oklahoma, prohibiting "perpetuities "; and
that the bill should be dismissed. The Circuit Court of
Appeals, in reversing this judgment, held that the franchises were not invalid because granted to individuals;
that upon assignment to a corporation organized for a
term of twenty years, the franchises were not cut down
in respect of their duration, but continued in full force
when conveyed by the assignee to others; that the term
"perpetuities" as used in Article II, § 32 of the Constitution of Oklahoma had in view the creation of future
estates and did not limit the enjoyment of a privilege or
franchise; and that the complainants should have an injunction as prayed for in the bill.
Article II, § 32 of the Constitution of Oklahoma provides: "Perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the
genius of a free government and shall never be allowed,
nor shall the law of primogeniture or entailment ever be
in force in this state." Construing that provision the
Court of Appeals said: "We do not doubt that the word
'perpetuities' . . . was not intended to mean or be
equivalent -to perpetual franchises, but was intended to
limit the power to pass titles that would vest in futuro."
But the Supreme Court of Oklahoma has not circumscribed the word so narrowly. It has said that a forbidden perpetuity is created when there is granted to an individual or corporation a perpetual privilege or franchise

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

288 US.

It has gone farther: it has said that a privilege or franchise i perpetual if indefinite in duration, though it be
subject to revocation at the pleasure of the legislature.
The question came before. the court in Okmulgee v. Okmulgee Gas Co., 140 Okla. 88; 282 Pac. 640. The legislature of Oklahoma had passed an act whereby a public
service corporation holding a franchise from a municipality for a fixed term of years was to be at liberty to
exchange it for a revocable permit. The court said that
such a permit, if viewed as a grant from the municipality,
was forbidden by Article XVIII, § 5a, which provides in
effect that no franchise shall be granted by a municipal
corporation for a longer term than twenty-five years. On
the other hand, if the permit could be viewed as one proceeding directly from the state, the court said that it
would then be a perpetuity within the prohibition of
Article II, § 32. The permit was not saved by the reservation to the legislature of a power to revoke it. In the
view of the court (p. 98), a franchise "not limited in
its existence to a fixed and definite period of years" is to
be classified as "a perpetual franchise," and hence an
unlawful perpetuity. To avoid misapprehension the
court at the end of its opinion summarized its conclusions
(p. 100). "Any act of the legislature which provides for
issuing a license, revocable permit, indeterminate permit,
or other instrument in the nature of a franchise which
is not limited as to its time of existence, violates section
32 of Article II of our Constitution." -See, to the same
effect: In re Okmulgee Gas Co., 141 Okla. 98; 284 Pac. 70;
In re Oklahoma Power Co., 141 Okla. 100; 284 Pac. .12.
We do not now determine what meaning we would give
to the Oklahoma Constitution if the question were before
us as an original one, unhampered by any pronouncement
of the courts of that state. Much can be said in support of the respondents' position that the perpetuities
denounced are those arising from the creation of future

Opinion of the Court.

estates or from restraints upon alienation without reasonable limit. The question is one distinctively local in
origin and content. The prohibition is embodied in the
local Constitution. Not only that, but it is designed to
give effect to "the genius" of the government, an impalpable existence that can best b6 apprehended and defined
by perceptions and experiences sharpened and developed
through the associations of the vicinage. " In a case
involving local history, as this does, we should be slow to
overrule the decision of courts steeped in the local tradition, even if we saw reason for doubting it." Jackman v.
Rosenbaum Co., 260 U. S. 22, 32; cf. Diaz v. Gonzalez,
261 U. S. 102, 105, 106. To define a " perpetuity" for a
young and developing community there must be recourse
to something more than the pages of a dictionary. The
word to be defined, in common with words generally, will
have a color and a content that will vary with the setting.
Towne v. Eisner, 245 U. S. 418, 425; InternationalStevedoring Co. v. Haverty, 272 U. S. 50; Surace v. Danna, 248
N. Y. 18, 21; 161 N. E. 315. It comes down to its interpreters freighted with subtle implications, with the "tacit
assumptions," the "unwritten practices," the " thousand
influences" and "values" that "logic and grammar never
could have got from the books." Diaz v. Gonzalez, supra.
Out of two or more meanings that were possible and
plausible, the State of Oklahoma has picked the one comporting best in the thought of her official spokesmen with
the" genius" of her history. The mists of our own uncertainties are scattered when pierced by this authentic evidence of the law of the locality. Chicago, M., St. P. &
P. R. Co. v. Risty, 276 U. S. 567, 570; Sioux County v.
National Surety Co., 276 U. S. 238; cf. Porterv. Investors
Syndicate, 287 U. S. 346.
We are urged by the respondents to exert a power of
independent judgment though the law to be interpreted
be a constitution or a statute, and not merely the form of

law which has come to be spoken of as general. Cf. Burgess v. Seligman, 107 U. S. 20. The power, we are told,
exists because at the grant of these franchises in 1911, the
Courts of Oklahoma had not yet spoken as to the meaning
of the Constitution by defining the "perpetuities"
within the zone of its restraints. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal
Co., 215 U. S. 349; Moore-Mansfield Construction Co. v.
Electrical Installation Co., 234 U. S. 619, 625; Edward
Hines Trustees v. Martin, 268 U. S. 458, 463. Obedience
is due to the courts of the state if the decisions claiming
fealty are so many and unequivocal as to make out a" rule
of property." Edward Hines Trustees v. Martin, supra,
at pp. 463, 464.' As to this there is no denial. The argument is that the fetters of obedience are released when
there is only a single state decision, and this subsequent
to the transaction out of which rights and duties have
developed. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., supra; Edward
Hines Trustees v. Martin, supra. One hurdle, it is said,
will be overlept if there are no barriers beyond.
Choice is not so free as the argument assumes. If the
single decision interpreting a constitution or a statute is
clear and unequivocal, submission to its holding has developed in these days into a practice so nearly uniform
that there is little need to consider whether under pressure
of extraordinary circumstances there is a privilege to deviate. Whatever doubt as to the practice may have prevailed in days gone by has been dispelled by recent judgments. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co. v. Risty, supra;
Sioux County v. National Surety Co., supra. Indeed the
radiating potencies of a decision may go beyond the actual
holding. A wise comity has decreed that deference shall
at times be owing, though there may be lacking, in the
circumstances, a strict duty of obedience. Cf. Sim v.
Edenborn, 242 U. S. 131, 135. An opinion may be soframed that there is doubt whether the part of it invoked as an authority is to be ranked as a definitive hold-

HAWKS v. HAMILL.

ing or merely a considered dictum. What was said in
Okmulgee v. Okmulgee Gas Co., supra,as to the meaning
of perpetuities was probably intended to be a definitive
holding. Cf. 141 Okla. 98; 141 id. 100. To be sure there
is room for argument that limiting distinctions will have
to be drawn in the future. We must leave it to the courts
of Oklahoma to declare what they shall be. But the result
will not be changed though the definition of perpetuities
be something less than a decision. At least it is a considered dictum, and not comment merely obiter. It has
capacity, though it be less than a decision, to tilt the balanced mind toward submission and agreement. Cf. Sim
v. Edenborn, supra; Lankford v. Platte Iron Works, 235
U. S. 461, 474. No controversy is here as to the impairment of the obligation of a contract in violation of the
restraints of the federal constitution. We are not to
confuse the standards of independent judgment appropriate in such conditions (Coombes v. Getz, 285 U. S. 434,
441; Shriver v. Woodbine Bank, 285 U. S. 467, 475) with
those appropriate where the only basis of jurisdiction is
diversity of citizenship. The Oklahoma decision as to the
validity of a grant in perpetuity is not an act of legislation, and would not have impaired the contract embodied
in the grant though it had overruled a contrary decision
previously rendered. Tidal Oil Co. v. Flanagan,263 U. S.
444; Fleming v. Fleming, 264 U. S. 29; GreatNorthern Ry.
Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358. What
is at issue in this case is not an actual or even a claimed
impairment of any right or privilege assured to the respondents by the Constitution of the nation. What is at
issue is the validity of a privilege or claim of privilege to
obstruct a bridge across a public stream. The case does
not call for a decision as to the ownership of the structure
of the bridge or the right of the complainants to tear it
down hereafter. Cf. State v. Lawrence Bridge Co., 22
Kan. 438, 463. The decision that is called for is one as to

the privilege of the complainants while maintaining an
obstruction of navigable waters, to exact payments from
the public. The statutes of Oklahoma are explicit that
tolls may never be collected unless permitted by a franchise (Wagon Road Act, Consolidated Oklahoma Statutes,
§ 5627; Toll Bridge Corporations Act, Consolidated Oklahorma Statutes, § 5367). In controversies so purely local,
little gain is to be derived from drawing nice distinctions
between dicta and decisions. Disagreement with either,
even though permissible, is at best a last resort, to be embraced with caution and reluctance. The stranger from
afar, unacquainted with the local ways, permits himself
to be guided by the best evidence available, the directions
or the counsel of those who dwell upon the spot.
The case thts far has been considered from the viewpoint of the substantive law, the basic rights and duties
contested by the litigants. There is another path of approach that brings us to the same goal, an approach along
the line of the law of equitable remedies. Caution and
reluctance there must be in any case where there is the
threat of opposition, in respect of local controversies, between state and federal courts. Caution and reluctance
there must be in special measure where relief, if granted,
is an interference by the process of injunction with the
activities of state officers discharging in good faith their
supposed official duties. In such circumstances this court
has said that an injunction ought not to issue "unless in
a case reasonably free from doubt." Massachusetts State
Grange v. Benton, 272 U. S. 525, 527. The rule has been
characterized as an "important" one, to be "very strictly
observed." 272 U. S. at 527, 529. Compare Gilchrist v.
Interborough Rapid Transit Co., 279 U. S.- 159; Cavanaugh v. Looney, 248 U. S. 453, 456. It is such interference by the process of injunction with the activities of
state officers that the respondents now seek. The members of the State Highway Commission believe it to be

Opinion of the Court.

their official duty to take possession of the bridge, and
propose to act accordingly. The Attorney General of the
state is about to institute proceedings at law and in
equity to vindicate the public rights or what he believes
to be such rights. The County Attorneys of McClain
and Cleveland Counties propose to sue for fines and penalties. All these activities the respondents ask us to enjoin. Indeed all have been enjoined by the decree under
review. Only a case of manifest oppression will justify
a federal court in laying such a check upon administrative
officers acting colore officii in a conscientious endeavor to
fulfill their duty to the state. A prudent self-restraint
is called for at such times if state and national functions
are to be maintained in stable equilibrium. Reluctance
there has been to use the process of federal courts in
restraint of state officials though' the rights asserted by
the complainants are strictly federal in origin. Massachusetts State Grange v. Benton, supra; Stratton v. St.
Louis S. IV. Ry. Co., 284 U. S. 530; Matthews v. Rodgers,
284 U. S. 521. There must be reluctance even greater
when the rights are strictly local, jurisdiction having no
other basis than the accidents of residence. The need is
clamant in such circumstances for cautious hesitation. If
there were to be a concession arguendo that the meaning
of " perpetuities" is still an unsettled question after the
decisions in Oklahoma, there is surely no room for a contention that a meaning in opposition to those decisions
is reasonably free from doubt. Our process does not issue
unless the path is clear.
What has been written has had its basis in the assumption that an indeterminate franchise is a perpetuity within
the meaning of the Constitution of Oklahoma, or at the
very least that state officers acting in that belief are not
subject to an injunction at the instance of the federal
courts. The case for the respondents would be beset, however, with other doubts and difficulties if all these were

to be removed. There would still remain the uncertainty
whether the franchise granted by the county was to the
grantees for their own use or for the use of a corporation
to be organized thereafter; whether the corporation was
to be one under the "Wagon Road" law, with an indeterminate duration, or under the " Bridge Companies" act,
with a duration of twenty years; and whether the public
policy of Oklahoma, disclosed by her statutes and decisions, and irrespective of decisions elsewhere, sets a limit
upon the toll right, or what is known as the secondary
franchise, coterminous with the primary franchise to exist
and engage in business in a corporate capacity. By the
statement of these questions we convey no hint as to the
answer. We do no more than emphasize the complexities
of law as well as of policy in which the respondents' title
is involved, and the unwisdom of superseding the official
acts and powers of the agents of the vicinage by writ out
of a federal court.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be
reversed, and the judgment of the District Court dismissing the complaint affirmed.
