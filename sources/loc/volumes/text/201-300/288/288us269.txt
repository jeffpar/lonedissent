MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE

CO. v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 322.

Argued January 16, 17, 1933.-Decided February 6, 1933.

1. Reenactment of a provision of a revenue act held a legislative
adoption of the construction that had been placed upon it in
administration by the Treasury Department. P. 273.
2. Section 245 (8) of the Revenue Act of 1926, applicable to Life
Insurance Companies (which make their returns only on the cash
basis) permits deduction from gross income of "All interest paid
or accrued within the taxable year" on a company's indebtedness,
with a certain exception. Held that interest accrued on dividends

held for policyholders, but unpaid, is not deductible. Pp. 271, 275.
3. The general rule against accounting for and reporting income
partly on the accrual and partly on the cash basis should apply
to insurance companies; being required to treat interest received
on the cash basis, they ought not to have the privilege of treating
on the other basis the interest that they owe. P. 273.

the Revenue Act of 1926,1 to deduct from its gross income, as interest paid, the amount of interest credited to
its policyholders during the taxable year, but not withdrawn by them.
Petitioner agrees to repay a portion of its receipts to
policyholders in the form of dividends. The policies provide that these dividends, when declared, may at the option of the insured be withdrawn in cash, applied as premium payments, or allowed to remain on deposit with the
company at interest. If the last alternative be chosen the
.dividends and interest accumulate; interest being added
to the accumulated sum at the end of each policy year.
The dividends and all accrued interest thereon may be
withdrawn at any time on demand. Of the total which
became due policyholders in 1926 as interest on sums so
left with the company, $544,964.40, the portion not withdrawn, was credited in appropriate amounts to the individual accounts of the policyholders during that year. In
its tax return the petitioner deducted as interest paid the
amount so credited. Interest actually withdrawn during
1926 totaled $248,405.97, some of which was credited to
the policyholders in that year, but the greater portion of
which had accrued prior to 1926, and had been credited in
the respective years of accrual. No deduction was taken
for. this sum. The Commissioner disallowed the claimed
deduction, and allowed in lieu thereof the amount of interest actually withdrawn in 1926. The resulting additional tax was paid under protest, a claim for refund filed,
and, the Commissioner having failed to act upon the
claim, suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover
the amount. That court dismissed the petition 2 and we
brought the case here by certiorari.
The earlier Revenue Acts made no distinction, in the
method of computing the tax, between insurance com144

panies and other corporations. The Act of 1921 and those
subsequently adopted embodied special and separate provisions respecting such companies.8 In the Act of 1926,
with which we are here concerned, the applicable sections
are 242 to 247, inclusive, the first four dealing with life
companies. Section 244 defines gross income as the
amount received during the taxable year from interest,
dividends and rents. Section 245 defines net, income as
the gross income, less certain enumerated deductions.
Paragraph (8) permits deduction of: "All interest paid or
accrued within the taxable year on its indebtedness,
except on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase
or carry obligations or securities . . . the interest upon
which is wholly exempt from taxation under this title."
The language of paragraph (8) with respect to interest
paid or accrued on indebtedness is precisely the same as
that employed with respect to deductions allowed to individuals by f 214 (a) (2)' and to corporations by § 234
(a) (2).1 Section 200 (d)6 enacts that "The terms'paid
or incurred' and 'paid or accrued' shall be construed
according to the method of accounting upon the basis of
which the net income is computed under § 212 or
232 . . ." The sections mentioned are those applicable
to individuals and to corporations generally; neither deals
with insurance companies, which, as above said, are
treated exclusively in §§ 242 to 247, inclusive.
In the light of these provisions the petitioner insists
that insurance companies are forbidden by the terms of
the statute to keep their accounts and make their returns
by the accrual method, but must report on the cash basis.

Opinion of the Court.

Hence it. is claimed the words "paid or accrued," as applied to interest, cannot grant an option in the matter of
returns, depending upon whether the insurance company
keeps its accounts on a cash basis or on an accrual basis,
as in the case of other taxpayers, since the company has
no choice in this respect; that the word "accrued" cannot
be read out of the statute or left without meaning or
effect; and that the phrase is employed to describe and
allow deduction of interest accrued on dividends left with
the company.
The Government replies that prior to 1921 there was no
statutory direction as to how insurance companies' returns
should be made; a regulation required them to be upon
the cash basis; when new sections were inserted in the Act
of 1921 as to insurance companies the phraseology with
respect to interest deductions of individuals and corporations generally was lifted bodily out of the sections applicable to individuals and corporations and inserted in these
new sections; as the act does not permit insurance companies to account on the accrual basis, only interest paid
is deductible, and the term "accrued" has no application..
It further points to a regulation adopted immediately
upon the passage of the Act of 1921 and carried forward
in the regulations under the Acts of 1924 and 1926. This
regulation is: '
"The deduction allowed by section 245 (a) (8) for interest on indebtedness is the same as that allowed corporations by section 234 (a) (2) (see Arts. 561, 121, and 122),
but this deduction includes item 18 of the disbursement
page of the annual statement of life companies to the extent that interest on dividends held on deposit and surrendered during the taxable year is included therein."
Item 18 of the disbursement page of the annual statement of insurance companies includes the amount of in'Treasury Regulations 62, Art. 685 (3).

terest actually paid policyholders, whereas accrued interest credited and not withdrawn is shown in item 22 on
page 5 of the standard form of report. Insurance companies have without exception complied with the regulation and taken a deduction only for interest paid. The
right to deduct interest credited to policyholders but not
withdrawn is now asserted for the first time.
The Congress in the Revenue Acts of 1928 and 1932
rebnacted § 245 without alteration.! This action was
taken with knowledge of the construction placed upon
the section by the official charged with its administration.
If the legislative body had considered the Treasury interpretation erroneous it would have amended the section.
Its failure so to do requires the conclusion that the regulation was not inconsistent with the intent of the statute
(National Lead Co. v. United States, 252 U. S. 140, 146;
Poe v. Seaborn, 282 U. S. 101, 116; McCaughn v. Hershey
Chocolate Co., 283 U. S. 488, 492; Costanzo v. Tillinghast,
287 U. S. 341) unless, perhaps, the language of the act is
unambiguous and the regulation clearly inconsistent with
it. Compare LousiviUe & N. R. Co. v. United States,
282 U. S. 740, 757-8. The petitioner insists that the
statute needs no interpretation and its plain mandate
should be enforced. But on examination the proper
application of the section is not so clear as is claimed.
The regulations of the Treasury under all the Revenue
Acts since 1916 have required taxpayers to report on the
cash or accrual basis, depending on which method was
pursued in their accounting.9 Since the adoption of the
Revenue Act of 1921 the requirement has been statutory.
It is settled beyond cavil that taxpayers other than insurance companies may not accrue receipts and treat

expenditures on a cash basis, or vice versa. Nor may
they accrue a portion of income and deal with the remainder on a cash basis, nor take deductions partly on
one and partly on the other basis. Congress we think
did not intend to make an exception of insurance companies. If they are not allowed to account on an accrual
basis for interest owed them there is no reason for permitting them to treat interest owed by them on any
different basis. The very paragraph (8) on which petitioner relies as defining interest credited but not paid, by
the use of the word "accrued," recognizes that insurance
companies may have indebtedness of other sorts, such as
that arising from borrowings to carry securities. Since
the company is required to treat interest received on a
cash basis, it ought not have the privilege of accruing
interest owed. That privilege must be accorded, if petitioner is right. We think the result would be unreasonable and is not intended by the act.
We are referred to a regulation which, provides: "Income which is credited to the account of or set apart for
a taxpayer and which may be drawn upon by him at any
time is subject to tax for the year during which so credited
or set apart, although not then actually reduced to possession."" It is argued that the regulation requires the
policyholder to report interest credited to him as received
in the year of credit. The conclusion drawn is that if the
credit is income to the insured it must constitute a " constructive payment" by the company. In this view the
transaction is said to come within the term "paid" and
we may disregard the word "accrued." This regulation
has, however, not been applied in any case where income
has been credited to another by a taxpayer employing the
cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting;
and specifically it has not been invoked to require policyholders to report as income the dividends or interest
credited to them in cases such as this. No tax is de"Regulations 69, Art. 51,

manded of them until actual receipt of the money. The
constructive payment theory is, we think, untenable.
We conclude Congress did not intend by the use of the
word " accrued" in § 245 (a) (8) to permit the deduction
of interest on policy dividends credited but not paid during the taxable year.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 359.

Argued January 18, 1933.-Decided February 6, 1933.

1. When because of washouts the presence of employees on the
tracks may be anticipated, the railroad company should exercise
reasonable care to have trains under control and to sound warnings
and to keep lookout at places such as blind curves where the view
is obstructed; and in such situations the rule that the employee on
the track assumes the risk does not apply. Chesapeake & Ohio
Ry. Co. v. Nixon, 271 U. S.218, distinguished. P. 277.
2. A track-inspector, riding a railway tricycle, set out on an inspection trip, as required by his duty, and was run down on a blind
curve by a delayed train, which he must have known was somewhere on the line before him. In an action under the Federal.
Employers' Liability Act, held that his failure to obey a rule
requiring him before leaving to ascertain from the railway office
the whfteabouts of trains, was not to be taken as the primary
and efficient cause of the accident, precluding recovery, but was to
be considered by the jury with the other evidence in determining
the question of his negligence. Davis v. Kennedy, 266 U. S. 147;
Unadilla Valley Ry. Co. v. Caldine, 278 U. S. 139, distinguished.
P. 279.
3. The Employers' Liability Act imposes liability on the carrier. if
the injury or death results "in whole or in part" from its negligence. In this case the questions of negligence and contributory
negligence were for the jury. P. 278.
