UNITED STATES v. FACTORS & FINANCE CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS

No. 141.

Argued December 8, 1932.-Decided January 9, 1933.

1. While a full examination of the taxpayer's affairs was-being made
by the Bureau for the purpose of determining the income and
profits tax for 1917, the taxpayer filed a claim for refund stating
only an amount, to cover any overpayment that might be found,
and not specifying the grounds. After the statutory period for
filing claims had run, an amended claim was filed, setting forth the
grounds in detail, with reasons why a special assessment should be
made under § 210 of the Revenue Act of 1917, which permits such
procedure if the Department is unable in any case satisfactorily
to determine the amount of invested capital. Thereafter the Commissioner decided that the case was one for such special assessment,
and, pursuing that method, found an overpayment in a stated
amount;- but he refused to refund, upon the ground that the first
claim was too general and the second filed too late. Held:
(1) That the first claim was subject to amendment until final
rejection, irrespective of a limitation running in the interval.
United States v. Memphis Oil Co., ante, p. 62. P. 93.
(2) The second claim was not an abandonment of or departure
from the first-not a new and independent claim-but properly an
amendment. United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., ante, p. 73,
distinguished., Id.
(3) The Commissioner's certificate that assessment should be
under § 210 is binding in the absence of evidence impeaching his
conclusion; and the taxpayer is entitled to recover the overpayment so found by the Commissioner. P. 96.
2. There are clear and important differences between the provisions
for special assessments made by § 210 of the Revenue Act of 1917,
and those made by § 327 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1918. P. 94.

Opinion of the Court.

George H. Foster, Bradley B. Gilman, and Wm. H. Riley,
Jr., were on the brief, for the United States.
Mr. J. Gilmer Korner, Jr., for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The suit is by a taxpayer to recover $19,995.44, with
interest, an overpayment of income and profits tax. Here,
as in other cases decided at this session, the judgment
stands or falls according to our determination of the time
.within which a notice of a claim for refund is subject to
amendment.
On June 15, 1918, respondent, a corporation, filed an
income and profits tax return for the calendar year ending December 31, 1917, and made payment of the tax in
accordance therewith. The amount of the payment was
$177,338.72. In May, 1920, the Commissioner made an
assessment of an additional tax for 1917 in the sum of
$267.32, which was paid by the respondent on June 29,
1920. In August, 1920, the Commissioner made another
assessment of an additional tax for the same year in the
sum of $25,327.91. On account of this additional tax
respondent on October 4, 1920 made a payment of
$9,388.57, and in the same month filed a claim for the
abatement of $15,933.34, the amount of the unpaid balance. In connection with this claim for abatement the
Commissioner made an order on May 6, 1921, for a full
examination of the affairs of the taxpayer by an agent
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Such an examination
was made, and a report by the examiner was filed with
his superior.
In February, 1923, the audit by the Commissioner was
still incomplete, and the amount of the assessment not
finally determined. The taxpayer was fearful, so it seems,
that the time might go by within which claims for overpayments were due under the law. To forestall any

Opinion of the Court.

default it lodged with the Commissioner on February 27,
1923, a claim for $177,606.04 in terms of sweeping generality. It stated in so doing that there had been at that
time no final audit of its return or assessment of the tax,
and that the purpose of the notice was to save the taxpayer's rights under the applicable statutes "and to permit the Commissioner to refund to deponent any excess
paid over taxes actually found to be due." There was
no statement in this notice as to the grounds of the claim
that the payments were excessive. No such statement
was made until July 17, 1925, when there was filed with
the Commissioner an amended claim for refund, setting
forth the grounds in detail. In this amended claim the
taxpayer explains the reasons why a special assessment
should be made in accordance with § 210 of the Revenue
Act of 1917 (c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 307), permitting that
procedure where the amount of the tax cannot otherwise
be determined with accuracy or justice. A copy of that
section is quoted in the margin.*
* Section 210. That if the Secretary of the Treasury is unable in
any case satisfactorily to determine the invested capital, the amount
of the deduction shall be the sum of (1) an amount equal to the same
proportion of the net income of the trade or business received during
the taxable year as the proportion which the average deduction (determined in the same manner as provided in section two hundred and
three, without including the $3,000 or $6,000 therein referred to) for
the same calendar year of representative corporations, partnerships,
and individuals, engaged in a like or similar trade or business, bears
to the total net income of the trade or business received by such
corporations, partnerships, and individuals, plus (2) in the case of a
domestic corporation $3,000, and in the case of a domestic partnership
or a citizen or resident of the United States, $6,000.
For the purpose of this section the proportion between the deduction and the net income in each trade or business shall be determined
by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in accordance with regulations prescribed by him, with the approval of the Secretary of the
Treasury. In the case of a corporation or partnership which has fixed
its own fiscal year, the proportion determined for the calendar year
ending during such fiscal year shall be used.

Opinion of .the Court.,

288 U.S.

In the interval between February, 1923 and July, 1927,
there had been action by the Commissioner upon the
claim for abatement which had been filed by the taxpayer in October, 1920. A claim for abatement, unlike
a claim for refund, has relation to a tax assessed, but still
unpaid. Rock Island, A. & L. R. Co. v. United States,
254 U. S. 141. The Commissioner declined to abate the
whole amount of $15,933.34 withheld by the taxpayer,
but did declare an overassessment of $3,293.89, leaving
a balance of $12,639.45, with interest, then determined
to be due. This balance the taxpayer discharged by payment to the Collector in November, 1923.
The claim for abatement had thus been disposed of,
but no action had yet been taken upon the claim fGr
refund. The Commissioner permitted this to slumber,
without deciding or considering it, till after the filing of
the amendment in July, 1925. Upon receipt of that
amendment, or soon afterwards, he proceeded to a consideration of the claim upon the merits. There were
hearings and rehearings at which the taxpayer gave evidence in support of its claim that its payments had been
excessive and that there was need of a special assessment
to arrive at a computation consistent with equity and
justice. The Commissioner decided the merits of the controversy in favor of the taxpayer. He held that a case
had been made out for a special assessment in accordance
with § 210 of the Revenue Act of 1917. He held, after
computing the tax accordingly, that there had been an
overpayment of taxes in the sum of $32,634.89. He held,
however, that the notice of claim of February 27, 1923,
was defective for failure to state the grounds of the taxpayer's objections; that the notice of July 17, 1925, was
without avail as an amendment in respect of overpayments made in 1918 and 1920, since as to these it was
too late; that it was good as an original claim for the
refund of the overpayment made in November, 1923;

U. S. v. FACTORS & FINANCE CO.

Opinion of the Court.

and hence that of the total overpayments of $32,634.89
there should be a refund of $12,639.45, the 1923 instalment, with $3,028.24, interest paid thereon, and that as
to the residue of the overpayments, $19,995.44, a refund
should be refused. A very different case would be here
if the Commissioner had ruled that no adequate reason
for a special assessment had been established, and had
refused relief upon that ground. We do not say that a
justiciable controversy would then have arisen for a court.
Williamsport Co. v. United States, 277 U. S. 551, 562;
United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., decided herewith,

ante, p. 73. What he did was to find that there was need
for a special method, that th2 application of such a method
would reduce the tax by a stated sum, but that because
of defects in the form of the claimant's notice, there could
be relief only in part. For the amount thus disallowed
the taxpayer brought suit in the Court of Claims which
overruled the action of the Commissioner and gave judgment accordingly. 56 F. (2d) 902; 73 Ct. Cls. 707. A
writ of certiorari brings the case here.
We are holding in United States v. Memphis Oil Co.,

ante, p. 62, that a general claim for refund, not specifying
grounds, is subject to amendment until final rejection
irrespective of a limitation running in the interval. We
are holding in United States v. Henry Prentiss& Co., ante,

p. 73, that under the Revenue Act of 191S a claim specifying as the sole ground for relief the necessity for a special
assessment by reason of anomalous conditions prevailing
in the claimant's business may not be turned by amendment into one for the revision of an assessment by increasing the value of real estate included in invested capital.
The present case falls midway, or near to that, between the
other two. Here the taxpayer did not specify any ground
in the claim first presented, but offered an amendment
afterwards setting forth the reasons why the assessment
should be special.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

288 U.S.

The case is a close one, giving fair opportunity for argument either way, but we think the better reasons uphold
the privilege of amendment.
1. The conclusion favorable to the privilege has support in the analogies of pleadings in a law suit. The claim
in its original form is one for money had and received to
the use of the respondent after the manner of the common
counts in a suit at common law. It does not specify a particular state of facts, as did the claim in the Prentiss case,
abandoning all others. It charges overpayment generally,
and thus brings within its range whatever facts reside in
the domain of equity and conscience.
2. The conclusion thus supported by the analogy of
pleadings is not inconsistent with the necessities of administrative practice.
This is not a case where the grounds injected by the
amendment have already been abandoned by agreement
tacit or express. Such abandonment and agreement there
was in the Prentiss case, the claimant seeking at the beginning the privilege of the special method of assessment and
reverting thereafter to another ground of challenge which
by implication, if not expressly, it had promised to
renounce. This is a case where the claimant has left the
grounds of challenge open, and where the Bureau has
itself to blame for not insisting at the outset upon a full
disclosure of the grievance.
There are other elements of difference, however, besides
the presence or absence of agreement, that divide the
Prentiss case from this one. These other elements of
difference are even more important, for the Prentiss
ruling would have been the same if agreement had been
absent. When the two cases are considered in the light
of administrative practice a distinction is to be noted at
the outset between the nature of a special assessment
under the Revenue Act of 1918, § 327 (d), and the
nature of such an assessment under the Act of 1917,

U. S. v. FACTORS & FINANCE CO.
89

Opinion of the Court.

§ 210. The application in the Prentiss case was made
under § 327 (d) of the Act of 1918, whereby the taxpayer, ignoring a possible challenge of the computation
of invested capital, plants itself upon the ground of a
variance between the statutory definition and the economic concept, and calls upon the Commissioner to exercise a dispensing power given to him, in circumstances
of hardship, by the provisions of the statute. In an application for special relief under § 210 of the Act of 1917,
the grounds of challenge are very different if the letter
of the section is the measure of relief thereunder. The
value of the invested capital under the statutory definition (Revenue Act of 1917, § 207) is not put aside in
such circumstances as an irrelevant inquiry. On the contrary it becomes the very essence of the claim by the taxpayer that there must be a recourse to another method.
Under § 210 of the Act of 1917, the special method is not
permissible unless " the Secretary of the Treasury is
unable in any case satisfactorily to determine the
invested capital." In brief, § 210 of the Act of 1917 is
the precursor of § 327 (a) of the Act of 1918, and is not
at all the analogue of § 327 (d). Cf. Williamsport Co. v.
United States, 277 U. S. 551, 558.
We are not forgetful of the fact that by the regulations
of the Commissioner and the practice of his Bureau, the
distinction between the two acts has been obscured, if
not destroyed. Relief has been granted under the Act
of 1917 as if its provisions .were the same as those of
the act adopted later. Treasury Regulations 41, 1918,
Art. 52; cf. R. H. Montgomery, Excess Profits Tax Assessment (1920), pp. 242, 243. The validity of the regulations, if applied to proceedings under the Act of 1917, is
a question not now before us. The practice, we may say
in passing, has not been left unchallenged, but has been
criticized in the Report of the Senate Committee for the
Investigation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. See

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

288 U.S.

Report No. 27, Pt. I, pp. 21.4, 215j et seq., 69th Congress,
First Session, 1925-1926. Certain at all events it is that
an appeal to the Commissioner to exercise his jurisdiction
under § 210 of the Act of 1917 is not confined to the
occasions stated in § 327 (d) of the Act of 1918, if indeed
it covers them at all. It is at least broad enough to give
notice that jurisdiction should be exercised in accordance
with the letter of § 210, upon the ground, that is to say,
of the inability of the Commissioner to arrive at a conclusion as to value satisfactory to himself. Under
§ 327 (d) of the Act of 1918, a special assessment is not
ordered except on the motion of the taxpayer, setting
forth the special reasons why the statutory definition is
oppressive, and why another method should be adopted.
Under § 210 of the Act of 1917, as under § 327 (a) of the
Act of 1918, the Commissioner acts of his own motion
whenever he is unable to satisfy himself that the valuation will be accurate if there is adherence to the statute.
This question, if no other, he must have considered and
determined when a claim for refund was submitted by the
taxpayer without specifying the grounds. United States
v. Memphis Oil Co., ante,p. 62. This question, if no other,
he must again have considered and determined when he
certified to the taxpayer, after the claim had been
amended and after submission of the evidence, that § 210
of the Act of 1917 supplied the applicable rule. It is a
question that in last analysis is addressed to his own conscience, and in the absence of .any evidence impeaching
his conclusion his certificate of satisfaction or the contrary is binding on the courts.
The cumulative force of these administrative opportunities and these procedural analogies upholds the claim-and
the amendment.
The judgment of the Court of Claims is accordingly
Affirmed.
