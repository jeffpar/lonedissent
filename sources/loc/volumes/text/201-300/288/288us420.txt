McDONNELL v. UNITED STATES.*
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 330. Argued January 17, 1933.-Decided March 13, 1933.
1. Paragraph (e) of § 278 of the Revenue Act of June 2, 1924, providing: "This section shall not (1) authorize the assessment of a
tax or the collection thereof by distraint or by a proceeding in
court if at the time of the enactment of this Act such assessment,
distraint or proceeding was barred by the period of limitation then
in existence, or (2) affect any assessment made or distraint or proceeding in court begun, before the enactment of this Act," does not
render invalid waivers executed after the date of the Act, with respect to income taxes, the assessment and collection of which had
become barred before that date. P. 422.
2. The purpose of paragraph (d) of § 250 of the Revenue Act of 1921,
and paragraph (c) of § 278 of the Revenue Act of 1924, was not
to grant authority for waivers or to limit their effect, but to remove
doubt of their validity by expressly recognizing them. P. 423.
3. Paragraph (e) of § 278 of the 1924 Act does not qualify paragraph (c). P. 424.
75 Ct. Cls. 155; id. 186; 59 F. (2d) 290, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases arose out of the same transaction and present, on substantially the same facts, the same question
of law. Reference will be made in the opinion only to the
McDonnell case.
The action was brought by McDonnell in the Court
of Claims on November 4, 1929 to recover $4,549.03 with
interest from the date of payment, October 23, 1926.
McDonnell filed his individual income-tax return for 1917
on April 1, 1918, and paid the amount shown thereon to
be due. The sum now sought to be recovered was paid
to the collector of internal revenue for the Second District
of New York pursuant to an assessment of an additional
income tax for the year 1917, which was made by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue on October 9, 1926.
There had been a waiver on February 23, 1926 of the
statutory limitation upon the time for making the assessment. Claims for refund were made on December 27,
1928 and May 31, 1929, alleging that the waiver was invalid and that the amount claimed was collected after
the running of the statute. The claims for refund were
rejected on March 6, 1929 and July 25, 1929. The Court
of Claims entered judgment for the defendant. 75 Ct.
Cls. 155, 186; 59 F. (2d) 290. Because of conflict of the
decision with that in Uncasviile Manufacturing Co. v.
Commissioner,55 F. (2d) 893, certiorari was granted, limited to the question of the validity of the waiver under
§ 27$ (e) of the Revenue Act of 1924. 287 U. S. 589.
The waiver was given under the following circumstances. McDonnell was in 1917 a member of the firm of
McDonnell & Truda, which in that year filed its income
tax return and paid the taxes therein shown to be due.
On March 18, 1923, that is, within five years after the
filing of the return and before the expiration of the period
allowed by § 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 for

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

assessment and collection of an additional tax, the Commissioner made a jeopardy assessment against the firm of
$100,005.14. On November 80, 1925, that is, after the
expiration of the statutory period for making an additional assessment against the plaintiff, the Commissioner
notified the plaintiff that the amount payable by the firm
for additional tax should, because of errors, be reduced to
$24,863.28; but that a reduction of the liability of the
partnership necessitated additional taxes to the individual
members of the firm; and that he would not make the
reduction to the firm unless plaintiff and his partner would
waive the statute of limitations so as to permit additional
individual taxes and would pay the amounts assessed
against them. Each gave the waiver requested and paid
the amount now sought to be recovered.
It is conceded by McDonnell that the tax was payable,
unless it was barred by the period of limitations prescribed
in § 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 or § 277 (a) (2)
of the Revenue Act of 1924. It is conceded by the Government that it was so barred, unless the limitation was
removed by the waiver signed by McDonnell on February
23, 1926, which, by its terms, purported to extend to
December 31, 1926 the time within which the Commissioner could assess additional taxes for the year 1917.
McDonnell claims that the Revenue Act of June 2, 1924
renders the waiver ineffective, because the assessment of
the tax had been barred on April 1, 1923. The contention
is that, since the period of limitation had expired before
the passage of the 1924 Act, the waiver was inoperative
under the express terms of paragraph (e) of § 278 of that
Act, which declares:
"This section shall not (1) authorize the assessment of
a tax or the collection thereof by distraint or by a proceeding in court if at the time of the enactment of this Act such
assessment, distraint or proceeding was barred by the

Opinion of the Court.

period of limitation then in existence, or (2) affect any
assessment made or distraint or proceeding in court begun,
before the enactment of this Act." 1
The contention of the petitioner, expressed in different
terms, is that waivers executed subsequent to June 2, 1924
are invalid where the date of filing the return was such
that the five-year period for assessment elapsed before
June 2, 1924. Obviously, the waiver would have been
good if executed before June 2, 1924, the period of limitation expiring when it did; for in that event the assessment would not have been "barred by the period of limitation " at the time of the enactment of the 1924 Act.
The fact that the waiver was executed after the running
of the statute of limitations does not render it invalid.
Burnet v. Chicago Railway Equipment Co., 282 U. S.
'Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234, § 278 (e), 43 Stat. 253, 299, 300. The
preceding paragraphs of the section are as follows:
"(a) In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade
tax or of a failure to file a return the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without
assessment, at any time.
"(b) Any deficiency attributable to a change in a deduction tentatively allowed under paragraph (9) of subdivision (a) of section 214,
or paragraph (8) of subdivision (a) of section 234, of the Revenue
Act of 1918 or the Revenue Act of 1921, may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without
assessment, at any time.
"(c) Where both the Commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to the assessment of the tax after the time prescribed
in section 277 for its assessment the tax may be assessed at any time
prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon.
"(d) Where the assessment of the tax is made within the period
prescribed in section 277 or in this section, such tax may be collected
by distraint or by a proceeding-in court, begun within six years after"
the assessment of the tax. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as
preventing the beginning, without assessment, of a proceeding in court
for the collection of the tax at any time before the expiration of the
period within which an assessment may be made."

295, 298-299; Stange v. United States, 282 U. S. 270,
273-275. And confessedly, the waiver would have been
good, executed when it was, if the period of limitation
had expired after June 2, 1924.
Nothing in the legislative history of § 278 indicates an
intention to exclude cases like that at bar from the generality of those in which waivers may be given. The purpose of Congress in enacting paragraph (c) of § 278 indicates the contrary. Prior to the 1921 Act there was no
statutory provision expressly authorizing waivers; but
their execution had grown out of administrative practice.
Doubt as to their validity in the absence of statute, however, had been raised; and the doubt in that situation was
not removed until the decision in Aiken v. Burnet, 282
U. S. 277. The purpose of Congress in enacting paragraph (d) of § 250 of the Revenue Act of 1921 and
paragraph (c) of § 278 of the Revenue Act of 1924 was
not to grant authority for waivers or to limit their effect,
but to remove that doubt by expressly recognizing them.
The latter paragraph substantially reenacted paragraph
(d) of § 250 of the Revenue Act of 1921.
Both the language and the purpose of paragraph (e)
are consistent with this view. It was pointed out in
Burnet v. Chicago Railway Equipment Co., 282 U. S.
295, 300, note 5, that paragraph (e) cannot have been
intended to qualify every other subdivision in § 278.
The petitioner assumes, in fact, that it does not qualify
subdivisions (a) and (b); which provide, respectively, for
assessment at any time in the case of false or fraudulent
returns or failure to file returns, and in the case of
deficiencies attributable to a change in deductions taken
in amortization of war investments. That paragraph (e)
does qualify paragraph (d), which extends the period in

Opinion of the Court.

which collection may be made to six years after assessment, was'decided in Russell v. United States, 278 U. S.
181. The petitioner argues that since paragraph (d) relates only to collection, and since the qualifications of
paragraph (e) apply in terms to assessments as well, the
latter paragraph must limit paragraph (c), the only
remaining subdivision. But this conclusion does not
necessarily follow. Congress may have inserted the reference to " assessments" in paragraph (e) in order to
make it clear that the extension of time for collections
should in no event be regarded as authorizing an assessment already barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Moreover, paragraph (d) alone marked a change
in the policy of Congress.' Paragraph (e) was inserted
to prevent the section from being given a "retroactive
effect." ' To apply it to paragraph (c) would not serve
that function. On the contrary, it would serve to cause a
break in the policy of giving effect to waivers,-a policy
expressly adopted in the Act of 1921 and avowedly continued by the Act of 1924. The disclaimer of an intention
to "authorize an assessment" where "such assessment"
was already barred cannot be taken to refer to assessments
8See the committee reports, loc. cit. supra,note 2; also Hearings on
H. R. 6715 before Senate Committee on Finance, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.,
pp. 36, 39. As originally drafted, paragraph (d) authorized collection without limitation of time. See Hearings, supra, p. 39; Statement of Changes Made in the Revenue Act of 1921 by H. R. 6715 and
the Reasons Therefor, Senate Committee on Finance, 68th Cong., 1st
Sess., p. 27. The limitation on collections of six years from the date
of assessment was proposed by the Senate and agreed to by the House.
See Conference Report, H. R. No. 844, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 24.
The 1921 Act, § 250 (d); had imposed a limit on collections of five
years from the date of return. See Russell v. United States, 278
U. S. 181, 185.
