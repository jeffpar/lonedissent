the contrary, what was included in the reasonable allowance for depletion by the established construction of the
earlier acts gave significant content to the word as used
in the Act of 1926. There is no ground for supposing
that Congress, by providing a new method for computing
the allowance for depletion intended to break with the
past. and narrow the function of that allowance. The
reasonable inference is that it did not and that depletion
includes under the 1926 Act precisely what it included
under the earlier acts. The regulations under the 1926
Act so ruled, as has been shown, by continuing the provisions of earlier regulations under which costs of
development and drilling were returnable by the depletion allowance and not by an additional allowance for
depreciation." °
It is true that the Board of Tax Appeals in construing
the 1924 and 1926 Acts has held that capitalized drilling
costs are subject to a depreciation rather than a depletion
allowance. Jergins Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 22
B. T. A. 551; Ziegler v. Commissioner, 23 B. T. A. 1091;

JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner, a Maine corporation, in making its tax
returns of income derived from the operation of oil wells
in the years 1925, 1926, and 1927, claimed a deduction
from gross income of a depreciation allowance on account
of the capitalized costs of drilling the oil wells. The Commissioner refused to allow the deductions and assessed a
corresponding deficiency against the taxpayer. On appeal
the Board of Tax Appeals held that the deductions should
have been allowed. 23 B. T. A. 890. On petition for
review the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the order of the Board. 61 F. (2d) 273. The court
held that the deductions claimed were included in the
depletion allowance fixed by § 234 (a) (8) of the Revenue
Act of 1926 at 27/2% of petitioner's gross income for
the years in question, and could not be allowed as depreciation of improvements. This Court granted certiorari to
resolve a conflict of the decision below with that of the

CENTRAL TRANSFER CO. v. TERMINAL RAILROAD ASSOCIATION OF ST. LOUIS ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 523.

Argued February 14, 1933.-Decided March 13, 1933.

Several rail carriers agreed with a single transfer comparW that
only its places of business should be designated as their "off
track " stations in a certain city; that it should have the exclusive
right to transfer less-than-carload freight between their "on
track" stations and between them and the "off track" stations in
the city; and that they would file the necessary amended tariffs
with the Interstate Commerce Commission to carry out the agreement, and would pay for the transfer services at prescribed rates,
absorbed in their line-haul rates. .Tariffs were filed accordingly
and approved by _the Commission. Held that a rival transfer
company, which was excluded by thi arrangement from business
that it previously had enjoyed, had no standing under § 16 of the
Clayton Act to enjoin performance of the agreement as contrary
to the Sherman Act, since it is provided by the Clayton Act that
no one, except the United States, shall be thereby entitled to sue
for injunctive relief against any common carrier subject to the
Interstate Commerce Act "in respect of any matter subject 'o
the regulation, supervision or other jurisdiction of the Interstate
Commerce Commission." P. 473.
61 F. (2d) 546, affirmed.
