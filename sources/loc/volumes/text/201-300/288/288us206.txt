effect or weight to be given them necessarily depends
upon the details and circumstances shown by the evidence.
Made as they were through a mistaken view of the applicable law, these declarations may not reasonably be
adopted here as findings that no such contracts were
made and that plaintiff and defendants indulged in the
make-believe denounced by ยง 4318.
There is no evidence of any violation of the bucketshop
laws, nor is there any suggestion that the transactions
shown can be held illegal except by force of the Missouri
statute. I do not disagree with the majority that the Federal Grain Futures Act has not superseded the statutes of
Missouri applicable to these transactions.
I am of opinion that the judgment of the district court
sh6uld stand reversed and that the judgment of the circuit
court of appeals should be affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 138.

Argued January 9, 1933.-Decided February 6, 1933.

1. One upon whom sentence in a criminal case has been suspended
may at any time request the court to pronounce judgment, and in
the absence of such request must be deemed to have consented to
the indefinite delay. P. 210.
2. In a criminal case in the federal district court an order for a
permanent suspension of sentence is void. Ex parte United States,
242 U. S. 27. P. 209.
3. Final judgment in a criminal case means sentence; and a void
order purporting permanently to suspend sentence is neither a final
nor a valid judgment. P. 210.

4. Where judgment has not been pronounced upon a verdict during
the term at which it was rendered, the cause continues on the
docket and necessarily passes over to a succeeding term for final
judgment or other appropriate action. P. 211.
5. Where the district court, in a criminal case in which a verdict has
been duly returned, orders sentence suspended, it is not without
jurisdiction thereafter, either at the same or a subsequent term,
to impose sentence,-even though the intent of the order of suspension was to suspend sentence permanently. P. 211.

ing a. judgment dismissing a writ of habeas corpus.
Mr. Dean G. Acheson for petitioner.
The order of the District Court was clearly an indefinite or permanent suspension of sentence. Petitioner
was not placed on probation. This order, under Ex
parte United States, 242 U. S. 27, was beyond the power
of the court. Ex parte Singer, 284 Fed. 60; United
States v. Wilson, 46 Fed. 748.
Where the record shows a suspension of sentence and.
release of the prisoner, the suspension is permanent and
indefinite. Mintie v. Biddle, 15 F. (2d) 931; People v.

States, 244 Fed. 422, and Musick v. United States, 2 F.
(2d) 711, are in no sense to the contrary.
With the passing of the trial term in which the invalid
order was entered, the trial court, according to the uniform holdings of the federal and many state courts, lost
jurisdiction thereafter to impose sentence. Ex parte

suspend the imposition of sentence except as a necessary incident to subjecting a defendant to the discipline
of probation. This was not done or attempted.

Messrs. John J. Byrne and W. Marvin Smith were on the

MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.*
December 10, 1930, in the federal district court for
the southern district of New York, petitioner was convicted on his plea of guilty of the crime of stealing from
the United States mails. By order of the court, sentence
was suspended and he was discharged from the custody of
the marshal.
At a subsequent term of court, on June 17, 1931, petitioner was sentenced by another judge to four years imprisonment. A motion to vacate the sentence was
denied; and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was
filed in the federal district court for the northern district
of Georgia, praying the discharge of petitioner on the
ground that the court imposing the sentence was without
jurisdiction to do so. After a hearing the writ was dismissed and petitioner remanded to custody. The circuit
court of appeals affirmed the judgment. 56 F. (2d) 152.
Petitioner seeks a reversal here on the ground that the
order of December 10 constitutes a permanent suspension
of sentence, void under the decision of this court in Ex
parte United States, 242 U. S. 27; and that with the
expiration of the term the trial court was without power
to sentence petitioner. The Solicitor General vigorously
opposes the contention that the effect of the order was

Sutherland being absent from the Bench.

to suspend sentence permanently; but, without determining that question, we are of opinion that if such was
the effect, nevertheless, the court was not deprived of
power to impose sentence at a subsequent term.
The decisions on the point are in conflict. The greater
number support the view of petitioner; but we are of
opinion that the weight of reason is the other way. Several of the cases holding with petitioner are set forth in
Mintie v. Biddle, 15 F. (2d) 931. While these cases and
others are emphatically to the effect that a permanent suspension of sentence is void, and that 1he court thereby,
with the passing of the term, loses jurisdiction, we find
no convincing reason in any of them for the latter conclusion. The decision in the Mintie case rests primarily
upon considerations affecting the accused. Support for
its conclusion is found by the court in the supposition
that during the suspension the accused can "make no
plans, enter into no contracts, engage in no permanent
occupation, and bind himself to no obligations, or create
any permanent ties, business or domestic." But it is hard
to see the relevancy of these difficulties to the question
of jurisdiction. They equally would be present if sentence
were definitely postponed from term to term; and power
to that extent is not doubted. Moreover, since the suspension order is void, the accused is not bound to rest
under the supposed hardship. He may at any time put
an end to it by requesting the court to pronounce judgment, which the court no doubt would do unless good
cause to the contrary were made to appear. In the absence of such request he must be held to have consented
to the indefinite delay and cannot complain. Hoggett v.
State, 101 Miss. 269, 271; 57 So. 811. Compare United
States v. Mulligan, 48 F. (2d) 93; United States v. Lecato,
29 F. (2d) 694, 695.
In a criminal case final judgment means sentence; and
a void order purporting permanently to suspend sentence

Opinion of the Court.

is neither a final nor a valid judgment. United States v.
Lecato, supra, at p. 695; State v. Bongiorno, 96 N. J. L.
318; 115 Atl. 665; People v. Bork, 78 N. Y. 346, 350;
State v. Vaughan, 71 Conn. 457, 458; 42 Atl. 640; Symington v. State, 133 Md. 452, 454; 105 Atl. 541. If the suspension be for a fixed time, the case undoubtedly remains
on the docket of the court Until disposed of by final judgment. There is no good reason, in our opinion, why a
different rule should obtain where the order of suspension,
though expressly made permanent, is void. Such an
order is a mere nullity without force or effect, as though
no order at all had been made; and the case necessarily
remains pending until lawfully disposed of by sentence.
Compare In re Bonner, 151 U. S. 242, 259-262; G.
Amsinck & Co. v. Springfield Grocer Co., 7 F. (2d) 855,
858; Hammers v. United States, 279 Fed. 265, 266; Biddle v. Thiele, 11 F. (2d) 235, 236-237; Bryant v. United
States, 214 Fed. 51.
The order here under review being ineffectual to confer immunity from punishment, the conclusion that such
immunity existed must rest upon the bare fact that, without any saving provision, the term at which the accused
was cow-icted but not sentenced had passed. But that
foundation for the conclusion at once vanishes in the face
of the rule that where judgment has not been pronounced
upon a verdict during the term at which it was rendered,
the cause continues on the docket and necessarily passes
over to a succeeding term for final judgment or other appropriate action. Walker v. Moser, 117 Fed. 230, 232.
We conclude, in accordance with what we regard as the
better view, that in a criminal case, where verdict has
been duly returned, the jurisdiction of the trial court,
under circumstances such as are here disclosed, is not exhausted until sentence is pronounced, either at the same
or a succeeding term. Rachmil v. United States, 288
Fed. 782, 785; Ex parte Dunn, 50 S. D. 48, 52-54; 208

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. ROYAL MILLING CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 393.

Argued January 20, 1933.-Decided February 6, 1933.

1. Respondents were engaged in the business of preparing, by a
process of mixing and blending, plain and self-raising flour. Although not themselves grinders of the wheat from which their
product was made, they were doing business under trade names
which included the words "milling company," or words of like
import, and made representations to the trade calculated to convey
the impression that they were grinders. Their product was sold in
interstate commerce in competition with a similar article marketed
by, concerns which were in fact grinders and also by other "blenders," although the latter did not hold themselves out in any way
as grinders. A large number of buyers preferred to purchase the
product prepared by grinders, in the belief that the quality or
price or both were better. Respondents' representations and trade
names induced many buyers to believe that they were grinders.
Proceeding under ยง 5 of 'the Federal Trade Commission Act, and
upon findings supported by evidence, the Commission ordered
respondents to cease and desist from the use of such trade names
and from making such representations. Held:
(1) The methods of respondents were unfair and were methods
of competition within the meaning of ยง 5 of the Act. P. 216.
(2) It sufficiently appeared that the proceeding was in the
interest of the public. P. 216.
(3) While the findings and conclusions of the Corunission are
sustained, its orders should. go no further than is reasonably neces-,
sary to correct the evil and preserve the fights of competitors and
public; and, in respect of the use of the trade names, which con-
