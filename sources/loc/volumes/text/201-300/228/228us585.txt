their acts "if done in good faith." It may be that that
portion of the ordinance is separable if invalid. The
Supreme Court of the State said it was not necessary to
pass upon the provision. What view it might entertain it
did not clearly express. In determining the validity of the
provision the court said that it "must assume that the
ordinance is otherwise valid," and that it could not presume that plaintiff would disregard the ordinance held
by it "to be valid or place his property in a condition to
invite its destruction." "Self-inflicted damage," the court
added, "is not recoverable. The open judicial inquiry
is in such case: Was the damage self-inflicted?" In other
words, as we understand the-court, a question upon that
portion of the ordinance has not yet reached a justiciable
stage. There is certainly no destruction of the milk impending. Indeed, according to the allegations of the complaint, there is a threat only, to be executed if plaintiff
should take milk into the city, which, though he alleges
he is anxious -o do, he may not do.
Judgment affirmed.

BUGAJEWITZ v. ADAMS, UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION INSPECTOR.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO.
No. 239. Submitted April 21, 1913.-Decided May 12, 1913.
Congress has power to order the deportation of aliens whose presence in
the country it deems hurtful; and this applies to prostitutes regardless of the time they have been here.
The determination of whether an alien falls within the class that Congress had declared to be undesirable, by facts which might constitute
a crime under local law, is not a conviction of crime, nor is deportation a punishment.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Argument for Appellant.

228 U. S.

The prohibition of ex post facto laws in Art. I, § 9 of the Federal Constitution has no application to the deportation of aliens.
There is a distinction between the words" as provided" and "in the manner provided "; the former may be controlled by an express limitation
in the statute while the latter must not be so controlled; and so held
that the limitation in § 3 of the act of February 20, 1907, was stricken
out by the act of February 26, 1910, notwithstanding a reference in
the latter act to a section in the former act in which the limitation
was referred to.

THE facts, .which involve the power of Congress to deport aliens and the construction of the acts of Congress
relating to deportation of alien prostitutes, are stated in
the opinion.
Mr. Joshua Freeman Grozier and Mr. John A. Deweese
for appellant:
This act deprives the "prisoner" of her liberty "without" due process of law and is contrary to the Fifth
Amendment.
This provision of the Federal Constitution means "by
process of law" as understood at the time of adopting
this provision of the Constitution. "Due prbcess of law"
in our judicial system takes the place of the "law of the
land" under the Magna Charta. 2 Kent Com. (5th ed.),
13; Story on Const., § 1783; Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill, 146;
Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 138; Vandant v. Waddell, 2
Yerger, 260; Bank of Californiav. Oakley, 4 Pet. 443.
"By due process of law" is not simply meant an act of
Congress, but law in its regular course of administration
through the courts of justice. See Kent Com., p. 620;
Green v. Briggs, I Curtis, 325; Menges v. Dentler, 33 Pa.

Yerger, 59; Brown v.Hummel, 6 Pa. St. 86; 1 Kent Com.,
§ 24 (and note "C").
By "Judicial Power in the Constitution" is meant that
source of power which was recognized and understood to
be such at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.

Argument for Appellant.

See Federalist, 80; 2 Brock, 477. "Persons" in the Constitution of the United States applies to aliens. See Yick Wo
v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356; Wong Wing v. United States,
163 U. S. 238.
The term "person" in the Fifth Amendment is broad
enough t6 include any and every human being within
the jurisdiction of the Republic; a resident alien is entitled
to the same protection under the law of the country as a
citizen is entitled to. Wong Wing v. United States, 163
U. S. 242; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 368; In re

An alien is a "person" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In re Parrott, 1 Fed. Rep. 481-511;

An alien is entitled to the protection of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Carlisle v. United States, 16 Wall. 147.
The act of Congress does not only attempt to exclude
aliens and to deport aliens, but delegates to the executive
branch of the Government the right to try aliens for
crimes and to pass judgment in the premises and to deport
them as convicted criminals in the judgment of executive
branch of the Government. While the Government has
the right to exclude aliens and to prevent them froin
entering the territory of the Government, and also- has
the right to deport them after they have entered the
territory of the United States, (see 149 U. S. 698), the
act involved here is not only attacked because it attempts to exclude aliens, but because it attempts to delegate to the executive branch of the Government the
right to try aliens, and brand them as criminals, and because they are criminals, to deport them. The act in
question must stand together-or fall together. It is in-

capable of separation. In other words it is so constructed
that the court cannot declare one part constitutional and
the other part unconstitutional. It must stand as an
entirety, or fall as an entirety. See People v. Cooper, 83
Illinois, 585; Ex parte Towels, 48 Texas, 413; Santo v.
State, 2 Clark (Iowa), 165; Reed v. Railroad,33 California,

Texas, 630.
The court cannot construe a constitutional provision
as merely directory but as mandatory. People v. Lawrence, 36 Barber (N. Y.), 117; Cooley on Const. Lim.
74-83.
Anarchy is one of the severest crimes known to the law:
even worse than that of treason. An anarchist not only
seeks to repudiate his allegiance to his sovereign, not
only attempts to destroy the government of his sovereign,
but he seeks to destroy all governments. Therefore,
anarchy is the blackest crime known to the law. See
Lewis v. Daily News, 32 Atl. Rep. 246; Spies v. People,
122 Illinois, 1; People v. Most, 53 N. Y. Supp. 220.
This act authorizes the executive branch of the Government to try, pass judgment upon and convict the most respectable and honorable person within the territory of the
United States, who is not a citizen of this Government,
of the blackest crime as a reason for deporting said person.
The act provides that all prostitutes shall be deported.
Prostitution is a crime under the law. See State y. Stoyell,
54 Maine, 27; State v. Rice, 56 Iowa, 431; Springer v.
State, 16 Tex. App. 593; Carpenter v. People, 8 Barber,

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Harr for appellee:
No point is made, in this case, that Congress did not
intend, by omitting the three-year limitation, to remove
that limitation upon the authority to deport contained
in the act of 1907. Such purpose is clear, and the amendatory act of 1910 has been uniformly so construed. Mango

portation proceedings are not criminal, Fong Yue Ting v.

statutes. Johannessenv. United States, 225 U. S. 227, 242.
Appellant was not arrested for practicing prostitution
prior to the statute, but because she was found so engaged
after its enactment.
MR. JUSTCE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from an order discharging a writ of
habeas corpus and remanding the petitioner to custody.
The ground of the appeal is that the act of March 26, 1910,
c. 128, § 2, 36 Stat. 263, 265, relied on as authority for the
arrest, impairs the petitioner's constitutional rights. It
appears from the petition and the return to the writ that
the petitioner is an alien; that she entered the United,
States not later than January 4, 1905, and that she was
arrested on August 3, 1910, on an order of the Acting
Secretary of Commerce and Labor directing the Immigrant Inspector to take her into custody and to grant
her a hearing to show cause why she should not be deported. The order recited that she was then a prostitute
and inmate of a house of prostitution, and that she was
a prostitute at the time of entry and entered the United
States for the purpose of prostitution or for an immoral
purpose. The answer to the return demurs to its sufficiency and denies that she was a prostitute at the time of
entry or that she entered the United States for any of the
purposes alleged; but we must take it, at least, that she is a
,.prostitute now.
By the act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134, § 3, 34 Stat.
898, 899, any alien woman found practicing prostitution
within three years after she should have entered the
United States was to be deported "as provided by sections twenty and twenty-one of this act." This section
was amended by the act of March 26, 1910, c. 128, § 2,

BAGAJEWITZ v. ADAMS.

Opinion of the Court.

and the limitation of three years was stricken out, but the
amendment still refers to §§ 20, 21, and orders deporta-,
tion "in the manner provided by" §§ 20, 21. The beginning of these two sections provides for the taking into
custody of aliens subject to removal, within three years
from entry, and so it has been argued in other cases that
the three-year limitation still holds good. The construction of the amendment was not relied on here, but before
we can deal with the constitutional question it becomes
necessary to dispose of that point. We are of opinion
that the effect of striking out the three-year clause from
§ 3 is not changed by the reference to §§ 20 and 21. The
change in the phraseology of the reference indicates the
narrowed purpose. The prostitute is to be deported, not
'as provided' but 'in the manner provided' in §§ 20, 21.
Those sections provide the means for securing deportation, and it still was proper to point to them for that.
United States v. Weis, 181 Fed. Rep. 860; Chomel v. United
States, 192 Fed. Rep. 117.
The attempt to reopen the constitutional question must
fail. It is thoroughly established that Congress has power
to order the deportation of aliens whose presence in the
country it deems hurtful. The determination by facts
that might constitute a crime under local law is not a conviction of crime, nor is the deportation a punishment; it is
simply a refusal by the Government to harbor persons
whom it does 4ot want. Te coincidence of the local penal
law with the policy of Congress is an accident. Fong Yue

The prohibition of ex post facto laws in Article I, § 9, has
no application, Johannessenv. United States, 225 U. S. 227,

to construe the statute as having any retrospective effect.
