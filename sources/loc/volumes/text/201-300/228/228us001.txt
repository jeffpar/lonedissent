ABILENE NATIONAL BANK v. DOLLEY, BANK
COMMISSIONER OF THE STATE OF KANSAS.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF-THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS.

No. 175.

Submitted March 5, 1913.-Decided March 17, 1913.

The Kansas Bank Depositors' Guaranty Act is not unconstitutional

as against national banks either because it discriminates against them
in favor of state banks, impairs the obligation of existing contracts,
or deprives them of their property without due process of law.
The statutes of the United States where they do not prohibit competition with national banks do not forbid competitors to succeed.
Contracts made after a law is in force are made subject to it, and impose only such obligations and create only such property as the law
permits.
The constitutionality of this statute has already been upheld as to,
state banks in Assaria State Bank v. Dolley, 219 U. S. 121.
179 Fed. Rep. 461, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of the
Kansas Bank Depositors' Guaranty Act, are stated in the
opinion.

The Kansas statute gives preference to private deposjtors' in .state banks to exclusion of national -banks as
creditors and results in unequal -distribution of the assets'
of an insolvent state bank to the disadvantage of national
banks. Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank,'161 U. S. 275, 283.

The law will presume that the legislature knew national
banks could not accept of the guaranty provisions and
that the legislature intended to discriminate against them
and induce them to reorganize as state banks. 'Henderson v. New York, 92 U. S. 259; Easton v. Iowa, 188 U. S.

MR. JusTIC Houw~s delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a bill to restrain the putting into operation of
the Kansas Bank Depositors' Guaranty Act (March 6,
1909, Sess. Laws 1909, c. 61), and to have it declared un-

constitutional. It seems to have been filed 'at about the
same'time as the bill in Assaria State Bank v. Dolley, 219
U. S. 121, in which case the law was upheld. The main
difference between the two suits is that the othar was
brought' by. state banks, and this by national banks.
-The Circuit Court of 'Appeatls held the bill bad on demurrer, 179.Fed. Rep. 461; 102 C. C. A. 607; and it was
dismissed. A writ of certiorari was denied by this court.
218 U. 'S.-673. In view of the decisions in 219 U. S. and
in this case below we shall add comparatively few words.
The ground peculiar to this case is an alleged discrimination against national banks. Allegations in the bill
as to the purpose and intent of the statute of course are
immaterial. They introduce no new facts, and leave the
question as it would be without them, namely, whether
anything can -be discerned in the terms or effect of the
act that infringes the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. A
good deal of .the argument seems to be that the statute
will make state banks so attracive to the public that the
national banks will suffer. It is replied that experience
has not justified the prophecy. But even if it had, there
is 'nothing to hinder the States from permitting a competing business and doing what Kansas has done with intent
to make it popular and safe. The national banks are free
to.come into the scheme. The suggestion that they could
not come in and remain national banks, is simply a statement! of the situation of all competitors. They cannot
retain the advantages of their adverse situation and share
those of the arties with whom they, contend. The statutesof the United States when they'do. not attemiA to
prohilit competition wi th national, banks -do not forbid
compeiitors to suoceed,
The specific -discrimination pointed out is that under
the'Kansas statutes the national banks do not share
equally with depositors in the assets of an insolvent state
bank. The bill alleges that the plaintiffs necessarily have

Opinion of the Court.

and make deposits with state banks, and that banks necessarily borrow money from other banks and rediscount
paper in other banks, and that the obligation of their
contracts will be impaired and they will be deprived of
their property without due process of law, contrary to
Art. I, ยง 10, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The section of the statute specified as having
this effect is ยง 4, which contemplates the primary application of the assets of the bank and the double liability .of
stockholders to depositors. It is replied that the word
depositors obviously was used by mistake for creditors
and that the statute was amended by substituting the
latter word in 1911. (March 13, 1911, Sess. Laws 1911,
c. 62,. p. 103, ยง 1.) But further the language of the bill
and the argument show that the complaint refers to future
transactions, not to past. There is nothing sufficient to
raise a question as to dealings before the law went into
effect. Contracts made after the law was in'force of
course are made subject to it, and impose only such obligations and create only- such property as the. law permits.
Denny v. Bennett, 128 U. S. 489, 494. Cross Lake Shooting
& Fishing Club v. Louisiana,224 U. S. 632, 638i 639.
The greater part of the bill is taken up with objections
to the scheme of the statute in which the plaintiffs have
no concern and that have been disposed of. by the former
decision of this court upon the Kansas .act. 'There is
nothing in it that calls for further remark.
Decree affirmed.
