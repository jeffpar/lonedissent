tween the indicated classes. It is enough to say of these
contentions-(1) of the asserted discrimination in §§ 1
and 5, plaintiff in error cannot complain and, so far as it is
made a criticism of the statute, we are not concerned with
it; (2) of the distinction made by the other sections, they
are within the power of classification which the legislature
possesses.

BROOKS v. CENTRAL SAINTE JEANNE.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
PORTO RICO.
No. 283.

Submitted May 2, 1913.-Decided May 26, 1913.

Whether one is in general service of another or not, if he is rendering
the latter a service even as a volunteer and comes under his orders,
he becomes his servant, and fellow-servant of the other employ6s.
The servant is not only such while actually at work on the service for
which he is specially employed, but also during its progress while
absent from the location for tho purpose of, and in connection with,
such work.
One going in the master's conveyance on the master's business, held,
in this case, to be a fellow-servant of the driver of the conveyance.
In view of the adoption by Porto Rico in substantially the same form,
of the English Employers' Liability Act which presupposes the
existence of the common-law rule as to fellow-servants, and the
provisions of that act in regard to exceptions in specific instances, and
in the absence of any authorities to the contrary, held that the law

in Porto Rico in regard to the fellow-servant defense does not differ
from the common law.
A single expression in the testimony that the driver of an automobile
was accustomed to drink while driving the machine, there being
other testimony importing usual sobriety, does not justify a finding
of negligence on the part of the employer for employing a servant
who was incompetent as an excessive drinker.

facts; which involve the application in a case for
personal injuries in Porto Rico of the defense of negligence
of a fellow-servant, and the determination of whether the
employ6 of the defendant whose negligence caused the
injury was a fellow-servant of the plaintiff, are stated in
the opinion.
THE

Mr. N. B. K. Pettingill and Mr. George H. Lamar for
plaintiff in error:
The fellow-servant rule is not applicable. Plaintiff was
not an employ6 of the defendant for any purpose. During
the enterprise resulting from an invitation to assist in the
erection of the plant, plaintiff was not acting as an employ6 of defendant, but entered upon the enterprise in
the capacity of a friendly helper by invitation, and was
riding upon the automobile truck at the time of the accident as a gratuitous passenger, by like invitation. Railroad Co. v. Fort, 17 Wall. 553; No. Pac. R. Co. v. Hambly,
154 U. S. 349, 357.
When an employ6 is not engaged in his work, his rights
are not to be determined by the principles applicable to
the relation of master and servant. Fletcher v. B. & R.
Co., 168 U. S. 135, 138.
Plaintiff's rights were the same as if he had had no business connection of any kind with defendant company, but
had been a stranger riding as a passenger by invitation
issued under due authority.
A gratuitous passenger may recover from owner for
negligence of driver. Thorogood v. Bryan, 8 C. B. 114;

of vehicle, before the arrival of the automobile. There is
nothing in the structure or management of that vehicle
which makes the above rule inapplicable. On the contrary, its greater speed and required skill and attention
in management has resulted in making more apparent the
reason and necessity for applying that rule. Wilson v.

Co., 179 U. S. 658.
MR. JusTIcE HO1MEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an action for personal injuries suffered in Porto
Rico. The declaration alleges that the plaintiff at the
defendant's request made a trip on an automobile of the
latter "for the purpose of aiding other employs of the
defendant in moving a certain boiler which was the property of the defendant," and that in returning from the trip
the automobile was so negligently operated by the defendant, its agents and employ6s, that it was driven into a ditch
and the plaintiff was badly hurt. There was a trial by
jury, in which, at the end of the plaintiff's evidence, the
judge directed a verdict for the defendant and the plaintiff
excepted. The evidence showed that the machine was
driven by a servant of the defendant, so that it appeared
in proof.that the plaintiff was suing for an injury caused
by a fellow-servant, as is to be inferred from the face of
the declaration itself.
Notwithstanding the admission that the plaintiff was
an employ6 of the defendant, imported by the words 'for
the purpose of aiding other employds.' it is argued that

Opinion of the Court.

the plaintiff was not a fellow-servant, and therefore, although the contention hardly is open, the substance of the
testimony may be stated. The plaintiff's general employers had sold a sugar mill to the Central, delivered in
New Orleans. At the request of the Central they had sent
over the plaintiff to put up a chimney, a battery of six
boilers and a bagasse track. While at the work he seems
to have been paid by the defendant and was under the
direction of its chief engineer. The chimney had been
nearly finished and the next work was to set up the
boilers, but they had not arrived. The man in charge of
the transportation directed the plaintiff to go and help to
get a boiler, which, after asking the chief engineer for
leave, he did. When they got to the boiler there were not
enough machines to haul it, so that they had to return to
the Central. On the way the driver seems to have been
more or less drunk, and negligently, it must be assumed,
upset the machine.
•Whether the plaintiff was in the general employ of the
defendant, as he seems to have been, or not, the service
that he consented to render was the defendant's work.
In rendering that, at least, he came under its orders and
became its servant. Assuming in his favor that he was a
volunteer, that fact did not enlarge his rights. Degg v.
Midland Ry. Co., 1 H. & N. 773; Potterv. Faulkner, 1 Best
& Sm. 800; Barstow v. Old Colony R. R. Co., 143 Massachusetts, 535, 536; Wischam v. Richards, 136 Pa. St. 109.
Other cases will be found in 2 Labatt, Master & Servant,
§ 631. He was the defendant's servant not only while
actually at work on the boiler but during the trip taken
for the purpose of doing the work. Northern Pacific R. R.
Co. v. Peterson, 162 U. S. 346, 358. Martin v. Atchison,
Topeka & SantaFe R. R. Co., 166 U. S. 399, 403. Texas &
Pacific Ry. CO. v. Bourman, 212 U. S. 536, 538, 539. And
he was fellow-servant with the driver of the machine.

Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Dixon, 194 U. S. 338. Texas &
Pacific Ry. Co. v. Bourman, 212 U. S. 536, 541. Beutler v.
Grand Trunk Junction Ry. Co., 224 U. S. 85. If the law of
Porto Rico does not differ in this respect from the common
law, the direction to the jury was right.
Whether the common law rule prevails is not made
clear by any authority cited. But by the act of March 1,
1902, (Rev. Stats. & Codes, 1902, p. 150), the English
Employers' Liability Act was copied more or less exactly,
as it has been in some of the States. That statute presupposes the common law rule as to fellow-servants, Ryalls v.
Mechanics' Mills, 150 Massachusetts, 190, 191, and the
Porto Rican copy would be hard to account for except
upon the same presupposition. If a master were liable for
injuries caused by the negligence of a fellow-servant there
would be no need of enacting that he should be liable for
such injuries in specific cases, as the statute does, and no
sense in the provision of § 10 that the act shall not apply
to injuries caused to domestic servants, or farm laborers,
by fellow-employ6s. Therefore, while we might hesitate
if we were deducing the rule from the considerations on
which it originally was placed, Schlemmer v. Buffalo,,
Rochester & PittsburgRy. Co., 205 U. S. 1, 11, 12, as indeed
one might hesitate about the more general liability to
which it is an exception, we must assume that it exists,
even laying on one side the suggestion that the statute
offers the only remedy for cases within it. We should add
that this suit is not brought under the act.
It was argued, evidently as an afterthought for which
no foundation was laid in the pleadings, that the defendant might have been liable on the ground that it employed
an incompetent servant. This suggestion is based on a
single expression concerning the driver, that it was his
custom to drink while driving the machine. This neither
stated nor meant, so far as we can judge, that it was the
custom of the driver to drink to excess or so as to unfit

him for his work. The only other reference to the matter
was by another of the plaintiff's witnesses, that the driver
was "not in the mood or attitude which he usually had
when we worked together in the shops," importing usual
sobriety. It would have been permitting a mere guess, to
allow the jury to find for the plaintiff on this ground.
Judgment affirmed.

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT
COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 290.

Argued May 5, 6,1913.-Decided May 26, 1913.

Whether or not the copartnership is an entity distinct from the members, partnership debts are debts of the members of the firm.
The individual liability of partners for debts of the firm is primary and
direct; it is not collateral like that of a surety.
The business of a bankruptcy act is so far as may be to preserve, not
to upset, existing relations based on fundamental rules of law.
The Bankruptcy Act recognizes the firm as an entity for certain purposes, but does not alter the preexisting rule that the partnership
can be in bankruptcy and the partners not.
In this case an order directing that the separate estate of a member of
a firm which had been adjudicated bankrupt be turned over to the
trustee for administration is affirmed.
