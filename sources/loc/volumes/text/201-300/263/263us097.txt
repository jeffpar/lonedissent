1. The act of state officials in issuing a patent, under a state statute

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Opinion of the Court.

263 U. S.

This is a petitory action for land in New Orleans
brought by the Brotts against the New Orleans Land
Company. Judgment was given for the Brotts except as
to one parcel which was adjudged to belong, to the defendant. The defendant brings a writ of error and the
Brotts a cross writ. The ground of the judgment was
that the State acquired title to the land under the Swamp
Land Act of March 2, 1849,.c. 87; 9 Stat. 352, and conveyed it to the plaintiffs' predeeessors, except that the
parcel awarded to the defendant was "held to have been
excluded from-the Swamp Land grant to the State because
before the territory was transferred by France to the
United States it had been conveyed to private persons by
a complete grant.
The New Orleans Land Company contends that at the
time of the Swamp Land Act all the land in controversy
was in private hands and therefore did not pass to the
State; the statute providing that the Secretary of the
Treasury shall approve the list of swamp lands directed
to be made out "so far as they are not claimed or held by
individuals," and the list having been approved "subject
to any valid legal rights." It asks this Court to take
jurisdiction on the ground that there is dravn in question
the validity of an authority exercised under a state law,
that is, the' issue of the patent, on the ground that it was
repugnant to the Treaty of 1803 with France, 8 Stat. 202,
and the laws of the United States, and that the decision
upheld the validity of the state patent. It also sets up
a prior purchase under a decree of the Circuit Court of
the United States, but that contention is disposed of by
New Orleans Land Co. v. Leader Realty Co., 255 U. S.
266. The Brotts rely upon alleged errors as to the grants
before the treaty and in recognizing a title under them,
even if it existed, when the alleged owner had -not had it
confirmed as required by the Act of March 2, 1805, c. 26,
§ 4; 2 Stat. 324, 326, and later acts.

NEW ORLEANS CO. v. BROTT.
97

Opinion of the Court.

The defendant, the Land Company, to make out its
case would have to maintain that notwithstanding the
unquestionable validity of the Acts of 1805 and later,
requiring outstanding titles to be established or registered
after Louisiana was acquired by the United States,
Botiller v. Dominguez, 130 U. S. 238, and notwithstanding the failure of its predecessor in title to comply with
the requirement, the land did not pass to the State under
the Swamp Land grant if at that timne there was any outstanding claim even though the claim turned out to be
void. Whatever may be thought of the proposition we
cannot deal with it now. No statute of Louisiana has
been called to our attention that purports to identify and
authorize a conveyance of these particular lands. See La.
Stats., March 14, 1855, No. 247; March 16, 1870, No. 38;
May 31, 1871, No. 104; Rev. Stats. 1870, § 2920. The validity of no statute has been called in question. The conveyances under which the Brotts claim were authorized
by state law only if the lands concerned were part of the
Swamp Land grant to Louisiana. The general authority
to convey such lands is not attacked, but only the specific
patent. If by any chance or hiatus the present lands were
ndt embraced the officials who undertook to convey them
were not exercising an authority under the State within
the rather narrow meaning that necessarily has been given
to the phrase in the statute authorizing writs of error.

Calumet & Chicago Canal & Dock Co., 138 U. S. 635.

250 U. S. 220. Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, § 2;39 Stat. 726. It follows that the New Orleans Land
Company's writ of error must be dismissed.
The cross writ taken out by the Brotts also must be
dismissed. There very well may have been ground for a
writ of certiorari but'there is no suggestion that would

MANUFACTURING COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 75. Argued October 15, 16, 1923.-Decided November 12, 1923.
The sale, by the patentee, of a costly and durable copying machine
dependent for its operation on bands of gelatine, which are attached to spools and which cost little and are quickly used up,
implies a right in the purchaser to replace such bands as they wear
out, without further consent of the seller; and their manufacture
and sale for that purpose by another is therefore not an infringement, though the band when used in the combination is covered
by the patent. Wilson v. Simpson, 9 How. 109. P. 101.
