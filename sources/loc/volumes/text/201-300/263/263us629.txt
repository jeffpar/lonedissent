Syllabus.

Manifestly, on these facts, the Government is not
estopped to show that its contract applied only within
narrow limits. If the facts were as it had a right to suppose them to be, the contract necessarily was so limited.
The Government thought that it might be that the
claimant had found a more perfect way to do what was
wanted and what the Bliss Company already had done,
but, on the record before us, it would be monstrous to suppose that it was undertaking to pay the claimant for the
Bliss Company product. The claimant was thought by the
Government to have failed in its undertaking, and therefore its device was laid aside. That device had certain
peculiarities not repeated by the Bliss Company's, but the
claimant relies and has to"rely here upon the broad contention that the introduction of water to the combustion
chamber in an. effective way belongs to it, which seems
unlikely in view of the previous British patent to Sodeau,
in 1907, and others, and which it seems to us clearly
might have been found, as by implication it was found,
by the Court of Claims, not to have been the assumption
or the meaning of the contract.. So far as appears, the use
of water by the Bliss Company owed nothing to Davison,
the claimant's assignor, but very closely embodied the
suggestions of Sodeau and other predecessors, in the field.
We cannot say as matter of law that the Court of Claims
was wrong.
Decree affirmed.

Questions certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
Mr. Arthur E. Weil for Washington-Southern Navigation Company.
Mr. Thomas Raeburn White, with whom Mr. John
Cadwalader,Jr., was on the brief, for Baltimore & Philadelphia Steamboat Company.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Washington-Southern Navigation Company, the
charterer of two steamers of the Baltimore & Philadelphia
Steamboat Company, filed, in the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, a libel in personam against the owner' to
recover the sum of $120,000 for breach of the charter
party. The usual bond for-costs was given. No attachment or seizure of the property of the respondent was
made or sought. The owner traversed the essential averments of the libel, and also fied a cross-libel in which it
sought damages in the sum of $43,443.25. There was no
attachment or seizure of person or property under the
cross-libel. The essential allegations of the cross-libel
were -in turn denied by the charterer. Thereafter, the
owner moved that the charterer be required to give security to respond in damages on the counterclaim. The

trial court ordered it to do so, provided the owner first
gave security to pay the charterer's claim. 271 Fed. 540.
This the owner did of his own motion and without compulsion. The charterer did not give the security ordered.
Thereupon, the trial court entered a decree staying all proceedings until its order should be obeyed.
The motion and order were based on Rule 50 of the new
Admiralty Rules, promulgated December 6, 1920, 254
U. S. 24 (appendix), which amends former Rule 53, 210
U. S. 562, by adding thereto the words italicised, so that it
now reads:
Rule 50. "Whenever a cross-iibel is filed upon any
counterclaim arising out of the same contract or cause of
action for which the original libel was filed, and the respondent or claimant in the originalsuit shall have given
security to respond in damages, the respondent in the
cross-libel shall give security in the usual amount and
form to respond in damages to the claims set forth in said
cross-libel, unless the court, for cause shown, shall othervise direct; and all proceedings on the original libel shall
be stayed until such security be given unless the court
otheruyise directs."
The charterer appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
That court, under § 239 of the Judicial Code, asks instruction whether. this rule empowers the District Court to stay
proceedings in the original suit until the original libelant.
shall have given security to respond to the counterclaim,
in a case where the original libel was in personam and the
original respondent (the cross-libelant) has given the security voluntarily; that is, of his own motion and without
compulsion.
The owner insists that the terms of Rule 50 are so clear
that there is no room for a construction different from that
given to it by the District Court. But to ascertain the
true meaning of the rule, the operation and effect of the
construction urged must be considered. Under that given,

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.

263 U. S.

a libelant may be automatically barred from prosecuting
his suit, merely because he is unable or unwilling to give
security to satisfy the claim made in the cross-libel. For,
although no security is 'asked of the original respondent,
he may, by voluntarily giving security, effect a stay of all
proceedings against himself, "unless the court, for cause
shown ", directs otherwise.- Thus construed, Rule 50
would abrogate the right to proceed in admiralty, and substitute therefor either a conditional right to prosecute the
suit, provided libelant gives security to satisfy the counterclaim, or a permission to do so, provided the court, in
ifs discretion, for cause shown, grants leave. Moreover,
the circumstances under which alone this loss of the right
to sue would occur are whimsical. The original libelant
could proceed without givhing the security, if the respondent, instead of filing a cross-libel, brought an independent
cross-suit. Likewise, if the person who feels himself aggrieved, instead of exercising diligence in prosecuting his
claim, exercises self-restraint, and allows the other party
to the controversy to commence the hostilities, he may,
without giving the security, exercise the right to prosecute
his cause of action, either by a cross-libel or by an independent cross-action.- An intention to introduce a practice so capricious is not to be lightly imputed.
. To ascertain the trile meaning of the rule, it must be
read, also, in the light of the established admiralty jurisdiction, of the general principles of maritime law, and of
the appropriate function of rules of court. Before Rule

Opinion of the Court.

53 was adopted 3, the general practice in admiralty concerning the giving of security had long been settled.
Every party-libelant, respondent, claimant, and intervenor-was obliged, or could be required, to give security
for costs. No party could be required to give security to
satisfy the claim of another. In suits in personam, whete
the mesne process'was solely by simple monition in the
nature of a summons to appear and answer the suit, no security, except that for costs, was ever given by the respondent. Where the process included a clause for mesne attachment of property, the respondent was not obliged to
give any security except for costs; but he could, if he
chose, obtain dissolution of the attachment by giving
security to pay the amount of the decree against him not
exceeding the value of the attached property. Where the
mesne process was by waftant of arrest of the person in
the nature of a capias, the respondent was, likewise, not
obliged to give security for the claim; but he could, if he
chose, obtain his release by giving bail to secure his appearance and/or to satisfy the decree. Where the suit was
in rem, the claimant was under no obligation to give such
security; but he could, if he chose, obtain release of the
property seized by giving security for its value or for the
amount required to satisfy the claims made. Thus,
neither respondent, claimant nor intervenor could, as a

condition of prosecuting his claim or defence, be compelled to furnish any security other than for costs. And
the libelant could never be put into a situation which
obliged him to give any other security. Such was still the
practice concerning the giving of security for claims prosecuted in admiralty (except as modified by Rule 53) when
Rule 50 was incorporated in the revision of December
6, 1920.:
The construction given to Rule 50 by the District Court
would, by imposing an impossible or onerous condition,
deprive many litigants of the right to prosecute their
claims in admiralty. Among others, it would, if applied
generally, deny this right to seamen, upon whom, regardless of their means or nationality, Congress, shortly before
the adoption of Rule 50, had conferred the right to prosecute their claims, in both trial and appellate courts, without giving security even for costs.' It would likewise deny
to poor citizens of the United States the right to proceed
in admiralty, which Congress had by successive acts sought
to ensure, in order to relieve litigants from dependence
upon the judicial discretion theretofore incident to leave

prosecute his claim to judgment. Illinois CentralR. R. Co.
v. Adams, 180 U. S. 28, 34; McClellan v. Carland,217 U. S.

6f poor persons or of others to prosecute suits in admiralty.
The function of rules is to regulate the practice of the
court and to facilitate the transaction of its business. This
function embraces, among other things, the regulation of
the forms, operation and effect of process; and the prescribing of forms, modes and times for proceedings. Most
rules are merely a formulation of the previous practice of
the courts. Occasionally, a rule is employed to express, in
convenient form, as applicable to certain classes of cases,
a principle of substantive law which has been established
by statute or decisions. But no rule of court can enlarge
or restrict jurisdiction.- Nor can a rule abrogate or modify
the substantive law. This is true, whether the court to
which the rules apply be one of law, of equity or of admiralty. It is true of rules of practice prescribed by this
Court for inferior tribunals, as it is of those rules which

lower courts make for their own guidance under authority
conferred.
It remains to consider the purpose of Rule 50. The
cross-libel, unlike the cross-bill in equity, is of recent
origin. This simple device in aid of the administration of
justice was not establishel in the English courts of admiralty until, under the name of cross-cause, it was authorized by the Admiralty Court Act of 1861, 24 and 25
Vict., c. 10, § 34. Theretofore, that court considered itself without power even to compel consolidation of. independent cross-suits or to stay one to await proceedings in
the other. Moreover, where the original libel was filed by
a non-resident libelant, substituted service in a crossaction, by serving his proctor, was not permitted, until
this was authorized by a rule of court adopted in 1859.s
In American courts of admiralty the practice was more
liberal. Set-off being of statutory origin and not expressly
authorized in admiralty, was rejected here as in England.'. But Congress conferred upon all federal courts,
in 1813, the right to compel consolidation of causes. The

Opinion of the Court.

North Star, 106 U. S. 17, 27. Later, our admiralty courts

recognized the propriety of affording affirmative relief by
a cross-libel, in analogy to the cross-bill in equity.10 The
procedure on cross-libels and their scope remained, however, unsettled.1
Rule 53 was doubtless suggested by § 34 of the English
Admiralty Court Act.1 By that provision, the court was
authorized, in certain cases, to suspend proceedings in the
original cause until security had been given to answer
judgment in the "cross cause." 1 The power was in its

(as distinguished from a cross-action) was definitely recognized appears to be Snow v. Carruth,1 Sprague, 324, 327 (1856). Compare
The Hudson, Olcott, 396 (1846); Ward v. Ogdensburgh, 5 McLean,
622 (1853); Kennedy v.Dodge,1 Ben.311, 316 (1867).
"IWard v. Chamberlain, 21 How. 572, 574 (1858), declared that on
the cross-libel process must be taken out and served in the usual way.
See The Ping-On v. Blethen, 11 Fed. 607, 611; The Edward H. Blake,
92 Fed. 202, 206. Nichols v. Tremlett, 1 Sprague, 361, 365 (1857),
held that substituted service of the cross-libel could not be made
upon the proctor of an original non-resident. libelant; but that the
court had power to compel subnission to the jurisdiction by staying
proceedings on the original libel until an appearance was entered on
the cross-libel.. The power to order substituted service of the crosslibel on the proctor of a non-resident libelant was still considered debatable in 1894. The Eliza Lines, 61 Fed. 308, 322-324. See also The

on the application of the defendant in any cause of damage, and on
his instituting a cross cause for the damage sustained by him in respect of the same collision, direct that the principal cause and the
cross cause be heard at the same time and upon the same evidence;
and if in the principal cause the ship of the defendant has been arrested or security given by him to answer judgment, and in the cross
cause the ship of the plaintiff cannot be arrested, and security has not
been given to answer judgment therein, the Court may, if it think fit,
suspend the proceedings in the principal cause, until security has been
given to answer judgment in the cross cause." The same provision
was introduced in Ireland in 1867, 30 and 31 Vict., c. 114, § 72.

terms limited to cases in which the ship of the original defendant had been arrested or he had given bail. The
courts held that the act does not apply where the original
libel was in personam;"' and that in actions in rem, it had,
thereunder, no power to order a stay where there had been
no arrest and the defendant had given bail voluntarily.1 5
Rule 53 did not so limit the power to suits in rem. For,
while process in the nature of foreign attachment in suits
in personam fell into disuse in England, it had become the
established practice in this country. Neither was Rule
53 in terms limited to suits where the original libelant had
made an arrest or attachment. But, although it remained
in force, unmodified, for more than half a century, no reported case discloses that a stay was ordered under it,
except where the original respondent had been obliged to
give security in order to obtain release of the ship or of attached property." Here, as in England, the purpose of
the provision was declared to be to place the parties on an

satisfy the counter claim could not be exacted by means
of a stay, unless the original libelant had compelled the
giving of such security to satisfy his own claim.
The new phrases introduced in Rule 50 Were not designed to introduce any new practice concerning crosslibels. Their purpose was to formulate the practice which
had become settled. This is true of those relating to the
giving of security, as it is of those concerning the character
