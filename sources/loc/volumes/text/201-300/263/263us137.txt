ERROR AND CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE
STATE OF TEXAS.

No. 12. Argued October 2, 1923.-Decided November 12, 1923.
1. That the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent a State from
taxing the intangible property of a railroad, ascertaining its value
by deducting the value of its physical assets from the value of its
property as a whole, within the State; or from taxing railroads by
other rules than those prescrijed for other business concerns; or
from imposing double taxation,--are propositions long settled,
denial of which is frivolous. P. 140.
2. Over-assessment due to mere error of judgment is not reviewable
here as a violation of due process of law. P. 141.
3. Where assessments of tangible and intangible railroad property
are made independently by separate boards, but the taxes are laid
on both at the same rate, collected by the same county officers,

and treated by the state law as constituting together a single

REviiw of a judgment of the Supreme Court of Texas,
sustaining and enforcing a tax on railroad property, in a
suit brought by its receivers to enjoin collection. The
questions concerning the validity of the state taxing statute, upon which the writ of error was based, are held to be
without substance, and that writ is dismissed; but the
writ of certiorari is granted and under it other questions,
arising in the administration of the statute, are reviewed.
Mr. Samuel B. Dabney for plaintiffs in error and petitioners.
Mr. W. A. Keeling, Attorney General of the State of
Texas, for defendants in error and respondents, submitted.
Mr. Frank M. Kemp, Assistant ,Attorney General, was
also on the briefs.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This suit was brought in-a state court of Texas by the
receivers of a Texas corporation, the International &
Great Northern Railway, against the taxing authorities
for Harris County. It seeks to enjoin the collection of
the tax assessed for the year 1915 upon the so-called intangible property of the company within that county.
The trial court denied the relief prayed; and, on defendants' cross action and a plea in reconvention, entered
judgment against the plaintiffs for the amount of the tax.
The Court of Civil Appeals reversed this judgment and
granted the injunction. 197 S. W. 1043. Its judgment
was in turn reversed by the Supreme Court of the State

which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 229 S. W.
493. The case comes here on writ of error under ยง 237
of the Judicial Code as amended; and also on a petition
for a writ of certiorari, consideration of which was postponed until the hearing on the writ of error. The claims
are that the statute under which the taxes were assessed
is obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment; and that
rights guaranteed by it have been denied in the administration of the statute.
Under the laws of Texas ad valorem taxes for both state
and county purposes, are laid upon the property of a
railroad in every county in which its lin:. is located. The
value is determined separately for tangible and for intangible property. The assessment of the tangible property
is made by county officials. The assessment of the intangible property is fixed by the State Tax Board. It
values the intangible property of the company as a whole;
and then apportions the amount among the several counties on a mileage basis. Upon the aggregate of the assessments of the tangible and the intangible property so made
for each county, the tax is laid by the county officials at
the rate found to be necessary and collected -by the
county's tax collector.1
Intangible values of a railroad company have been declared by the highest court of the State to mean "the
values of the railroad properties above the value of its
physical assets." Missouri, Kansas & Texas lRy. Co. v.
Shannon, 100'Texas, 379, 390. Under the statute the
value of the intangible is to be determined by deducting
the value of the tangible from the value of the entire railroad property. Article 7420. To enable the State Board
to determine the values, the company is required to furnish data. Articles 7415-7419. The Board, on the other

hand, is required to submit a preliminary estimate of the
valuation and to give the company an opportunity to be
heard thereon, so that changes may be made before the
Valuation is declared effective. Some methods of calculation are set forth in the statute; but it is provided that
these are not to be deemed mandatory; that all available
evidence must be considered; and that the method of calculation which will best bring about a fair valuation shall
be adopted. Article 7419.
The Board duly submitted its preliminary estimate:
This it later amended upon the discovery of an error.
Thereupon a hearing was held at which the company introduced evidence. The Board adhered to its own estimate as amended. The aggregate assessment for the year
1915 upon. this railroad's property within Harris County
was $1,709,332. Of this amount, $603,227.44 was on intangible property. The tax rate was $1.09 per $100 of
valuation. The amount of the tax so laid was $6,605.34.
The trial court found that the actual value of the tangible
property alone in Harris County was $3,205,202.09; and
that the assessment upon this was only 34 per cent. of
'that value.
The contention that the statute violates the Fourteenth
Amendment is wholly without merit. It has long been
settled that the due process clause does not preclude a
-State from tdxing the intangible property of a railroad,
or from.ascertaining its value substantially in the manner
prescribed by the statute herein assailed; that the equal
protection- clause is not violated by-prescribing different
rules ot taxation for railroad companies'than for concerns
engaged in. other lines of business; 2 and that the Federal

Opinion of the Court.

Constitution does not afford protection against double
axation by a State, which is here alleged.3 The writ of
error is dismissed. The contention that the due process
and equal protection clauses have been violated in administering the statute is rested upon many claims. Two of
them are substantial. The writ of certiorari is, therefore,
granted. But, for the reasons to- be stated, the judgment
below must be affirmed.
The company-has 1106 miles of road and extends into
road and
thirty-seven counties. The alleged cost of its '"
equipment"" to June 30, 1915, was $46,502,041.55; its
alleged depreciated value (as of June 30, 1914) $37,243,133.44; its value as fixed by the Railroad Commission, $34,013,092.07. A foreclosure'was.effected in 1911.
The reorganization largely reducbd the capitalization,
leaving outstanding a mortgage debt of only $25,239,000.00, and capital stock of $4,822,000. The net
earnings of the company in 1911 to 1914 were so small
that, if the property were capitalized on the basis of
seven per cent., it would appear to have been worth less
than $30,000,000 in 1912, and in 1914 less than $1,000,000.
In the lafter year the company, unable to pay its fixed
charges, again passed into receivers' hands. The State
Tax Board fied the-value of the physical property in
1915 at $28,372,810, and of the intangibles at $10,743,223;
making the value of the entire property $39,116,033.
The receivers contend that, even if the value of the
entire property was as found by the State Board, the
physical property was undervalued, resulting in an overvaluation of the intangibles so gross as to amount to a
denial of due process of law. There was evidence, ineluding statements made by the receivers, which supports
the State Board's valuation.. The trial court, upholding
this valuation, found that it represented the honest judg'Kidd-v. Alabama, 188 U. S. 730, 732; Cream of -Wheat Co. v
Grand Forks, 253 U. S.325, 330.

ment of the State Board; and that there was no evidence
of arbitrary action or of improper motives on its part.
This holding of the trial court was approved by the highest court of the State. There is no evidence of arbitrary
action, of fraud, or of gross error in the system on which
the valuation was made, to justify the claim of denial of
due process. Pittsburgh,Cincinnati,Chicago & St. Louis
Ry. Co. v. Backus, 154 U. S. 421, 434; Maish v. Arizona,
164 U. S. 599, 610. Mere errors of judgment are not subject to review in this proceeding. Southern Ry. Co. v.
Watts, 260 U. S. 519, 527.
The receivers also contend that the tax is void, under
the equal protection clause, because the tangibles were
intentionally and systematically assessed, by the county
authorities, at not more than 38 per cent. of their actual
value, while intangibles were assessed, by the State Board,
at their full value. Where illegal discrimination was
practiced, it is immaterial whether it was effected by a
single assessing board or through the action of two independent boards. Greene v. Louisville & InterurbanR. R.
Co., 244 U. S. 499, 513; Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, 260
U. S. 519, 526. Under the laws of Texas the assessments
are made by the separate action of two independent
boards using different methods, but the taxes upon the
tafigible and the intangible property of railroads, are laid
at the same rate, and are collected by the same county
officers. It is the settled law of the State that equitable
relief will not be granted, on the ground of discrimination, against an excessive assessment of either one, if,.
taking the tax on tangible and the tax on intangible
property together, the taxpayer is not called upon to pay,
on the average, on a higher percentage of the actual value
than are other persons and property. Missouri, Kansas
& Texas Ry. Co. v. Hassell, 57 Tex. Civ. App. 522;
Druesedow v. Baker, 229 S. W. 493. Thus, the taxes on.
the two kinds of property are treated by its courts as parts

of a single ad valorem tax on railroads. Their construction of the state statutes is binding upon us. The trial
court found on adequate evidence that the aggregate assessment placed upon the tangible and the intangible
property of the railroad in Harris County was about 45
per cent. of their aggregate true value, whereas the other
property in the county was assessed at about 50 per cent.
of its true value. Thus the railroad was not, in essence,
subject to any discrimination. Compare Davenport Bank
v. Davenport, 123 U. S. 83. The requirement of the
equal protection clause was satisfied.
Affirmed.

1. To maintain a suit to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission upon the ground that it exceeded the powers of
the Commission, it is not essential that a plaintiff should have been
a party to the proceedings before the Commission in which the
order was made. P. 147.

order alleged to be void subjects him to actual or threatened legal
injury. P. 148.
3. Where the interest shown by a group of lumber manufacturers in
attacking an order of the Commission, which abolished a penalfy
charge on lumber held at reconsignment points, was in the handicap
which the charge imposed on competing jobbers, and in th.e possibility that its removal might divert the cars of carriers, including
those of their own projected railroad, from transportation to storage
usesr-hed, that they had no standing to sue to set the order aside,
