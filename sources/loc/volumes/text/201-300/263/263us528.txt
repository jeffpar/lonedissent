PEORIA & PEKIN UNION RAILWAY COMPANY
v. UNITED STATES, INTERSTATE COMMERCE
COMMISSION, AND MINNEAPOLIS & ST. LOUIS
RAILROAD COMPANY.
APPEAL FRO'" THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 318.

Argued November 20, 21, 1923.-Decided January 7, 1924.

1. The authority conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission by the Transportation Act, 1920, to issue orders without
notice or hearing, in certain classes of cases, if it finds that an
emergency exists, does not sustain an order, so issued, requiring
a terminal carrier to switch, by its own engines and over its own
tracks, freight cars tendered by or for another connecting carrier.
P. 632.
2. The provision of the Act of October 22, 1913, that suit to set
aside an order of the Commission shall be brought in the district
of the residence of the party on whose petition the order was made,
relates to venue, not to jurisdiction of the subject matter; and
objection that the suit is in another district, will be waived if not
made in the trial court. P. 535.
3. In a suit of that kind, wherein the District Court overruled an
objection by the United States to the venue, but refused a temporary injunction, and the plaintiff appealed, held that the right of
the United States to insist upon its objection was lost by its failure
to take a cross appeal. Id.

Opinion of the Court.

263 U. S.

Mr. Donald Evans, with whom Mr. M. M. Joyce was
on the brief, for Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Company, appellee.
Whether, as an abstract proposition, the order in its
terms goes beyond the powers conferred by Congress is
immaterial, for the reason that, under the situation as
presented by the record, the plaintiff has failed to show
that, as a result of the issuance of the order, its property
is being taken for public use without compensation, or
that it is deprived of its property without due process of
law. The claims of constitutional infringement of plaintiff's rights are based entirely upon the assumption that
the services required to be performed and the facilities
furnished are performed for and furnished to the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Company. This is an erroneous assumption. The facilities are furnished to the tenants of the plaintiff under tenancy contracts. The services are performed for the tenants under the same agreements. By virtue of those contracts, the facilities have
become part of the railroads of the tenants, and neither
they nor their agent has any right to collect from a connection a charge for receiving or delivering a car in interchange. The plaintiff has no right to be compensated
.by this defendant, and, this being the only right of which
it claims it is deprived by the issuance of the service
order, it follows that the order of the District Court must
be affirmed.
MR. JusTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Transportation Act 1920 confers upon the Interstate
Commerce Commission authority to issue, in certain
classes of cases, orders "with or without notice, hearing,
or the making or filing of a report," if it finds that an
emergency exists. Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91, § 402,
41 Stat. 456, 476-477, 486.
Purporting to act under this power, the Commission
ordered, without notice or hearing, that the Peoria &

Opinion of the Court.

Pekin Union Railway Company " continue to interchange
freight traffic between the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Company and connecting carriers at the regularly
established interchange points at and in the vicinity of
Peoria, Ill." This order required the terminal company
to switch, by its own engines and over its own tracks,
freight cars tendered to it by, or for, the Minneapolis &
St. Louis, a service which it had Threatened to discontinue
because the payment demanded therefor had been refused.1 The Peoria Company insisted that the Commission was without authority under its emergency power
to require one carrier to switch cars for another; and
brought this suit against the United States in the federal
court for southern Illinois to enjoin the enforcement of
the order. The Commission and the Minneapolis & St.
Louis intervened as defendants. The case was heard
upon application for a temporary injunction; the injunction was denied; and the Peoria Company took a direct
appeal to this Court under the Act of October 22, 1913,
c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220.
It is conceded that the Commission could, under its
general powers and upon appropriate procedure, order a
terminal company to perform a service of this character.
But under the general powers of the Commission this
could be done only after full hearing, and such an order
would ordinarily not take effect under the law until thirty
days after service. It is also conceded that the existing

conditions were such as to justify entry of the order under
the emergency powers, if these include the requiring of
switching. The objection urged is that the emergency
power conferred is limited to orders which direct the
manner in which transportation servi4e shall be rendered
or which prescribe the use to be made of railroad property; and that no such authority is granted to require
performance of a transportation service. The substantive
question presented is one of statutory construction-the
scope of the emergency power.
The Commission possessed no emergency power prior
to the so-called Esch Car Service Act, May 29, 1917, c.
23, 40 Stat. 101.- Its provisions were amended by Transportation Act 1920; and in the amended form are introduced as paragraphs 15 and 16 of § 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce and as paragraph 4 of § 15. 41 Stat.
476-7, 486. Paragraph 15 deals in sub-paragraphs (a)
and (bx) with car service; in sub-paragraph (c) with the
common use of terminals; in sub-paragraph (d) with
preferences in transportation, embargoes, and movement
of traffic under permits. Paragraph 16 and the amendment to § 15 confer emergency power to reroute traffic
and to "establish temporarily such through routes as in
its [the Commission's] opinion are necessary or desirable
in the public interest." None of these provisions grants
in terms power to require the performance of a transportation service. The specific grant in paragraph 16 of
emergency power to "make such just and reasonable
directions- with respect to the handling, routing, and
movement of the traffic of such carrier and its distribution over other lines of roads," and the omission of any
reference to switching, tend to rebut an intention to grant
the power here asserted. The order cannot be justified
'Except that to suspend a tariff increasing rates, as provided in
the Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, § 12, 36 Stat. 539,'552, added to
§ 15 of the Act to Regulate Commerce as paragraph 7.

Opinion of the Court.

as dealing with preferences in transportation or embargoes under sub-paragraph (d). Nor does the order provide for the joint use of terminals under sub-paragraph
(c)4; since it does not purport to authorize the Minneapolis & St. Louis to use the tracks and terminals of the
Peoria Company. The contentions mainly urged are that
the order is one concerning car service under sub-paragraph (b)'; or that power to require switching should be
held to have been granted by implication.
The argument that the authority of the Commission
over car service should be construed to include the requiring of switching rests upon paragraph 10 of amended § 1
of the Act to Regulate Commerce.' But ",car service"
connotes the use to which the vehicles of transportation
are put; not the transportation service rendered by means
of them.7 Cars and locomotives, like tracks and terminals, are the instrumentalities. To make these instru'Sub-paragraph (c): "to require such joint or common use of terminals, including main-line track or tracks for a reasonable distance
outside of such terminals, as in its opinion.will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest
"
Sub-paragraph (b): "to make such just and reasonable directions
with respect to car service without regard to the ownership as between carriers of locomotives, cars, and other vehicles, during such
emergency as in its opinion will best promote the service in the
interest of the public and the commerce of the people, upon such
terms of compensation as between the carriers as they may agree
upon, or, in the event of their disagreement, as the Commivsion may
after subsequent hearing find to be just and reasonable."
'Paragraph 10: "The term 'car service '.
in this Act shall include
the use, control, supply, movement, distribution, exchange, interchange, and return of locomotives, cars, and other vehicles used in
the transportation of property, including special types of equipmerit,
and the supply of trains, by any carrier by railroad subject to this
Act."
'The purpose of the amendment is clearly stated in the report of
the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, submitting H. R. 10,453, enacted as Transportation Act 1920: "Section
402 amends the Car Service Act of May 29, 1917, in several particulars. Originally the term 'car service' included 'the movement,

mentalities available in emergencies to a carrier other than
the owner was the sole purpose of sub-paragraphs a, b,
and c. It is to this end only, that provision is made by
paragraph 10 for the "movement, distribution, exchange,
interchange, and return of locomotives, cars, and other
vehicles used in the transportation of property." This is
substantially the same expression as was Used in the Esch
Car Service Act. The 1920 Act merely adds locomotives
and other vehicles.
Transportation Act 1920 evinces, in many provisions,
the intention of Congress to place upon the Commission
the administrative duty of preventing interruptions in
traffic. But there is no general grant of emergency power
distribution, exchange, interchange, and return of cars used in the
transportation of property.' As amended the term is made to include the use, control, supply, movement, distribution, etc., not only
of cars, but of locomotives and other vehicles. It is further extended
to include, 'the supply, movement, and operation of trains by any
carrier by railroad subject to this act', and so require every carrier
by railroad 'to furnish safe and adequate car service."' House Report 456, 66th Cong., 1st sess, p. 17. In discussing the bill before
the House, on November 11, 1919, Chairman Esch said: "We also
give the Commission greater power in cases of emergency. You
know we have had an emergent condition throughout the country
many times in recent years. We want the Commission to have the
power to act promptly on the spur of the moment in case of emergency in order to prevent congestion at terminals; in order to route
traffic around a congested terminal so that it may reach its destination at the'earliest possible date; in order to ship goods over the
most direct route regardless of instructions contained in the bills of
lading. We want all this power to be exercised by the Commission
in an emergency. The bill gives such powers to the Commission."
58 Cong. Rec. 8315-8316. See also 58 Cong. Rec. 8529M8531; 59 Cong.
Rec. 3263. The reports of the 6ommittees of the House and of the
Senate on the Esch Car Service Act, and the further explanation of
that bill by the chairmen in charge of it, confirm the conclusion that
the term " car service" is used in this limited sense. See House
Report 1553, 64th Cong., 2nd sess., pp. 2, 6-9; House Report 18,
65th Cong., 1st sess., pp. 5-8; Senate Report 43, 65th Cong., 1st sess.,

Opinion of the Court.

to that end; and the detail in which the subjects of such
power have been specified precludes its extension to other
subjects by implication. Moreover, switching service
differs in character from those as to which such power is
expressly granted. These involve either the use by one
carrier of property of another or the direction of the manner and the meahs by which the service of transportation
shall be performed. The switching order here in question
compels performance of the primary duty to receive and
transport cars of a connecting carrier. That courts may
enforce such duties by a mandatory injunction, including
a preliminary restraining order, has long been recognized,
It may be that Congress refrained, for this reason, from
conferring emergency power of this character upon the
Commission.
The United States contends, also, that the decree dismissing the bill should be affirmed, because under the
Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219-220, the
proper venue was the District of Iowa, that being the
residence of the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad. Compare Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. State Public Utilities
Commission, 245 U. S. 493, 504, 505; Skinner & Eddy
Corporation v. United States, 249 U. S. 557, 563. The
provision that suit shall be brought in the district of the
residence of the party on whose petition the order was
made is obviously one inserted for his benefit.'

the defect, even if not urged below by the appellee.
Mattingly v. Northwestern Virginia R. R. Co., 158 U. S.

of the court for the particular district. The objection is
to the venue. See Camp v. Gress, 250 U. S. 308, 311.
This privilege not to be sued elsewhere can be waived;
and it was waived both by the Minneapolis & St. Louis
Railroad and the Commission. The United States was,
nevertheless, entitled to insist upon compliance with the
venue provision; and its objection was properly taken
below. But by failure to enter a cross appeal from the
court's action in overruling its objection, the right to insist upon it here was lost. The appellees can be heard
