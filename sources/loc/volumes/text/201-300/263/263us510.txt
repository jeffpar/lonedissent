HAAVIK v. ALASKA PACKERS ASSOCIATION.
APPEAL ROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA,

No. 128. Argued November 15, 1923.-Decided January 7, 1924.
1. An annual poll tax, and an annual license imposed only on nonresident fishermen within Alaska, are within the power delegated
to the Alaska legislature by the Organic Act. P. 514.
2. These taxes, as applied to a citizen of California who went to
Alaska to engage in the business of fishing and remained there, so
engaged, for four months, are not in conflict with the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment. Id.
3. Nor does the license tax, confined to non-residents, violate the
"privileges and immunities" provision (Const., Art. IV, § 2,) ; nor
was it arbitrary or unreasonable to favor local residents by exempting them from it. P. 515.
Affirmed.

APPEAL from a decree of the District Court, dismissing
a libel brought by the appellant to.recover the sum of ten
dollars, claimed to be due him from the appellee, as part
of his wages as a fisherman. The appellee had paid that
sum to discharge the taxes laid on the appellant in Alaska,
the constitutionality of which the appellant disputed.

No part of th United States can levy a tax on
interstate-and foreign commerce. Kelley v. Rhoads, 188

special burden on a citizen and resident of another part,
not imposed on its own people? Ward v. Maryland,
12 Wall. 418. Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519, distinguished. Alaska permits anyone to take salmon for
any purpose, but discriminates between residents and
non-residents in a matter in which interstate and foreign commerce alone is involved.
The deduction of this tax from appellant's wages in
San Francisco, was unlawful. Appellee is a California
corporation. It could not at any time be present in
Alaska. The contract of hiring was made in California.
It was an entire contract and was only fully performed
when those who signed it returned to this State. The
earnings were payable only in San Francisco, except
$10.00 payable after leaving Alaska.
A State cannot tax or affect a contract payable in anothef Territory. State Tax on Foreign-Held Bonds, 15

The law taxing non-resident fishermen violated § 9
of the Organic Act of Alaska, providing: "nor shall the
lands or other property of non-residents be taxed higher
than the land or other property of residents." Appellant
had property in the right to go to Alaska and fish.

sage of special laws "for the assessment and collection
of taxes for Territorial, county, township, or road
purposes."
If the fisherman is not "employed ", but works. for
himself, he does not pay the license tax, whether a
resident or non-resident. The tax is special taxation.
If the District of Columbia should undertake to collect a poll tax from an attorney who went to Washington
to argue a case before this Court, would not this Court
hold the attempt void?
Art. IV of the Constitution declares: "The citizens
of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States." Stoutenburgh v. Hennick, 129 U. S. 141; Hanley v.. Kansas City
Southern Ry. Co., 187 U. S. 617; and the organic law
of Alaska: "See. 3. That the Constitution of the
United States . . . shall have the same force and effect
within said Territory as elsewhere in the United States,
"While the word State is often used in contradistinction to Territory yet in its general public sense, and
as sometimes used in the statutes and the proceedings
of the government, it has the larger meaning of any
separate political community, including therein 'the District of Columbia and the Territories, as well as those
political communities known as States of the Union.
Such .a use of the word State has been recognized in the
decisions of this court." Talbott v. Silver Bow County,
139 U. S. 438-444.
The resident owner of a fishing boat can use it without
this tax. The pr6perty right of the non-resident owner
is thus discriminated against, contrary to § 9 of the
Organic Act.

Opinion of the Court.

MR.

JUSTICE

McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Appellant challenges the validity of the Act of the
Alaska Legislature approved May 1, 1919 (c. 29, Session
Laws 1919), which imposes upon each male person, with
certain exceptions, within the territory or the waters thereof an annual poll tax of five dollars to be used for school
purposes; and also that portion of the Act of the same
Legislature approved May 5, 1921 (c. 31, Session Laws
1921), which imposes an annual license tax of five dollars
upon every non-resident fisherman-the term "to include
all persons employed on a boat engaged in fishing."
Congress established an organized government for
Alaska by the Act of August 24, 1912, c. 387, 37 Stat. 512.
It declares fhat "the Constitution of the United States,
and all the laws thereof which are not locally inapplicable,
shall have the same force and effect within the said Territory as elsewhere in the United States." It also created a
Legislature with power and authority, which "shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent
with the Constitution and laws of the United States," subject to specified restrictions. One of them is this--" nor
shall the lands or other property of nonresidents be taxed
higher than the lands or other property of residents."
, While residing in California appellant was employed by
appellee corporation, owner and operator, to serve as spaman and fisherman upon the sailing vessel, "Star of Finland." He sailed upon her to Alaska and served with her
there while she engaged in fishing, from the middle of
May, 1921, until the middle of September. In compliance
with the above-mentioned statutes, appellee paid the
taxes which they imposed upon him and, on final settlement, charged the same against his wages. By this proceeding he seeks to recover the amount so deducted.
Without opinion the court below sustained the validity
of the taxes. Both statutes have been considered and

Plainly, we think, the Territorial Legislature had authority under the terms of the Organic Act to impose both
the head and the license tax unless, for want of power,
Congress itself could not have laid them by. direct action.

United States, 194 U. S. 486, 491; Alaska Pacific Fisheries
v. United States, 248 U. S. 78, 87; Territory of Alaska v.
Troy, 258 U. S. 101.
Appellant went to the Territory for the purpose of engaging in the business of fishing and remained there for
at least four months. He was not merely passing through
-not a mere sightseer or tourist-but for a considerable
period while so employed enjoyed the protection and was
within the jurisdiction of the local government. To require him to contribute something toward its support did
not deprive him of property without due process of law
within the Fifth Amendment. Such cases as Dewey v.
Des Moines, 173 U. S. 193, and Union RefrigeratorTransit
Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S.194, 202, relied upon to.support the contrary view, are not controlling.
The tax was upon an individual actually within the Territory; there was no attempt to reach something in a, mere
state of transit or beyond the borders. Some general
rules touching the taxation of property were pointed out
in Brown v. Houston, 114 U. S.622, 632, 633, and Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S.18. No
more stringent ones should be applied when poll taxes are
questioned. Unless restrained by constitutional provision, the sovereign has power to tax all persons and
property actually within its jurisdiction and enjoying the
benefit and protection of its-laws. Cooley on Taxation,3d ed., p. 22.

UNITED STATES v. ILLINOIS CENT. R. R. 515
Syllabus.

510

We are not here concerned with taxation by a State.
The license tax cannot be said to conflict with § 2, Art. IV,
of the Constitution--" the citizens of each State shall be
entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the
several States." It applies only to nonresident fishermen; citizens of every State are treated alike. Only residents of the Territory are preferred. This is not wholly
arbitrary or unreasonable, and we find nothing in the Constitution which prohibits Congress from favoring those
who have acquired a local residence and upon whose
efforts the future development of the Territory must
largely depend. See Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United
States, supra, and Alaska Fish Co. v. Smith, 255 U. S.
44,47, 48.
