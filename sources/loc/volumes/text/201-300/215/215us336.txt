SCOTT COUNTY MACADAMIZED ROAD COMPANY v.
STATE OF MISSOURI EX REL. HINES, PROSECUTING ATTORNEY OF CAPE GIRARDEAU COUNTY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE

No. 52.

OF MISSOURI.

Argued December 7, 8, 1909.-Decided December 20, 1909.

Following the construction given by the state court, held that where
a charter for a toll-road provided that the privileges granted should
continue fifty years subject to the right of the county to acquire
it after twenty years, all privileges ceased on the expiration of the
fifty years; and the owner of the franchise was not deprived of his
property without due process of law, nor was the obligation of the
contract in its charter impaired, by an injunction, from further
maintaining toll-gates on such road.

207 Missouri, 54, affirmed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Edward S. Robert, with whom Mr. Douglas W. Robert
and Mr. William L. Becktold were on the brief, for plaintiff in
error:
A franchise or charter granted by a State to a quasi-public
corporation is a contract the obligation of which cannot be
impaired. St. Clair Turnpike Co. v. Illinois, 96 U. S. 63;
New Orleans Gas Co. v. Louisiana Light Co., 115 U. S. 650;
New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Rivers, 115 U. S. 674; Pearsall
v. Great Northern R. R. Co., 161 U. S. 663.
The decision of a state court, holding as a matter of construction, that a particular charter or charter provision does
not constitute a contract, is not binding on this court. Mobile & 0. R. R. Co. v. Tennessee, 153 U. S. 486.
Due process of law requires compensation to be made, or
secured, to the owner of private property when it is taken by

Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226; Norwood v. Baker, 172 U. S.
269.
A judgment of a state court, even if it be authorized by
statute, whereby private property is taken for the State or
under its direction for public use without compensation made
or secured to the owner, is wanting in the due process of law
required by the Fourteenth Amendment. Tindal v. Wesley,
167 U. S.222; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 526.
Corporations are persons within the meaning of the constitutional provision forbidding the deprivation of property
without due process, as well as a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Covington Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, 164
U. S.578; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.466; People v. Roberts,
171 U. S.658, 683; Railway Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S.150; United

U. S. 268; Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, 114 U. S.
196; Cooper &c. Co. v. Ferguson, 113 U. S. 727.
If an instrument is subject to two constructions, the rule
that the construction most favorable to the public should be
adopted does not apply, if its application would obviously defeat the legislative intent. A fortiori the rule has no application where the meaning of the grant is clear and free from
ambiguity. Moran v. Miami Co., 2 Black, 722; St. Clair
Turnpike Co. v. Illinois, supra.
Mr. M. A. Dempsey and Mr. T. D. Hines for defendant in
error:
The charter expressly provides that the privileges granted
by the charter shall continue for fifty years. The company
and its franchise to take tolls therefore expired February 24,
1903. Session Laws, 1853, 337, 338.
The roadbed in question was a public highway established
by public authority for public use, and is to be regarded as
a public easement and not as private property. The right to

travel over the road was an easement vested in the public,
and when the charter expired this easement continued, disburdened of tolls, but otherwise unaffected. State v. Hannibal County Road Co., 138 Missouri, 332; Campbell on Highways, No. 8, p. 8; No. 14, p. 11; Benedict v. Gait, 3 Barb. 469;

Bridge v. Lowell, 15 Gray, 106; People v. Newburg, 86 N. Y.
302; Heath v. Barrymore, 50 N. Y. 302.
The words "perpetual succession" mean continuous succession during the life of the charter only. Of themselves
they do not confer perpetuity upon a corporation. The word
"perpetual" qualifies the succession and not the duration
of the corporation. State ex rel. v. Payne, 129 Missouri, 477;
Ralls Co. Case, 138 Missouri, 332.
The claim of fee simple to the roadbed as a defense is untenable.
No constitutional question is involved. The county does
not seek to take any property without compensation or
without process of law, but merely seeks by process of law an
adjudication as to whether or not the right or franchise to
0
take tolls has expired.
Injunction is a proper remedy. This court is without
jurisdiction to determine the appeal. There is no Federal
question in the case. Mills v. County of St. Clair,8 How. 567;

MR.

JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit brought in pursuance of a statute to enjoin
the plaintiff in error from maintaining toll-gates upon a road
alleged to be a public highway. The defendant justifies under a charter granted by a special act of February 24, 1853,
which contained the following section: "8. The privileges
granted in this charter shall continue for fifty years; provided, that the county courts of the counties of Cape Girardeau and Scott may, at the expiration of twenty years, or
any time thereafter purchase said road at the actual cost of
construction, and make it a free road." Mo. Laws, 1853,
pp. 337, 338. The defendant says that it has not received
the cost of construction, and sets up the Constitution of the
United States, Art. I, ยง 10, the Fourteenth Amendment, and
other less material clauses. The reply is that the right to
take tolls expired on February 24, 1903, when the fifty years
contemplated by the charter had elapsed. There was a trial
and a judgment for the relator, which was affirmed by the
Supreme Court of the State, and the case was brought here.
State ex rel. v. Road Co., 207 Missouri, 54.
The plaintiff in error contends that the privileges referred
to in ยง 8 are but three: the life of the corporation brought
into being by the charter, the exclusive right to maintain a
toll-road granted by ยง 2, and the right to take higher tolls
than those allowed to toll companies organized under a general act then in force; but that it cannot be deprived of its
right to take tolls except by a purchase of the road at the
actual cost of construction. It says that the provision for
the right to purchase at the expiration of twenty years 'or
at any time thereafter' imports that the right to make the
road free, even after fifty years, can be gained only by pur-

chase, and that the clause makes a contract and creates a
right of property which it is beyond the power of the State
to impair or take away. The Supreme Court of Missouri
took a different view. It held after an elaborate discussion
that the plaintiff in error never had more than an easement,
that this easement was of a public character charged only
with the burden of paying toll during the time allowed by
the charter, and that after that time the public had an unencumbered right. The sole question here is whether the
construction of the charter and the supposed contract was
wrong.
We are of opinion that the decision of the state court was
right, and that the meaning of ยง 8 is so plain that it cannot be
made much clearer by argument. "The privileges granted
in this charter" means all the privileges, including the privilege of taking toll. The limitation of fifty years would be
almost meaningless if tolls were not embraced. The plaintiff
in error recognizes the difficulty, and tries to meet it by the
suggestion that as applied to tolls the word 'privileges' is to
be limited to the excess of the tolls allowed above those mentioned in a general act then in force. But the general act is
not referred to in the section granting the right to charge
tolls, or, indeed, in the charter at all; it was a law with which
the specially chartered corporation had nothing to do. There
is not the slightest reason to suppose that there was any implied reference to or thought of it when this act was passed.
The words of purchase, 'at the expiration of twenty years,
or any time thereafter,'%do not convey the meaning that the
express limitation of fifty years is done away with in the same
section that imposes it, but must be read subject to that
more specific phrase, even if 'any time thereafter' practically
is cut down to any time within the fifty years, so far as its
value to the plaintiff in error is concerned. It was a reservation in favor of the county, not the grant of a new right to
the plaintiff in error, and its operation is sufficient if as extensive as the need.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

As we are of opinion that the plaintiff in error has no such
rights as it claims, even if we assume that it has all the rights
of the original corporation created by the charter, it is unnecessary to consider other difficulties in the case.
Judgment affirmed.

ESTHERVILLE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IOWA.
No. 64.

Argued December 10, 1909.-Decided January 3, 1910.

Where the validity of the local statute under which national bank
shares are assessed was not drawn in question, but the only objection in the state court was that the assessment was in excess'
of actual value, exorbitant, unjust and not in proportion with other
like property, no Federal right was set up or denied and this court
has no jurisdiction to review the judgment under ยง 709, Rev. Stat.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Charles A. Clark for plaintiff in error:
The statutes of Iowa, ยงยง 1305-1322 of the Code, provide
a scheme of taxation of banks by which the franchises, good
will, good business management, dividend earning power,
and United States bonds held as required by law are all included by force of the very statutes themselves, while all of
these elements are excluded by force of the same statutes,
as to moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens
and invested in the very moneyed institutions which come
in competition with national banks.
This discrimination against national banks is clearly not
warranted but forbidden by ยง 5219, Rev. Stat., and renders
