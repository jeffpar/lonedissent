OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Argument for the United States.

remanded to the District Court of the United States for the
District of Massachusetts for further proceedings in conformity
with this opinion.
Reversed.
UNITED STATES v. STEVENSON (NO. 2).
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.

No. 293.

Argued October 14, 15, 1909.-Decided November 29, 1909.

Where Congress has made an act a crime and indictable it follows that
if two or more conspire to commit the act they conspire to commit an
offense against the United States within the meaning of § 5440, Rev.
Stat.; and so held in regard to conspiring to assist immigration of
contract laborers in violation of § 4 of the Immigration Act of
February 20, 1907, c. 1134, 34 Stat. 898.
It is within the power of Congress to regulate the punishment of crimes
and it may make the punishment for conspiring to commit a crime

greater than that for committing the crime itself.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.

The Solicitor General for the United States:
Even if indictment will not lie for a violation of § 4 of the

Immigration Act of 1907, Congress has made that offense an
express misdemeanor; and such statutory classification of the
crime brings a conspiracy to commit it unmistakably within
§ 5440, Rev. Stat. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 99;
United States v. Van Schaick, 134 Fed. Rep. 592; Cohen v.
United States, 157 Fed. Rep. 651; United States v. Tsokas, 163
Fed. Rep. 129.
It is enough in any case to make an "offense against the
United States" within the meaning of § 5440, Rev. Stat., that
the offense which the conspiracy contemplates is a crime, in
the fundamental sense of a prohibited public wrong, visited
with personal punishment. Neither the mode of prosecution
nor the severity of the punishment for the offense is material.

215 U. S.

Argument for Defend'ant in Error.

Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, 19; Lees v. United States, 150
U. S. 476; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616; United States
v. Britton, 108 U. S. 199, distinguished.
As to the form of proceeding by which a violation of § 4 is
to be prosecuted, it is enough to say that § 5440 looks solely
to the nature of the act which the conspiracy contemplates,
and not' to the nature of the remedy given for that act. It is
enough that the object of the conspiracy is an act criminal in
its own quality. United States v. Chouteau, 102 U. S. 603.
The operation of § 5440 does not depend upon the amount
or extent of punishment imposed for the "offense against the
United States." Death, imprisonment, fine, forfeiture-each
suffices, if the wrongful act is public in nature and therefore a
crime. Clune v. United States, 159 U. S. 590.
For cases of conspiracy under § 5440 to commit offenses under the statutes regulating railroads, where only a money
penalty attached to the offense, see Thomas v. United States,
156 Fed. Rep. 897; United States v. Clark, 164 Fed. Rep. 75;
Evans v. United States, 153 U. S. 584, 587; Coffin v. United
States, 156 U. S. 432, 448.
Assisting or encouraging the importation or migration of
alien contract laborers is naturally and usually a course of
action rather than a single act, and is therefore closely analogous to engaging in a business or occupation, which may be
averred generally without details.
In an indictment for aiding and abetting a crime it is
enough to say that the defendants aided and abetted, without
particularizing the acts of aiding or abetting. Cases supra
and United States v. Simmons, 96 U. S. 360, 363; United States
v. Mills, 7 Pet. 138, 141.
Mr. Herbert Parker, Mr. Charles C. Milton and Mr. Henry
H. Fuller, for defendant in error, submitted:
The demurrer to the second count was properly sustained.
Section 4 of the Immigration Act of 1907 will not support an
indictment for conspiracy under § 5440, Rev. Stat.

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

215 U. S.

An offense against the United States which may be the basis
for an indictment for conspiracy under § 5440 must be such an
offense as will itself support an indictment. United States v.
Britton, 108 U. S. 199; United States v. Watson, 17 Fed. Rep.
145, 148; United States v. Payne, 22 Fed. Rep. 426, 427.
Although § 4 has attempted to define a crime, there has
been provided no punishment for such offense within the language of the act itself, other than the penalty recoverable by a
judgment in a civil suit. As to the effect of this, see, and also
distinguish, United States v. Tsokas, 163 Fed. Rep. 129, 131;
United States v. Van Schaick, 134 Fed. Rep. 602; United States
v. Kellam, 7 Fed. Rep. 843. The determination of the case of
United States v. Stevenson, No. 292, simultaneously argued,
must determine this case also, and, if it shall be held that § 4 of
the Immigration Act of 1907 sets forth no offense for which an
indictment will lie, then the demurrer to the second count must
be sustained.
MR.JUSTICE DAY

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case was argued and submitted with No. 292, just decided. The indictment herein in its second count charges a
conspiracy, under § 5440 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States, to commit the offense of assisting alien contract laborers to migrate into the United States, in violation of the
statutes of the United States. Inasmuch as the court below
had already reached the conclusion, in considering the former
case (No. 292, ante), that assisting alien contract laborers was
not punishable as a crime by indictment under the Immigration Act, it held that it followed that to conspire to assist such
migration was not an offense against the United States within
the meaning of § 5440 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States. That section provides:
"If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United
States in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of

Syllabus.

such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy,
all the parties to such conspiracy shall be liable to a penalty of
not less than one thousand dollars and not more than ten thousand dollars, and to imprisonment not more than two years."
Inasmuch as we have already held that Congress, in making
the assistance of contract laborers into the United States a
misdemeanor, has made the same a crime indictable as such
under the Immigration Act of 1907, it must necessarily follow
that if two or more persons, as is charged in the indictment
under consideration, conspire to assist such importation, they
do conspire to commit an offense against the United States
within the terms of § 5440 of the Revised Statutes of the
United States. In this view, applying the principles laid down
in the opinion in case No. 292, ante, we think that the court below erred in sustaining the demurrer to the second count of the
indictment. Nor does it make any difference that Congress
has seen fit to affix a greater punishment to the conspiracy to
commit the offense than is denounced against the offense itself; that is a matter to be determined by the legislative body
having power to regulate the matter. Clune v. United States,
159 U. S.590.
Judgment reversed.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 1.

Argued October 22, 1909.-Decided November 29, 1909.

Where the fundamental fact in issue in a suit by a wife for separate
maintenance is whether there was a marriage, and the court having
jurisdiction finds that the wife's petition should not be granted but
should be dismissed, the courts of another State must, under the full
faith and credit clause of the Constitution, regard such decree as determining that there was no marriage even though the husband may
have asserted other defenses; nor can the wife, in a suit depending
solely on the issue of whether there was a marriage, prove by oral
