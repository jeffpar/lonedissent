UNITED STATES v. MESCALL.
ERROR TQ TNE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 278.

Argued October 14, 1909.-Decided November 8, 1909.

The rule of ejusdem generis, that where the particular words of descrip-

tion are followed by general terms the latter will be regarded as referring to things of a like class with those particularly described, is
only a rule of construction to aid in arriving at the real legislative

intent and does not override all other rules. When the particular
words exhaust the genus the general words must refer to words outside of those particularized.

Under § 9 of the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, c. 407,
26 Stat: 131, 135, providing punishment for making and aiding in
false entries, the words "owner, importer, consignee, agent or other
person" include a weigher representing the Government, and his

acts come within the letter and purpose of the statute.
SECTION 9, chapter 407, Laws of June 10, 1890, 26 Stat.
130-135, known as the Customs Administrative Act, under
which defendant was indicted, reads as follows:
"That if any owner, importer, consignee, agent, or other
person shall make or attempt to make any entry of imported
merchandise by means of any fraudulent or false invoice,
affidavit, letter, paper, or by means of any false statement,
written or verbal, or by means of any false or fraudulent
practice or appliance whatsoever, or shall be guilty of any
wilful act or omission by means whereof the United States
shall be deprived of the lawful duties, or any portion thereof,
accruing upon the merchan'dise, or any portion thereof, embraced or referred to in such invoice, affidavit, letter, paper,
or statement, or affected by such act or omission, such merchandise, or the value thereof, to be recovered from the person making the entry, shall be forfeited, which forfeiture

shall only apply to the whole of the merchandise or the value
thereof in the case or package containing.the particular article or articles of merchandise to which Auch fraud or false
paper or statement relates; and such person. shall, upon conviction, be fined for each offense a sum not exceeding five
thousand dollars, or be imprisoned for a time not exceeding
two years, or both, in the discretion of the court."
The indictment in the first count alleges that the steamship Alice arrived at the port of New York on November 2,
1907, from Greece, having on board eighty cases of cheese,
consigned to one Stamatopoulos; that the said cheese was unloaded and an invoice and entry thereof filed with the collector
of customs of the port of New York by the said Stamatopoulos; that the defendant was at the time an assistant
weigher of the United States in the customs service at the
port of New York and engaged in the performance of his duties as such assistant weigher; that it was his duty to weigh
accurately the said cheese and make return thereof to the
collector of customs, and upon the weight so returned the
said entry was to be liquidated; that the said defendant "did
knowingly, wilfully and unlawfully make and attempt to
make an entry of imported merchandise, to wit, the said
eighty cases of cheese, by means of a false and fraudulent
practice, by means whereof the United States was to be deprived of the lawful duties or a portion thereof accruing upon
the said merchandise;" that he did knowingly, wilfully and
unlawfully return the net weight of said cheese as 13,358
pounds, .whereas the true weight thereof and the weight upon
which the entry should have been liquidated and the duties
paid was 17,577 pounds. The second and third counts contain the same statement of facts, but it is averred in the one
that the defendant was "guilty of a wilful act and omission,
by means whereof the United States was to be deprived of
the lawful duties," or a portion thereof, and in the other that
he unlawfully made and attempted to make the entry "by
means of a false written statement." To this indictment a

demurrer was filed and .sustained, the court, after discussing
several matters, saying:
"But it is apparent from the allegations of the indictment
that the defendant is not in fact any of the persons within the
contemplation of section 9 with relation to these particular
importations, and cannot be considered either an owner, importer, consignee, agent or other person.
"The defendant Mescall was not making 6r attempting to
make an entry of these goods. According to the charge he
was, contrary to his duty, rendering assistance to the importer,
who was the 'person' making the entry."
The case is here under the act of March 2, 1907, 34 Stat.
1246, which authorizes a writ of error "direct to the Supreme Court of the United States" in a criminal case wherein
there has been a decision or judgment sustaining a demurrer
to an indictment, when such decision or judgment is based
upon the invalidity or construction of a statute upon which
the indictment is founded.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Fowler for the United States:
An entry of goods within the meaning of §9 of the act of
July 24, 1897, embraces the entire transaction from the time
the vessel enters port until the importer obtains an entrance
of the goods into the body of merchandise in the United
States; United States v. Baker, 24 Fed. Cas. 953; United States
v. Cargo of Sugar, 25 Fed. Cas. 288; United States v. Legge,
105 Fed. Rep. 930; and every person performing any material act in accomplishing that purpose and violating the
statute in any particular is liable to prosecution therefor.
One who is not an importer is not excluded from prosecution because under the rule of ejusdem generis the words
"other person" exclude those not of the class of importer.

Mr. George F. Hickey for defendant in error:
Section 9 of the Customs Administrative Act is a penal
statute and should be construed strictly. United States v.
Seventy-five Bales of Tobacco, 147 Fed. Rep. 127; Andrews v.
United States, 2 Story, 202; United States v. Wiltberger, 5
Wheat. 76; United States v. Eighty-four Boxes of Sugar, 7
Pot. 453; Sutherland on Stat. Const., § 353.
In expounding a penal statute the court will not extend it
beyond the plain meaning of its words. United States v.
Morris, 14 Pet. 464.
Such a statute should be construed according to the manifest import of the words.
If the statute is ambiguous, the construction adopted
should be that most favorable to the accused. The Schooner
Enterprise,1 Paine, 32.
Under § 9 indictments may not be brought against others
than owners, importers, consignees, agents or other persons
of the same class.
The entry contemplated undoubtedly is the entry originally made by the importer, or some one on his behalf, as
required by the rules and regulations of the customs service.
This was the entry alluded to in the act of June 22, 1874, § 21,
18 Stat. 190, and it was the entry provided for, regulated and
defined by §§ 2785-2790, Rev. Stat. United States v. Seidenberg, 17 Fed. Rep. 227.

No one but the importer or some one representing him,
has a right tb enter goods at the custom house. Harris v.
Dennie, 3 Pet. 292; United States v. One Silk Rug, 158 Fed.
Rep. 974; United States v. Ninety-nine Diamonds, 132 Fed.
Rep. 579; 139 Fed. Rep. 961.
It seems to us that the principal dispute that can arise in
the case at bar is as to the meaning of the words "or other
person."
The decision in the case that the words "or other person" mean some one of the same general class asthose described by the preceding words, seems to be correct. It is
certainly supported by the great weight of authorities.
United States v. 1,150 Pounds of Celluloid, 82 Fed. Rep.
627.
The words "or other person" cannot be construed to mean
"or other person whosoever."
For cases in support of this rule of construction, known as
Lord Tenderden's Rule, see 21 American & Eng. Ency. of
Law, title "Other," 1012; In re Davidson, 4 Fed. Rep. 509;
CrystalSpring D. Co. v. Cox, 49 Fed. Rep. 555; Newport News
Co. v. United States, 61 Fed. Rep. 488; Crowther v. Fidelity
Ins. Co., 85 Fed. Rep. 41; Alabama v. Montague, 117 U. S.
602; State v. McGarry,21 Wisconsin, 502. Sedgwick on Const.
of Stat. 361, states the rule as follows:
"Where general words follow particular words, the rule is
to construe the former as applicable to the persons or things
particularly mentioned."
The rule that general words will be restrained to things of
the same kind with those particularized, has been applied in
numerous cases. East Oakland v. Skinner, 94 U. S. 255;
White v. Ivey, 34 Georgia, 186; McIntyre v. Ingraham, 35
Mississippi, 25; Bucher v. Commonwealth, 103 Pa. St. 528;

UNITED STATES v. MESCALL.
Opinion of the Court.

215 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE BREWER,

after making the foregoing state-

ment, delivered the opinion of the court.
It appears that the trial court sustained the demurrer on
the ground that, as to the offense charged, the statute, properly construed, does not inclhide the defendant. The case
is, therefore, one which may be brought to this court. United
States v. Keitel, 211 U. S. 370. But our inquiry is limited to
the particular question decided by the court below. Id. 398.
Counsel for defendant invokes what is sometimes known
as Lord Tenderden's Rule, that where particular -words of
description are followed by general terms the latter will be
regarded as referring to things of a like class with those particularly described-ejusdem generis. The particular words
of description, it is urged, are "owner, importer, consignee,
agent." The general term is "other person," and should be
read as referring to some one similar to those named, whereas
the defendant was not owner, importer, consignee, or agent
or of like class with either. He was not making or attempting to make an entry. He represented the Government, and,
contrary to his duties, was rendering assistance to the consignee who was making the entry. But, as said in National
Bank of Commerce v. Ripley, 161 Missouri, 126, 132, in reference to the rule:
"But this is only a rule of construction to aid us in arriving at the real legislative intent. It is not a cast-iron rule,
it does not override all other rules of construction, and it
is never applied to defeat the real purpose of the statute,
as that purpose may be gathered from the whole instrument. .

.

. Whilst it is aimed to preserve a meaning for the

particular words, it is not intended to render meaningless
the general words. Therefore, where the particular words
exhaust the class, the general words must be construed as
embracing something outside of that class. If the particular
words exhaust the genus there is nothing ejusdem generis left,
and in such case we must give the general words a meaning

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

215 U. S.

outside of the class indicated by the particular words or we
must say that they are meaningless, and thereby sacrifice
the general to preserve the particular words. In that case
the rule would defeat its own purpose."
I See also Gillcock v. The People, 171 Illinois, 307, and the
cases cited in the opinion; Winters v. Duluth, 82 Minnesota,
127; Matthews v. Kimball, 70 Arkansas, 451, 462. Now the
party who makes an entry, using the term "entry" in its
narrower sense, is the owner, importer, consignee or agent,
and it must be used in that sense to give any force to the
argument of counsel for defendant, but used in that sense the
term "other person" becomes surplusage. In § 1 of chap. 76,
Laws of 1863, 12 Stat. 738, is found a provision of like character to that in the first part of the section under which this
indictment was found, but the language of the description
there is "owner, consignee or agent." This was changed by
§ 12, chap. 391, Laws 1874, 18 Stat. 188, to read "owner, importer, consignee, agent, or other person," and that description. has been continued in subsequent legislation. Evidently
the addition in 1874 of the phrase "other person" was intended
to include persons having a different relation to the importation than the owner, importer, consignee or agent. Congress
was broadening the scope of the legislation and meaning to
reach other persons having something to do in respect to the
entry beyond that which was done by the owner, importer,
consignee or agent, or else the term "other person" was a
meaningless addition. Now the defendant was a person,
other than the owner, importer, consignee or agent, by whose
act the United States was deprived of a portion of its lawful
duties. His act comes within the letter of the statute as well
as within its purpose, and the intent of Congress in the legislation is the ultimate matter to be determined.
The fact that he could not be punished in all respects as
fully as the owner, in that he had no goods to be forfeited, is
immaterial. United States v. Union Supply Company, decided this day, post, p. 50.

WATERMAN v. CANAL-LOUISIANA BANK CO. :33
215 U. S.

Syllabus.

We are of opinion, therefore, that the trial court erred in
sustaining the demurrer. The judgment is reversed and the
case remanded for further proceedings.

WATERMAN v. THE CANAL-LOUISIANA BANK AND
TRUST COMPANY, EXECUTOR.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

No. 306. Submitted February 25, 1909.-Decided November 8, 1909.

The equity jurisdiction of the Federal courts is derived from the
Federal Constitution and statutes and is like unto that of the High

Court of Chancery in England at the time of the adoption of the
Judiciary Act of 1789; it is not subject to limitations or restraints by
state legislation giving jurisdiction to state courts over similar matters.
While Federal courts cannot seize and control property which is in the
possession of the state courts and have no jurisdiction of a purely
probate character, they can, as courts of chancery, exercise jurisdiction, where proper diversity of citizenship exists, in favor of creditors,

legatees, and heirs, to establish their claims and have a proper execution of the trust as to them.
Although complainant in this case asks in some of her prayers for relief

which is beyond the jurisdiction of the court as being of a purely
probate character if the allegations of the bill support them the court

may grant other prayers for relief which are within its jurisdiction,
and, as a court of equity, shape its decree according to the equity of
the case.
Where the bill does not seek to set aside the probate of a will or interfere with the possession of the probate court, the Federal court of
equity, in a case where diverse citizenship exists, may determine as
between the parties before the court their interests in the estate and
such decree will be binding upon, and may be enforced against, the
executor.
It will be assumed that the state probate court will respect the decree
