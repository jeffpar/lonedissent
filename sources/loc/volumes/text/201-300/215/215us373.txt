HENLEY v. MYERS, RECEIVER OF CONSOLIDATED
BARB WIRE COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT

No. 72.

OF THE STATE

OF KANSAS.

Submitted December 10, 1909.-Decided January 3, 1910.

The State creating a corporation may determine how transfers of its
stock shall be made and evidenced, and a change in the law imposing
no restraint upon the transfer, but only affecting the method of
procedure, does not impair the obligation of the charter contract
within the meaning of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution; and so held that the corporation law of Kansas of 1899 is not
void as to stockholders who purchased stock prior thereto and sold
it thereafter, because it required a statement of the transfer of stock
to be filed in the office of the Secretary of State in order to relieve
the transferor of stockholder's liability, the act not depriving him
of any defense that might be made at the time the stock was
acquired.
Methods of procedure in actions on contract that do not affect substantial rights of parties are within the control of the State, and
the obligation of a stockholder's contract is not impaired within
the meaning of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution by
substituting for individual actions for statutory liability a suit in
equity by the receiver of the insolvent corporation; and so held
as to the corporation law of Kansas of 1899 amending prior laws to
that effect.
In becoming a stockholder of a corporation one does not acquire as
against the State a vested right in any particular mode of procedure
for enforcement of liability, but it is assumed that parties make their
cohtracts with reference to the existence of the power in the State
to regulate such procedure.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.

So much of § 12, ch. 10, Laws of Kansas, 1898, as provides
that no transfer of stock in a corporation shall be legal and
binding until a statement of the change of ownership thereof,
made by the president and secretary of such corporation, is
filed with the Secretary of State, is retroactive, impairs the
obligation of the contracts of those who owned stock at the
time of its enactment, and is therefore unconstitutional and
void.

The law of Kansas enacted January 11, 1899, repealing
§ 32, ch. 23, General Statutes of Kansas of 1868, and §§ 44
and 46 of ch. 23, General Statutes of Kansas of 1868, and
enacting §§ 14 and 15 of ch. 10, Laws of 1898, is unconstitutional and void as it impairs the obligations of the contracts
of both the creditor and stockholder.
Section 15, ch. 10, Laws of 1898, is unconstitutional and
void as it impairs the obligation of the contract of the stockholder by making his additional liability an asset of the
corporation and diverting the funds so collected to sources
which were not contemplated by § 2, Art. XII, of the constitution of the State.

The constitutionality of the law of 1899 has been directly
before this court in the case of Evans v. Nellis, 187 U. S. 271.
This court, however, did not pass upon the questions here
involved, for the reason that it decided that there was no
authority conferred by the act of 1899 of Kansas from which
the right of the receiver to bring the suit then before the
court could be deduced.
The Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern
District of New York, in Evans v. Nellis, 101 Fed. Rep. 920,
in an exhaustive opinion, held that the law of 1899 referred
to was absolutely unconstitutional, for the reason that it impaired not only the contract of the creditor, but also that of
the stockholder. We ask this court to carefully examine
this decision and t he reasons of the court in arriving at the
conclusion set forth in said case.
Mr. E. E. Myers and Mr. R. E. Melvin for defendant in
error:
There is no question of impairment of contract. Defendants were still stockholders when the act of 1898 was passed,
and the Kansas constitution also gave the right to amend or
repeal corporation laws. Art. XII, § 1, Const. Kansas.
Defendants having entered into a contract by the very
terms of which they agreed that the legislature might amend
the law relating to their liability and the method of collecting
same cannot now, that the legislature did exactly what they
contracted it might do, be heard to complain. Sioux City Ry.

court in Evans v. Nellis, 187 U. S. 271. This court held in
effect that the law in force at the time the judgment was
obtained fixed the rights and obligations of the parties and
that because the judgment sued on in that action was obtained prior to the passage and taking effect of the 1898 law
the receiver had no standing in court to maintain the action; that the action must be brought under the law in
force at the time the judgment was obtained. So that 101
Fed. Rep. 920 is virtually wholly obiter dictum so far as any
discussion of the constitutionality of the act of 1898 is concerned.

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN

215 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the court.

The Federal question to be disposed of on this writ of error
arises under the contract clause of the Constitution. The
facts upon which its decision depends are not in dispute and
may be thus summarized:
On the third day of August, 1887, the plaintiffs in error
became respectively subscribers to and owners of capital
stock in the Consolidated Barb Wire Company, a Kansas
corporation, engaged in the business of manufacturing wire.
But on January 15, 1899, they sold and transferred their
stock, worth par, in good faith, to responsible parties and
thereafter had no interest in the company. The fact of such
transfer was made to appear on the books of the company.
On the same date the company sold all its property and the
good will of its business, the proceeds of the sale being distributed among the defendants as stockholders in the proportion of the stock held by each. And on the day last named
the company suspended and did not thereafter resume business.
In 1900 W. H. Stevenson obtained a judgment against the
company upon which execution was issued and returned
"no property found." In 1903 two other judgments-each
of which, it is admitted, being based upon a cause of action
'sounding in tort-were recovered against the company, one
by Briggs, administrator, and one by Maxwell. No execution was issued on either of those judgments.
In 1903 Myers, the defendant in error, was appointed receiver of the Wire Company. As such receiver, and by
authority of existing statutes, he brought an action in one
of the Kansas courts against the present plaintiffs in error
as stockholders to recover the amount of the above judgments.
Upon final hearing the trial court gave judgments against
the defendants, respectively, in certain amounts, to be paid
by them in proportion to the stock owned by each. The case
was carried to the Supreme Court of Kansas, and the jtudg-

Opinion of the Court.

ment was affirmed. A rehearing was granted, but the judgment was again affirmed. Henley v. Myers, 76 Kansas, 736.
At the time the defendants became stockholders in the
Wire Company certain constitutional and statutory provisions
relating to corporations were in force in Kansas. Those
referred to by counsel are given, for convenience, in the
margin. 1 From an examination of those provisions it will be
1 "Dues from corporations shall be secured by individual liability
of the stockholders to an additional amount equal to the stock owned
by each stockholder, and such other means as shall be provided by
law; but such individual liabilities shall not apply to railroad corporations, nor corporations for religious or charitable purposes." Const.
Kansas, Art. 12, § 2.
"If any execution shall have been issued against the property or
effects of a corporation, except a railway or a religious or charitable
corporation, and there cannot be found any property whereon to levy
such execution, then execution may be issued against any of the
stockholders, to an extent equal in amount to the amount of stock by
him or her owned, together with any amount unpaid thereon; but no
execution shall issue against any stockholder, except upon an order
of the court in which the action, suit or other proceedings shall have
'been brought or instituted, made upon motion in open court, after
reasonable notice in writing to the person or persons sought to be
charged; and, upon such motion, such court may order execution to
issue accordingly; or the plaintiff in the execution may proceed by
action to charge the stockholders with the amount of his judgment."
Gen. Stat. Kans., 1868, c. 23, § 32, p. 198, Ib., 1889, par. 1192.
"A corporation is dissolved, first, by the expiration of the time
limited in its charter, second, by a judgment of dissolution rendered
by a court of competent jurisdiction; but any such corporation shall
be deemed to be dissolved for the purpose of enabling any creditors
of such corporation to prosecute suits against the stockholders thereof
to enforce their individual liability, if it be shown that such corporation has suspended business for more than one year, or that any corporation now so suspended from business shall for three months after
the passage of this act fail to resume its usual and ordinary business."
Gen. Stat. Kans., 1868, ch. 23, § 40, as amended by laws 1883, ch. 46,
§ 1, March 7; Ib., 1889, par. 1200.
"Itany corporation, created under this or any general statute of
this State, except railway or charitable or religious corporations, be
dissolved leaving debts unpaid, suits may be brought against any

seen that when the defendants became the owners of stock
in the company it was the law of Kansas: 1. That a stockperson or persons who were stockholders at the time of such dissolution, without joining the corporation in such suit; and if judgment
be rendered, and execution satisfied, the defendant or defendants may
sue all who were stockholders at the time of dissolution, for the recovery of the portion of such debt for which they were liable, and the
execution upon the judgment shall direct the collection to be made
from property of each stockholder respectively; and if any number
of stockholders (defendants in the case) shall not have property
enough to satisfy his or their portion of the execution, then the amount
of the deficiency shall be divided equally among all the remaining
stockholders, and collections made accordingly, deducting from the
amount a sum in proportion to the amount of stock owned by the
plaintiff at the time the company dissolved." Gen. Stat. Kans., 1868,
ch. 23, § 44, Oct. 31; Ib., 1889, par. 1204.
"No stockholder shall be liable to pay debts of the corporation,
beyond the amount due on his stock, and an additional amount equal
to the stock owned by him." Gen. Stat. Kans., 1868, c. 23, § 46; lb.,
1889, par. 1206.
By a statute passed in 1898, which took effect January 11th, 1899,
the following section took the place of the above § 32:
"If any execution shall have been issued against the property or
effects of a corporation, except a railway or a religious or charitable
corporation, and there cannot be found any property upon which to
levy such execution, such corporation shall be deemed to be insolvent;
and upon application to the court from which said execution was
issued, or to the judge thereof, a receiver shall be appointed, to close
up the affairs of said corporation. Such receiver shall immediately
institute proceedings against all stockholders to collect unpaid subscriptions to the stock of such corporation, together with the additional liability of such stockholders equal to the par value of the stock
held by each. All collections made by the receiver shall be held for
the benefit of all creditors, and shall be disbursed in such manner and
at such times as the court may direct. Should the collections made
by the receiver exceed the amount necessary to pay all claims against
such corporation, together with all costs and expenses of the receivership, the remainder shall be distributed among the stockholders from
whom collections have been made, as the court may direct; and in the
event any stockholder has not paid the amount due from him, the
stockholders making payment shall be entitled to an assignment of

Opinion of the Court.

holder in any corporation other than one for railroad, religious
or charitable purposes, should be liable for the dues of the
any judgment or judgments obtained by the receiver against such
stockholder, and may enforce the same to the extent of his proportion
of claims paid by them." Gen. Stat. Kans., 1868, ch. 23, § 32, as
amended by L. 1898, ch. 10, § 14; b., Gen. Stat. 1901, par. 1302.
"The stockholders of every corporation, except railroad corporations or corporations for religious or charitable purposes, shall be
liable to the creditors thereof for any unpaid subscriptions, and in
addition thereto for an amount equal to the par value of the stock
owned by them, such liability to be considered an asset of the corporation in the event of insolvency, and to be collected by a receiver for
the benefit of all creditors." Gen. Stat. Kans., 1868, ch. 23, § 46, as
amended in 1898, ch. 10, § 15.
When the defendants acquired their stock the statute that governed the transfer of stock in corporations was as follows:
"The stock of any corporation created under this act shall be
deemed personal estate, and shall be transferable only on the books of
the corporation, in such manner as the by-laws may prescribe; and no
person shall, at any election, be entitled to vote on any stock, unless
the same shall have been standing in the name of the person so claiming to vote, upon the books of the corporation, at least thirty days
prior to such election; but no shares shall be transferred until all
previous assessments thereon shall be fully paid." Gen. Stat. Kans.,
1868, ch. 23, § 27, as amended by Laws 1879, ch. 88, § 1; b., 1889,
par. 1184.
The above statute which was in force on and after January 11th,

1899:
f .

It shall also be the duty of the president and secretary

of any such corporation, as soon as any transfer, sale or change of
ownership of any such stock is made as shown upon the books of the company, to at once file with the Secretary of State a statement of the new
stockholder or stockholders, the number of shares so transferred, and the
par value and the amount paid on such stock. No transfer of such stock
shall be legal or binding until such statement is made as provided for in
this act: provided, however that no transfers of stock shall release the
party so transferring from the liability of the laws of this State as to
stockholders of corporations for profit, for ninety days after such
transfer and the filing and recording thereof in the office of the

Secretary of State."

corporation to the extent of every unpaid subscription, and
for an additional amount equal to the par value of the stock
owned by him. 2. That if an execution against a corporation
was returned "no property found," then execution could go,
on the order of court and after written notice, against any
stockholder, to the extent equal in amount to his stock,
together with the amount, if any, unpaid thereon. 3. That
when a corporation became insolvent a receiver could be
appointed on application to the proper court to close its
affairs; and it was made the duty of such receiver to immediately institute proceedings against all stockholders to collect
unpaid subscriptions, together with the additional liability
of such stockholders equal to the par value of the stock held
by each; all such collections to be for the benefit of creditors.
4. That the stock of the corporation should be transferable
only on the books of the corporation in such manner as the law
prescribed.
By an act passed in 1899, and which went into effect January 11th, 1899, before the defendants sold their stock, the previous statute (Gen. Stat. 1868, c. 23, § 24) was so amended
as to make it the duty of the president and secretary or the
managing officer of each corporation for profit doing business
in the State (other than banking, insurance and railroad corporations) as soon as any transfer, sale or change of ownership
of stock is made, as shown on its books, "to at once file with
the Secretary of State a statement of such change of ownership,
giving the name and address of the new stockholder or stockholders, the number of shares so transferred, and the par
value and the amount paid on such stock." The same statute provided that "no transfer of such stock shall be legal
or binding until such statement is madeas provided." Laws
of Kans. Special Sess. 1898, c. 10, § 12, p. 33. It is not
claimed that the above statement had been made or filed with
the company prior to the sale by the defendants of their
stock, or that it was ever filed, and the result is that the
transfer made by the defendants of their stock (although the

HENLEY v. MYERS.
215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

fact of such transfer may have been shown on the books of
the Wire Company) was not legal or binding, if the statute
was valid.
But the defendants insist that as the statutes of Kansas
did not, at the time they acquired their stock, require as a
condition of its legal or binding transfer that a statement of
such transfer should be filed with the Secretary of State, by
the president, secretary or managing officer of the corporation, the subsequent statute imposing a condition of that
kind impaired the obligation of the contract under which
stockholders acquired their stock in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Court of Kansas rejected this view and they were right.
In what way the transfer of the stock of a corporation shall
be made and evidenced is a matter entirely within the governmental power of the State that creates the corporation,
the State taking care that such power be not so exerted as to
violate any right secured by the Supreme Law of the Land.
It was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution
that the national authorities should supervise the action of a
State upon such a subject, so long as the State did not transgress that instrument but kept within the limits of its reserved
power to enact such reasonable laws or regulations as, in its
judgment, were necessary or conducive to the general good.
We can well understand how the State might have concluded
that the statutory requirement in force when the defendants
acquired their stock, to the effect that transfers of the stock
of corporations created by the State (except certain corporations) should be transferable only on the bcoks of the corporation, was not effective or sufficient; particularly, because
such books might not be easily or at all accessible. And we
can also well understand how the State might have reasonably
concluded, in the interest of the public, particularly of purchasers of stock, and of stockholders as well, that the evidence of such transfers should appear from the records of
some public office, like that of the Secretary of State. Hence,

215 U. S.

perhaps, the enactment of the statute which went into effect
January 11, 1899. Such a requirement as that in the act of
1899 did not increase, in any degree whatever, the liability
of stockholders, as agreed to by them when becoming stockholders. On the contrary, it was in the interest of stockholders as determining the fact of their ceasing to be stockholders on and after a particular date. Further, the statute
did not forbid a sale of the stock upon such terms as might
be agreed upon between a stockholder and any purchaser,
the transfer, pursuant to such sale, being evidenced as prescribed by the statute. Nor, if sued as stockholders, did the
act deprive defendants of any valid defense which they were
entitled to make at the time they acquired their stock. It
(lid nothing more than to prescribe, presumably in the interestoof the parties immediately concerned and of the public, a rule under which a person, owning and selling his stock
in a corporation, should be regarded as a stockholder, unless
and until its sale and transfer were manifested by a statement
of a particular kind filed in a named public office. If it be
said that the officers, charged with the duty of making and
filing that statement, might fail or refuse to discharge the
duty imposed upon them, the answer is, that if injury thereby
came to the stockholder, those officers would be liable to him
for such injury arising from neglect of duty. Besides, those
officers could be compelled by proper proceedings to perform
the duty put upon them by the statute. We hold that the
defendants acquired their stock subject, necessarily, to the
power of the State, having due regard to the legal rights of
parties, to regulate the transfer of stocks in its own corporations. In its first opinion in this case the Supreme Court of
Kansas well said (p. 735): "Before the act [of 1899] was
passed one who had sold stock of a corporation, in order to
relieve himself from liability for its debts, was obliged to see
that the transfer was noted by its officer upon its books; the
enactment merely imposed an additional duty to see that a
similar notation was made upon a public record. The change

'HENLEY v. MYERS.
215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

imposed no restraint upon the transfer of the stock, but related only to the means by which it should be accomplished
and the manner in which it might be evidenced. It is essentially a matter of method-of procedure-rather than of
ultimate substantial rights."
Equally without merit is the contention that the statute
of 1899 impaired the obligations of the stockholders' contract,
in that it substituted for individual actions against them a
suit in equity by a receiver appointed after judgment against
the corporation. In becoming stockholders the defendants
did not acquire a vested right in any particular mode of procedure adopted for the purpose of enforcing their liability as
stockholders. It is a well-established doctrine that mere methods of procedure in actions on contract that do not affect the
substantial rights of parties are always within the control of
the State. It is to be assumed that parties make their contracts with reference to the existence of such power in the
State.
Without expressing any opinion as to questions of a local
character, we hold, for the reasons stated, that the statute of
1899 furnishes no valid basis for the contention that it impaired the obligation of the contract by which defendants
acquired their stock. This is the only Federal question of a
substantial character presented on this writ of error, and the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas must be affirmed.
It is so ordered.
