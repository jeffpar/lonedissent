Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

215 U. S.

CALIGA v. INTER OCEAN NEWSPAPER COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 22.

Argued November 5, 1909.-Decided November 29, 1909.

Statutory copyright is not to be confounded with the exclusive property of the author in his manuscript at common law.
In enacting the copyright statute Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one dependent on compliance with the
statute.
Under existing copyright law of the United States there is no provision
for filing amendments to the first application; and, the matter being
wholly subject to statutory regulation, copyright on a second application cannot be sustained.
The statutory limit of copyright cannot be extended by new applications.
157 Fed. Rep. 186, affirmed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Otto Raymond Barnett, with whom Mr. Clarence T.
Morse was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
Copyright exists at common law as an incident to ownership. It may be lost by publication. The copyright statutes
specify what steps must be taken to avoid such loss upon publication. Myers v. Callaghan, 5 Fed. Rep. 726; Wheaton v.
Peters, 8 Peters, 591; Board of Trade v. Commission Co., 103
Fed. Rep. 902; Millar v. Taylor, 4 Burr. 2303; Donaldson v.
Becket, 4 Burr. 2408.
Copyright law is to be construed liberally and beneficially.
Nothing but a general publication or an express surrender of
his rights will affect a proprietor's common-law copyright property. Allan v. Black, 56 Fed. Rep. 754; Myers v. Callaghan,
128 U. S. 617.
A general publication is one which gives an express or implied right to copy the thing published. An exhibition of a painting under conditions which do not

give to the public a right to copy does not amount to a general
publication. Ladd v. Oxnard, 75 Fed. Rep. 730; Werckmeister
v. American LithographicCo., 134 Fed. Rep. 321.
A deposit of a photograph in the Library of Congr~ess in compliance with the copyright statutes merely serves to identify
the thing to be copyrighted and, not giving any express or
implied right to copy, does not amount to a publication.
Under the statute the only condition which will prevent obtaining a copyright is prior publication. Rev. Stat., § § 4952,
4956. A copyright registration may be abandoned by failure
to publish within a reasonable time after such registration.
In such event the common-law right never ceases. Boucicault v. Hart, Fed. Cas. No. 1,692; Carillo v. Shook, Fed. Cas.
No. 2,407.
If, therefore, a registration may be abandoned by failure
to publish within a reasonable time, it may also be abandoned
by a subsequent re-registration in the absence of any intermediate publication. Osgood v. Aloe Inst. Co., 69 Fed. Rep.
291.
Common law copyright and statutory copyright cannot coexist, the first only terminates upon a general publication, the
secQnd only begins upon a general publication. Prior to such
publication, common-law copyright remains unimpaired notwithstanding any registration which may have been made
with the Librarian of Congress for the purpose of obtaining
the protection of statutory copyright. Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.
Straus, 210 U. S. 339, 347; Press PublishingCo. v. Monroe, 164
U. S. 105; Boucicault v. Hart, Fed. Cas. No. 1,692; Carillo v.
Shook, Fed. Cas. No. 2,407.
The title of a copyrighted publication must correspond with
the title filed for purpose of copyright with the Librarian of
Congress. Mifflin v. White, 190 U. S. 260.
The copyright statute providing a penalty for infringement
is in form penal, but is remedial in intent. Dwight v. Appleton,

Plaintiff's only legal remedy for copyright infringement is

Opinion of the Court.

215 U. S.

Where a painter by repainting a copyrighted picture effects
a substantial change, the original copyright does not protect
the picture as repainted. Rev. Stat., § 4959, and see Fed.
Stat. Ann.; Lawrence v. Dana, 15 Fed. Cas. No. 8,136; Drone
on Copyrights, 146; 9 Cyc. 924.
In an action to recover for an infringement of a copyright it
must be shown that the publication complained of is a copy of
or copied from the copyrighted painting. Reproduction of a
copyrighted photograph of a painting is not an infringement
of the copyright on the painting. Champney v. Haag, 121 Fed.
Rep. 944.
The insertion or impression of a copyright notice upon a
painting before applying for a copyright is prohibited. Rev.
Stat., § 4963, and see Fed. Stat. Ann.
A variance can only be where there is a clear discrepancy
between averment and proof. 29 Am. & Eng. Ency. 580;
Walford v. Anthony, 21 E. C. L. 75.
A brief by Mr. E. L. Coburn and Mr. Josiah M. McRoberts
was filed by leave of the court for the Tribune Company as
amicus curice to which a reply brief was filed by the counsel for
plaintiff in error.
MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error, also plaintiff below, brought an action
in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois to recover damages under § 4965 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States, because of the publication by
the defendant of more than one thousand copies of a newspaper containing a picture of a painting, copyrighted by the
plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that he had in all respects complied with the Revised Statutes of the United States by causing to be deposited, on or about the fifth day of November,
1901, a photograph and a description of the painting for the
purpose of having it copyrighted, which deposit was before

CALIGA v. INTER OCEAN NEWSPAPER.
215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

publication of the same in the United States or in any foreign
country. By reason of the premises and the compliance with
the statutes of the United States the plaintiff claimed to be entitled to a copyright for the painting for the term of twentyeight years frorm and after the recording of the title thereof by
the Librarian of Congress on November 7, 1901.
There were other allegations, and proofs tending to show a
publication of a copy of the photograph in the newspaper of
the defendant company. In the course of the trial it appeared
that the plaintiff had deposited a description and photograph
of the same painting with the Librarian of Congress on October 7, 1901, for the purpose 6f securing a copyright. The trial
court charged the jury, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff
had brought his suit upon the wrong copyright, and therefore
directed a verdict in favor of the defendant. Upon writ of
error, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
affirmed this judgment. Caliga v. Inter Ocean Newspaper Co.,
157 Fed. Rep. 186. The case is now here for review.
The photographs filed upon the two applications for a copyright are identical. Nor is any substantial change in the
painting shown; the copyrights undertaken to be secured were,
therefore, upon the same painting. The difference is that in
the copyright sued upon, that of November 7, 1901, the title
and description are, "The Guardian Angel. Portrait of a
young girl sitting, hair arranged smoothly over the ears, hair
parted in the middle. Her guardian angel stands behind her,
one hand resting on her left shoulder, the other on her right
arm." The description accompanying the application for the
copyright of October 7, 1901, is, "Maidenhood; A Young Girl
seated beside a Window; An Angel stands behind her."
The question in this case is: Is the second attempt to copyright valid and effectual, or was the court right in charging in
substance that it was void and of no effect?
We have had such recent and frequent occasions to consider the nature and extent of the copyright laws of the United
States, as the same were before the recent revision, which took

effect July 1, 1909, that it is unnecessary to enter into any extended discussion of the subject now. Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.
Straus, 210 U. S. 339; White-Smith Music Pub. Co. v. Apollo
Company, 209 U. S. 1; American Tobacco Company v. Werckmeister, 207 U. S. 284; Bong v. Campbell Art Cp., 214 U. S. 236.
In these cases the previous cases in this court were cited and
reviewed.
As a result of the decisions of this court certain general
propositions may be affirmed. Statutory copyright is not to
be confounded with the common-law right. At common-law
the exclusive right to copy existed in the author until he permitted a general publication. Thus, when a book was published in print, the owner's common-law right was lost. At
common-law an author had a property in his manuscript, and
might have an action against any one who undertook to publish it without authority. The statute created a new property
right, giving to the author, after publication, the exclusive
right to multiply copies for a limited period. This statutory
right is obtained in a certain way and by the performance of
.certain acts which the statute points out. That is, the author
having complied with the statute and given up his common-law
right of exclusive duplication prior to general publication, obtained by the method pointed out in the statute an exclusive
right to multiply copies and publish the same for the term of
years named in the statute. Congress did not sanction an existing right; it created a new one. Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet.
591, 661. Those violating the statutory rights of the author or
proprietor are subject to certain penalties, and to the payment
of certain damages, as is provided in the statute.
Section 4952 of the Revised Statutes as amended in 1891
(3 Comp. Stat., §3406), provides that the proprietor of any
painting, upon compliance with the provisions of the copyright act, has the sole right of publishing, copying and vending
the same. By § 4953 we find that this right exists for the
period of twenty-eight years from the recording of the title of
the copyright, with a right to certain extensions after the ex-

CALIGA v. INTER OCEAN NEWSPAPER.
215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

piration of the twenty-eight years, as provided in § 4954. In
§ 4956 we find that a copyright is secured by depositing, on or
before the day of publication, in this or any foreign country, in
case of a painting, a photograph of the painting, accompanied
by a description thereof. There is absolutely no provision in
the statutes for a second filing of the photograph or description, nor is there any provision as to filing any amendments
thereto, and as the matter is wholly the subject of statutory
regulation, we are at a loss to perceive by what authority any
second application for the same painting, with a view to securing a copyright thereon, can be sustained. If it could be,
we see no reason why the proprietor might not thus extend the
limit of copyright fixed in the statute by an indefinite number
of new applications and filings with the Librarian.
The argument of the plaintiff in error is that, inasmuch as
the statutory copyright is not complete before a publication of
the subject-matter thereof, and no publication being shown
prior to the second application, it was within his power, while
his rights were thus inchoate, to make the second application
for the copyright, that of November 7, 1901. Assuming that
these premises are correct and that publication was requisite
to complete the right to be secured by the statute, it by no
means follows that a second copyright is warranted by the
statute. On the other hand, as we have already stated, the
statute is barren of any provisions to that end. There is no
provision, as there is in the patent law, for an amended application, and under the patent law it has been held that there
is no authority for double patenting. Miller v. Eagle Manufacturing Company, 151 U. S. 186. This is so because the first
patent exhausts the statutory right secured by the act of Congress.
In this case the plaintiff had complied with all the terms of
the statute on October 7, 1901. He then attempts to take out
a new copyright under the same statute on November 5, 1901,
for the same painting, by depositing a new description of the
painting and the same photograph. It is true there is a change

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Syllabus.

215 U. S.

in the title of the painting, and a slight change in the description, but these matters are immaterial and cannot enlarge the
right of the plaintiff. We think the same principle, in this
aspect, controls, as in the case of a patent. The plaintiff had
already exhausted his statutory right and the second attempt
availed him nothing.
These views render it unnecessary to consider whether the
record shows a publication of the painting prior to November 5, 1901. For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that
the Circuit Court of Appeals was right in holding that the attempted duplication of the copyright was void and of no effect.

UNITED STATES v. STEVENSON
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.

No. 292.

Argued October 14, 15, 1909.-Decided November 29, 1909.

On writ of error taken by the United States under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246, where the indictment was dismissed as not sustained by the statute and also as bad
on principles of general law, this court can only review the decision
so far as it is based on the invalidity or constructionof the statute;
it cannot consider questions of general law. United States v. Keitel,
211 U. S.370.
In determining whether a special remedy created by a statute for enforcing a prescribed penalty excludes all other remedies, the intention of Congress may be found in the history of the legislation, and,
in the absence of clear and specific language, Congress will not be
presumed to have excluded the Government from a well-recognized
method of enforcing its statutes.
The fact that a penal statute provides for enforcing the prescribed penalty of fine and forfeiture by civil suit does not necessarily exclude
enforcing by indictment; and so held in regard to penalty for assisting the immigration of contract laborers prescribed by §§ 4 and 5 of
the Immigration Act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134, 34 Stat. 898.
