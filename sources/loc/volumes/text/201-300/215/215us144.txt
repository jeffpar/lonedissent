SCULLY v. SQUIER
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IDAHO.
No. 21.

Argued November 5, 1909.-Decided November 29, 1909.

Where plaintiff bases his bill on the contention that under the town-

site law, § 2387, Rev. Stat., the ascertainment of boundaries by
official survey is a condition subsequent upon which the vesting of
the equitable rights of the occupant depends, the construction of a
law of the United States is involved, and, if passed on adversely by
the state court, this court has jurisdiction under § 709, Rev. Stat.,
to review the judgment.
The object of local legislation authorized by the townsite law, § 2387,
Rev. Stat., is to consummate the grant of the Government to the
townsite occupants-rot to alter or diminish it-and in this case the
construction by the state court of the territorial statute followed to
the effect that the trustee and surveyor had no power to alter or diminish the holdings of bona fide occupants by laying out or widening
streets.
13 Idaho, 428, affirmed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

subsequently filed, and the survey after confirmation cannot
be impeached, and power exists to have the grant correctly
surveyed before individual rights attach. Moore v. Walla

upon the defendants in error, and they can have no equitable rights in and to the land claimed by them and have
not the legal title to any of it. The land claimed by them
forms a part of the Congressional grant to the aggregation, to
the city of Lewiston, possession of such land has been, at all
times since the acceptance of deeds upon the official survey of
D street, if any possession dates back to this period, wrongful
and unlawful and the maintenance of a private and public
nuisance, giving no possessor thereof any rights in law or in
equity as against the city or as against the plaintiff in error.

at all times been wrongful and unlawful and they encroach
upon the legal and lawful street with an occupation which deprives the plaintiff in error of his rights under the laws of Congress and he should have a mandatory injunction against
them; for the appurtenant rights of the plaintiff in error are
not confined to the front of his lot, but extend to that part of
the street in front of adjoining lots. Dooly Block v. Salt Lake

The nature of the grant under the Federal townsite laws, is
that of confirmation of rights in existence. No new grant is
made-simply the ascertainment of rights already in existence,
and their certification. This is analogous to the deed of confirmation described by Blackstone. Scully v. Fix, 13 Idaho,

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

The relation of the parties to the cause of action is the same
in this court as in the state courts, and we will refer to plaintiff

SCULLY v. SQUIER.
215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

in error as plaintiff and to the defendants in error as defendants.
The pleadings in the case are exceedingly voluminous and
equally so are the findings of fact. It is enough for our purpose
to say that the city of Lewiston, State of Idaho, was entered
as a townsite under § 2387 of the Revised Statutes, hereinafter quoted, and a patent was issued by the United States to
the mayor of the city in trust for the occupants of the lands
conveyed. In pursuance of the trust the mayor executed
conveyances to the predecessors in title of plaintiff and defendants. The rights derived through these deeds, and the
occupation of the land preceding and subsequent to them, and
the effect of a survey made by one E. P. True, hereinafter re-"
ferred to, and the plat thereof filed by him, constitute the
questions in the case. Plaintiff seeks by this suit to enjoin defendants from encroaching on D street, as laid down on said
plat, by certain buildings which, it is alleged, they proposed
to erect. It is prayed, besides, that the buildings, if erected
before an injunction can be obtained, be declared a public
nuisance, "damaging the public and this plaintiff's private
rights," and be abated. The special damage alleged is that
plaintiff, having erected a building, on what he alleges to be
the true boundary line of D street, will be, as it was said in the
argument, "put into a hole" by the buildings of defendant
projecting beyond it, and that light and air thereto, through
the doors and windows of plaintiff's building, will be prevented, and the view therefrom to all parts of D street obstructed, and that "the light and air and view from all parts
of the said D street as the said building [plaintiff's building]
is constructed, necessarily ensue and benefit the said property
materially, and are of great value to the plaintiff, and as is
also the right of egress and ingress."
It is further alleged that before erecting his building plaintiff applied to the city engineer to be shown the original south
line of D street according to the original survey, and the
engineer ran '"the lines on the ground according to the said

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

215 U. S.

original survey and plat," and that plaintiff erected his building in accordance therewith, "covering the entire lot."
It is also alleged that the lots owned by defendants were
conveyed by the mayor to the original owners according to the
original survey, and "deeds thereto accepted according to the
said original survey and plat, and said lots have since been
conveyed to the defendants and their grantors according to
the said original survey and plat." A dedication of the street
to the public is averred as hence resulting, and an estoppel
against defendants to dispute the survey and plat. The answer of the defendants, in effect, denies the correctness of the
survey and plat made by True, and avers that there was an
amendment of the latter which exhibited the streets and alleys
according to the occupation of the respective claimants of the
lots. It is admitted, however, that some of the deeds issued
were in accordance with the plat, but it is denied that all the
deeds were, and averred "that the same were in accordance
with the use and occupation of the lands prior to the survey,
and with the said survey and plat, as the same were and had
been amended."
The findings of the trial court sustained these averments,
and found further that the True survey as originally made
disregarded the lines of occupation of the lots, and "ran
through buildings then in the actual use and occupancy of
the claimants of land and cut off approximately four feet from
the north end of buildings there standing and in actual use and
occupation of bonafide claimants."
A decree was passed dismissing the suit, which was affirmed
by the Supreme Court. 13 Idaho, 417.
All of the parties, as we have said, derived their rights and
titles under § 2387 of the Revised Statutes, providing for the
reservation and sale of townsites on the public lands. That
section is as follows:
"(Entry of town authorities in trust for occupants.) Whenever any portion of the public lands have been or may be
settled upon and occupied as a townsite, not subject to entry

SCULLY v. SQUIER.
215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

under the agricultural preemption laws, it is lawful, in case
such town be incorporated, for the corporate authorities
thereof, and, if not incorporated, for the judge of the county
court for the county in which such town is situated, to enter
at the proper land office, and at the minimum price, the land
so settled and occupied in trust for the several use and benefit
of the occupants thereof, according to their respective interests; the execution of which trust, as to the disposal of the
lots in such town, and the proceeds of the sales thereof, to be
conducted under such regulations as may be prescribed by
the legislative authority of the State or Territory in which
the same may be situated."
We have not recited, nor do we think that it is necessary to
recite, all of the facts found by the lower courts. We may add
to those which we have stated that the city of Lewiston was
incorporated under the laws of the Territory of Washington,
it then being within that Territory, and was reincorporated
by an act of the legislature of Idaho in 1866, it then being
within Idaho. The act defined the boundaries of the city.
Levi Ankeny was mayor of the city in 1871, and on November 21 of that year he filed his declaratory statement No. 39
in the United States land office at Lewiston, proposing to enter
the lands included within the borders of the city as incorporated, in trust for its inhabitants, claiming settlement in 1861.
Cash entry was made for the lands June 6, 1874, by Henry W.
Stainton, mayor, in trust for the inhabitants. "The legislature
of the Territory, [we quote from the opinion of the Supreme
Court of the State, 13 Idaho, p. 428 by an act approved January 8, 1873 (7th Sess. Laws, p. 16), provided for the survey,
platting and disposal of the land in the city of Lewiston pursuant to the United States statutes in regard to such matters.
Said act provides that the mayor-trustee shall cause to be
made and filed in his office by a competent person a plat of the
land within said city, divided into blocks and lots, and 'to
make and deliver to the bona fide occupants of such portions
of said lands described in said patent from the Government of

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

.'215 U. S.

the United States Who may be entitled thereto, good and sufficient deeds of conveyance in fee simple according to their
respective rights.'
"Under the provisions of said laws one E. B. True was employed to survey and plat the lands in said town, and was
commanded to adjust said plat so as to conform to the conditions of the improvements and the use and occupation of
such lands by the settler, and the mayor was required to make
*and deliver to the bonafide occupants of such lands good and
sufficient deeds of conveyance in fee simple, according to their
respective interests, under the provisions of said law.
"It appears from the evidence in the case that said True
. made a plat of said town, including block 24, in which block
are the lots involved in this case, so as to make the lots about
forty-six feet long, north and south, when, as a matter of fact,
most, if not all of the lots in that block were fifty feet long,
.north and south, as indicated by the buildings and other improvements thereon."
The Supreme Court said, 13 Idaho, p. 429:
"The question is fairly presented as to whether said True
had any authority whatever to' make said plat so as to interfere with and cut off a part of the buildings and improvements
of the occupants of such lots. In other words whether under
the law a surveyor, who is employed to plat such a townsite
after its entry by the proper officer, can widen a street, and in
doing so cut off a portion of the buildings and improvements
of the lot owners bordering on such street."
The question was answered in the negative, and the judgment of the trial court, which was adverse to plaintiff, was
affirmed. In some aspects the answer may be said to have
been put upon the statute of the State of January 8, 1873,
providing for the survey, platting and disposal of the land.
The court observed that there was no dispute that the evidence
established that the defendants claimed and occupied their
lots to the extent they had claimed for many years prior and
subsequently to the survey, Lnd that it was not shown or

SCULLY v. SQUIER.
215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

claimed that part of the lots was used as a street, nor that the
city ever claimed any part of them as a street. And it was
said (p. 433): "The city surveyor cannot make any portion of

said lots a street by simply making a plat and indicating on
such plat that said lots were only forty-five or forty-six feet
in length." The claim by defendants was of fifty feet. The
court further said (p. 433): "The mayor-trustee, had no judicial power in this matter-neither had the surveyor. The
surveyor and mayor cannot dedicate to the public as a street
parts of lots occupied and possessed by individuals." This, it
may be contended, is a mere construction of the statute of the
State of Idaho, and nothing more, in other words, a decision
that under the statute there was no power given to make a
survey or plat which did not conform to the lines of occupation. The contention of plaintiffs, however, is that "the
laws of Congress authorize an official ascertainment" of the
boundaries of the city, and "that the equitable right under
the said laws of Congress vests upon a condition subsequent,
which is that the owner of the equity must within a reasonable
time have his right confirmed by the trustee upon an official
survey ascertaining and settling its boundaries and nature,
and that the laws of Congress require each townsite occupant
to see to it that the official ascertainment is true and correct
and satisfactory before accepting confirmation of his equitable
rights from the mayor, trustee." It is hence insisted that a
construction of the laws of Congress is involved. This contention, we think, is the basis of plaintiff's bill of complaint,
and it seems also to have been passed on by the Supreme
Court of the State. The court said (p. 433): "The appellant
[plaintiff in error here] rests his case here on the making and
approval of said plat," (that is, the plat made by True,) and
the contention was discussed. We think, therefore, the motion
'to dismiss should be overruled.
But a little more discussion is necessary to pass on its merits.
Section 2387 constitutes the grant of title, and it is very explicit as to grantees, to the matter granted, and for whose use

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

215 U. S.

it is granted. The grant is of lands occupied as a townsite, the
grantees are the corporate authorities thereof, or the judge of
the county court where the town is situated, "in trust for the
several use and benefit of the occupants thereof, according to
their respective interests." And the legislation of Idaho, enacted in pursuance of § 2387, provides, as we have seen, that
the mayor shall cause to be made and filed in his office a plat
of the land divided into lots and blocks, but it is also provided
that he is required, as trustee, "to make and deliver to the
bonafide occupants of such portions of said lands described in
said patent from the Government of the United States, who
may be entitled thereto, good and sufficient deeds of conveyance in fee simple, according to their respective rights." The
object of the state legislation, therefore, was to consummate
the grant of the Government to the occupants of the land,
not to alter or diminish it. The grant was through the mayor
to the occupants of the lands. The extent of their occupation
was the extent of their rights; determined, therefore, the relation of their lots to the streets and alleys; fixed the location
of the streets and alleys. Or, as it is epigrammatically expressed by the Supreme Court of the State, "It must be kept
in mind that Lewiston existed prior to the True survey. The
settlers did not acquire their right under the plat nor by virtue
of it. The survey and plat was made for them; they were not
made for the survey and plat." But we need not make a universal application of this. It is enough for the present case
that the Supreme Court so construed the power of the mayor
and the surveyor under the Idaho statute. It may well be
contended, however, that the Supreme Court expressed a principle that has broader application, expressed as well the meaning of the act of Congress. In Ashby v. Hall, 119 U. S.526,
this court said (p. 529), speaking by Mr. Justice Field, "That
the power vested in the legislature of the Territory (Montana)
in the execution of the trust (under § 2387), upon which the
entry was made, was confined to regulations for the disposal of
the lots and the proceeds of the sales. These regulations might

SCULLY v. SQUIER.

Opinion of the Court.

extend to provisions for the ascertainment of the nature and
extent of the occupancy of different claimants of lots, and the
execution and delivery to those found to be occupants in good
faith of some official recognition of title, in the nature of a
conveyance. But they could not authorize any diminution of
the rights of the occupants when the extent of their occupancy was established. The entry was in trust for them, and
nothing more was necessary than an official recognition of the
extent of their occupancy. Under the authority conferred by
the townsite act the legislature could not change or close the
streets, alleys and blocks of a town by a new survey. Whatever power it may have had over them did not come from the
act, but, if it existed at all, from the general grant of legislative power under the organic act of the Territory." See also
Stringfellow v. Cain, 99 U. 8. 610; Cofield v. McClelland, 16
Wall. 331; Hussey v. Smith, 99 U. S. 20. Many state cases are
to the same effect, and may be found in the notes to § 2387 in
the United States Federal Statutes Annotated, vol. 6, page 344
et seq.
Further discussion is unnecessary. Plaintiff's other contentions are either disposed of by the facts found by the state
courts or do not present Federal questions.
Judgment affirmed.
