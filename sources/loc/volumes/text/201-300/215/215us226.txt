YORDI v. NOLTE,. UNITED STATES MARSHAL.
APPEAL

FROM THE

DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES

FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.

No. 382.

Submitted October 22, 1909.-Decided December 6, 1909.

In foreign extradition proceedings the complaint is sufficient to authorize the commissioner to act if it so clearly and explicitly states
a treaty crime that the accused knows exactly what the charge is;
nor need the record and depositions from the demanding country
be actually fastened to the complaint.
In this case held that depositions in the possession of the officer of
the demanding country making the complaint, which showed
actual grounds for the prosecution and of which the commissioner
had knowledge, from their use in a former proceeding, were admissible on the hearing before the commissioner and were also
admissible for the purpose of vesting jurisdiction in him to issue
the warrant.
166 Fed. Rep. 921, affirmed.
