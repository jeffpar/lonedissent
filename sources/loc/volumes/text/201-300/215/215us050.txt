plainant and the Watermans are entitled to share, without
prejudice to the rights of Davis. It may direct the retention of
his share in the hands of the executors, to be adjudicated in
some other suit, or may otherwise shape its relief so as to do
justice to the parties before the court without affecting his
interest.
Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the Federal
court has jurisdiction for the purpose of ascertaining the rights
of the complainant to recover as against the executor, and the
interest of the persons before the court in the fund. While the
court could make no decree which would interfere with the
possession of the probate court, it had jurisdiction to entertain the bill and to render a judgment binding upon the parties to the extent and in the manner which we have already
stated. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the court below
erred in holding that there was no jurisdiction to entertain
this suit, and the decree is reversed and the cause remanded
to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana for further proceedings in accordance with
this opinion.

UNITED STATES v. UNION SUPPLY COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.

No. 120.

Argued October 13, 14, 1909.-Decided November 8, 1909.

Where corporations are as much within the mischief aimed at by a
penal statute and as capable of willful breaches of the law as individuals the statute will not, if it can be reasonably interpreted as
including corporations, be interpreted as excluding them.
Where a penal statute prescribes two independent penalties, it will be
construed as meaning to inflict them so far as possible, and, if one is

impossible, the guilty defendant is not to escape the other which is
possible.
Section 6 of the act of May 9, 1902, c. 784, 32 Stat. 193, imposing certain duties on wholesale dealers in oleomargarine and imposing
penalties of fine and imprisonment for violations applies to corpo-

rations, notwithstanding the penalty of imprisonment cannot be
inflicted on a corporation.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
The Solicitor General for plaintiff in error.
The duty to make the returns in question was undoubtedly
imposed upon corporations as well as upon natural persons.
1. Section 6 of the act of 1902 is a reenactment of § 41 of
the act "to reduce revenue and equalize duties on imports,
etc.," approved October 1, 1890, 26 Stat. 567, which latter
act undoubtedly applied to both natural persons and corporations but was defective in not providing any penalty for
its violation. 2. To construe § 6 as not imposing a duty on
corporate dealers would be inconsistent with the general purposes of the oleomargarine legislation. 3. Section 6 imposes
the duty on wholesale dealers, without distinction between
different classes of dealers and in this the section is consistent
with the other provisions of the act, which all relate to oleomargarine, or dealers in or manufacturers of it and not to
particular persons or classes.
Corporations being under the duty to make said returns,
they are subject to the criminal punishment which § 6 visits
upon violators of that duty, so far as their nature makes
possible. 1. The purpose of the statute will be largely defeated unless punishment can be imposed. 2. There is no
difficulty in construing the word "person" in the final clause
as including a corporation. United States v. Amedy, 11

Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 588; Rev. Stat., § 1. 3. The

punishment the imposition of only one. would not be an
exercise of discretion by the court; hence the cases of Ex parte

766, and Whitwarth v. United States, 114 Fed. Rep. 502, are
not in point. 5. The mention of natural persons in § 5 of
the act has no effect upon the construction of § 6.
If the construction placed on § 6 by the trial court be
correct, then corporations may violate some fifty or sixty
other important criminal statutes similarly worded.
A construction which would limit the application of § 6
to natural persons would render it unconstitutional or would
at least make its constitutionality seriously questionable.

Downes v. Bidwell, 183 U. S. 244, 291; Dorr v. United States,
195 U. S. 138, 147, and therefore such a construction is to be
avoided. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S.
366, 407.
Mr. Isaac R. Hitt, Jr., for defendant in error.
The act of May 9, 1902, c. 784, 32 Stat. 193, is an original act
which also amends the act of August 2, 1886, and is not to be
construed as a supplemental act, as the plaintiff in error endeavors to show.
Section 5 of that act applies, in express terms, to corporations, and gives the court discretionary power to punish either

Opinion of the Court.

by fine or imprisonment or both. Since a corporation cannot
be imprisoned, the court, under § 6, cannot disregard so much
of that section as prescribes punishment by imprisonment and
punish only by fine. United States v. Braun, 158 Fed. Rep.
450.
See the decision of Judge Caldwell holding, in a case in
which the statute prescribed a penalty of fine and imprisonment, that a sentence of imprisonment only was erroneous.
Woodruff v. United States, 58 Fed. Rep. 766.
If the penalty prescribed for the act be both fine and imprisonment, then, so far as the punishment cannot, from the
nature of the offender, be carried out, the statute is, of course,
inoperative. Commonwealth v. Association, 92 Kentucky, 197.
See also Clark's Criminal Law, 2d ed., 79. It may be that such
a construction discloses a serious defect in the law; but if so,
that defect must be cured by congressional and not judicial
legislation. United States v. Braun, 158 Fed. Rep. 456. Also
see Cumberland Canal Corp. v. Portland,56 Maine, 77; Androscoggin Water Power Co. v. Bethel Steam Mill Co., 64
Maine, 441.
It has been held, in substance, that oleomargarine acts are
complete in themselves and contain provisions for all the
punishment that Congress intended for'violations thereof.
United States v. Lamson, 165 Fed. Rep. 80; Grier v. Tucker,
150 Fed. Rep. 658; Schafer v. Craft, 144 Fed. Rep. 907; Craft
v. Shafer, 153 Fed. Rep. 175; S. C., 154 Fed. Rep. 1002.
The contention of the Government that a decision adverse to
the Government will affect many other now existing laws
seems unworthy of the high ideal which this court has ever
endeavored to fill: The decisions of this court are always farreaching and the enactments of Congress are not necessarily
settled law until passed upon by this tribunal.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an indictment of a corporation for wilfully violating

the sixth section of the act of Congress of May 9, 1902, c. 784,
§ 6, 32 Stat. 193, 197. That section requires "wholesale
dealers" in oleomargarine, etc., to keep certain books and to
make certain returns. It then goes on as follows: "And any
person who wilfully violates any of the provisions of this
section shall, for each such offense, be fined not less than
fifty dollars and not exceeding five hundred dollars, and imprisoned not less than thirty days nor more than six months."
The corporation moved to quash the indictment and the
District Court quashed it on the ground that the section is
not applicable to corporations. Thereupon the United States
brought this writ of error.
The argument for the defendant in error is drawn from an
earlier decision by the same court.. It is that § 5 applies in express terms to corporations, and gives the court discretionary
power to punish by either fine or imprisonment, or both,
whereas in § 6 both punishments are imposed in all cases and
corporations are not mentioned; that it is impossible to imprison a corporation, and that the statute warrants no sentence that does not comply with its terms. United States v.
Braun & Fitts, 158 Fed. Rep. 456. We are of opinion that this
reasoning is unsound. In the first place, taking up the argument, drawn from § 5, that corporations were omitted intentionally from the requirements of § 6, it is to be noticed
that the sixth section of the present act copies its requirements
from the act of October 1, 1890, c. 1244, §41, 26 Stat. 567, 621,
which did not contain the penal clause. In its earlier form the
enactment clearly applied to corporations, and when the same
words were repeated in the later act it is not to be supposed
that their meaning was changed. The words "wholesale
dealers" are as apt to embrace corporations here as they are in
§ 2, requiring such dealers to pay certain taxes. We have no
doubt that they were intended to embrace them. The words
"any person" in the penal clause are as broad as "wholesale
dealers" in the part prescribing the duties. U. S. Rev. Stat.,
§ 1. It is impossible to believe that corporations were inten-

tionally excluded. They are as much within the mischief
aimed at as private persons, and as capable of a "wilful"
breach of the law. New York Central & Hudson River R. R. v.
United States, 212 U. S. 481. If the defendant escapes, it does
so on the single ground that as it cannot suffer both parts of the
punishment it need not suffer one.
It seems to us that a reasonable interpretation of the words
used does not lead to such a result. If we compare § 5, the
application of one of the penalties rather than of both is made
to depend not on the character of the defendant, but on the discretion of the judge; yet there corporations are mentioned in
terms. See Hawke v. E. Hulton & Co. Limited, (1909) 2 K. B.
93, 98. And if we free our minds from the notion that criminal
statutes must be construed by some artificial and conventional
rule, the natural inference, when a statute prescribes two independent penalties, is that it means to inflict them so far as
it can, and that if one of them is impossible, it does not mean
on that account to let the defendant escape. See Commonwealth v. Pulaski County Agricultural & Mechanical Association, 92 Kentucky, 197, 201. In Hawke v. E. Hulton & Co.
(1909), 2 K. B. 93, it was held that the words "any person"
in one section of a penal act did not embrace a corporation
notwithstanding a statute like our Rev. Stat., § 1. But that
was not so much on the ground that imprisonment was contemplated as a punishment, as because the person convicted
was to be "deemed a rogue and a vagabond." Moreover it
was thought that corporations could be reached under another
section of the act.
Judgment reversed.
