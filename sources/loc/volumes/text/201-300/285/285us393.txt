Argument for Petitioner.

BURNET, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. CORONADO OIL & GAS CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.

No. 341.

Argued January 15, 1932. Reargued March 16, 1932.Decided April 11, 1932.

Lands granted by the United States to the State of Oklahoma for the
support of common schools and dedicated to that purpose by the
state constitution, were leased by the State to a private company
for extraction of oil and gas, the State reserving a part of the gross
production, the proceeds of which were paid into the public school
fund, and the lessee taking the remainder. Held:
(1) The lease was an instrumentality of the State in the exercise
of a strictly governmental function. P. 398.
(2) Application of the federal income tax to the income derived
from the lease by the lessee was therefore unconstitutional. Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S.501, followed; Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v.
Bass, 283 U. S.279, distinguished. Id.

CERTIORARI, 284 U. S. 606, to review a judgment overruling a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining
an income and excess-profits tax, 14 B. T. A. 1214.

Solicitor General Thacher, with whom Assistant Attorney General Youngquist and Messrs. Sewall Key, Hayner
N. Larson, and Francis H. Horan were on the brief, for
petitioner.
The effect of the federal tax is too indirect and remote
to interfere with any governmental function of the State.
The tax is less direct and burdensome than those which
this Court sustained in Metcalf &'Eddy v. Mitchell, 269
U. S.514, and in Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216. The
decision below is contrary to the principle of Forbes v.
Gracey, 94 U. S.762; Gromer v. Standard Dredging,Co.,

195 U. S. 375, and the cases following them. It is likewise contrary to the principle of U. S. Glue Co. v. Oak
Creek, 247 U. S. 321; Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37;
Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain,254 U. S. 113.
The respondent is a private corporation engaged in
business for its own profit. If for any purpose the respondent is an agency of the State, it is still not exempt
from the tax imposed upon income derived from the exercise of nongovernmental functions.
Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501, rests on the peculiar relation of the United States to its Indian wards,
and is in agreement with a recognized federal policy that
any activity of the Federal Government in behalf of the
Indians shall not be affected even very remotely by state
taxation. Further, the question as to whether the lessee
was a federal instrumentality was not argued or decided
in that case. It dealt with the absolute immunity of
activities and instrumentalities of the United States from
state taxation; whereas the States enjoy no such immunity unless their activities are strictly governmental.
South Carolinav. United States, 199 U. S. 437.
The implied immunity from taxation of the States by
the United States, and of the United States by the States,
arises from thu provisions 6f the Constitution which contemplate the maintenance of the independence of the
national and state governments within their respective
spheres. The reasons underlying the principle mark the
limits of its range, and the immunity does not extend to
anything lying outside or beyond governmental functions
and their exertion. Indian Motocycle Co. y. United
States, 283 U. S. 570, 575-576.
Within the limits of its sovereignty, defined by the Constitution, the power of the national government is supreme, and it follows necessarily that all of its activities
are etftitled to absolute immunity from state taxation.

In contrast, the powers of a State are both governmental and proprietary. Unlike the United States, it
may exercise powers both of a governmental and of a
nongovernmental character. Cf. Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U. S. 151, 158.
The States retain all the powers of a monarch except so
far as they have been surrendered or limited by the provisions of the Federal Constitution (Hall v. Wisconsin, 103
U. S. 5, 11), and may engage, directly or through agencies
and instrumentalities, in activities governmental and no-ngovernmental in character. It follows that where the exemption from federal taxation is predicated upon interference with the exercise of strictly governmental powers
of the State, the inquiry fnust extend beyond the instruimentality sought to be taxed to its activities with which
the imposition of the tax will interfere, and ifthese activities are not strictly governmental the tax will be sustained.
South Carolinav. United States, 199 U. S. 437.
In this case the tax imposed upon income derived by
the lessee from the sale of its own share of the oil and gas
produced is imposed upon income derived by the lessee
from the sale of its own property and the conduct of its
own private business. See State v. Horr, 165 Minn. 1, 5.
Assuming the lease to be an instrumentality of government, the lessee, in marketing its own share of the oil,
does not act for the State in its soverein or governmental
capacity. It acts solely on its own account, and for its
own profit, in a purely private business undertaking.
Taxation of the property of the agent is not always or
generally taxation of the means. 'Clallam County v.

Argument for Respondent.

285U.S.

In principle there is no distinction between this case
and Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, 283 U. S. 279.
Messrs. David A. Richardson and Thos. P. Gore, with
whom Messrs. Samuel W. Hayes and Eugene Jordanwere
on the brief, for respondent.
The governmental function of maintaining public
schools involves not only their establishment, but also the
raising of revenue to carry them on; and, under the Enabling Act and the constitution of the State, it was as much
a governmental function of Oklahoma to obtain revenue
for its public school fund from these governmental lands
as it is to obtain such revenue for that purpose by taxation
or by the issuance of bonds. The State's leasing power of
these government lands for governmental purposes was as
much a governmental power as is its taxing power or its
power to issue bonds for school purposes; and the leases
themselves were governmental instrumentalities.
The aim of Congress and the State was to raise money
for public school purposes, and the lands and their development and operation through leases were intended to be
a means to that end. It is the power of the government
to raise money for governmental purposes that is protected. That an act is one which may be done by individuals or private corporations does not necessarily stamp it
as nongovernmental when done by Government for a recognized governmental purpose. Cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449;

397

Opinion of the Court.-'

A State's operation and development of its own lands
for governmental purposes is not to be likened to its engaging in an ordinary business like that of selling intoxicating liquor. If a State in leasing its public lands to
obtain revenue for governmental purposes would not be
acting in a governmental capacity, performing a governmental function, then the United States does not do so in
leasing its public lands containing coal, oil, etc., and any
State in which the land lies may tax the lease and the income of the lessee thereunder, without the consent of the
United States and against its will. The ownership, leasing, and mineral development of land has been a power
and function of sovereignty from earliest common law
times.
Under the Constitution delegating to it certain powers
of government and reserving to the States those not
delegated, and intending that each shall exercise its
powers so delegated and reserved without hindrance or
obstruction by the other, neither a State nor the United
States can tax the property or the governmental functions, agencies or instrumentalities of the other. A tax
upon respondent's income derived from its state leases is
a tax upon the leases themselves, and a tax upon the
leases is a tax upon the power of the State to make them,
and interferes with the exercise of and may be used to
destroy the power.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivmred the opinion of the
Court.
By the Enabling Act Congress required as a condition
precedent to tl admission of Oklahoma into the Union
that her constitution should make provision for common
schools; and for their benefit it granted certain lands to
the State with the proviso that those valuable for min-

erals, gas and oil should not be sold prior to January 1,
1915, but might be leased. Act of June 16, 1906, 34
Stat. 267, 270, 272, 273. The State Constitution established a common school system and pledged her faith to
preserve the lands so conveyed by the United States as
a sacred trust, "and to keep the same for the uses and
purposes for which they were granted." The legislature
prescribed regulations for leasing and directed payment
of the proceeds into the school fund. Oklahoma Comp.
Statutes of .1921, §§9415, 9417, 9423.
In January, 1914, some of these lands were leased to
the Coronado Oil and Gas Company; renewals followed
in 1919.' Under the first lease the State received fifty
per cent. and under the second twelve and one-half per
cent. of the gross production of oil and gas. During the
years here important the lessee's entire income came from
the sale of its poiftion of such output.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed income and excess-profits taxes upon the corporation's net
income for 1917, 1918 and 1919. The Board of Tax Appeals approved his action;- the Court of Appeals, District
of Columbia, ruled otherwise. The latter held that the
lease to the Coronado Company was an instrumentality
of the State for the utilization of lands dedicated to the
support of public schools and that to tax the fruits of the
lease would burden her in the performance of the gov-,
ernmental function of maintaining such schools. This
conclusion, it properly thought, was necessary under Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501.
We. are disposed to apply the doctrine of Gillespie v.
Oklahoma strictly and only in circumstances closely analogous to those which it disclosed. In principle, however,
the present claim of exemption cannot be distinguished
from the one presented in the earlier cause and we adhere
,to the rule there approved.

BURNET v. CORONADO OIL & GAS CO.

399

Opinion of the Court.

True it is, as stated in Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass,
283 U. S. 279, 282, 283, "This Court has consistently held
that where property or any interest in it has completely
passed from the government to the purchaser, he can claim
no immunity from taxation with respect to it, merely
because it was once government-owned, or because the sale
of it effected some government purpose. . . . Property
which has thus passed from either the national or a state
government to private ownership becomes a part of the
common mass of property and subject to its common
burdens." And, as there distinctly indicated, the exemption claimed by the Oil Corporation was denied because
under the settled rule applied by the Texas Supreme Court
the oil and gas from disposal of which the corporate income arose had been purchased, not obtained under a
lease-title had passed out of the State by a present sale.
Status of the title was matter for determination under
laws of the State as construed and applied by her courts.
In the present cause there is no basis for saying that, according to the local law, the transaction between the State
and the lessee amounted to a sale. The distinction between cases involving sales, and those where leases had
been made seemed sufficiently apparent when Group No
1 Oil Corp. v. Bass was. decided and is not less obvious
now.
"Just what instrumentalities of either a state or the
federal government are exempt from taxation by the
other cannot be stated in terms of universal application.
But this Court has repeatedly held that those agencies
through which either government immediately and directly
exercises its sovereign powers, are immune from the taxing
power of the other." Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269
U. S. 514, 522.
The opinion in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra, has often
been referred to as the expression of an accepted principle.

the United States." Indian Motocycle Co. v. United

and in order to preserve our dual system this fact must

arising therefrom would amount to an imposition upon the
lease itself.
The challenged judgment must be
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE, dissenting.

I think the judgment below should be reversed and Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501, should be overruled.
Neither can stand as the law of this Court consistently
with the principles recently reaffirmed in Group No. 1 Oil
Corp. v. Bass, 283 U. S. 279.
The State of Texas, like the State of Oklahoma, has
set apart a portion of its public domain for educational
purposes. It has granted oil and gas leases of these lands,
not differing in any material respect from the Oklahoma
lease involved in this case. The royalties received by the
State from the leases are devoted to the University of
Texas, as Oklahoma devotes the income derived from its
leases to its public schools. In Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v.
Bass, supra, decided less than a year ago, this Court, notwithstanding its decision in the Gillespie case that the income of the lessees of Indian oil lands could not be taxed
by Oklahoma, upheld the right of the National Government to assess and collect a tax upon the income received
by the lessee of one of the Texas leases, from the sale
of oil produced from the leased land. It was pointed out
that under Texas law the lessee, by virtue of his lease,
became the owner of the oil underground and that the
taxed income was derived from the sale of oil which was
his own property. In upholding the tax the Court said
(pp. 282-283):
"Property sold or otherwise disposed of by the government,either state or national, in order to raise revenue
for government purposes, is in a broad sense a government instrumentality, with respect to which neither the

property itself before sale, nor its sale by one government,
may be taxed by the other. But it does not follow that
the same property in the hands of the buyer, or his use
or enjoyment of -it,.or the income he derives from it, is
also tax immune. New Brunswick v. United States, 276
U. S. 547; Forbes v. Gracey, 94 U. S. 762; Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall. 527; see Weston v. Charleston,2 Pet. 449,
468; Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 547. Theoretically, any tax imposed on the buyer with respect to the
purchased property may have some effect on the price,
and thus remotely and indirectly affect the selling government. We may assume that if the property is subject to
tax after sale, the governmental seller will generally receive a less favorable price than if iAwere known in advance that the property in the hands of later owners, or
even of the buyer alone, could not be taxed.
"But the remote and indirect effects upon the one government of such a non-discriminatory tax by the other
have never been considered adequate grounds for thus
aiding the one at the expense of the taxing power of the
other. See Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216, 231; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, 282 U. S. 379; Metcalf &
Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514, 523-524. This Court
has consistently held that where property or any interest
in it has completely passed from the government to the
purchaser, he can claim no immunity from taxation with
respect to it, merely because it was once government
owned, or because the sale of it effected some government
purpose. New Brunswick v. United States, supra; Forbes
v. Gracey, supra; Tucker v. Ferguson,supra; see Gromer
v. Standard Dredging Co., 224 U. S. 362, 371; Choctaw,
0. & G. R. Co. v. Mackey, 256 U. S. 531, 537; Central

which has thus passed from either the national or a state government to private ownership becomes a part of the common mass of property and subject to its common burdens. Denial to either government of the power to tax it, or income derived from it,
in order to insure some remote and indirect antecedent
benefit to the other, would be an encroachment on the
sovereign power to tax, not justified by the implied constitutional restriction. See Weston v. Charleston, supra,
p. 468."
The doctrine thus announced was not a new one.
More than fifty years before, and long before the decision in the Gillespie case, it had been definitely decided in
Forbes v. Gracey, 94 U. S. 762, that private mining claims
granted by the Government in the public lands of the
United States, and the ores and minerals derived from
them, are subject to state taxation.
In deciding thb Group No. 1 Oil Corp. case, it was not
necessary to determine whether the result in that case
would have been different if the oil, from the sale of which
the taxpayer derived his income, had become his only
when severed from the soil, or whether there were other
distinguishing features between that case and the Gillespie
case. It was enough, there, that, as the taxed income was
derived from the lessee's sale of the oil, title to which
was, by the lease,.vested in him before severance, the case
was definitely controlled by precedents whose avowed
principles the Court approved. Now, we are concerned
with a lease identical with that involved in the Gillespie
case, and comparison of it with the Texas lease is unavoidable. If we can find no distinction of substance between
the operation and effect of-the Texas leases and the Oklahoma leases, the Gillespie case should no longer be followed. That no such distinction can be drawn is obvious.
The leasing by the National Government of Indian oil
lands in Oklahoma to private lessees, for the benefit of the
"Property

Indians, and the leasing by Oklahoma of its school lands
in like fashion, for the benefit of the schools of the state,
are no more and no less governmental enterprises than the
leasing by Texas of its oil lands for the benefit of the state
university. Whatever the genesis of the particular public
duty which each sovereignty has undertaken to perform,
the method chosen and the instruments selected for its performance are the same. In each case there was the exercise of a function concededly governmental, but in each
the only result, so far as the lessee was concerned, was the
acquisition by him of certain property rights exclusively
for his own benefit. in each the lessee was taxed on his
profits, derived from his private business in the production and sale of oil and gas, which was his property. It
cannot be said that the identical tax, thus levied, has any
effect on Oklahoma differing from that on Texas. The
fact, if it is a fact, that under the Oklahoma leases the
lessees do not acquire ownership of the oil or gas until
they have severed it from the soil, but before its sale,
while the lessees under the Texas leases acquire it immediately on receipt of their leases, presents no distinguishing feature. All acquire private rights by governmental
grant, from the exploitation of which they have derived
income which, upon principles consistently applied by this
Court, except in the Indian oil lease cases, and reiterated
in the Group No. 1 Oil Corp. case, may be taxed as other
income is taxed.
Since comparison of the two methods of disposing of
state assets reveals only formal differences, this Court
must now deal with an irreconcilable conflict in the
theories upon which two'6f its decisions rest. One, the
Gillespie case, extends the doctrine of tax immunity, beyond any other case, to income from private business
enterprises, merely because the property used in the business was acquired from a sovereign government which ap-

BURNET v. CORONADO OIL & GAS CO.

BRANDEIS,

J., dissenting.

plies the proceeds of it to a governmental purpose. The
other, and more recent, case, decided by the Court after
full consideration of all the arguments now advanced as
supporting the Gillespie case, restricted the immunity to
the property of the sovereign government itself and to the
income which the Government derives from it.
It is plain that if we place emphasis on the orderly administration of justice, rather than on a blind adherence
to conflicting precedents, the Gillespie case must be overruled. It is true that for ten years the State of Oklahoma
has been deprived, by the decision in that case, of taxes
upon the income derived from private business of lessees
of Indian lands in that state, but that is no reason why it
should continue to be so deprived or why the National
Government should now be denied the right to like taxes
and at the same time be permitted to tax the income of
the lessees under the Texas leases. No interest which
could be subserved by so rigid an application of stare
decisis, is superior to that of a system of justice based on
a considered and consistent application of the Constitution of the United States.

willing that it be regarded hereafter as the law of this court, that its

of this Court is unlike that of the highest court of England, where the policy of stare decisis was formulated and
is strictly applied to all classes of cases.' Parliament is
free to correct any judicial error; and the remedy may
be promptly invoked.
The reasons why this Court should refuse to follow
an earlier constitutional decision which it deems erroneous are particularly strong where the question presented
is one of applying, as distinguished from what may accurately be called interpreting, the Constitution. In the
cases which now come before us there is seldom any dispute as to the interpretation of any provision. The controversy is usually over the application to existing conditions of some well-recognizea constitutional limitation.7
This is strikingly true of cases under the due process
clause when the question is whether a statute is unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious; of cases under the equal
protection clause when the question is whether there is
any reasonable basis for the classification made by a
statute; and of -cases under the commerce clause when
the question is whether an admitted burden laid by a statute upon interstate commerce is so substantial as to be
deemed direct. These issues resemble, fundamentally,
that of reasonable care in negligence cases, the determination of which is ordinarily left to the verdict of the
jury. In every such case the decision, in the first instance, is dependent upon the determination of what in
legal parlance is called a fact, as distinguished from the

declaration of a rule of law.8 When the underlying fact
has been found, the legal result follows inevitably. The
circumstance that the decision of that fact is made by a
court, instead of by a jury, should not be allowed to
obscure its real character.
The issue presented by the case at bar is of the character
of those discussed above. Here, also, the applicable provision of law is beyond dispute. Confessedly, the United
States may not, by a tax, interfere substantially with the
functions of a State. The question at issue is, whether,
as a practical matter, it does so interfere by a statute
which includes among the. items on which its general income'tax is laid, the profits derived by the taxpayer from
operating some of the State's school lands under a lease.
The question resembles closely that presented and decided
in Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S.216, 230, 231. There, this
Court examined the surrounding facts to determine
.whether "a federal tax on the profits of sales of such securities should be deemed, as a practical matter, to lay
such a burden on the exercise of the State's borrowing
power as to make it necessary to deny to the Federal Government the constitutional authority to impose the tax."
The validity of the tax, it held, depends upon "whether
the prospect on the part of the ordinary investor of obtaining profit on the resale of such obligations is so important
an element in inducing their acquisition that a federal tax
on7 such profits, in common with profits derived from the
sales of other property, constitutes any substantial interference with the functions of state governments." Obviously the matter for determination in Willcuts v. Bunn,
although made by the highest court of the land, was, in

essence, a matter of fact. Similarly, here, the question
whether it would interfere substantially with the functions of the state government to permit the general income
tax of the United States to include profits derived from
the lease involves primarily the determination of a fact,
not the decision of a proposition of law.
The doctrine of res judicata demands that a decision
made by the highest court, whether it be a determination
of a fact or a declaration of a rule of law, shall be accepted
as a final disposition of the particular controversy, even
if confessedly wrong. But the decision of the Court, if, in
essence, merely the determination of a fact, is not entitled,
in later controversies between other parties, to that sanction which, under the policy of stare decisis, is accorded to
the decision of a proposition purely of law. For not only
may the decision of the fact have been rendered upon an
inadequate presentation of then existing conditions, but
the conditions may have changed meanwhile. Compare
Abie State Bank v. Bryan, 282 U. S. 765, 772. Moreover,
the judgment of the Court in the earlier decision may
have been influenced by prevailing views as to economic
or social policy which have since been abandoned." In
cases involving constitutional issues of the character discussed, this Court must, in order to reach sound conclusions, feel free to bring its opinions into agreement with
experience and with facts newly ascertained, so that its

CIRCUIT.

FOR THE

Argued February 25, 1932.-Decided April 11, 1932.

1. In a suit in admiralty between foreigners it is ordinarily within
the discretion of the District Court to refuse to retain jurisdiction;
and the exercise of its discretion will not be disturbed unless abused.

2. This rule applies even though the cause of action arose in this
country. Pp. 418, 419.
3. Two ships of Canadian registry and ownership, each carrying
cargo shipped from one Canadian port to another, collided on Lake
Superior while unintentionally in United States waters, and one
ship sank. While suit was pending in a Canadian court of admiralty to determine liability as between the ships, libels in personam
against the owner of one of them were filed by cargo owners in a
federal district court in New York. All the parties were citizens
of Canada, and the officers and crew of each vessel-the material
witnesses-were citizens and residents of that country. Opposing
affidavits alleged that the motive of the cargo owners in coining to
a court of the United States lay in the opportunity in our law to
recover full damages from the non-carrying vessel, whereas, in
Canada, the liability would be divided equally between the two
vessels if both were at fault. The district court dismissed the libels,
but ordered that the respondent should appear and file security in
any action which might be instituted by the libelants in the admiTogether with No. 488, British Empire Grain Co., Ltd. v. Paterson Steamships, Ltd., and No. 489, Starnes v. Same.
