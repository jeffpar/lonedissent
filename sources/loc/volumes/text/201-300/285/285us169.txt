diction, . . . under which the estate is being administered." Charges against an estate are only such as affect
it as a whole. They do not include taxes on the rights of
individual beneficiaries. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner,
256 U. S. 345, 350.
The Massachusetts statute by plain words places the
feal burden of the tax upon the legatee or other person
who receives a decedent's property. Payments required
of an executor are only preliminary; ultimately they
must be met by the beneficiaries.
Decisions of the Massachusetts Supreme Court show
with adequate certainty that the right of succession is the
real object of the charge laid because of property which
passes by will or under the laws relative to intestacy.
The thing burdened is the right to receive. Attorney

APPEAL from a judgment against the Hartford Company and the surety on its appeal bond in the court below.

31 (119 So. 366); 132 So. 535; 135 id. 497.

Messrs. Marion Smith and L. Barrett Jones, with whom
Messrs. W. Calvin Wells, Max F. Goldstein, and Arthur
G. Powell were on the brief, for appellant.
Whether a judgment is such a joint judgment that
all parties against whom it is rendered must unite in the,
appeal depends not on the form of the judgment, but upon
considerations of substance. Hanrick v. Patrick, 119
U. S. 156; The New York, 104 Fed. 561; Love v. Export
Storage Co., 143 Fed. 1, 11; Clarke v. Boysen, 39 F. (2d)
800, 821.
The nature of judgments rendered in the State of Mississippi and the relations of parties thereto is a matter
of local law as to which the decisions of the highest courts
of that State are controlling. Central Loan & Tr. Co. v.
Campbell Commission Co., 173 U. S. 84, 90. The scope
and effect of a judgment of a state court is peculiarly a
question of state law. Kenney v. Craven, 215 U. S.
125, 130.
The Supreme Court of Mississippi has held (Wilson v.
Lexington, 153 Miss. 209) that though an intermediate
appellate court includes the surety on the appeal to that
court in the judgment it renders against the appellant,
the surety on this first appeal is not a necessary party to

HARTFORD ACCIDENT CO. v. BUNN.
169

171

Argument for Appellant.

a further appeal of the case to a higher court. The rule
of joinder on appeal is the same in that State as it is in
this Court, with the exception of the manner in which
summons and severance is had as to a non-joining party.
We have then, a construction of the effect of judgments
in that State-a construction that the relations of the
principal appellant and his surety to the judgment are
not joint but are severable; and that the relation of the
surety to the judgment is not absolute, as it appears on
the face of it to be, but is contingent only. The earlier
case of Thomas v. Wyatt, 17 Miss. 308, cited by appellee,
was overruled in Wilson v. Lexington, supra. To the same
effect: National Surety Co. v. LeFlore County, 262 Fed.
325; National Surety Co. v. Austin Machinery Co., 35 F.
(2d) 842, 845.
In Mississippi the common-law rule as to joint contracts has been abolished by statute, so that all liabilities,
by contracts, express or implied, including judgments, are
now several. J. B. White's Garage v. Boyd, 149 Miss.
383; Code, 1930, §§ 2027, 2028.
This is peculiarly so as to bonds on appeal; since all
appellants do not have to join in the appeal bond, and
judgment on appeal may be entered against the surety,
though his immediate principal be held not liable, if liability is adjudged against any of the other appellantsthus showing a complete severability of liability. Code,
1930, § 37; Wise v. Cobb, 135 Miss. 673.
A joint judgment, if we look to common-law definition,
is such that if either party pay it, he is entitled to contribution against the other; and in a judgment against one
as principal and another as surety, no contribution ever
exists. The principal, if he pays, can not recover anything from the surety; and the surety, if it pays, can
recover the entire amount from the principal.
Neither reason nor precedent supports the proposition
that where, under statute or the rules of court, judgment

is a necessary party to an appeal from that judgment,
where the appeal is solely on the merits of the controversy. The New York, 104 Fed. 561. See same case,
189 U. S. 363. Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Erie & W. Transp. Co.,
204 U. S. 220, 224; The Glide, 72 Fed. 200; Evans v.
Cheyenne Cement Stone Co., 20 Wyo. 188.
The judgment appealed from in Estis v. Trabue, 128
U. S. 225, was, as Judge Lurton points out (The New
York, supra), a judgment in a suit which was in substance a suit on the bond itself.
In Columbia River Packers Assn. v. McGowan, 217
Fed. 196, also, it is held that sureties on an injunction
bond need not be joined in an appeal from a judgment
in which they were included with their principal. Cf.
Hart v. Wiltse, 16 F. (2d) 838; Pease v. Rathburn-Jones
Engineering Co., 243 U. S. 273; Babbitt v. Shields, 101
U. S. 7.
A surety not interested in the controversy on the merits
can not appeal, though included in the judgment. Davis
v. Preston, 280 U. S. 406.
If, as is said in Ex parte Chetwood, 165 U. S. 443, 461,
"according to the practice in this Court, a: writ of error
[now appeal] has been treated rather as a continuation
of the original litigation than the commencement of a
new action," how can one whose function in the case is
not to conduct litigation, but merely to abide the result
of litigation, prosecute the appeal, or join in prosecuting
it or in shaping and controlling the litigation on appeal?
In the Glide case, 72 Fed. 200, it is said that the surety
need not be joined in the further appeal, because his interests are represented by his principal. In Clinchfield
Fuel Co. v. Titus, 226 Fed. 574, the court refused to dismiss the appeal for the non-joinder of certain persons, on

the ground that another person representative .of their
interest had been joined.
The surety's relation to the case and to the judgment
is analogous to that of a co-defendant against whom a
decree pro confesso or a default has been taken where
the other defendant defends. It is held that in appealing from such a judgment the defendant who litigated
need not join the defaulting co-defendants included in
the same judgment. Winters v. United States, 207 U. S.
564; Federal.IntermediateBank v. L'Herrisson,33 F. (2d)
841; Clarke v. Boysen, 39 F. (2d) 800, 820.
Even if the surety is a necessary or proper party, the
motion of the appellant to make it a party, to which the
surety has consented, should be granted. The Mary B.
Curtis, 250 Fed. 9; The Seguranca, 250 Fed. 19; The City
of Naples, 69 Fed. 794; Hart v. Wiltse, 16 F. (2d) 838;

Messrs. Gerard Brandon, S. B. Laub, and Garner W.
Green, with whom Messrs. L. T'. Kennedy, E. H. Ratcliff, Joseph E. Brown, and Marcellus Green were on the

There being a joint judgment, there is no jurisdiction
of an appeal by the Indenmity Company alone. Hardee

MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDs delivered the opinion of the
Court.
October 18, 1926, J. V. & R. T. Burkes agreed with the
Investment Company, owner of certain land in Natchez,
Mississippi, to construct a hotel thereon. The contract
contains the following clauses"Article 30. Guaranty Bond.-The Owner shall have
the right, prior to the signing of the contract, to require
the Contractor to furnish bond covering the faithful performance of the Contract and the payment of all obligations arising thereunder, in such form as the Owner may
prescribe with su'ch sureties as he may approve. If such
bond is required by instructions given previous to the
submission of bids, the premium shall be paid by the
Contractor; if subsequent thereto it shall be paid by
the Owner.

HARTFORD ACCIDENT CO. v. BUNN.

Opinion of the Court.

"Obligations of Bondsmen.-The Contractor's bondsmen shall obligate themselves to all the terms and covenants of these specifications, and of the contracts covering the work executed hereunder, and the Owner and
the Architect reserve the right to make all desired changes,
alterations, and additions, under the conditions and in
the manner hereinbefore described, without in any ineasure affecting the liability of the bondsmen or releasing
them from any of their obligations hereunder."
October 20, 1926, the Burkes gave a bond for $316,822.00, payable to the Investment Company, with appellant as surety. Among other things this provides"Whereas, the Principal and the Obligee have entered
into a certain written contract (hereinafter called the
contract) dated October 18th, 1926, To construct 'Eola
Hotel' building as per plans and specifications #640 as
prepared by Weiss & Dreyfus, Architects, New Orleans,
La., a copy of which is or may be attached hereto, and
is hereby referred to and made a part hereof. Now,
therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if
the principal shall indemnify the obligee against loss or
damage directly caused by the failure of the principal
faithfully to perform the contract, then this obligation
shall be null and void; otherwise it shall remain in force;
provided, however, this bond is executed by the surety,
upon the following express conditions, which shall be
precedent to the right of recovery hereunder. ...
" 11. No right of action shall accrue upon or by reason
hereof, to or for the use or benefit of any one other than
the obligee named herein; and the obligation of the
surety is and shall be construed strictly as one of suretyship only."
Payments to the contractors were made as required by
the building contract but they failed to satisfy claims for
material furnished by Bunn Electric Company and others.
The latter notified the Investment Company. There-

upon, it instituted a proceeding in the Chancery Court,
Adams County, Mississippi, against the contractors, the
appellant Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company,
and many unpaidi materialmen. The bill prayed for a
decree declaring the indemnity bond to be one for faithful
performance of the building contract and subject to the
rights and liabilities provided by § 3,* c. 128, Mississippi
Laws of 1918 (§ 2598, Hemingway's Miss. Code 1927);
also for judgments in favor of those who had furnished
materials, etc.
The lnaterialnen answered. Also by cross bill and interventions they set up their claims and asked for judgments against the contractors and appellant here, surety
upon the bond. The Chancellor gave judgments in favor
of the cross-complainants as prayed. The Indemnity
Company appealed. The Supreme Court approved, upon
the view that § 3, c. 128, Mississippi Laws 1918, applied
and controlled the obligation of the bond. [132 So. 535.]
It ordered that the materialnen severally "do have and

Indemnity Company, and of Aetna Casualty & Surety

Chapter 128, Mississippi Laws of 1918. "Sec. 3. That when any

person, firm or corporation guaranteeing the faithful pcrformance of
such contract and containing such provisions and penalties as the
parties thereto may insert therein, such bond shall also be subject to
the additional obligations that such contractor or subcontractor, shall
promptly make payments to all persons furnishing labor or material
under said contract; and in the event such bond does not contain any
such provisions for the payment of the claims of persons furnishing
labor or material under said contract, such bond shall nevertheless
'inure to the benefit of such person furnishing labor or material under
said contract, the same as if such stipulation had been incorporated
in said bond; . .."

Company, surety in the appeal bond," the sums found
to be due them.
Upon petition of the Hartford Accident & .Indemnity
Company alone, the Chief Justice of Mississippi allowed
an appeal to this Court, July 25, 1931. The Aetna Casualty & Surety Company did not join in the appeal; there
was no summons and severance nor any notice equivalent thereto.
The assignment of errors challenges the validity, under
the Federal Constitution, of § 3, c. 128, Mississippi Laws,
above cited, as construed and applied.
December 4, 1931, the appellees entered a motion here
to dismiss the appeal. They maintain that the judgments
in the Mississippi Supreme Court against appellant and
Aetna Casualty & Surety Company were joint; the latter
company did not join in the appeal; there was no summons and severance; consequently this Court is without

jurisdiction.
December 23, 1931, appellant and the Aetna Company
asked that the latter be made party to the appeal and
for proper amendments to that end.
The motion to amend must be overruled. The motion
to dismiss is sustained.
The challenged judgment became final June 15, 1931,
more than six months before the Aetna Company applied

here for permission to become a party to the pending
appeal. If this application and the accompanying motion
to amend were granted, the practical effect would be to
permit an appeal by a party to a judgment after the
prescribed time had expired.

The statute (Act of Feb. 13, 1925, c. 229, § 8, 43 Stat.
940; U. S. C. A. Title 28, § 350) provides-" No writ of
error, appeal, or writ of certiorari, intended to bring

therefor be duly nmade within three months after the entry

three months' period extinguished the right to grant an

Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co., 261 U. S. 399,

The judginent is join't in form and no reason appears
why either or both of the parties defendant therein might
not have appealed to this Court and submitted claims of
error for our determination. In matters of this kind we
may not disregard the face of the record and treat the
judgment as something other than it appears to be. So
to do probably would lead. to much confusion and
uncertainty.

case as presented, it is impossible to anticipate its ultimate disposition. It may be voluntarily discontinued,
or it may happen that the defeated party may amend
his pleading by supplying some discovered defect, and
go to trial upon new evidence. To determine whether,
in a particular case, this may or may not be done, might
involve an examination, not only of the record, but even
of the evidenee in the court of original jurisdiction, and
lead to inquiries with regard to the actual final disposition of the case by the Supreme Court, which it might
be difficult to answer. We. have, therefore, always made
the face of the judgment the test of its finality, and refused to inquire. whether, in case of a new trial, the defeated party would stand in a position to make a better
case. The plaintiffs in the case under consideration could
have secured an immediate review by this court, if the

court as a part of its judgment of reversal had ordered
the Circuit Court to dismiss their petition, when, under
Mower v. Fletcher [114 U. S. 127], they might have sued
out a writ of error at once."
Norfolk Turnpike Co. v. Virginia, 225 U. S. 264, 268,
269. The question was: To which state court should the
writ of error run? This Court said-" The difference between the cases, however, 'is not one of principle, but
solely depends upon the significance to be attributed to
the particular form in which the action of the court below
is manifested. In other words, the apparent want of
harmony between the rulings of this court has undoubtedly arisen from the varying forms in which state courts
have expressed 'their action in refusing to entertain an
appeal from or to allow a writ of error to a lower court
and the ever-present desire of this court to so shape its
action as to give effect to the decisions of the courts of
last resort of the several States on a subject peculiarly
within their final cognizance. A like want of harmony
resulted from similar conditions involved in determining
what was a final judgment of a state court susceptible
of being reviewed here, and the confusion which arose
ultimately led to the ruling that the face of the judgment
would be the criterion resorted to as the only available
means of obviating the great risk of confusion which
would inevitably arise from departing from the face of
the record and deducing the principle of finality by a consideration of questions beyond the face of the alleged
judgment or decree which was sought to be .reviewed.
The wisdom of that rule as applied to a question like the
one before us is, we think, appArent by the statement
which we have made concerning the rule in the Crovo
Case [220 U. S. 364, 366] and the previous decisions."

Masterson v. Herndon, 10 Wall, 416, 417, held-" It is
the established doctrine of this court that in cases at law,
where the judgment is joint, all the parties against whom
it is rendered must join in the writ of error; and in
chancery cases, all the parties against whom a joint decree is rendered must join in the appeal, or they will be
dismissed. There are two reasons for this: 1. That the
successful party may be at liberty to proceed in the enforcement of his judgment or decree against the parties
who do not desire to have it reviewed. 2. That the appellate tribunal shall not be required to decide a second
or third time the same question on the same record.
. . . One of the effects of this judgment of severance
was to bar the party who refused to proceed, from prosecuting the same right in another action, .as the defendant could not be harassed by two separate actions on a
joint obligation, or on account of the same cause of
action, it being joint in its nature."
In Estis v. Trabue; 128 U. S. 225, an attachment was
levied upon certain personalty. After the return, Estis,
Doan & Co. claimed the property, and they gave a forthcoming bond with two sureties. The challenged judgment ruled " that the plaintiffs recover of the claimants
and C. F. Robinson and John W. Dillard, their sureties in
their forthcoming bond, the sum of six thousand and
three hundred dollars, together with the costs, etc." This
Court held [p. 229]-" The judgment is distinctly one
against 'the claimants, and C. F. Robinson and John W.
Dillard, their sureties in their forthcoming bond,' jointly,
for a definite sum of money. There is nothing distributive in the judgment, so that it can be regarded as containing a separate judgment against the claimants and
another separate judgment against the sureties, or as containing a judgment against the sureties payable and en-

forceable only on a failure to recover the amount.from the
claimants; and execution is awarded against all of the
parties jointly. In such a case the sureties have the right
to a writ of error. Ex parte Sawyer, 21 Wall. 235, 240.
It is well settled that all the parties against whom a judgment of this kind is entered must join in a writ of error,
if any one of them takes out such writ; or else there must
be a proper summons and severance, in order to allow of
the prosecution of the writ by any less than the whole
number of the defendants against whom the judgment is
entered."
Mason v. United States, 136 U. S. 581. A postmaster
and the sureties on his official bond were sued jointly.
He and some of the sureties appeared and defended. The
suit was abated as to two of the sureties, who had died.
The others defaulted, and judgment of default went
against them. On the trial there was a verdict for the
plaintiff, whereupon, July 14, 1886, judgment was entered against the principal and all the sureties. The
sureties who had appeared sued out a writ of error to
this judgment, without joining the principal or the sureties who had made default, and the record came here.
May 5, 1890, and after expiration of the two years within
which the statute then permitted the suing out of such
writs, the plaintiff in error moved to amend the writ by
adding the omitted parties as complainants, or for a severance of the parties, and it was held that the motion
must be denied and the writ of error be dismissed.
Hardee v. Wilson, 146 U. S. 179, 180, cited earlier cases
and declared-" Undoubtedly the general rule is that all
the parties- defendant, where the decree is a joint one,
must join in the appeal." See also Davis v. Mercantile
Trust Co., 152 U. S. 590; Garcia v. Vela, 216 U. S. 598,
601; Hughes' Federal Practice, § 6153.

or that it must appear that those who have not joined

error, and refused or neglected to join therein." But, it
ruled that, though joint in form, the decree was separable
in law and fact and, therefore, the surety was not a necessary party to the appeal.
