HEINER, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE,

v. DONNAN ET AL.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 514.

Argued February 26, 1932.-Decided March 21, 1932.

1. The second sentence of § 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926,

which creates a conclusive presumption that gifts made within two
years prior to the death of the donor were made in contemplation of death, requiring the value of such gifts to be included in
computing the value of the estate of the decedent subject to the
graduated death transfer tax, and thus burdening the estate beneficiaries because of acts bearing no relation to the estate or to death
as the generating cause of its transfer, violates the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270
U. S. 230; Hoeper v. Tax Commission, 284 U. S. 206. P. 322.
2. A statute which imposes a tax upon an assumption of fact which
the taxpayer is forbidden to controvert is so arbitrary and unreasonable that it can not stand under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 230. P. 325.
3. The restraint imposed upon legislation by the due process clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment is the
same P. 326.
4. The claimed necessity of preventing frauds and evasions of the
death transfer tax can not justify the otherwise unconstitutional
exaction imposed by the statute; the constitutional rights of the
individual are superior to this supposed necessity. P. 328.
5. The conclusive presumption created by the statute is invalid
whether it be treated as a rule of evidence or of substantive law.
Id.
6. Section 302 (c) can not be sustained as imposing a gift tax, (1)
because the intent of Congress to enact the provision as an incident of the death tax is unmistakable; and (2) as a gift tax it would
be arbitrary and capricious in violation of the due process clause
of the Fifth Amendment. P. 330.

HEINER v. DONNAN.
312

Argument for Heiner.

Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom Solicitor General Thacher, and Messrs. Claude R. Branch,
Sewall Key, A. H. Conner, and Erwin N. Griswold were
on the brief, for Heiner, Collector.
Section 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 is a necessary and proper exercise of the power of Congress to lay
and collect taxes, and in the judgment of Congress was
the only way in which the evasion of estate taxes could
be prevented.
The difficulty of determining whether a particular transfer was or was not made in contemplation of death is
apparent. The question depends largely on the intent of
the donor. United States v. Wells, 283 U. S. 102, 117.
Proving a person's state of mind is almost always a natter of difficulty, and this is especially true when the person
is dead. Furthermore, the motives which prompt persons
to make gifts are exceedingly complex, and a man may
easily lead himself to believe that he makes a gift solely
for some purpose to be served during his lifetime, although
the fact is that his motive is mixed and that lie would
not have made it had there been no estate tax in force.
The difficulties are clearly illustrated by the fact that, up
to the time of the committee report on this provision, tlhe
Government failed to establish that the transfer in question was made in contemplation of death, in every reported case on the subject.
To prevent such evasions, Congress, ii 1924, adopted
the gift tax (§§ 319-324 of the Revenue Act of 1924;
U. S. C., Title 26, §§ 1131-1136), upheld in Bromley v.
McCaughn, 280 U. S. 124. The reports of the committees
and the debates in Congress show that the gift tax in itself
was not expected to produce large revenue, but was intended to supplement the estate tax and make the latter
effective. But the gift tax proved to be exceedingly difficult to administer and enforce; it resulted in inequalities,
the revenue which it produced was small, and its provi-

sions were easily eva(led. For these reasons it was repealed by § 324 of the Revenue Act of 1926. As a. substitute for the gift tax and the rebuttable presumption as to
transfers made within two years of death, Congress
enacted the provision under consideration.
It is obvious that no estate tax can be effective without
some means for taxing such transfers inter vivos as are
made to evade the tax imposed at death. Fourteen of the
States had found it necessary to adopt similar safeguards
for their succession taxes, and it can not be said that there
was no basis for this widespread conviction. See Purity
Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226 TU. S. 192, 205; Silz v. Hesterberg, 211 U. S. 31, 40.
Considered as creating a conclusive presumption, the
statute establishes a rule of substantive law and not a mere
rule of evidence. Such statutes have been upheld in
many cases. See: Hawkins v. Bleakly, 243 U. S. 210;
Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, 172 U. S. 557; Hawker v. New
York, 170 U. S. 189, 195; Jones v. Brim, 165 U. S. 180,
1S3; Street v. Farmers' Elevator Co., 34 S. 1. 523; Conrad
v. Smith, 6 N. D. 337, 342, 343; State v. District Court,
139 1\Iinn. 409, 411; State v. Lapointe, 81 N. H. 227;
Matter of Buchanan, 184 App. Div. 237. Cf. Mobile, J.
& K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U. S. 35.
The creation of a conclusive presumption is " after all
but an illustration of the power to classify." Jones v.
Brim, 165 U. S. 1SO, 183.
Congress has power to levy a, tax upon testamentary
transfers as well as upon transfers inter vivos. The inclusion of transfers of the kind here involved is not forbidden merely because they do not technically pass at
the decedent's death as a part of his estate. United
States v. Wells, 283 U. S. 102; Milliken v. United States,
283 U. S. 15; Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U. S.
339; Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S. 497.

H EINER v. DONNAN.
312

Argument for Heiner.

So, the sole constitutional objection must be based
upon the proposition tlvt the classification is so arbitrary
and unreasonable as to offend against the general language of the due process clause.
The statute is entirely prospective in operation. The
decedent was fully informed that the value of the transfer would be included in his gross estate should his death
occur within two years thereafter. See Milliken v. United
States, 283 U. S. 15, 23-24; Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, 172
U. S.557.
The means by which a law may be avoided or defeated
is a proper basis for classification. St. John v. New York,
201 U. S.633; District of Columbia v. Brooke, 214 U. S.
138, 150; Shevlin-Carpenter Co. v. Minnesota, 218 U. S.
57, 69; Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S.497, 505; Milliken v. United States, 283 U. S.15, 20.
The only objection that can be raised to the classification is that it may include transfers which were made
without intent to evade the estate tax. But the inclusion within the tax of some gifts which in fact were not
made to evade the estate tax is not an insuperable objection. This Court has frequently upheld statutes that
included innocent articles or activities within the proscribed class, because their inclusion was necessary in
order effectively to accomplish the purpose to which the
law was directed. Powell v. Pennsylvania,127 U. S.678;
Jones v. Brim, 165 U. S. 180; Hawker v. New York, 170
U. S.189, 195; Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S.606; Silz v. Hesterberg, 211 U. S.31; Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226

lowley, 272 U. S. 581. Cf. United States v. Doremus, 249
U. S. 86, 94. A provision may be valid as a necessary
adjunct to a matter that lies within the legislative power,
even though standing alone its constitutionality might
have been subject to doubt. Milliken v. United States,
283 U. S. 15, 20; Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S. 497,
505; Corliss v. Bowers, 281 U. S. 376, 378; Taft v. Bowers,
278 U. S. 470, 482. Cf. Fawcus Machine Co. v. United
States, 282 U. S. 375. And it has been held that it is permniss.ble incidentally to include in the measure of an excise
tax property exempt from taxation. Flint v. Stone Tracy
Co., 220 U. S. 107; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward,
282 U. S. 379.
So-called "conclusive presumptions," which are in
reality rules of substantive law, are found in the common
law and have for many years been included in statutes.
See Allen v. United States, 150 U. S. 551, 558; Holland
v. State, 161 Ga. 492; Callananv. Hurley, 93 U. S. 387,
390, 392; Webb v. Den, 17 How. 576; Chicago v. Sturges,

56, reversed, 13 F. (2d) 702; Farringtonv. Commissioner,
30 F. (2d) 915.
There is no basis for an objection to the classification on
the ground that the operation of the act is limited to
transfers made within two years of death. Such a result
is inherent in any classification. See King v. Mullins,
171 U. S. 404; Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago, 228
U. S. 61; United States v. Wells, 283 U. S. 102, 117. It is
enough if the classification is reasonably founded in the
purposes and policies of taxation. Watson v. Comptroller,

Argument for Donnan.

The case is not controlled by Schlesinger v. Wisconsin,
270 U. S. 230; the difference between the equal protection
clause in the Fourteenth Amendment and the due process
clause in the Fifth is indicated in Lalelle Iron Works v.
United States, 256 U. S. 377, 392. See also Flint v. Stone
Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 161.
The extremely long period embraced in the Wisconsin
statute undoubtedly influenced the Court. Cf. United
States v. Wells, 283 U. S. 102, 117. There is an adequate
basis for including recent transfers and excluding others
more remote. Klein v. Board of Supervisors, 282 U. S.
19, 23.
The Schlesinger case did not repudiate the principle
that Congress may include all that is reasonably necessary to carry its powers into execution. Another difference is that the Wisconsin statute levied an excise upon
the privilege of receiving property 3y succession.
Mr. William G. Heiner for Donnan et al., Executors.
The case is ruled by Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S.
230; Uihlein v. Wisconsin, 273 U. S. 642; Tax Commission v. Robinson's Executor, 28 S. W. (2d) 491.
The pro vision in question has been declared unconstitutional by three other district courts, two circuit courts
of appeals and the Board of Tax Appeals in the cases of
Hall v. White, 48 F. (2d) 1060, affirmed, 53 F. (2d) 210;

Whenever the question was squarely raised and decided, no court has ever held valid a conclusive presumption of fact. United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128; Manley v. Georgia, 279 U. S. 1; Stuart v. Palmer, 74 N. Y.

An estate tax cannot be laid merely upon complete and
irrevocable gifts made within two years of the donor's
death, because there is no transfer as "at death," and
consequently no theory at all upon which to base such
a tax.
The legislature may not lay an income tax based upon
a fiction which is contrary to the fact. Hoeper v. Tax
Commission, 284 U. S. 206.
The reasonableness of the length of any given period
is immaterial to the question here involved. The decision
in the Schlesinger case did not rest upon the unreasonable-

ness of a six year period but upon the disregard for actuali-.
ties and the discrimination between like gifts made at
different times.
If the conclusive presumption here involved be declared valid by this Court, upon what ground shall this
Court hereafter reject another conclusive presumption?
It is submitted that there is no middle course for this
Court to follow.
It is respectfully urged that this Court disaffirm the
type of legislation which provides for fiction instead of
fact, unless there exists a national emergency.
The collector also urges that the rebuttable presumption is ineffective. Yet the federal courts and the Board
of Tax Appeals, to say nothing of unreported cases in the
Bureau of Internal Revenue, have effectively enforced
the rebuttable presumption under prior revenue acts in
many cases, in which the gifts were held to have been
made in contemplation of death.
The provision in question also violates the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment, in that it denies equal
protection of the laws. This Court has repeatedly held
that, where there is no reasonable ground for selecting
particular individuals or corporations, or classes, a legislative enactment directed against them amounts to a denial
of due process of law as far as their property is concerned.
Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466.
There is no adequate basis for selecting non-testamentary gifts made within two or six years of death and taxing them and exempting like gifts made beyond such
periods. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 230; Louisville Gas & Elec. Co. v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32.
In determining the validity of classification, the practical operation and effect of the legislation must be considered. Quaker City Cab Co. v. Penvsylvania, 277 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This case is here on a certificate from the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On March 1, 1927,
John W. Donnan, by complete and irrevocable gift inter
vivos, transferred without consideration certain securities
to trustees for his four children, and also, without consideration, advanced a sum of money to his son. He died
on December 23, 1928, less than two years after the gifts
and advancement were made. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue included in the gross estate of decedent
the value of the property transferred, and imposed a
death transfer tax accordingly, on authority of the clause
ir § 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat.
9,70 (U. S. C., Sup. V, Title 26, § 1094), which, without
regard to the fact, provides that such a transfer inade
within two years prior to the death of the decedent shall
"be deemed and held to have been made in contemplation
of death within the meaning of this title.' '"
*"Sec. 302.

The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall

;be determined by including the value at the time of his death of
all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situ-

ated"(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent
has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at
or after his death, except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate

HEINER v. DONNAN.
312

Opinion of the Court

The executors paid the tax, and, after rejection of a
claim for refund, brought this action in the federal district court for the western district of Pennsylvania to
recover the amount of the tax attributable to the inclusion of the property in question by the commissioner.
The trial court found that neither the transfer in trust
nor the advancement was made in contemplation of death.
Judgment was rendered in favor of the executors on the
ground that the foregoing provision of § 302 (c) was unconstitutional as contravening the due process clause of
the Fifth Amendment, and void as being repugnant to
other sections of the act. 48 F. (2d) 1058. An appeal
was taken, and the circuit court of appeals has certified
to this court two questions of law upon which instruction
is desired:
"1. Does the second sentence of section 302 (c) of the
revenue act of 1926 violate the due process clause of the
fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States?
"2. If the answer to the first question be in the negative, is the second sentence of section 302 (c) of the revenue act of 1926 void because repugnant to sections 1111,
1113 (a), 1117, and 1122 (c) of the same act?"
and full consideration in money or nioney's worth. Where within
two years prior to his death but after the enactment of this Act and
without such a consideration the decedent has made a transfer or
transfers by trust or otherwise, of any of his property, or an interest
therein, not admitted or shown to have been made in contemplation
of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after
his death, and the value or aggregate value, at the time of such
death, of the property or interest so transferred to any one person
is in excess of $5,000, then, to the extent of such excess, such transfer
or transfers shall be deemed and held to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title. Any transfer of
a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition
or distribution thereof made by the decedent within two years prior
to his death but prior to the enactment of this Act, without such consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have
been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this
title."
137818°-32-21

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

285U.S.

A negative answer to the first question, if made, must
rest either upon the ground that Congress has the constitutional power to deny to the representatives of the estate
of a decedent the right to show by competent evidence
that a gift made within two years prior to the death of
the decedent was in fact not made in contemplation of
death; or upon the theory that, although the tax in question is imposed as a death transfer tax, it nevertheless
may be sustained as a gift tax.
First. Section 301 of the Revenue Act of 1926 imposes
a t x "upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent," etc. There can be no doubt as to the meaning of
this language. The thing taxed is the transmission of
property fromri the dead to the living. It does not include
pure gifts inter vivos. The tax rests, in essence, "upon
the principle that death is the generating source from
which the particular taxing power takes its being and that
it is the power to transmit, or the transmission from the
dead to the living, on which such taxes are more immediately rested. - . . it is the power to transmit or the transmission or receipt of property by death which is the subject levied upon by all death duties." Knowlton v. Moore,
178 U. S. 41, 56, 57. The value of property transferred
without consideration and in contemplation of death is
included in the value of the gross estate of the decedent
for the purposes of a death tax, because the transfer is
considered to be testamentary in effect. Milliken v.
United States, 283 U. S. 15, 23. But such a transfer, not
so made, embodies a transaction begun and completed
wholly by and between the living, taxable as a gift (Bromley v. McCaughn, 280 U. S. 124), but obviously not subject to any form of death duty, since it bears no relation
whatever to death. The "generating source " of such a
gift is to be found in the facts of life and not in the circumstance of death. And the death afterward of the
donor in no way changes the situation; that is to say, the

HEINER v. DONNAN.
312

.323

Opinion of the Court.

death does not result in a shifting, or in the completion of
a shifting, to the donee of any economic benefit of property, which is the subject of a death tax, Chase Nat. Bank
v. United States, 278 U. S. 327, 338; Reinecke v. Northern
Trust Co., 278 U. S. 339, 346; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall,
276 U. S. 260, 271; nor does the death in such case bring
into being, or ripen for the donee or anyone else, so far
as the gift is concerned, any property right or interest
which can be the subject of any form of death tax. Compare Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S. 497, 503. Complete
ownership of the gift, together with all its incidents, has
passed during the life of both donor and donee, and no
interest of any kind remains to pass to one or cease in
the other in consequence of the death which happens
afterward.
The phrase "in contemplation of or intended to take
effect . . • at or after his death," found in the provisions
of § 302 (c) of the act of 1926 and prior acts, as applied
to fully executed gifts inter vivos, puts them in the same
category for purposes of taxation with gifts causa rnortis.
In this light, the meaning and purpose of the provision
were considered, in a iecent decision of this court dealing
with the Revenue Act of 1918. United States v. Wells,
283 U. S. 102, 116-117, 118:
"The dominant purpose is to reach substitutes for
testamentary dispositions and thus to prevent the evasion
of the estate tax. Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531,
542; Milliken v. United States, ante, p. 15. As the transfer may otherwise have all the indicia of a valid gift inter
vivos, the differentiating factor must be found in the
transferor's motive. Death must be ' contemplated,' that
is, the motive which induces the transfer must be of the
sort which leads to testamentary disposition. As a condition of body or mind that naturally gives rise to the
feeling that death is near, that the donor is about to
reach the moment of inevitable surrender of ownership,

324

Opinion of the Court

285U.S.

is most likely to prompt such a disposition to those who
are deemed to be the proper objects of his bounty, the
evidence of the existence or non-existence of such a condition at the time of the gift is obviously of great importance in determining whether it is made in contemplation
of death. The natural and reasonable inference which
may be drawn from the fact that but a short period intervenes between the transfer and death, is recognized by
the statutory provision creating a presumption in the case
of gifts within two years prior to death. But this presumption, by the statute before us, [Act of 1918] is expressly stated to be a rebuttable one, and the mere fact
that death ensues even shortly after the gift does not determine absolutely that it is in contemplation of death.
The question, necessarily, is as to the state of mind of the
donor.
"If it is the thought of death, as a controlling motive
prompting the disposition of property, that affordIs the
test, it follows that the statute does not enibrace gifts
inter vivos which spring from a different motive. Such
transfers were made the subject of a distict gift tax,
since repealed."
There is no doubt of the power of Congress to provide for including in the gross estate of a decedent, for
purposes of the death tax, the value of gifts made in contemplation of death; and likewise no doubt of the power
of that body to create a rebuttable presumption that gifts
made within a period of two years prior to death are
made in contemplation thereof. But the presumption
here created is not of that kind. It is made definitely
conclusive-incapable of being overcome by proof of the
most positive character. Thus stated, the first question
submitted is answered in the affirmative by Schlesinger v.

284 U. S. 206. The only difference between the present

Opinion of the Court.

case and the Schlesinger case is that there the statute fixed
a period of six years as limiting the application of the
presumption, while here it is fixed at two; and there the
Fourteenth Amendment was involved, while here it is
the Fifth Amendment. The length of time was not a
factor in the case. The presumption was held invalid
upon the ground that the statute made it conclusive
without regard to actualities, while like gifts at other
times were not thus treated; and that there was no adequate basis for such a distinction. "The presumption
and consequent taxation," the court said (p. 240), "are
defended upon the theory that, exercising judgment and
discretion, the legislature found them necessary in order
to prevent evasion of inheritance taxes. That is to say,
'A' may be required to submit to an exactment forbidden by the Constitution if this seems necessary in order
to enable the State readily to collect lawful charges
against 'B.' Rights guaranteed by the federal Constitu-tion are not to be so lightly treated; they are superior
to this supposed necessity. The State is forbidden to
deny due process of law or the equal protection of the
laws for any purpose whatsoever."
The Schlesinger case has since been applied many times
by the lower federal courts, by the Board of Tax Appeals,
and by state courts; * and none of them seem to have
been at any loss to understand the basis of the decision,
namely, that a statute which imposes a tax upon an
assumption of fact which the taxpayer is forbidden to
controvert, is so arbitrary and unreasonable that it cannot stand under the Fourteenth Amendment.
* See for example, Hall v. White, 48 F. (2d) 1060; Donnan v.
Heiner, 48 F. (2d) 1058 (the present case); Guinzburg v. Anderson,

Nor is it material that the Fourteenth Amendment was
involved in the Schlesinger case, instead of the Fifth
Amendment, as here. The restraint imposed upon legislation by the due process clauses of the two amendments
is the same. Coolidge v. Long, 282 U. S. 582, 596. That
a federal statute passed under the taxing power may be
so arbitrary and capricious as to cause it to fall before the
due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment is
settled. Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, 542; Brushaber v. Union Pac. R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 24-25; Tyler v.
United States, supra, p. 504.
In Hoeper v. Tax Commission, supra, this court had
before it for consideration a statute of Wisconsin which
provided that in computing the amount of income taxes
payable by persons residing together as members of a
family, the income of the wife should be added to that of
the husband and assessed to and payable by him. We
held that, since in law arid in fact the wife's income was
her separate -property, the state was. without power to
measure his tax in part by the income of his wife. At
page 215 we said:
"We have no doubt that, because of the fundamental
conceptions which underlie our system, any attempt by
a state to measure the tax on one person's property or income by i'eference to the property or income of another is
contrary to due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. That which is not in fact the taxpayer's income cannot be made such by calling it income.
Compare Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, 540."
The suggestion of the state court that the provision
was valid as necessary to prevent frauds and evasions of
the tax by married persons was definitely rejected on the
ground that such claimed necessity could not justify an
otherwise unconstitutional exaction.
In substance and effect, the situation presented in the
Hoeper case is the same as that presented here. In the

HEINER v. DONNAN.
312

Opinion of the Court.

first place, the tax, in part, is laid in respect of property
shown not to have been transferred in contemplation of
death and the complete title to which had passed to the
donee during the lifetime of the donor; and secondly, the
tax is not laid upon the transfer of the gift or in respect of
its value. It is laid upon the transfer, and calculated upon
the value, of the estate of the decedent, such value being
enhanced by the fictitious inclusion of the gift, and the estate made liable for a tax computed upon that value.
Moreover, under the statute the value of the gift when
made is to be ignored, and its value arbitrarily fixed as of
the date of the donor's death. The result is that upon
those who succeed to the decedent's estate there is imposed
the burden of a tax, measured in part by property which
comprises no portion of the estate, to which the estate is in
no way related, and from which the estate derives no benefit of any description. Plainly, this is to measure the tax
on A's property by imputing to it in part the value of the
property of B, a result which both the Schlesinger and
Hoeper cases condemn as arbitrary -and a denial of due
process of law. Such an exaction is not taxation but.
spoliation. " It is not taxation that government should
take from one the profits and gains of another. That is
taxation which compels one to pay for the support of the
government from his own gains and of his own property."
United States v. RailroadCo., 17 Wall. 322, 326.
The presumption here excludes consideration of every
fact and circumstance tending to show the real motive of
the donor. The young man in abounding health, bereft
of life by a stroke of lightning within two years after
making a gift, is conclusively presumed to have acted
under the inducement of the thought of death, equally
with the old and ailing who already stands in the shadow
of the inevitable end. And although the tax explicitly
is based upon the circumstance that the thought of death
must be the impelling cause of the transfer (United

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

285U.S,

States v. Wells, supra, p. 118), the presumption, nevertheless, precludes the ascertainment of the truth in respect of that requisite upon which the liability is made
to rest, with the result, in the present case and in many
others, of putting upon an estate the burden of a tax
measured in part by the value of property never owned
by the estate or in the remotest degree connected with
the death which brought it into existence. Such a statute
is more arbitrary and less defensible against attack than
one imposing arbitrarily retroactive taxes, which this
court has decided to be in clear violation of the Fifth
Amendment. As said by Judge Learned Hand in Frew
v. Bowers, 12 F. (2d) 625, 630, " Such a law is far more
capricious than merely retroactive taxes. Those do
indeed impose unexpected burdens, but at least they distribute them in accordance with the taxpayer's wealth.
But this section distributes them in accordance with
another's wealth; that is a far more grievous injustice."
To sustain the validity of this irrebuttable presumption it is argued, with apparent conviction, that under the
prima facie presumption originally in force there had
been a loss of revenue, and decisions holding that particular gifts were not made in contemplation of death are
cited. This is very near to saying that the individual,
innocent of evasion, may be stripped of his constitutional
rights in order to further a more thorough enforcement
of the tax against the guilty-a new and startling doctrine, condemned by. its mere statement and distinctly
repudiated by this court in the Schlesinger (p. 240) and
Hoeper (p. 217) cases involving similar situations. Both
emphatically declared that such rights were superior to
this supposed necessity.
The government makes the point that the conclusive
presumption created by the statute is a, rule of substantive law, and, regarded as such, should be upheld; and
decisions tending to support that view are cited. The

HEINER v. DONNAN.
312

Opinion of the Court.

earlier revenue acts created a prima facie presumption,
which was made irrebuttable by the later act of 1926. A
rebuttable presumption clearly is a rule of evidence which
has the effect of shifting the burden of proof, Mobile,
J. & K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U. S. 35, 43; and it
is hard to see how a statutory rebuttable presumption is
turned from a rule of evidence into a rule of substantive
law as the result of a later statute making it conclusive.
In both cases it is a substitute -for proof; in the one open
to challenge and disproof, and in the other conclusive.
However, whether the latter presumption be treated as
a rule of evidence or of substantive law, it constitutes an
attempt, by legislative fiat, to enact into existence a fact
which here does not, and cannot be made to, exist in
actuality, and the result is the same, unless we are ready
to overrule the Schlesinger case, as we are not; for that
case dealt with a conclusive presumption and the court
held it invalid without regard to the question of its technical characterization. This court has held more than
once that a statute creating a presumption which operates
to deny a fair opportunity to rebut it violates the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. For example, Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U. S. 219, 238, et seq.; Manley v. Georgia, 279 U. S. 1, 5-6. "It is apparent," this
court said in the Bailey case (p. 239) "that a constitutional prohibition cannot be transgressed indirectly by
the creation of a statutory presumption any more than
it can be violated by direct enactment. The power to
create presumptions is not a means of escape from constitutional restrictions."
If a legislative body is without power to enact as a
rule of evidence a statute denying a litigant the right to
prove the facts of his case, certainly the power cannot
be made to emerge by putting the enactment in the guise
of a rule of substantive law.

285U.S.

Second. The provision in question cannot be sustained
as imposing a gift tax, (1) because the intent of Congress to enact the provision as an incident of the death
tax and not as a gift tax is unmistakable; and (2) because, if construed as imposing a gift tax, it is in that
aspect still so arbitrary and capricious as to cause it to
fall within the ban of the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment.
1. The intent of Congress to include gifts made in contemplation of death as integral parts of the decedent's
estate for the purposes of the death tax only is so clear as,
reasonably, to preclude argument to the contrary. In
United States v. Wells, supra, this court held, as already
shown, that since it is the thought of death, as a, controlling motive prompting the gift, that affords the test
whether it is made in contemplation of death, " it follows
that the statute does not embrace gifts inter vivos which
spring from a different motive. Such transfers were made
the subject of a, distinct gift tax, since repealed." And
see Reineche v. Trust Co., supra, at p. 347. It is significant that the repeal of the gift tax referred to was made
by the same act (c. 27, § 1200 (a), 44 Stat. 9, 125), which
contains the provision here in question. The tax is
imposed upon the transfer of the net estate, but it is first
necessary to ascertain the value of the gross estate, and
the statute provides that this is to be determined by including, among other things, the value of any interest in
property of which the decedent has at any time made a
transfer in contemplation of his death. The statute re.quires that this value shall be determined as of the time
of the decedent's death, without regard to the value of the
gift when received. The event upon which the tax is
made to depend is not the transfer of the gift, but the
transfer of the estate of the decedent. The tax falls
upon the estate and not upon the gift, and is computed
not upon the value of the gift, but, by progressively

HEINER v. DONNAN.
312

Opinion of the Court,.

graduated percentages, upon the value of the entire estate.
It is so apparent from a consideration of these features
of the statute that Congress could not have had, even
remotely, in mind the imposition of a.gift tax, that to construe the provision in question as imposing such a tax
is to disregard the plain language and the plain intent of
the act. For this court to do so would be to enact a law
under the pretense of construing one and thus pronounce
itself guilty of a flagrant perversion of the judicial power.
2. But if we assume, contrary to what is reasonable,
that a gift tax is imposed by providing that the value
of property transferred withlut consideration by a decedent within two years prior to his death shall be
included in the value of the gross estate, the case for the
government is no better. In the Schlesinger case, the
Supreme Court of Wisconsin had expressly held that the
tax could not be supported as one on gifts inter vivos
only, saying, " Under su(c!h taxation the classification is
wholly arbitrary and void. We perceive no more reason
why such gifts inter vivos should be taxed than gifts
made within six years of marriage or any other event.
It is because only one class of gifts closely connected with
and a part of the inheritance tax law is created that the
law becomes valid." Estate of Schlesinger, 184 Wis. 1,
10; 199 N. W. 951. This court accepted that view in
these words (p. 239): " The court below declared that
a tax on gifts inter vivos only could not be so laid as
to hit those made within six years of the donor's death
and exempt all others-this would be 'wholly arbitrary.'
We agree with this view and are of opinion that such a
classification would be in plain conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment." And it follows that the present
provision, written in almost identical terms, is in plain
conflict with the Fifth Amendment.' The provisions of
the statute referred to in the preceding paragraph of this
opinion necessarily condition the tax, however it be char-

acterized. If it be a gift tax, it, nevertheless, is based,
not upon the transfer of the gift, but upon the transfer of
the estate; and upon the Value of the estate, and not
that of the gift. Obviously these are bases having no
relation whatever to the gift. Moreover, the value of
the gift is not to be determined as of the time when
made, but, considered as a part of the estate, is to be
fixed as of the date of the decedent's death-a condition
so obviously arbitrary and capricious as, by itself, to condemn the tax, viewed as a gift tax, as violative of due
process. It is to .be paid by the beneficiaries of the
decedent, although it is impossible for them to share in
the gift which has passed beyond recall. It. is, therefore,
a contribution to the government exacted of one person,
based pro tanto upon the wealth of another.
Considered as a gift tax, these conditions demonstrate
the entire lack of relation between the taxpayer and the
transfer which is the subject of the tax. They disclose
that there is no rational ground for measuring the tax,
considered as a gift tax and not as a death tax, by the
value of an estate coming into being after the gift has
become complete and irrevocable, and of which the gift
comprises no part. And they show that to impose liability for the tax, as a gift tax, upon the estate, as they
in terms require, is, in effect, to exact tribute from the
gains or property of one measured by the gains or property of another.
The first question must be answered in the affirmative
and this makes it unnecessary to answer the second.
It is so ordered.

valid, and that the certified questions in both cases should
be answered in the negative.
The present federal estate tax, enacted in 1916, Title
II of the Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 777, has
been continued in each successive Revenue Act. Although levied upon the privilege of transferring property
passing at death and imposed on the estates of decedents,
the prescribed tax was not limited to such transfers. By
§ 202 (b) and (c) of the 1916 Act it was extended to gifts
inter vivos, made in contemplation of death, and to gifts
of property upon joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety,
the benefit of which inured to the surviving tenant upon
the death of the donor. Both classes of gifts were taxed
as a part of the decedent's estate at the rates prescribed
by the estate tax. The obvious purpose of these provisions was to prevent or compensate for the withdrawal
of property by gifts inter vivos from the operation of the
estate tax. The 1918 Revenue Act, § 402 (c) and (f),
c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1097, included in the donor's estate,
subject to the estate tax, all gifts effected by any trust
taking effect in possession or enjoyment at the time of
the donor's death, and the proceeds in excess of $40,000
of life insurance purchased by the decedent in his lifetime
and payable to named beneficiaries at his death.
As a further measure for preventing avoidance of the
tax by gifts inter vivos, Congress, in 1924, adopted the
gift tax, §§ 319-324 of the Revenue Act of that year, c.
234, 43 Stat. 253, 313-316. That it was adopted as a
measure to prevent avoidance of the estate tax sufficiently
appears from the fact that the graduated rates and exemptions of the tax were the same as in the case of testamentary transfers, §§ 301 (a), 319, 303 (a) (4), 321 (a)
(1), 1 and from the fact that in the Revenue Act of 1§26

the retroactive reductions in rates of the estate tax were
extended to the rates of the gift tax. §§ 301, 324, Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 69, 86. Provisions were
also made for crediting the gift tax against the estate tax
where the amount of the gift was later required to be
included in the decedent's gross estate. § 322, Revenue
Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 316; § 404, Revenue Act of 1928,
c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 863.
Because of inequalities and inconvenience, expense and
other difficulties in its operation and administration, the
gift tax was repealed by § 1200 of the Revenue Act of
1926, 44 Stat. 125; 2 and as a result of ten years' experience in the administration of the estate tax and particularly of the provision taxing gifts in contemplation of
death, the present provision of § 302 (c) of the Revenue
Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 70, was added, which operates to
impose the tax on all gifts made within two years of
death, regardless of the purpose or motive of the donor.
The Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives, in its report recommending this legislation
(House Report No. 1, 69th Congress, 1st Sess., p. 15),
pointed out that the tax on gifts in contemplation of
death had been ineffective in its practical administration,
with a great loss of revenue to the Government in consequence, and that "the difficulty of enforcement will be
even more serious in view of the repeal of the gift tax."
It stated, without qualification, that the amendment was
one imposing the tax on all gifts made within two years
of death, and said that " the inclusion of this provision
will prevent most of the evasion and is. the only way in
which it can be prevented."
See Senate Report No. 52, 69th Congress, 1st Sess., p. 9.
This consideration seems also to have motivated the corresponding English legislation. In 1881 England adopted a statute, 44 Viet.
e. 12, § 38 (2) (a), which included gifts inter vivos, made within

STONE,

J., dissenting.

As we are concerned here only with the power of Congress to tax such gifts, I shall take no time in discussing
the particular form of language by which Congress has
sought to accomplish its .purpose. In this statute taxing
gifts inter vivos, as though they were legacies, it can be
of no consequence whether the enactment says that all
gifts within two years of death of the donor are irrebuttably presumed to be in contemplation of death or
whether more directly it imposes the tax on all gifts made
within two years of the donor's death. In either case,
we are concerned only with the power which, here, the
legislative body has indisputabily sought to exert, and
not with the particular choice of words by which it has
expressed that purpose.
The question, reduced to its simplest terms, is whether
Congress possesses the power to supplement an estate tax,
and protect the revenue derived from it, as wis its
declared purpose, by a tax on all gifts inter vivos, made
within two years of the death of the donor, at the same
rate and in the same manner as though the gift were
made at death. I think it has.
At the outset it is to be borne in mind that gifts inter
vivos are not immune from federal taxation. Whatever
doubts may formerly have been entertained, it is now
settled that the national Government may tax all gifts
duties. The three months was increased to one year, in 1889, 52
Viet. c. 7, § 11 (1), and to three years in 1910, 10 Edw. VII, c. 8,
§ 59 (1), the last provision remaining in force, except in some particular circumstances not now necessary to mention, until the present

time.
The brief for the Government in No. 514, Appendix B, lists fourteen
states which, prior to the enactment of the present statute in'1926,
had found it necessary or expedient to adopt similar legislation; the
state statutes subjected to inheritance taxation gifts made within
periods ranging from one to six years of the donor's death. See

inter vivos and at rates comparable to those which may
be imposed on gifts at death. Bromley v. McCaughn,
280 U. S. 124. That the present gifts were inter vivos,
made in the lifetime of the donors and effected as are any
other dispositions of property passing from the donors
independently of death, is not in dispute. The question
then is, not whether they may be taxed, but, more narrowly, whether the Congressional selection of some such
gifts-those made within two years of death-and their
taxation as though made at death, as an adjunct to the
estate tax, is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount
to a taking of property without due process of law, prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.
That question was not answered by Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 230. If it had been, this case, could and
doubtless would be-disposed of per curian on the authority of that one. This case comes to us after ten years
of experience in the administration of the estate tax, an
experience which was not available, or at least not presented, in the Schlesinger case. There, all gifts made
within six years of death were taxed. Here, only those
within two years of death are within the statute. There,
the tax was a succession tax and so was a burden on the
right to receive, Leach v. Nichols, ante, p. 165, and necessarily payable by the donee, but at rates and valuations
prevailing at the time of the donor's death. Here, the
tax was upon the transfer effected by the donor's gift
after the enactment of the statute, and is payable from
the donor's estate at the same rates and values as though
it had passed at his death. It burdens the estate of the
donor before distribution, exactly as does the estate tax.
New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345; Leach v.
Nichols, supra. In the Schlesinger case, the Court declared (p. 240) that the gifts were "subjected to graduated taxes which could not properly be laid on all gifts
or, indeed, upon any gift without testamentary character."

And in stating the argunment presented and rejected there,
the Court said (p.240):
" The presumption and consequent taxation are defended upon the theory that, exercising judgment and
discretion, the legislature found them necessary in order
to prevent evasion of inheritance taxes. That is to say
'A' may be required to submit to an exactment forbidden

Here, a, graduated tax imposed by Congress on gifts
inter vivos is not forbidden, Bromley v. McCaughn, supra,
and the case is not one where A's property is taxed to
enable the Government to collect lawful charges against
B. Here A's gift, which may be lawfhlly taxed, is in this
instance, taxed because it removes property from the
operation of another tax, which, but for the gift, would
be applied to the property at A's death. Concededly
there is nothing in the Federal Constitution or laws which
necessarily precludes taxation of gifts at the same rate
and value as if they had passed at the donor's death,
rather than at the rate and value prevailing. at the time
of the gift. The tax upheld in Bromley v. McCaughn,
supra, taxed all gifts inter vivos at the same rates and
with the same exemptions as in the case of testamentary
transfers. In Milliken v. United States, 283 U. S. 15, 20,
a selected class of gifts inter viVOs, which were not testamentary although made in contemplation of death, were
so taxed as a part of the donor's estate. See Phillips v.
Dime Trust & Safe Deposit Co., 284 IT.S.160. In Tyler
v. United States, 281 U. S.497, we upheld taxation, as a
part of the donor's estate, of another selected class of
gifts inter vivos, estates by the entirety donate by one
spouse for the benefit of both, although the gift was not
testamentary and neither title, possession, no. enjoyment,
passed at death. Similar -taxation of gifts made inlter

in Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U. S. 339, and
Chase National Bank v. United States, 278 U. S. 327; see
Taft v. Bowers, 278 U. S. 470, 482.
In the Schlesinger case the classification of the gifts
selected for taxation under the state statute was deemed
to be so arbitrary as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbids state legislation denying equal protection of the laws. Here, we are concerned only with
the Fifth Amendment. As was said by this Court in
LaBelle Iron Works v. United States, 256 U. S. 377, 392:
"The Fifth Amendment has no equal protection clause;
and the only rule of uniformity prescribed with respect
to duties, imposts and excises laid by Congress is the
territorial uniformity required by Art. I, § 8 ...
The difficulty of adjusting any system of taxation so as
to render it precisely equal in its bearing is proverbial,
and such nicety is not even required of the States under
the equal protection clause, much less of Congress under
the more general requirement of due process of law in
taxation." See Treat v. White, 181 U. S. 264, 269; Flint
v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 158; Barclay & Co. v.
Edwards, 267 U. S. 442, 450.
No tax has been held invalid under the Fifth Amendment because based on an improper classification, and it is
significant that in the entire one hundred and forty years
of its history, the only taxes held condemned by the Fifth
Amendment were those deemed to be arbitrarily retroactive. See Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531; Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S. 440; Coolidge v. Long, 282
U. S. 582.
It is, I think, plain, then, that this tax cannot rightly
be held unconstitutional on its face. These gifts inter
vivos, not being immune from taxation, and the obvious
and permissible purpose of the present and related sections being to protect the revenue derived from the tax-

ation of estates,4 want of due process in taxing them can
arise only because the selection of this class of gifts within
two years of death, for taxation at the prescribed rates,
is so remote from the permissible policy of taxing transfers at death or so unrelated to it as to be palpably
arbitrary and unreasonable.
It is evident that the practice of disposing of property
by gift inter vivos, if generally adopted, would, regardless of the age or motive of the donor, defeat or seriously
impair the operation of the estate tax, and that the practice would be encouraged if such gifts, made shortly before
the death of the donor, were left -free of any form of
taxation. That in itself would be a legitimate ground
for taxing all gifts at the same rates as legacies, as was
done by the gift tax; but since the object is to protect
the revenue to be derived from the estate tax, the Government is not bound to tax every gift without regard
to its relation to the end sought or the convenience and
expense of the Government in levying and collecting it.
It may aim at the evil where it exists and select for taxation that class of gifts which experience has shown tends
most to, defeat the estate tax. This Court has held
explicitly that the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the selection of subjects for one form of taxation for
the very reason that they may not be readily or effectively
reached by another tax which it is the legislative policy
to maintain. Watson v. State Comptroller, 254 U. S.
122, 124, 125. And since the imposition of the one tax
is induced by the purpose to compensate for the loss of
the other, the effect in accomplishing this result may itself
be the basis of the selection of subjects of taxation. St.

v. Brooke, 214 U. S. 138, 150; Shevlin-Carpenter Co. v.
Minnesota, 218 U. S. 57, 69.
That being the object here, it is not imperative that
the motive of the donor be made the exclusive basis of
the selection of these gifts for taxation, as in the case of
gifts made in contemplation of death. The fact that such
gifts, made shortly before death, regardless of motive,
chiefly contribute to the withdrawal of property from
operation of the estate tax, is enough to support the selection, even though they are not conscious evasions of the
estate tax, and opprobrious epithets can not certainly be
applied to them. The opinion of the Court does not
deny that Congress has power to select, on this basis, certain gifts to be taxed as estates are taxed. In fact, this
Court has recently held that Congress does possess that
power and has said so in language completely applicable
to the present tax. In Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S.
497, 505, the tax on estates by the entirety, as a part of
the decedent's estate passing to the surviving spouse, was
upheld regardless of the motive which inspired it, and the
decision was rested on the sole and only possible ground
that " the evident and legitimate aim of Congress was to
prevent an avoidance in whole or in part, of the estate
tax by this method of disposition during the lifetime of the spouse who owned the property, or whose
separate funds had been used to procure it; and the provision under review is an adjunct of the general scheme
of taxation of which it is a part entirely appropriate as
a means to that end." See also Reinecke v. Northern
Trust Co., 278 U. S. 339; Taft v. Bowers, 278 U. S. 470,
482.
The gifts taxed may, in some instances, as thb present
opinion states, bear no relation whatever to death, except
that all are near death. But that all do have an intimate
and vital relation to the policy of taxing the estates of
decedents at death, cannot be gainsaid, for what would

otherwise be taxed is, by the gift, withdrawn from the
operation of the taxing act, and the revenue derived from
the taxation of estates necessarily impaired, unless the act
which impairs it, the giving away of property inter vivos,
is itself taxed. It cannot be said generally that gifts made
near the time of death do not have a greater tendency
to defeat the estate tax than gifts made at periods remote
from it, both because of the greater number and amounts
of the former and because such gifts more certainly withdraw the property from the operation of the estate tax
than do the earlier and relatively infrequent gifts of
property which may be lost or destroyed before the
donor's death. Gifts of amounts in excess of $5,000 to
one donee in any one year, which alone are taxed, are
usually made from substantial fortunes which, in the
generality of cases, are accumulated relatively late in life,
and the great bulk of which, if not given away in life,
would pass at death. Nor can it be denied that the cost
and inconvenience of collecting the tax on earlier, generally smaller, and less frequent gifts, which led to the
repeal of the gift tax, may not themselves require or
justify a distinction between them and gifts made nearer
to the time of death.
Since Congress has power to make the selection if the
facts warrant, we cannot say a priori that such factj do
not exist or that in making the selection which it did,
Congress acted arbitrarily or without the exercise of the
judgment or discretion which rightfully belong to it.
Stebbins v. Riley, 268 U. S. 137, 143. As was said in
Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 270, it is but a proper
"... respect due to the wisdom, the integrity, and
the patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law
is passed, to presume in favour of its validity, until its
violation of the constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt."

The existence of facts underlying constitutionality is
always to be presumed, and the burden is always on him
who assails the selection of a class for taxation to establish that there could be no reasonable basis for the legislative judgment in making it.5
But even if that presumption is not to be indulged, in
passing on the power of Congress to impose this tax, we
cannot rightly disregard the nature of the difficulties
involved in the effective administration of a scheme for
taxing transfers at death, and we cannot close our eyes
to those perhaps less apparent, which have been disclosed
by the experience with this form of taxation in the
United States, which led to the enactment of the present
statute.
It is evident that the estate tax, if not supplemented
by an effective provision taxing gifts tending to defeat it,
would, to a considerable extent, fail of its purpose. The
tax on gifts made in contemplation of death, devised for
this purpose, has been upheld by this Court, Milliken v.
United States, 283 U. S. 15, but the difficulties of its
successful administration have become apparent. The
donor of property which would otherwise be subject to
heavy taxes at his death does not usually disclose his
purpose in making the gift, even if he does not conceal it.
He may not, and often does not, analyse his motives or
determine for himself whether his dominating purpose is
to substitute the gift for a testamentary disposition which
would subject it to the tax, see Milliken v. United States,
supra, p. 23; United States v. Wells, 283 U. S. 102, or

whether it is so combined with other motives as to preclude its taxation, even though in making it the donor
cannot be unaware that he, like others, must die and that
his donation will, in the natural course of events, escape
the tax which will be imposed on his other property passing at death. See United States v. Wells, supra. The
difficulty of searching the motives and purposes of one
who is dead, the proofs of which, so far as they survive,
are in the control of his personal representatives, need
not be elaborated. As the event has proved, the difficulties of establishing the requisite mental state of the
deceased donor has rendered the tax on gifts in contemplation of death a weak and ineffective means of compensating for the drain on the revenue by the withdrawal of
vast amounts of property from the operation of the estate
tax.
The Government has been involved in 102 cases arising
under § 202 (b) of the 1916 Revenue Act and its successors.0

This number does not include any of the cases

arising under § 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, the
statute under present consideration. And it includes only
those cases, decision of which was determined by the
answer made to the question of fact, whether a gift had
been made in contemplation of death.
In 20 cases involving gifts of approximately $4,250,000,
the Government was successful.' In 3 it was partially

The value of the gifts so made was approximately $3,000,000, exclusive
of certain realty and personalty, the value of which was not definitely
indicated in the reports. Among this group of cases was one in which
the gift was $880,100, made when the donor was advised by his

In the remaining 22 cases the
gifts were made more than two years before the death of
the donor.-The judgment of the Ways and Means Committee that
the provision of § 302 (c) of the 1926 Act was required
to stop the drain on the revenues from the estate tax,
is strikingly confirmed by these 56 cases. The value of
the gifts in those cases alone, was $113,401,157, a total
that does not include realty and personalty of undetermined value or the very large gifts on which the Government, in the case already noted, sought to collect a tax
of more than $1,000,000.
In many of the cases, notably those in which large
amounts were involved, the gift was substantially all the

of the gifts to the estate of the donor would place the
tax on the gifts in the higher brackets, so that the total
amount of the tax that might have been collected is much
larger than the tax that would have been payable on the
gifts considered separately from the estates of which they
had been part. It is also fairly inferable that the cases
actually litigated constitute only a small portion of the
instances in which large gift's were made within two years
of the donor's death.
These are but a.few of the many details of the administration of the Act supporting the conclusion of Congressional committees that large amounts of money and
property were being withdrawn from the operation of
the estate tax by gifts inter vivos under circumstances
which clearly indicated that but for the gifts all would
have been taxed as a part of the donor's estates, and that
by far the greater number and amount of such gifts had
been made within two years. of death by persons of
advanced age.
The present tax, if objectionable, is not so because
motive or intention of the donor is not made the basis of
the classification. It is not so because it does not tend
to prevent or compensate for the evil aimed at. It is not
so because the revenue leak will not be effectively stopped
by including in the estate tax all gifts made within two
years of death. Legislation to accomplish that end, and
reasonably adapted to it, cannot be summarily dismissed
as being arbitrary and capricious. Nor can it be deemed
invalid on the assumption that Congress has acted arbitrarily in drawing the line between all gifts made within
two years of death and those made before. Congress cannot be held rigidly to a choice between taxing all gifts
or taxing none, regardless of the practical necessities of
preventing tax avoidance, and regardless of experience
and practical convenience and expense in administering
the tax. Even the equal protection clause of the Four-

teenth Amendment has not been deemed to impose any
such inflexible rule of taxation.
The very power to classify involves the power to recognize and distinguish differences in degree between those
things which are near and those which are remote from
the object aimed at. Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller,
229 U. S. 322; see Miller v. Wilson, 236 U. S. 373, 384.
It has never occurred to anyone to suggest that a state
could not, by statute, fix the age of consent, or the age
of competence to make a will or conveyance, although
some included within the class selected as competent
might be less competent than some who are excluded.
In the exercise of the police power, classification may be
based on mere numbers or amounts where the distinction
between the class appropriately subject to classification
and that not chosen for regulation, is one of degree. 3
As all taxes must be levied by general rules, there is a
still larger scope for legislative action in framing revenue
laws, even under the Fourteenth Amendment, with its
guarantee of equal protection of the laws. The legislature may grant exemptions. Magoun v. Illinois Trust

degree produce differences in kind.25
The purpose here being admittedly to impose a tax on
a privilege-that of making gifts inter vivos-to the extent that its exercise substantially impairs the operation
of the tax on estates,, it was for Congress to say how
far that impairment extends and how far it is necessary
to go in the taxation of gifts either to prevent or to
compensate for it. Unless the line it draws is so wide
of the mark as palpably to have no relation to the end
sought, it is not for the judicial power to reject it and
substitute another, or to say that no line may be drawn.

285 U. S.

The objection that the gifts are taxed as a part of the
donor's estate, and at the same rates and on values as of
the donor's death, has no more force than that made to
the selection for taxation of gifts made within two years
of death. Since the basis of the tax is that it compensates
for the drain on the estate tax, and since it is paid by the
donor's estate, which would otherwise be compelled to pay
the estate tax on transmission at death, the whole object
of the tax on the gifts would be defeated if levied fon
another basis. In determining the reasonableness o a
tax which, like this one, is levied in i:eu of another, it is
of course necessary to consider all the statutes affecting
the subject matter. Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett,
276 U. S. 245; Farmers & Mechanics Savings Bank v.
Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516, 529. Where the very purpose
and justification of the one tax is that it is compensatory
for the loss of the other, it is no objection that the one is
made the exact equivalent of the other, thus avoiding
inequality which, under some circumstances, might be objectionable. See General American Tank Car Corp. v.
Day, 270 U. S. 367. No one has yet indicated precisely
in what way this method of measuring the tax works any
greater injustice or hardship than the tax on estates. It
is certainly not greater where, as here, the tax is paid from
the estate of the donor who, regardless of his age, in giving
away this property after the statute was in force, took his
chances that death within two years would bring it into
his estate for taxation where it would have been if the
gift had not been made. See Milliken v. United States,
supra, pp. 23, 24. A very different case would be presented if the taxed gift were made before the enactment
of the taxing statute and many years before the death,
as in Frew v. Bowers, 1 F. (2d) 625, 630.6 See Nichols
In this case the Government sought to collect the tax on a trust
created before the estate tax was passed, and twelve years before

v. Coolidge, supra. The application of the estate tax to
the other types of gift inter vivos mentioned in the Act
has uniformly been upheld, even though the gift was made
more than two years before death. Milliken v. United
States, supra; Phillips v. Dime Trust and Safe Deposit
Co., supra; Tyler v. United States, supra; Reinecke v.
Northern Trust Co., supra; Taft v. Bowers, supra.
I cannot say that the tax on all gifts made in contemplation of death, supplemented by that imposed on all
others made within two years of death, is not adapted to
a legitimate legislative object. The history of the litigation over gifts made in contemplation of death, to which
reference has been made, and the reports of Congressional
Committees prepared after extensive investigation and
with expert aid, plainly indicate that it is. I can 'find no
adequate reason for saying that the tax is invalid> The
denial of its validity seems to me to rest on no substantial
ground and to be itself an arbitrary and unreasonable
restriction of the sovereign power of the Federal Government to tax, for which neither the words of the Fifth
Amendment nor any judicial interpretation of it affords
justification.
The questions should be answered in the negative.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS joins in this opinion.
the settlor's death.

Judge Learned Hand, concurring, said, p. 630:

"As to transfers made after the law went into effect, I have nothing

to say; one may insist that settlors take their chances. But as to
those made before the law was passed it appears that the result is
too whimsical to stand. There are settlements which the settlor

outlives for 30 or 40 years."
