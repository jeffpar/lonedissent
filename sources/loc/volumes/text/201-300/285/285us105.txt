PACKER CORPORATION' v. UTAH.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF UTAH.

No. 357.

Argued January 20, 1932.-Decided February 23, 1932.

A statute of Utah forbids the hdvertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products on billboards, street car signs, and placards, but does
not apply to advertising in newspapers and periodicals, this exemption having been introduced to avoid conflict with the commerce
clause of the Federal Constitution as construed by the State's highest court. A billboard company was convicted for displaying a
poster advertising a brand of cigarettes. Both poster and cigarettes
were manufactured outside of the State and shipped into it by a foreign corporation; and the advertising was done under contract with
an agency in another State. It was conceded that the regulation
of the local sale and advertising of tobacco products was within the
police power of the State. Held:
1. The amendment exempting advertising in newspapers and periodicals to avoid conflict with the commerce clause, did not produce a discrimination violative of the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. P. 108.
2. It is a reasonable ground of classification that the State has
power to legislate with respect to persons Jn. certain situations and
not with respect to those in a different one: P. 110.
3. The discrimination between billboard and newspaper advertising was not an arbitrary classification. The legislature may recognize degrees of evil and adapt its legislation accordingly. Id.

4. In making it illegal to carry out the contract under which the
advertising was being done, the statute does not violate the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since the subject of
the legislation was within the police power of the State. P. 111.
5. In preventing the display, for intrastate advertising, of posters
shipped in from another State, the statute does not impose an
unreasonable restraint upon interstate commerce. Id.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Section 2, of c. 145, Laws of Utah, 1921, as amended
by c. 52, § 2, Laws of 1923, and c. 92, Laws of 1929,
provides:
"It shall be a misdemeanor for any person, company,
or corporation, to display on any bill board, street car
sign, street car, placard, or on any other object or place
of display, any advertisement of cigarettes, cigarette papers, cigars, chewing tobacco, or smoking tobacco, or any
disguise or substitute of either, except that a dealer in
cigarettes, cigarette papers, tobacco or cigars or their
substitutes, may have a sign on the front of his place of
business stating that he is a dealer in such articles, provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit
the advertising of cigarettes, cigarette papers, chewing
tobacco, smoking tobacco, or any disguise or substitute
of either in any newspaper, magazine, or periodical
printed or circulating in the State of Utah."
The Packer Corporation, a Delaware corporation engaged in billboard advertising and authorized to do business in Utah, was prosecuted under this statute for displaying a large poster advertising Chesterfield cigarettes
on a billboard owned by it and located in Salt Lake City.
The poster was displayed pursuant to a general contract
for advertising Chesterfield cigarettes, made by the defendant with an advertising agency in the State of Ohio.
Both the poster and the cigarettes advertised were manufactured without the State of Utah and were shipped into

it by Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, a foreign corporation. The defendant claimed that the statute violates several provisions of the Federal Constitution; the
objections were overruled; and the defendant was convicted and sentenced. On the authority of its recent
decision in State v. Packer Corp., 297 Pac. 1013, the
highest court of the State affirmed the judgment of the
trial court. 2 P. (2d) 114. The case is here on appeal
under § 237 (a) of the Judicial Code, as amended by the
Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 937.
It is not denied that the State may, under the police
power, regulate the busin :zs of selling tobacco products,
compare Gundling:v. Chicaje, 177 U. S. 183, 188; Austin
v. Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343, 348; and the advertising connected therewith, compare Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis
Co., 240 U. S. 342, 364, 365; Tanner v. Little, 240 U. S.
369, 384, 385. The claim is that because of its peculiar
provisions the statute violates the Federal Constitution.
First. The contention mainly urged is that the statute
violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment; that in discriminating between the display
by appellant of tobacco advertisements upon billboards
and the display by others of such advertisements in newspapers, magazines or periodicals, it makes an arbitrary
classification. The history of the legislation shows that
the charge is unfounded. In Utah no one may sell cigarettes or cigarette papers without a license.' Since 1890,
it has been the persistent policy, first of the Territory
and then of the State, to prevent the use of tobacco by
minors, and to discourage its use by adults. Giving tobacco to a minor, as well as selling it, is a misdemeanor.2
Laws of Utah, 1921, c. 145, § 1, as amended, Laws of 1923, c. 52,
§ 1; Laws of 1925, c. 68; Laws of 1930, c. 5, § 1.

Laws of 1930, c. 5, § I (k).

Opinion of the Court.

So is permitting a minor to frequent any place of business while in the act of using tobacco in any form. Mere
4
possession of tobacco by the minor is made a crime.
And smoking by anyone in any enclosed public place (except a public smoking room designated as such by a conspicuous sign at or near the entrance) is a misdemeanor5
In 1921, the legislature enacted a general prohibition of
the sale or giving away .of cigarettes or cigarette papers
to any person, and of their advertisement in any form.
Laws of Utah, 1921, c. 145, §§ 1, 2. After two years,
however, the plan of absolute prohibition of sale was
abandoned in favor of a license system. Laws of Utah,
1923, c. 52, § 1. But the provision against advertisements
was retained, broadened to include tobacco in most other
forms. In 1926, this statute was held void under the coinmerce clause, as applied to an advertisement of cigarettes
manufactured in another State, inserted in a Utah newspaper which circulated in other States. State v. Salt
Lake Tribune Publishing Co., 68 Utah 187; 249 Pac. 474.
Thereupon the legislature, unwilling to abandon altogether its declared policy, amended the law by striking out
the provision which prohibited advertising in newspapers
and periodicals. The classification alleged to be arbitrary
was made in order to comply with the requirement of the
Federal Constitution as interpreted and applied by the
highest court of the State. Action by a State taken to
observe one prohibition of the Constitution does not entail the violation of another. J. E. Raley & Bros. v.
Richardson, 264 U. S. 157, 160; Des Moines Nat. Bank v.
Fairweather, 263 U. S. 103, 116, 117. Compare Dolley

v. Abilene Nat. Bank, 179. Fed. 461, 463, 464. It is a
reasonable ground of classification that the State has
power to legislate with respect to persons in certain situations and not with respect to those in a different one.'
Compare Williams v. Walsh, 222 U. S. 415, 420.
Moreover, as the state court has shown, there is a difference which justifies the classification between display
advertising and that in periodicals or newspapers: "Billboards, street car signs, and placards and such are in a
class by themselves. They are wholly intrastate, and the
restrictions apply without discrimination to all in the
same class. Advertisements of this sort are constantly
before the eyes of observers on the streets and in street
cars to be seen without the exercise of choice or volition
on their part. Other forms of advertising are ordinarily
seen as a matter of choice on the part of the observer.
The young people as well as the adults have the message
of the billboard thrust upon them by all the arts and
devices that skill can produce. In the case of newspapers
and magazines, there must be some seeking by the one
who is to see and read the *dvertisement. The radio can
b turned off, but not so the billboard or street car placard. These distinctions clearly place this kind of advertisement in a position to be classified so that regulations
or prohibitions may be imposed upon all within the class.
This is impossible with respect to newspapers and magazines." 297 Pac. 1013, 1019. The legislature may recognize degrees of evil and adapt its legislation accordingly.
6

A contention was made in argument that the State had not in
fact acted upon this basis of classification since the statute .makes no
distinction as to newspapers and magazines circulating solely in intrastate commerce. But the record does not indicate the existence of
any such publications. Moreover, the administrative difficulties of
any effort to make the applicability of the statute depend upon the
character of the circulation of a particular newspaper or magazine
would be such as to justify the exclusion of the entire class.

Opinion of the Court.

Miller v. Wilson, 236 U. S. 373, 384; Truax v. Raich, 239
U. S. 33, 43.
Second. The defendant contends that to make it illegal to carry out the contract under which the advertisement was displayed takes its property without due process of law because it arbitrarily curtails liberty of contract. The contention is without merit. The law deals
confessedly with a subject within the scope of the police
power. No facts are brought to our attention which
establish either that the evil aimed at does not exist or
that the statutory remedy is inappropriate. O'Gorman
& Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., 282 U. S. 251,
257; Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v.
Glidden Co., 284 U. S. 151.
Third. The defendant contends also that the statute
imposes an unreasonable restraint upon interstate commerce because it prevents the display on billboards of
posters shipped from another State. It does not appear
from the record that the defendant is the owner of the
posters. Its interest is merely in its billboards located
in the State, upon which it displays advertisements for
which it is paid. So far as the posters are concerned, assuming them to be articles of commerce, compare Charles
A. Ramsay Co. v. Associated Bill Posters, 260 U. S.501,
511, the statute is aimed, not at their importation, but at
their use when affixed to billboards permanently located
in the State. Compare Browning v. Waycross, 233 U. S.
16, 22, 23; General Railway Signal Co. v. Virginia, 246
U. S. 500, 510. The prohibition is non-discriminatory,
applying regardless of the origin of the poster. Its operation is wholly intrastate, beginning after the interstate
movement of the poster has ceased. Compare Hygrade
Provision Co. v. Sherman, 266 U. S. 497, 503; Hebe Co.
v. Shaw, 248 U. S.297, 304. See also Corn Products Refining Co. v. Eddy, 249 U. S. 427, 433, To sustain the

defendant's contention would be to hold that the posters,
because of their origin, were entitled to permanent immunity from the exercise of state regulatory power. The
Federal Constitution does not so require. Compare Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Commission, 236 U. S. 230,
240, 241. So far as the articles advertised are concerned,
the solicitation of the advertisements, it may be assumed,
is directed toward intrastate sales. Compare Di Santo v.
Pennsylvania,273 U. S. 34. Whatever may be the limitations upon the power of the State to regulate solicitation
and advertisement incident to an exclusively interstate
business, the commerce clause interposes no barrier to its
effective control of advertising essentially local. Compare
Jell-O Co. v. Landes, 20 F. (2d) 120, 121; International
Text-Book Co. v. District of Columbia, 35 App. D. C.

CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

Argued January 12, 1932.-Decided February 23, 1932.

A fire insurance policy contained a warranty exempting the insurer
from liability for loss occurring while the hazard was increased by
any mcans " within the control or knowledge of the insured," and
another warranty exempting the insurer if loss occurred while
there were kept on the premises certain prohibited articles,. including gasoline. A rider altered this prohibition to the extent of permitting gasoline to be kept and used for the purpose of bottling
automobile oils "or for other mercantile purposes not more hazardous." Fire occurred during occupancy by a tenant engaged in the
illegal manufacture of intoxicating liquor who kept on the premises
a large quantity of gasoline for use in that connection. Held:
1. A determination of the hazard involved was essential to maintaining the defense under either warranty, P. 116.
