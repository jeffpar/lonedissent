duced evidence in support of the charge and that the
defendant admitted the introduction of the liquors "as
charged in the indictment." The natural import of this
is that the liquors were introduced into the Flathead
Indian Reservation. In this situation the reference to the
town of Polson cannot be regarded as a factor in the case.
But, as bearing upon the possible status of the lands
occupied by. the town, see Perrin v. United States, ante,
p. 478; Act of June 21, 1906, c. 3504, § 17, 34 Stat.

As no real question of the District Court's jurisdiction
is involved, nor any constitutional or treaty question,
there is no basis for the direct writ of error. The Judicial

Writ of error dismissed.

CHICAGO, ROCK ISLAND & PACIFIC RAILWAY
COMPANY v. CRAMER.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IOWA.
No. 156.

Submitted January 16, 1914.-Decided February 24, 1914.

The Hepburn Act of 1906, amending the Interstate Commerce Act,
established a uniform rule of liability of carriers for loss on interstate shipments which superseded all state laws upon the subject.
In enforcing liability of the carrier for interstate shipments the provisions in the regularly filed tariff enter into and form part of the

contract of shipment, and if that tariff offers two rates based on
value and the shipper declares the lower value so as to avail of the'
lower rate, the carrier may avail of the lower value so declared.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

In this case the liability of the interstate carrier on an interstate shipment from Iowa was limited to the declared value notwithstanding
§ 2074, Iowa Code, prohibited such a defense.
153 Iowa, 103, reversed.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the Carmack Amendment to the Hepburn Act and its effect on
state statutes, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. M. L. Bell and Mr. F. C. Dillard for plaintiff in
error:
The provisions of § 20 of the act of February 4, 1887, as
amended by the act of June 29, 1906, constitute an
exclusive regulation of contracts for interstate shipments
by railroad common carriers, superseding all state regulations upon the same subject. C., B. & Q. Ry. v. Miller,
226 U. S. 513; Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, 226 U. S.
491; C., St. P. &c. Ry. v. Latta, 226 U. S. 519.
The liability imposed by said amended § 20, is the
liability imposed by the common law upon a common
carrier, and may be limited or qualified by special contract
with the shipper, provided the limitation or qualification
is reasonable and does not exempt from loss due to negligence.
This is the law with reference to contracts for interstate
shipments. M., K. & T. Ry. v. Harriman,227 U. S. 567,
672. A carrier is permitted by fair and reasonable agreement to limit the amount recoverable in case of loss, to an
agreed value made in order to obtain the lower of two
rates. Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger,226 U. S. 491, 509.
In the present case, defendant in error agreed with the
plaintiff in error, in order to get the lower of two rates,
that in case of loss settlement was to be made on the
agreed value of $10.00 per head for each hog. Kansas City
Southern v. Carl, 227 U. S. 639, 652.
An agreed valuation regulation determining a rate is,

when filed and published according to law, in effect a
part of the act of Congress. Its reasonableness is not
open to question in this action.
A carrier is required by law to publish its rates and any
rules or regulations which in any wise effect or determine
said rates. After being so published, the carrier cannot
deviate therefrom, even in the slightest particular. They
stand as the law, binding as well upon the shipper as the
carrier. L. & N. Ry. v. Motley, 219 U. S. 467; Tex. & Pac.
Ry. v. Abilene Co., 204 U. S. 426; Armour v. United States,
209 U. S. 56; Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Mugg, 202 U. S. 242;
Poor Grain-Co. v. C., B. & Q. Ry., 12 I. C. C. 492, 546;
Blinn v. Southern Pacific Ry., 18 I. C. C. 430.
There was no appearance or brief filed for defendant
in error.
MR. JUSTICE LAMAR

delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff Cramer, sued the Railroad Company
to recover $992 the amount of damage to a car-load of
60 hogs shipped from Galt, Iowa, to Chicago, Illinois.
The Company defended on the ground that the plaintiff overloaded the car and placed therein such an excessive
quantity of hay as to overheat the animals, thereby
damaging some and causing the death of others. It
further contended that no agent of the Company had any
knowledge as to the value of the hogs, except what was
stated by the shipper, who represented that their value
did not exceed $10 per head and thereby secured the
benefit of the lower of two rates specified in the tariff on
file with the Interstate Commerce Commission and at
Galt. One of these rates applied where the value of the
hogs did not exceed $10 per head, and the other, a higher
rate, applied where the value exceeded $10 per head. The
defendant claimed that the tariffs were binding on plain-

Opinion of the Court.

tiff and that he could not, in any event, recover beyond
the valuation on which the freight was charged. This
latter defense was stricken out on demurrer and the trial
resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for more
than $600. On writ of error the Supreme Court affirmed
the judgment and sustained the order striking out the
plea on the ground that such defense was prohibited by
§ 2074 of the Iowa Code, which provides that:
"No contract, receipt, rule or regulation shall exempt
any railway corporation engaged in transporting persons or
property from the liability of a common carrier, or carriers
of passengers, which would exist had no contract, receipt,
rule or regulation been made or entered into."
In Chicago &c. Ry. v. Solan, 16'9 U. S. 133, decided in
January, 1898, it was held that this statute was valid even

as applied to interstate shipments. But on June 29, 1906,
Congress passed the Hepburn Act, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584,
which established in interstate commerce a uniform rule

of liability. That rule of liability is to be enforced in the
light of the fact that the provisions of the tariff enter into
and form a part of the contract of shipment, and if a
regularly filed tariff offers two rates, based on value,
and the goods are forwarded at the low value in order to
secure the low rate, then the carrier may avail itself of
that valuation when sued for loss or damage to the property. The question has been so fully considered in cases

determined since the decision herein of the Supreme Court
of Iowa, that it is unnecessary to do more than refer to
Kansas Southern Ry. v. Carl, 227 U. S.639, 645; Missouri

&c. Ry. v. Harriman,227 U. S.657, where the facts were
substantially like those here involved and where it was
held that a carrier had the right to make a defense like
that filed in the court below. As it was error to strike the
plea, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
