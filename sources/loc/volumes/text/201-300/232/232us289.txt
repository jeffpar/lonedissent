delivered the opinion of the

court.
These two cases are controlled by the two cases between
the same parties just decided. In the case which is here
on error, the suit was brought by the United States to
recover the amount of the tax which became due upon
the yacht Vanadis, on the first day of September, 1910,
under the act of August 5, 1909, which was under consideration in the previous cases. The complaint, leaving aside
some additional averments which it is unnecessary to
refer to, was the same as the one. in the cases already
passed upon, and this is true also of the answer. The case

by stipulation was submitted to the court without a jury
and the steps essential to save all the questions in the case
were properly taken. The use of the vessel during the
taxing period was shown. There was a judgment in favor
of the United States for the amount of the tax, but against
it for interest and error was prosecuted from the Circuit
Court of Appeals to review that subject and such case
is here on certificate. Taking jurisdiction of both cases
and treating them as one, as was done in the previous
cases, and applying the conclusions in those cases expressed,
to this, it results that the judgment below must be modified, so far as the interest is concerned, by allowing the
claim of the United States in that respect, and in other
respects it must be affirmed.
And it is so ordered.
