dence that at least was sufficient to go to the jury.

It is

doubtful whether there was substantial contradiction respecting any of these facts; but this we need not consider.
From what has been said, it follows that the state
courts erred in holding that the Federal act had no application. As the case stands, we are not called upon to deter-

mine the validity of the several contentions that were
raised by defendant at the trial on the strength of that
act, nor to pass upon the mode in which they were raised.
Upon these matters, therefore, we express no opinion.
Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further

proceedingsnot inconsistentwith this opinion.

Court of Appeals as to other questions decided against it, which
court has certified that question to this court, and the record is in

Under § 37 of the Tariff Act of August, 1909, imposing a tax on the
use of foreign-built yachts owned or chartered for more than six
months by citizens of the United States, to be collected annually on
September 1, the tax became due on the first day of September next
occurring after the act became effective; further held that the six
months' clause relates only to the chartering of the yachts, and the
word "annually" indicates continuity and that the tax is not a
sporadic one to cease after a single payment.
Where words are used in a statute in their every-day sense and not in a
technical one, they should be so construed.
The use of a foreign-built yacht which renders the owner subject to the
tax imposed by § 37 of the Tariff Act of 1909 is active and actual
use and not the potential use arising from the mere fact of ownership.
See Pierce v. United States, p. 290, post.
The fact that a tax statute operates retroactively does not necessarily
cause it to be unconstitutional. Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., 220 U. S.
107.
The rule that statutes should be construed if possible so as not to operate retroactively does not authorize a judicial reenactment of the
statute to save it from acting retroactively if Congress intended it so
to do.
Section 37 of the Tariff Act of 1909, imposing a tax on foreign-built
yachts, is not unconstitutional because it operates retroactively as
to the tax levied for the year 1909, and the use of yachts within the
meaning of the statute during the year 1909, renders the owner or
charterer liable for the tax for that year.
The requirement of uniformity imposed by the Constitution on Congress in levying excise taxes is not intrinsic but geographic.
The Constitution is not self-destructive-it does not take away by
one provision powers conferred by another, and the express authority
to tax is not limited or restricted by subsequent provisions or amendments, especially the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

built yachts is not so repugnant to justice as to amount to denial of
due process of law because domestic-built yachts are not subject to
the same tax; nor is § 37 of the Tariff Act'of 1909, unconstitutional
for lack of uniformity.
The state rule as to interest on taxes differs from the United States
rule-the former excludes interest unless the statute so provides;
the latter allows interest unless forbidden by statute. This court
will not now apply the state rule, as to do so would repudiate settled
principles and disregard the sanction expressly or impliedly given
by Congress to the rule adopted by the Federal courts.
The Government is entitled to interest on taxes on use of foreign-built
yachts under § 37 of the Tariff Act of 1909, from the date when the
taxes become due, and may maintain an action against the owner or
charterer therefor.
190 Fed. Rep. 359, modified and affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction and constitutionality of § 37 of the Tariff Act of 1909, imposing a tax
on the use of foreign-built yachts, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. William D. Guthrie for the owners of foreign-built
yachts, in this and other cases argued simultaneously herewith:
The classification in § 37 violates the Fifth Amendment.
A tax law must be imposed impartially upon all in the
same class similarly situated, and must apply equally and
uniformly to all persons in like circumstances or under
like conditions.
The yacht owners purchased their yachts when no import duty or excise tax was imposed or ever had been imposed by dongress upon foreign-built yachts, The Conqueror, 166 U. S. 110, and presumably have duly paid the
tonnage tax laid upon all vessels classed as foreign. The
practical effect of this legislation is to penalize them and
compel them to pay an import duty of thirty-five per
centum ad valorem asthe alternative to submitting to this
new tax. The act is precisely the same as if it had provided
in so many words that all citizens who had theretofore acquired foreign-built yachts should pay a retrospective im-

port "duty of thirty-five per centum ad valorem" in order

U. S. 219, 244. See Cooley on Taxation, 3d ed., pp. 4,

The classification is in conflict with sound principles of
constitutional taxation. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S.

As to the selection of property according to origin as a
subject for a special form of taxation, see Phillips v.
Raynes, 136 App. Div. 417, aff'd 198 N. Y. 539, holding void under the Fourteenth Amendment, § 190 of the
New York Labor Law prohibiting sale of convict-made
goods without the payment of an annual license fee of
$500. See also Farringtonv. Mensching, 187 N. Y. 8, 17;
People v. Hawkins, 157 N. Y. 1, 9; Knowlton v. Rock
County, 9 Wisconsin, 410, 422.
While in the case of import duties the foreign origin of
the article imported is necessarily the basis and test of the
duty, the yacht tax now before the court purports to be
an excise tax upon the use of an article and not upon its
importation. The law, therefore, must be treated solely
as an excise tax upon use, and cannot be sustained upon a
theory which might uphold an import duty.
There is no substantial difference between the requirement of due process of law contained in the Fifth Amendment and that in the Fourteenth Amendment. Carrollv.

Greenwich Ins.. Co., 199 U. S. 401, 410; Twining v. New
Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 101.
The act of Congress requires use of a foreign-built yacht
during the taxable period.
Tax statutes, especially when attempting to impose
special, novel and. extraordinary taxes, should be strictly
construed, and, if any ambiguity be found to exist, it
must be resolved in favor of the citizen. Eidman v. Martitez, 184 U. S. 578, 583; United States v. Wigglesworth, 2
Story, 369, 374; Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. Herold,

Bldg. Assn. v. Herold, 203 Fed. Rep. 876, 880; Mutual
Trust Co. v. Miller, 177 N. Y. 51, 57.
The language plainly indicates that it was the intention
to levy a tax not upon foreign-built yachts as property
but solely upQn their use. The Anjer Head, 46 Fed. Rep.
664.
The distinction between an excise tax on the use of a
thing and a direct tax upon the thing itself is, of course,
fundamental and substantial. But it would vanish into
nothingness if "use" be now construed to mean not actual use at all but mere capacity for use.
The word "use" was advisedly employed in order to
avoid creating what might be held to be a direct tax on the
property, and as such necessary to be apportioned. Pollock v. Farmers' L. & T. Co., 157 U. S. 429; 158 U. S. 601;
McCoach v. Minehill Railway Co., 228 U. S. 295, 306. The
court will not, therefore, now adopt a construction of the
statute which would create grave doubts as to its constitutionality, when another construction, which avoids all
constitutional difficulties, is not only equally consistent
with the terms of the act, but more consonant with its
plain intent. United States v. Del. & Hud. Co., 213 U. S.

232 U. S.

The tax is not leviable in respect of foreign-built yachts
not within the jurisdiction of the United States.
Property in order to be the subject of taxation must be
within the jurisdiction of the power assuming to tax.
Buck v. Beach, 206 U. S. 392, 400. If the yachts in question had no permanent situs anywhere, the fact that their
owners were domiciled abroad would fix their situs there.
Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, 222,U. S. 63, 69; Union
Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194.
The power to tax depends upon jurisdiction of the
subject-matter of the tax.
Taxation must have relation to some subject-matter
actually within the jurisdiction of the taxing power, otherwise it violates the constitutional guaranty against the
taking of property without due process of law. Neither a
State nor the Federal Government can tax the property of
citizens situated in foreign countries, or the use of such
property in foreign countries. Railroad Co. v. Jackson, 7

There is no law of the United States which authorizes
the Secretary of the Treasury to extend any special right

BILLINGS v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Argument for Owners of Foreign-built Yachts.

Conceding that Congress has power to tax the use of
foreign-built yachts owned and used outside of the United
States by American citizens permanently residing abroad,
it has not expressed the intention so to do. Such a novel
tax burden should be expressed in plain terms, free from
doubt or ambiguity. Eidman v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 578,
583; Lynch v. Union Trust Co., 164 Fed. Rep. 161, 163.
Section 37 fails to reveal any such legislative intent.
190 Fed. Rep. 368, 369.
Section 37 should not be construed as retrospective so as
to tax the use of foreign-built yachts during the year 1909.
One who has owned property, or exercised or enjoyed a
right or privilege, or carried on a vocation, at a time and
under circumstances when such ownership or acts were
not taxable, ought not to be subjected to a special, novel
and extraordinary tax by a subsequent statute operating
retrospectively upon his past ownership or acts. N. Y. C.
& H. R. R. R. Co. v. Gaus, 200 N. Y. 328, 330.
A tax should not be levied upon past ownership so as to
cover a period when the property was not subject to taxation. People v. Trust Co. of America, 205 N. Y. 74, 77. A
statute imposing a tax upon use should not be construed
retrospectively unless the language imperatively requires
it. U. S. Fidelity Co. v. Struthers, 209 U. S. 306, 314;
United States v. Heth, 3 Cr. 399, 413; Assur. Soc'y v. Miller, 179 N. Y. 227; 180 N. Y. 525, 526; Metz v. Hagerty, 51
Oh. St. 521. See also United States v. Burr, 159 U. S. 78,

Holliday v. Atlanta, 96 Georgia, 377; Young v. Henderson, 76 N. Car. 420; 2 Lewis' Sutherland Stat. Const. (2d
ed.), p. 640.
If it be held that it must be presumed that Congress intended that the obligation to pay the tax should begin to
accrue from the date when the act took effect, this annual
tax on use should be apportioned according to the period
of actual use during the year ending September 1, 1909,

501, and distinguished in N. Y. C. & H. R. R. R. Co. v.
Gaus, 200 N. Y. 328, 331.
The Government is not entitled to recover interest. The
burden of a tax should not be increased by the addition of
interest unless such a purpose of the legislature has been
clearly expressed. Hartford v. Hills, 75 Connecticut, 599,
600. What the State omitted to demand, the court cannot
require. People v. Gold & Stock Tel. Co., 98 N. Y. 67, 80.
The act itself shows that Congress did not intend to
exact interest as a penalty for delay in payment of the tax.
Courts may not find an intention to impose interest as a
penalty for 'delay in payment of taxes and cannot award
interest on taxes unless there be some express statutory
provision to that effect. Crabtree v. Madden, 54 Fed. Rep.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Argument for the United States.

232 U. S.

The contention that another rule of construction applies
to an indirect tax like the present cannot prevail. The
tax is upon the present use of the property, whether that
use has endured for a year or for a day. The tax is called
an annual one, which means that the tax is to be collected
once a year.
Even if such construction does give the statute a retroactive effect, Congress intended the tax to be paid
September 1, 1909.
Congress has the power to lay a retrospective tax.
Locke v. New Orleans, 4 Wall. 172; Stockdale v. Ins. Companies, 20 Wall. 323, 331; Railroad Co. v. Rose, 95 U. S.
78, 80; Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 108; Cooley,
Taxation, 3d ed., 492, 494.
Courts will construe a statute retrospectively when
that is clearly the legislative intent. Stephens v. Cherokee
Nation, 174 U. S. 445; Lamb v. Powder River Co., 132
Fed. Rep. 434.
The language of the act shows a clear intention to make
it immediately effective. Pauley Mfg. Co. v. Crawford
County, 84 Fed. Rep. 942.
Punctuation is to be given little weight in determining
the legislative intent. Hammock v. Loan & Trust Co., 105
U. S. 77, 84; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445,
480.
A construction which leads to absurd and unjust
consequences is to be avoided if possible. Pickett v.
United States, 216 U. S. 456, 461.
The tax cannot be apportioned. McClellan v. Railroad, 11 Lea, 336.
The tax is upon consumption or upon the privilege of
using, and is not avoided by failure to employ the yacht
on cruises.
The language of the act indicates that the tax is to
be levied upon the use of foreign-built yachts.
The transaction of active business is the thing taxed;

Argument for the United States.

the income derived therefrom is included in the measure
of the tax. Were it otherwise the tax would probably
run counter to the decision of this court in Pollock v.
Farmers' L. & T. Co., 157 U. S. 429.
A privilege tax is not direct simply because measured
by capacity for use. Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., 220 U. S.
107, 166; United States v. Singer, 15 Wall. 111; Hylton v.
United States, 3 Dall. 171.
While economically the incidence of the present tax
is upon the yacht itself, its legal incidence is upon the
privilege of using, and whether this be called a tax upon
consumption, potential use, or capacity for use, it is indirect in the constitutional sense. Knowlton v. Moore, 178
U. S. 81, 83; Missouri &c. Ry. Co. v. United States, 231
U. S. 112.
The reasonable construction of the act shows that the
tax is primarily a revenue measure and secondarily designed to encourage the building of yachts in America,
and there would be no object in exempting yachts out of
commission.
The privilege of use, as shown by ownership or a charter
of more than six months, is the only test of liability imposed by the act.
The tax applies to every foreign-built yacht belonging
to a citizen of the United States, though such citizen be
domiciled and resident abroad and the yacht has acquired
a permanent situs abroad.
The statute is to be construed sensibly and to accomplish the legislative intent. Johnson v. Southern Pacific
Co., 196 U. S. 17.
The congressional proceedings, however, clearly indicate that Congress understood that the tax would apply
to the specific yachts now involved. Cong. Rec., Part V,
61st Cong., 1st sess., p. 4875. See Eidman v. Martinez,
184 U. S. 591.

description. United States v. Chamberlin, 219 U. S.
263.
In other income statutes there were reasons for naming
non-resident citizens. See act of August 5, 1861, 12 Stat.
309; act of June 30, 1864, 13 Stat. 281; Tariff Act of October 3, 1913.
The United States merely asks that the language used
be given its plain meaning, and that no words of exception be read into the statute under the guise of construction.
The annual tax is an excise, and is uniform throughout
the United States. Geographical uniformity is the only
limitation imposed by the Constitution. This limitation
being observed, the tax does not amount to deprivation
of property without due process of law, even if in its
operation it be found intrinsically unequal. And the present tax would be valid, even were the equal protection of
the laws clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applicable.
Admittedly, the tax is an excise. Hylton v. United
States, 3 Dall. 171; Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 84;
Patton v. Brady, 184 U. S. 608; McCray v. United States,
195 U. S. 27; Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107.
The present tax meets this requirement of geographical
uniformity. It operates upon every citizen of the United
States owning a foreign-built yacht, wherever such citizen
may be found.
The classification of the statute is reasonable within
the equal protection of the laws clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. District of Columbia v. Brooke, 214 U. S.
138; Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1.
As to the scope of the equal protection of the laws clause,
see Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, 229 U. S. 322; Mutual
Loan Co. v. Martell, 222 U. S. 225; Metropolis Theater Co.

but is essentially arbitrary. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic

The classification involved includes all citizens who own

The court below finds as a fact that under the law of
Great Britain a ship is not a British vessel unless owned

as a British vessel and is not within the treaty.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
It is necessary to determine whether these two cases
from different courts are not virtually one and to be considered in that aspect.
The United States sued for the amount of a tax with
interest. The alleged liability under the statute was
challenged and if it existed the statute was alleged to be
repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and
right to interest was denied. The court held the statute
to be constitutional and judgment was awarded for the
sum claimed, but the prayer for interest was rejected.
Error was prosecuted directly from this court by the defendant and* from the Circuit Court of Appeals by the
United States, the first because of the constitutional questions and the secofid because of the disallowance of interest. The Circuit Court of Appeals certified a question
concerning the right to recover interest, and the two cases
before us consist of the direct writ of error on the one hand
and the certificate on the other. Both writs of error when
,taken were authorized. Ohio R. R. Comm. v. Worthington,
225 U. S. 101; Macfadden v. United States, 213 U. S. 288.
Our jurisdiction, however, on the direct writ of error is
not confined to the constitutional questions, but embraces
every issue in the case. Williamson v. United States, 207
U. S. 425. The Circuit Court of Appeals, however, has
no power to ask instructions upon an issue which it has
no right to decide and we have no authority to instruct on
such a subject or to refuse to decide issues which are
properly before us for judgment.
Under these conditions, we think the better practice is,

BILLINGS v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

as regards the controversy as to interest which was taken
to the Circuit Court of Appeals by writ of error and in
which cases the certificates now befhre us were drawn, to
treat the writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals as
in substance pending here on a cross-writ by the United
States, and as without further orders the record is in such
a condition as to enable us to decide the whole case, we
proceed to do so.
Section 37 of the Tariff Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, 36
Stat. 11, 112, provided in part as follows:
"There shall be levied and collected annually on the
first day of September by the collector of customs of the
district nearest the residence of the managing owner, upon
the use of every foreign-built yacht, pleasure-boat or vessel, not used or intended to be used for trade, now or hereafter owned or chartered for more than six months by any
citizen or citizens of the United States, a sum equivalent
to a tonnage tax of seven dollars per gross ton."
The second paragraph of the provision which we need
not quote, gives the right to the owner of any "foreignbuilt yacht, pleasure-boat or vessel above described" to
pay a duty of 35 per cent. ad valorem and thus secure an
exemption from the tax provided by the first paragraph.
The act went into effect on August 6, 1909, and the collector of the port of New York thereafter made a demand
upon C. K. G. Billings, the plaintiff in error, for the payment of $7,644.00, that is, of the sum produced by calculating seven dollars per ton on 1,091.71 tons, the tonnage
of the foreign-built yacht Vanadis, owned and controlled
by him.
Failing to pay, in January, 1911, the United States sued
in the court below to recover the tax. The defendant was
alleged to be a citizen of the United States and the suit
was averred to have been brought in the district nearest
his residence. The ownership and use by him of the
pleasure-yacht Vanadis, an English foreign-built vessel,

the levy based upon her tori: age according to the statute
of the amount of $7,644, the demand for payment, the
failure to pay on the first day of September, 1909, under
the statute, were all alleged, and recovery of the tax as
well as of interest was prayed. The answer admitted
citizenship and the ownership of the yacht and that she
was a foreign-built pleasure craft, but set up three distinct
defenses, the first, that the vessel was not enrolled, registered, or documented as a vessel of the United States and
enjoyed no privileges because she was of that character.
It was expressly admitted that "during the year preceding
the first day of September, 1909" the said yacht "has been
used by the defendant outside of the waters and territorial
limits or jurisdiction of the United States from time to
time and at various times
.
and was not used for
six months during such year within the waters and territorial limits or jurisdiction of the United -States or elsewhere."
The second defense expressly averred that the tax imposed by the statute was intended by Congress to be "an
annual tax, that it should be prospective and operate only
upon the future use of any such foreign-built yacht,
pleasure-boat or vessel, and that said annual tax did not
accrue and could not be duly levied and collected prior
to the first day of September in the year 1910."
The third defense, after fully averring that there were
within the United States many pleasure yachts not foreignbuilt which were in use and whose use was identical with
that of a foreign-built yacht like the one which the defendant used, charged that the law imposing the burden sought
to be enforced was void because repugnant to the due
process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The case was
submitted to the court on bill and answer and as we at
the outset said, there was a judgment holding that the
sum claimed was due by the defendant as an excise or
duty upon the use of his yacht and that the act imposing

BILLINGS v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the tax was not repugnant to the Constitution, but that
the Government was not entitled to recover interest.
To avoid if it may be the necessity of determining the
constitutional question, we shall first decide what, if any,
burden the statute imposes, and then if necessary consider
its asserted repugnancy to the Constitution. In view of
the requirement that direct taxes be apportioned and
assuming as we do assume, that the act before us was
adopted by Congress in the light of the ruling in Pollock
v. Farmers Loan & Trust Company, 157 U. S. 429, 158
U. S. 601, it is certain that the tax levied by the provision
was intended to be an excise tax upon "the use of every
foreign-built yacht, pleasure-boat or vessel . . . now
or hereafter owned or chartered for more than, six months
by any citizen or citizens of the United States." This is
not seriously, if at all, disputed in argument, the controversy turning first upon the period when the tax provided
for is to take effect and the nature and character of the
use which is taxed. These subjects are so interwoven
that we consider and dispose of them together.
'Was the tax due on the first day of September, 1909,
or was it only due on the same day in September, 1910?
In view of the positive direction that the tax shall be
levied and collected on the first day of September, we
can see no escape from the conclusion that the court
below was right in holding that it became due on the
first day of September after the passage of the act. The
word "annually" upon which so much reliance to the
contrary is placed, is manifestly used not for the purpose
of postponing the time of payment, but rather as provision
for continuity; that is, the word but shows the purpose
of fixing the annual duty of levying and collecting the
tax on the designated day. This becomes quite apparent
when it is observed that if the word "annually" be removed, there would be room for the implication that the
tax was to be but sporadic and would therefore cease to

Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S

be collectible after one payment. And it is equally cleai
that the six months clause is concerned not with the period
when the tax imposed shall be levied and collected, but
addresses itself to the subject-matter upon which the tax
is placed; in other words, it qualifies the word "charter"
and therefore only indicates when the use of a chartered
vessel shall become subject to the duty imposed. The
tax being leviable and collectible, on the first of September
in each year after the passage of the act, upon what was
it assessed? is the question. It seems difficult to answer
it in clearer terms than does the text of the act when it
provides that it shall be upon the use of the yachts with
which the provision is concerned. But it is said to respond
in the language of the act leaves the question virtually
unanswered, since the extent of the use and its essential
period are left wholly undetermined. But this is a misconception based upon a disregard of the fact that the
word "use" in the text is unqualified, from which it
results that the recurrence of the tax is annual and depends upon two elements, ownership or charter rights,
as specified in the act, and use for any time during the
year. It is to be observed that the provision deals with
ownership and distinguishes between ownership and use,
since it bases the tax not upon the former but upon the
latter. From this it follows that it is not ownership but
the election during the taxing period of the owner to take
advantage of one of the elements which are involved in
ownership, the right to use which is the subject upon
which the statute places the excise duty. In this view the
fact of use, not its extent or its frequency, becomes the
test, as distinguished from mere ownership, for that in
the statutory sense could exist without use having taken
place. The words of the statute under this construction
were used in an every-day sense and not in a technical
one: in other words but convey the distinction without
reference to nice analysis of the nature of things which is

BILLINGS v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

commonly conceived to exist between ownership and use.
Let it be conceded that the ownership of property includes
the right to use, plainly we think, as use and ownership
are distinguished one from the other in the provision, the
word "use" as there employed means more than the
mere privilege of using which the owner enjoys, and relates to its primary signification, as defined by Webster;
"The act of employing anything or of applying it to one's
service; the state of being so employed or applied." If
the use which arises from the fact of ownership without
more was what the statute proposed, then it is inconceivable why the difference between use and ownership was
marked in the provision and made the basis of the tax
which it imposed. While this construction in this case
leads to the same conclusion as does that which the court
below affixed to the statute, that is, that it taxed the
privilege of use, or, in other words the potentiality of
using involved in ownership, inherently there is this
fundamental difference between the interpretation we
give and that which the lower court adopted, since the
privilege of use is purely passive (or subjective), a right
which necessarily pertains to ownership and must exist
where there is ownership, as one may not obtain ownership
without acquiring the privileges of use which ownership
gives. "The other, on the contrary, that is, use in the
statutory sense, although it arises from ownership, is
active (objective), that is, it is the outward and distinct
exercise of a right which ownership confers but which
would not necessarily be exerted by the mere fact of ownership. The contention that inequality must be the result
from making the tax depend upon mere use without
reference to the extent of its duration, addresses itself
not to the question of power, and is therefore beyond the
scope of judicial cognizance. But it is to be observed that
it may well have been that the character of the property
with which the statute deals and the mere element of

Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

caprice as to its use and the -uncertainties of the subject
led to the fact of making the use alone the criterion as the
wiser and juster method of operating equally upon all.
Again let it be conceded that the causing the tax for the
annual period to become due in September, 1909, is to
give it in some respects a retroactive effect, such concession does not cause the act to be beyond the power
of Congress under the Constitution to adopt. Flint v.
Stone-Tracy Company, 220 U. S. 107 and authorities there
cited. While the rule is that statutes should be so construed as to prevent them from operating retroactively,
that principle is one of construction and not of reconstruction and therefore does not authorize a judicial reenactment by interpretation of a statute to save it from producing a retroactive effect.
As under. the meaning which we thus give the statute
the admitted use of the vessel was within its provision and
therefore the amount due for excise was rightfully imposed
and under our interpretation was due when demanded, we
must consider whether the asserted repugnancy of the
statute to the Constitution is well founded.
It has been conclusively determined that the requirement of uniformity which the Constitution imposes upon
Congress in the levy of excise taxes is not an intrinsic
uniformity, but merely a geographical one. Flint v.
Stone-Tracy Company, 220 U. S. 107; McCray v. United
States, 195 U. S. 27; Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41. It
is also settled beyond dispute that the Constitution is not
self-destructive. In other words, that the powers which it
confers on the one hand it does not immediately take
away on the other; that is to say, that the authority to
tax which is given in express terms is not limited or
restricted by the subsequent provisions of the Constitution or the amendments thereto, especially by the due
process clause of the Fifth Amendment. McCray v.
United States, 195 U. S. 27 and auth6rities there cited.

BILLINGS v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Nor is there anything in Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance
Company, 199 U. S. 401, or Twining v. New Jersey,.211
U. S. 78, which in the remotest degree nullifies or restricts
the principle thus stated. Indeed it is apparent, if the
suggestion as to the meaning of those cases were assented
to, it would result in rendering the Constitution unconstitutional. This certainly was the view entertained by
the pleader when the answer in the case was prepared,
since the sole attack on the constitutionality of the statute
was based upon the assertion that it was repugnant to the
due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. And such
also is the line of the argument at bar where the fundamental rights secured by the Fifth Amendment are
constantly referred to as the basis upon which the unconstitutionality of the statute is urged. Is there foundation for this claim under the Fifth Amendment? is then
the issue, and that of ccdurse requires a statement of the
grievances which it is asserted result from upholding the
tax. They all come to this, that to impose a burden in the
shape of a tax upon the use of a foreign-built yacht when a
like tax is not imposed on the use of a domestic yacht under
similar circumstances is so beyond the power of classification, so abhorrent to the sense of justice, and so repugnant
to the conceptions of free government as to be void even
in the absence of express constitutional limitation. We do
not stop to point out the obvious unsoundness of the
contentions, nor indeed to direct attention to the selfevident demonstration of their want of merit even from
the point of view of the power to classify, since the difference between things domestic and things foreign and
their use are apparent on the face of things and are expressly manifested by the text of the Constitution. We
say we do not stop to do these things because in any event
we are of opinion the conclusion cannot be escaped that
the propositions, each and all of them, Whatever may be
their form of expression, are in substance and effect but an

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

232 U1. S.

assertion that the tax which the statute imposes is void
beeause of a want of intrinsic uniformity, and therefore
all the contentions are adversely disposed of by the previous decisions of this court on that subject. That which
is settled beyond dispute may not be disregarded and be
brought into the realm of thaf which is controvertible and
questionable by the mere garb in which propositions are
clothed.
Was the Government entitled to interest? is then the
remaining question which we must decide in view of the
purpose which we at the outset expressed of treating the
United States as here present and urging its right to interest on a cross-writ of error. The cyclopedias and textbooks state the doctrine to be that in the absence of a
statute expressly so directing, taxes bear no interest. The
principle is thus announced in 37 Cyc., p. .1165: " Delinquent taxes do not bear interest unless it is expressly so
provided by statute. But it is competent for the legislature to prescribe the payment of interest as a penalty for
delay in the payment of taxes and to regdlate its rate.
This, however, can be effected only by an act plainly
manifesting the legislative intention as to the right to
recover interest, its amount, and the date from which it
shall begin, the latter being ordinarily the time when the
assessment is complete and the taxes become payable."
Cooley on Taxation, p. 17; Sedgwick on Damages (9th
ed.), § 332; Sutherland (3d ed.), § 337; Black On Tax
Titles (2d ed.), § 236, and. see note in 6 L. R. A. (N. S.),
p. 694. And the statement of the text is borne out by
the decided cases in nearly all of the state courts of last
resort. On the other hand, the Government relies upon
four cases in this court where interest was allowed as a
matter of course on taxes due the United States. CheangKee v. United States, 3 Wall. 320; Railroad Co. v. United
States, 101 U. S. 543; Litchfield v. County of Webster,
101 U. S. 773; United States v. Erie Railway Company, 106

BILLINGS v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Opiqion of the Court.

U. S. 327. We say as a matter of course because in the
cases referred to, the subject was not discussed and the
liability for interest was practically admitted. The
Government also relies on a careful and clear opinion by
Maxey, Judge, in the Circuit Court for the Western
District of Texas, holding that interest was due to the
United States on customs duties. United States v. Mexican
&c. R. Co., 154 Fed. Rep. 519. Whether the practice
applied in the previous decisions of this court should be
now followed or the theory established by the state cases
adopted and made the rule as to taxes due the United
States, is therefore the question. Its solution must depend
not upon the mere authority of the state cases, but upon
the conclusiveness of the principles upon which such
cases rest and their concurrence with the principles by
which interest is allowed in the courts of the United
States, considerations which require us to determine the
nature of the duty which arises from the liability for a tax
imposed by the United States, not only inherently but as
well from the practice which has obtained in the past in
the enforcement of the law of the United States and the
implication of legislative sanction, if any, to such practice
which may have arisen. It would serve no purpose to
refer to the abhorrence which obtained in early times
concerning the payment of interest and the evolution by
which the legitimate character of interest was gradually
understood and it came to be recognized that its payment Was, as a general principle, but the compensation
due for the use of money or that its allowance was merely
for damages caused by delay in discharging a duty and
therefore in default on a contract to pay money even
without express legislation so directing, interest would
be allowed. The subject was explained in National Bank
v. Mechanics National Bank, 94 U. S. 437 and was reviewed in Reid v. Rensselaer Glass Factory, 3 Cow. 393,
5 Cow. 587. To avoid prolixity we do not review the

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

state cases as to non-liability for interest on default for
taxes but content ourselves with stating that we think it is
apparent- that the conclusion which they sustain, leaving
aside minor differences rests upon two fundamental propositions: First the necessity for an express statute providing
for interest except in cases of contract, and second, that
even where there is a statute providing for interest on all
debts, such statute is not applicable to taxes because they
are not debts and therefore must be enforced alone by
virtue of express legislative penalties, except where a
provision exists giving eo nomine interest on taxes. But
both of these propositions are in conflict with the settled
doctrine established by the decision of this court. Thus,
as to the necessity for a statute it was long ago here
decided in view of the true conception of interest, that a
statute was not necessary to compel its payment where
in accordance with the principles of" equity and justice in
the enforcement of an obligation, interest should be allowed. Young v. Godbe, 15 Wall. 562, 565:
"It is said there is no law in the Territory of Utah prescribing a rate of interest in transactions like the one in
controversy in this suit, and that, therefore, no interest
can be recovered. But this result does not follow. If
there is no statute on the subject, interest will be allowed
by way of damages for unreasonably withholding payment
of an overdue account. The rate must be reasonable, and
conform to the custom which obtains in the community in
dealings of this character."
And the decisions of this court have often since exemplified the principle by considering the question of the responsibility for interest from the point of view of reason
and justice even though no express statute existed for
compelling this payment.. So also as to the nature and
character of the obligation to pay taxes. As long ago as
Meredith v. United States, 13 Peters, 486, it was decided,
the court speaking by Mr. Justice Story (p. 493):

BILLINGS v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"It appears to us clear upon principle, as well as upon
the obvious import of the provisions of the various afts of
Congress on this subject, that the duties due upon all
goods imported constitute a personal debt due to the
United States from the importer.
"
Again in United States v. Chamberlin, 219 U. S. 250, the
nature and character of an obligation to pay a stamp duty
was considered, and the right to collect it by action of
debt was passed upon and it was held that the obligation
to pay was a debt and that it could be enforced by suit
in the absence of an exclusive remedy created by the
statute by which the obligation was imposed. In the
course of the opinion, various decisions of this court
recognizing the right of the United States to enforce internal revenue duties by suit were referred to and the statute
to the same end was cited and its application to the case
in hand was pointed out upon grounds which in reason
may well be said to cause the statute to be applicable
to th case here before us. In addition, in repeated adjudications in this court it has been settled that in a suit
-to recover taxes which have been illegally assessed interest
woiild be allowed against the official although the real
responsibility was on the Government. The concluded
doctrine on this subject was thus stated in a recent case
after referring to the exemption of the United States from
liability for interest (National Volunteer Home v. Parrish,
229 U. S. 494, 496):
"On the contrary, ift suits against collectors to recover
moneys illegally exacted as taxes and paid under protest
the settled rule is, that interest is recoverable without
any statute to that effect, and this although the judgment
is not to be paid by the collector but directly from the
Treasury. Erskine v. Van Arsdale, 15 Wall. 75; Redfield
v. Bartels, 139 U. S. 694."
The conflict between the systems is pronounced, and
fundamental. In the one, the state rule, except as to

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

contract, no interest without statute; in the United States
rule, interest in all cases where equitably due unless forbidden by statute. In one no suit for taxes as a debt
without express statutory authority, in the other the
right to sue for taxes as for a debt in every case where not
prohibited by statute.
From this review it results that the doctrine as to nonliability to pay interest for taxes which have become due
which prevails in the state courts is absolutely in conflict
with the doctrine applied to the same subject in this court
and cannot now be made the rule without repudiating
settled principles which have been here applied for many
years in various aspects and without in effect disregarding
the sanction either expressly or impliedly given by Congress to such rules. From this it follows that although
in the cases in this court to which we at the outset made
reference which enforced the liability for interest and
which are here controlling if they be not now overruled,
there was no controversy as to the liability for interest,
this was presumably because the matter was deemed not
disputable as the direct result of the then settled doctrine
that interest could be recovered by the United States
on a default in payment of import duties. Under this
condition we can see no ground for departing from the
rule which the cases enforced, and we are therefore constrained to the conclusion that the court below was wrong
in rejecting the prayer of the Government for interest
and its action in that respect must be reversed while
in others it must be affirmed.
Modified and affirmed.
