WILLIAMSON v. OSENTON.
CFRTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 634.

Submitted February 24, 1914.-Decided March 9, 1914.

The essential fact that raises change of abode to change of domicil is
the absence of any intention to live elsewhere.
An ambiguous meaning will not be attributed to a phrase used in an
agreed statement of facts on the assumption that the parties were
by a quibble trying to get the better of each other; and so held that
"an indefinite time" as applied to an intent to reside, referred to in
such a statement, meant that no end to such time was then contem-

plated.
Where one changes his abode with no intention of returning to the
former abode the motive is immaterial so far as change creates a
citizenship enabling the party to sue in the Federal courts.
One's domicil is the technically preeminent headquarters that every
person is compelled to have in order that his rights and duties
that have attached to it by the law may be determined.
The identity of husband and wife is a fiction now vanishing.
In this country, a wife who has justifiably left her husband may acquire
a different domicil from his, not only for the purpose of obtaining a
divorce from him, Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562, but for other
purposes, including that of bringing an action for damages against
persons other than her husband.

Quvre, whether the same is the law in England.

THE facts, which involve the question whether a
married woman may, under certain conditions, acquire a
domicil different from that of her husband, axe stated
in the opinion.

suit. A subsequent divorce will not aid defendant in error

in maintaining jurisdiction in the Federal court. Mansfield v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379; Metcalf v. Watertown, 128
U. S. 586; Stevens v. Nichols, 130 U. S. 230; Jackson v.
Allen, 132 U. S. 34; Mattingly v. Railway, 158 U. S. 53;
Insurance Co. v. Tempkins, 41 C. C. A. 490; Brizel v. Salt
Co., 73 Fed. Rep. 13.
Even if husband and wife can have different citizenships in different States at the same time, the record does

not show that the wife, in fact, gained a citizenship in
Virginia prior to the institution of this suit.
A married woman cannot, even where she has grounds
for leaving her husband, acquire another domicil, except
for the purpose of bringing a suit directly involving the
marriage relation.
At common law a wife could not have any existence

separate from her husband, nor even civil rights, nor separate personal estate, and she could not have a separate

domicil. The fact that she lived apart from her husband;
that they had separated by agreement; or that the husband had been guilty of misconduct, such as would furnish
a defense to a suit by him for restitution of conjugal rights,
did not, in England, enable the wife to acquire a separate
domicil. Warrender v. Warrender, 2 C. & F., H. L., 488;
Dolphin v. Robins, 7 H. L., 390; Yelverton v. Yelverton,
1 Swab. & Trist. Probate, 574; 2 Bishop on Marriage
and Divorce (4th ed., ยง 129).
In the United States it has been held that a divorce
a mensa et thoro gives the wife all the rights to acquire a
separate domicil for all purposes, and she can sue her
husband in the Federal court as a citizen of another
State than his. Barberv. Barber, 21 How. 482; Bennett v.
Bennett, Deady, 299.
Even without judicial separation a woman can acquire
a separate domicil for the purpose of an action against
her husband if the husband commit acts that would

WILLIAMSON v. OSENTON.
232 U. S.

Argument for Williamson.

entitle her to a judicial separation or divorce. Ditson v.
Ditson, 4 R. I. 87; Harteanv. Hartean,14 Pick. 181.
Even that she can go to another State and acquire a
domicil for purposes of such action is upheld. Atherton
v. Atherton, 155 N. Y. 129; Hunt v. Hunt, 72 N. Y. 217;
White v. White, 18 R. I. 292; Smith v. Smith, 43 Louisiana,
1140; Irby v. Wilson, 1 Dev. & B. Eq. 568, 582.
For the difference between a direct and a collateral
application of the rule that the wife may acquire a new
domicil, see Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582; Hartean v.
Hartean, 14 Pick. 181, 185; Calvin v. Reed, 55 Pa. St. 379.
Without the provocation of wrongful acts which entitle her to a divorce, or without a judicial separation, a,
wife cannot establish a domicil separate from that of her
husband. Anderson v. Watt, 138 U. S. 694; Cheely v. Clayton, 110 U. S. 706; Loker v. Gerald, 157 Massachusetts, 42.
Even in a voluntary separation, that is without ground
upon which a separation or a divorce could be maintained,
the wife can acquire a domicil that would give the court
of her residence jurisdiction to settle her estate despite
the domicil of her husband being in another jurisdiction.
Matter of Florence, 54 Hun (N. Y.), 328; Rundle v. Van
Innegan, 9 Civ. Pro. Rep. (N. Y.) 330; Lyon v. Lyon, 30
Hun, 455; Schute v. Sargent, 67 N. H. 305; but see Matter
of Wickes, 128 California, 270.
Thus, for divorce, the American courts have held that
a wife can acquire a domicil separate from that of her
husband, and even if separated without judicial decree,
in New Hampshire and New York the courts of her actual
residence can administer on her estate.
In the case under consideration it may be admitted
from the fact that the plaintiff below subsequently obtained a divorce from her husband, that she had grounds
to leave his domicil and acquire another for the purpose
of suing him.
She did not, however, acquire another domicil in Virginia

for the purpose of obtaining a divorce, and if she had, she
could not have sued for divorce in the Federal court, but
would have been confined to the state courts.
As she had not been judicially separated from her
husband when she instituted this suit, she could not, for.
the purpose of suing a third party for damages, claim
her right to sue as a citizen of Virginia, because of wrongful acts committed by her husband. Thompson v. Stolman, 139 Fed. Rep. 93; Nicholas v. Nicholas, 92 Fed.
Rep. 1.
The agreed facts establish the lack of jurisdiction in the
Federal court as much by what they fail to show as by
what they show. Morris v. Gilmer, 129 U. S. 328. This
was a pretended change of domicil, and not an actual
one; an ostensible removal to Virginia and not a permanent
taking up of her residence in that State, animo manendi.
To show how careful this court has been to confine its
jurisdiction in cases of this kind to those which arise between actual citizens of different States, see Inhabitants
v. Stebbins, 109 U. S. 341; Eberly v. Moore, 24 How. 147;
Williams v. Nottawa, 104 U. S. 209; Hawes v. Contra. Co.,

Ave. Co., 197 U. S. 178; Jones v. League, 18 How. 76; Anderson v. Watt, 138 U. S. 694. South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 311, and the other cases cited by defendant
in error, such as Dickerson v. Northern Trust Co., 176 U. S.
181, have no application here.
While usually the court will not inquire into the motives
of a party in doing an act such as making an assignment or

changing his domicil, the court will not hold that one is
not a citizen of a State when, in fact, he is a citizen, solely
because his purpose in becoming such a citizen was to
enable him to bring a suit.
The authorities cited by defendant in error can be

MR. JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the

court.
This case comes here upon the certified question whether
the plaintiff, when she began this suit, was a citizen of
Virginia in such sense as to be entitled to maintain her
action in the District Court of the United States for the
Southern District of West Virginia. The plaintiff, (the
defendant in error), at that time was the wife of a citizen
of West Virginia, but, in consequence of his adultery as
she alleged, had separated from him and had gone to
Virginia. Before bringing this action she had brought a
suit in West Virginia for divorce, and pending the present
proceeding obtained a divorce a vinculo. This action is
for damages, alleging the defendant to have been a party
to the adultery. The defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction setting up the plaintiff's marriage and the residence
of her husband in West Virginia; in other words that the
requisite diversity of citizenship did not exist. The plea
seems to have been heard upon a written statement of
facts in which it was agreed that the plaintiff went to
Virginia "with the intention of making her home in that
State for an indefinite time in order that she might institute this suit against the defendant in the United States
Court," together with the facts already stated. The plea
was overruled, there was a trial on the merits at which the

232 U. S.

plaintiff got a verdict for $35,000, and thereupon the case
was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, from which
the certified question comes.
On these facts the question certified is divided into two
by the argument: first, whether if able so to do the plaintiff
had changed her domicil from West Virginia to Virginia
in fact; and, second, supposing that she had changed it so
far as to have enabled her to proceed against her husband
in Virginia had she been so minded, whether for other
purposes her domicil did not remain that of her husband
until the divorce was obtained, which was after the beginning of the present suit. Premising that if the plaintiff
was domiciled in Virginia when this suit was begun she
was a citizen of that State within the meaning of the Constitution, Art. III, ยง 2, and the Judicial Code of March 3,
1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087; Gassies v. Ballon, 6 Pet. 761;
Boyd v. Thayer, 142 U. S. 135, 161; Minor v. Happersett,
21 Wall. 162; we will take these questions up in turn.
The essential fact that raises a change of abode to a
change of domicil is the absence of any intention to live
elsewhere, Story on Conflict of Laws, ยง 43-or, as Mr.
Dicey puts it in his admirable book, 'the absence of any
present intention of not residing permanently or indefinitely in' the new abode. Conflict of Laws, 2d ed. 111.
We may. admit that if this case had been before a jury on
testimony merely that the plaintiff intended to live.in Virginia for an indefinite time, it might have been argued that
the motive assigned for the change, the bringing of this action, showed that the plaintiff, even if telling the literal
truth, only meant that she could not tell when the law suit
would end. It is to be noticed also that the divorce proceedings were carried through in West Virginia, though it
is fair to assume that they were begun before the plaintiff
moved. But the case was submitted to the court upon a
written statement, upon which we presume both sides expected the court to rule. To give the supposed ambiguous

Opinion of the Court.

meaning to the words 'for an indefinite time' in that statement would be to assume that the parties were trying to get
the better of each other by a quibble. We must take them
to mean: for a time to which the plaintiff did not then
contemplate an end. If that is their meaning, the motive
for the change was immaterial; for, subject to the second
question to be discussed, the plaintiff had a right to select
her domicil for any reason that seemed good to her. With
possible irrelevant exceptions the motive has a bearing
only when there is an issue open on the intent. Cheever v.
Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 123. Dickerman v. Northern Trust
Co., 176 U. S. 181, 191, 192. With that established as
agreed there is no doubt that it was sufficient to work the
change. Mitchell v. United States, 21 Wall. 350, 352.
Dicey, Conflict of Laws, 2d ed. 108, 113, 114.
The second subdivision of the question may be answered
with even less doubt than the first. The very meaning of
domicil is the technically preeminent headquarters that
every person is compelled to have in order that certain
rights and duties that have been attached to it by the
law may be determined. Bergner & Engel Brewing Co. v.
Dreyfus, 172 Massachusetts, 154, 157. In its nature it is
one, and if in any case two are recognized for different
purposes it is a doubtful anomaly. Dicey, Conflict of
Laws, 2d ed. 98. The only reason that could b offered
for not recognizing the fact of the plaintiff's actual change,
if justified, is the now vanishing fiction of identity of
person. But if that fiction does not prevail over the fact
in the relation for which the fiction was created there is no
reason in the world why it should be given effect in any
other. However it may be in England, that in this country a wife in the plaintiff's circumstances may get a
different domicil from that of her husband for purposes of
divorce is not disputed and is not open to dispute. Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562, 571, 572. This she may do
without necessity and simply from choice, as the cases

show, and the change that is good as against her husband
ought to be good as against all. In the later decisions the
right to change and the effect of the change are laid down
in absolute terms. Gordon v. Yost, 140 Fed. Rep. 79.
Watertown v. Greaves, 112 Fed. Rep. 183. ,Shute v. Sargent, 67 N. H. 305. Buchholz v. Buchholz, 115 Pac. Rep.
88. See Haddock v. Haddock, sup., Barber v. Barber, 21
How. 582, 588, 597, 598. We see no reason why the wife
who justifiably has left her husband should not have
the same choice of domicil for an action for damages that
she has against her husband for a divorce.
We answer the question, Yes.
