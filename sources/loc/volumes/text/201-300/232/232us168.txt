of this court the judgment could not be sustained. No
doubt the States have a large latitude in the policy that
they will pursue and enforce, but the rudiments of fair
play required by the Fourteenth Amendment are wanting
when a defendant is required to guess rightly what a jury
will find, or pay double if that body sees fit to add one
cent to the amount that was tendered, although the tender
was obviously futile because of an excessive demand. The
case is covered by St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern
Ry. Co. v. Wynne, 224 U. S. 354. It is not like those in
which a moderate penalty is imposed for failure to satisfy
a demand found to be just. Yazoo & Mississippi Valley

STATE OF ALABAMA v. SCHMIDT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA.

No. 595.

Argued January 12, 1914.-Decided January 26, 1914.

The act of March 2, 1819, c. 47, ยง 6, 3 Stat. 489, under which Alabama
became a State, vestedthe legal title of section 16 of every township
in the State absolutely although the statute declared that it was for
the use of schools.
While the trust created by a compact between the States and the
United States that section 16 be used for school purposes is a sacred
obligation imposed on the good faith of the State, the obligation is
honorary and the power of the State where legal title has been vested
in it is plenary and exclusive. Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173.
Statutes of limitation providing for title by adverse possession against
the State after a specified period are a valid exercise of the power of
the State and apply to lands conveyed to the State absolutely by
the United States although for the use of schools. Nor. Pac. Railway
Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267, distinguished.

held not to impair the obligation of the contract created by the acceptance of the enabling act. The State has the right to subject such
lands in its hands to the ordinary incidents of title. Cooper v.
Roberts, 18 How. 173.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Robert C. Brickell, Attorney General of the State of
Alabama, with whom Mr. R. B. Evins was on the brief,
for plaintiff in error:
Sections 16 in this State were granted by Congress to the
inhabitants of the several townships for the specific use
of schools. Acts of March 2, 1819, 3 Stats. 489, and
March 2, 1827, 4 Stats. 237.
This grant which was in the form of a proposal to the
people of the Alabama Territory, the acceptance of which
was a prerequisite for the admission of the State into
the Union, was accepted, as made, by the inhabitants of
the State, in convention assembled, on August 2, 1819.
Ordinance, Const. Cony. of 1819; 1 Code, Alabama, 1907,
pp. 82-83.
Upon the acceptance of these proposals, the State was
admitted into the Union. 3 Stats. 608.
By the grant of these lands for the particular use, the
United States retained title for all other purposes or uses.
Nor. Pac. Ry. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267.
The State of Alabama, in accepting the proposals upon
which its admission into the Union was made contingent,
disclaimed all right and title to waste or unappropriated
lands lying within said Territory. Clause in fourth
proposal in act of Congress of March 2, 1819, 3 Stats.
489; Ordinance of 1819, supra; 1 Code, p. 82.
All other uses or purposes to which said Sections 16
might be put, except the use for schools, being unappropriated by the United States, came within the above disclaimer.
A state statute of limitations, whereby lands granted by

the United States to a specific use, are diverted from that
use into private ownership, are in conflict with the act of
Congress making the grant, and void.
The State has no power to divert sixteenth section lands
from the specific use, for schools, to which they were
dedicated by the act of Congress. Nor. Pac. Ry. Co. v.
Townsend, 190 U. S. 267; Vincennes University v. Indiana,
14 How. 269; Springfield v. Quick, 6 Indiana, 83; S. C.,
22 How. 56; Davis v. Indiana, 94 U. S. 792; Morton v.
GranadaAcademies, 16 Mississippi, 773.
The acceptance of the proposals of the act of March 2,
1819, created a contract between the United States and
the State of Alabama, and the attempted diversion of these
lands from the use to which granted, by a state statute of
limitations, violates the obligation of this contract, and
is void. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87; Fenn v. Kinsey,
45 Michigan, 446, 8 N. W. Rep. 64; Covington v. Kentucky, 154 U. S. 204; United States v. Great Falls, 21 Maryland, 119; Lowery v. Francis, 2 Yerg. (Tenn.) 534.
The acts of Congress making the grant are construed
most strongly against the grantee, and in favor of the
United States. United States v. Michigan, 190 U. S. 379.
The acts of March 2, 1819, and March 2, 1827, are in
pari materia, and must be construed as if passed at the
same time. Plummer v. Murray, 51 Barbour (N. Y.), 201;
People v. Aichison, 7 How. Pr. 241.
The grant of Sections 16 for the use of schools, is a part
of the land system of the United States. 2 Kent. Com.

in err9r;

ALABAMA v. SCHMIDT.
232 U. S

Argument for Defendant in Error.

The grant of Sections 16 to the inhabitants of the
townships for the use of schools in the State of Alabama,
and the acceptance of the proposal contained in ยง 6 of the
act for the admission of Alabama by the convelition
operated as a present grant and immediately divested the
title of the United States to Sections 16. Cooper v. Roberts,
18 How. 173; Hedrick v. Hughes, 15 Wall. 123; Kissel v.
St. Louis Public Schools, 18 How. 19; Campbell v. Township Number One, 13 How. 244; McNee v. Donahue, 142
U. S. 587; Johanson v. Washington, 190 U. S. 179; Beecher
v. Wetherby, 95 U. S. 517; United States v. Tully, 140 Fed.
Rep. 899.
The Alabama grant of Sections 16 being a grant of the
entire title thereto, without reservation, vests in the
grantee or grantees an indefeasible fee simple title and is
not governed by the rules of law laid down with reference
to grants of rights-of-way to railroads. Cases supra, and
see also Deseret Salt Co. v. Tarpey, 142 U. S. 241; Rutherford v. Greene, 2 Wheat. 196; Toltec Ranch Co. v. Cook,
191 U. S. 532; Iowa Land Co. v. Blumer, 206 U. S. 482;
Missouri Valley Land Co. v. Wiese, 208 U. S. 234; Nor.
Pac. R. R. Co. v. Ely, 197 U. S. 1.
No one can take advantage of the non-performance
of a condition subsequent annexed to an estate in fee
except the grantor or its successors. The same rule
applies to a grant upon condition proceeding from the
government. Schulenberg v. Harriman,21 Wall. 44; Spokane &r. R. Co. v. Washington &c. R. Co., 219 U. S. 166;
United States v. Nor. Pac. R. Co., 152 U. S. 281.
Nothing in the Alabama grant of Sections 16 school
lands imports a limitation of the fee. Stuart v. Easton,
170 U. S. 383.
Adverse possession as against a trustee operates as
well against the beneficiaries of the trust. Meeks v. 01pherts, 100 U. S. 564.

so vested that such party may grant an indefeasible estate
in fee simple ripens into a fee simple title by the operation
of the Statute of Limitations. Nor. Pac.R. Co. v. Ely, 197
U. S. 1; Coxe v. University of Alabama, 161 Alabama, 639.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is a suit brought by the State of Alabama to recover possession of a specified part of Section 16, Township 17, Range 5, Talladega County. It was agreed that
the land was a part of the sixteenth section school lands
given to the State by the act of March 2, 1819, c. 47, ยง 6,
3 Stat. 489, 491, and still belonged to the State if the defendant had not got a title by adverse possession, which
it was agreed the defendant had if the statutes of Alabama
limiting suits like the present to twenty years were valid.
The trial eourt ruled that the statutes were valid and
ordered judgment for the defendant, and this judgment
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.
We are of opinion that the judgment must be affirmed.
The above mentioned act of Congress, under which Alabama became a State, provided that section sixteen in
every township 'Shall be granted to the inhabitants of
such township for the use of schools.' Of course the State
must admit, as it expressly agreed, that these words
vested the legal title in it, since it relies upon them for
recovery in the present case. Any other interpretation
hardly would be reasonable. In some cases the grant has
been to the State in terms, but in whichever way expressed
probably it means the same thing, so far as the legal title
is concerned. Certainly it has the same effect with regard
to the scope of the State's legal control.
The argument for the plaintiff in error relies mainly
upon Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267,
271, which held that a right of way over public land

ALABAMA v. SCHMIDT.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

granted by the United States for railway purposes could
not be extinguished by adverse possession under the
statute of limitations of the State in which the land lay.
The ground of that decision was that the grant to the
railroad was not a conveyance of the land in fee simple
absolute but a limited grant 'upon an implied condition
of reverter in the event that the company ceased to use or
retain the land for the purpose for which it was granted.'
This decision has been met for some similar cases elsewhere
by the act of June 24, 1912, c. 181, 37 Stat. 138. Union
PacificR. R. Co. v. LaramieStock Yards Co., 231 U. S. 190.
Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Snow, 231 U. S. 204. But it
does not apply to a gift to a State for a public purpose of
which that State is the sole guardian and minister. As
long ago as 1856 it was decided "the trusts created by these
compacts relate to a subject certainly of universal interest, but of municipal concern, over which the power of
the State is plenary and exclusive," and it was held that
the State of Michigan could sell its school lands without
the consent of Congress. Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173,
181. This decision adverted to the fact that it had been
usual for Congress to authorize the sale of lands if the
State should desire it, but suggested that it was unnecessary, (which, indeed, followed from what was decided),
and thus met the further argument here pressed that a
qualified permission to sell was given to Alabama by a
much later act of March 2, 1827, c. 59, 4 Stat. 237. It
also disposes of other forms of the same contention, that
the state law impairs the obligation of its contract, or
involves a breach of trust, supposing that such positions
are open to the State to take. American Emigrant Co. v.
Adams County, 100 U. S. 61. Spokane & British Columbia
Ry. Co. v. Washington & Great Northern Ry. Co., 219 U. S.
166. The gift to the State is absolute, although, no doubt,
as said in Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 182, 'there is a
sacred obligation imposed on its public faith.' But that

obligation is honorary like the one discussed in Conley v.
Ballinger, 216 U. S. 84, and even in honor would not be
broken by a sale and substitution of a fund, as in that
case; a course, we believe, that has not been uncommon
among the States. See further Stuart v. Easton, 170
U. S. 383, 394.
Some reliance was placed upon Trustees for Vincennes
University v. Indiana, 14 Howard, 268, but the decision
of the majority in that case rested upon the grant having
been made to a private corporation of which the rights
could not be impaired by the State.
The result of Cooper v. Roberts and of what we have said
is that the State had authority to subject this land in its
hands to the ordinary incidents of other titles in the State
and that the judgment must be affirmed. Northern
Pacific Ry. Co. v. Ely, 197 U. S. 1, 8.
Judgment affirmed.

TANEY, TRUSTEE OF MILLER PURE RYE DISTILLING COMPANY, v. PENN NATIONAL BANK
OF READING.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 115.

Argued December 9, 10, 1913.-Decided January 26, 1914.

In determining the relative rights of the trustee in bankruptcy and a
secured creditor the legal effect of the transaction securing the loan
depends upon the local law.
The rule that physical retention by the vendor of goods capable of delivery to the vendee is a fraud per se does not apply in Pennsylvania
in a transaction, the inherent nature of which necessarily precludes
delivery, or in which the absence of a physical delivery is excused by

the applicable usages of trade.
