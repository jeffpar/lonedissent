for what was done by Grande in building the party wall
because he was an independent contractor.
But the evidence showed that he was required to follow
the instructions of La Driere, who was Barnett's agent,
and that La Driere was in fact in charge of the work. For
this reason it was properly held that Grande was not an
independent contractor. Railroad Co. v. Hanning, 15

Syllabus.

Where the statute specifically makes the tax a lien upon real estate
and the bill alleges that enforcement of penalties would work irreparable injury, equity jurisdiction is properly invoked.
The Federal court may examine the opinion of the state court as well
as the syllabus to ascertain the scope of the decision, notwithstand-.
ing the state rules of practice require the syllabus to be prepared by
the judge preparing the opinion and to be confined to the points of
law arising from the facts that have been determined.
The franchise of a railroad company is not necessarily to be regarded
as valueless merely because its present earnings are not sufficient to
pay more than high grade investments or even to pay operating
expenses. State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575.
A state statute imposing a tax on railroads is not unconstitutional as
denying equal protection of the law. The classification rests upon a
reasonable and sufficient basis of distinction.
In the ,absence of a construction by the state court to that effect, the
Federal court should not, if it can avoid doing so, place such a construction upon a state statute as would render it unconstitutional.
"Interstate," as used in a state tax statute, can fairly be construed as
including all commerce other than "intrastate" when the evident
purpose is to tax only the earnings subject to state taxation.
In a state statute imposing a tax on intrastate earnings, it is reasonable
to suppose that the exclusion of interstate earnings from taxation
extended to earnings from foreign commerce when another construction would render the statute unconstitutional.
The reasonableness of an excise or privilege tax, unless some Federal
right is involved, is within the discretion of the state legislature.
Where a state statute does not on its face manifest a purpose to interfere
with interstate commerce, this court cannot accept historical facts
in connection with its enactment as evidence of a sinister purpose on
the part of the legislature to evade obligations of the Federal Constitution, without a more substantial basis than appears in this
case.
Double taxation does not exist in a legal sense unless the double tax is
levied upon the same property within the same jurisdiction, and an
excise tax measured on earnings from operating the property is not
a double tax because the property itself is taxed.
These actions do not involve enforcement of penalties; and the
penalty provisions of this statute if unconstitutional are severable
by the express terms of the statute itself.
The Ohio statute of 1911 imposing an excise tax of four per cent. on
gross intrastate earnings of railroad companies is not unconstituVOL. ccxxxn-37

tional, either as denying equal protection of the laws, or as depriving
the railroads of their property without due process of law, or as interfering with interstate commerce, or as being an attempt to indirectly tax total gross receipts of the railroads, or as double taxation.
203 Fed. Rep. 537, affirmed.

THESE suits were brought in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Eastern Division)
by appellants, which are Ohio railroad corporations, to
enjoin the certification and collection by appellees of a
tax which the State was seeking to enforce upon the privilege of carrying on business in that State. This tax appellants claimed to be in violation of the due process and
equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment
and of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution,
and also of the preamble and sections two and nineteen
of the Ohio constitution.
A restraining order was allowed by the District Court,
and afterwards appellants' motions for temporary injunctions came on for hearing before three judges, of whom
one was a circuit judge, pursuant to § 266 of the Judicial
Code (36 Stat. 1162, c. 231), which went into effect shortly
after the bills were filed. The two cases were argued and
considered together, upon the facts averred in the bills,
which were, for the purposes of the motions, conceded to
be true by appellees, and, after consideration, the temporary injunctions were refused. 203 Fed. Rep. 537.
Appellants come direct to this court, under the same
section of the Code.
The tax law in question, the validity of which is attacked
generally, and also specially in its application to appellants, was enacted in its present form May 31, 1911. (102
Ohio Laws, 224.)
It created a tax commission, with defined powers, and
prescribed various taxes, some upon property and others
upon franchises and privileges, with sundry provisions,
penal and otherwise, for the collection thereof. Some of

these taxes were new in Ohio law, others were carried
over from previously existing statutes.
The tax here in question is limited in its operation to
certain lines of quasi-public business, specifically named
in the act and therein referred to as "public utilities," including railroads.
As applied to railroads, the act requires the filing with
the Tax Commission, by each railroad doing business in
the State, of a statement, on or before September 1, setting
forth, among other things, its "entire gross earnings, including all sums earned or charged, whether actually received or not, for the year ending on the thirtieth day of
June next preceding, from whatever source derived, for
business done within this State, excluding therefrom all
earnings derived wholly from interstate business or business done for the Federal Government. Such statement
shall also contain the total gross earnings of such company
for such period in this State from business done within this
State." (Sections 81 and 83 of Act; §§ 5470 and 5472,
General Code of Ohio.)
It is further provided that on the first Monday of
October the Commission "shall ascertain and determine
the gross earnings as herein provided, of each railroad
company whose line is wholly or partially within this
State, for the year ending on the thirtieth day of June
next preceding, excluding therefrom all earnings derived
wholly from interstate business or business done for the
Federal Government. The amount so ascertained by the
Commission shall be the gross earnings of such railroad
company for such year." (Section 88 of Act; § 5477,
Gen. Code.)
The act further provides that on the first Monday of
November the Commission shall certify to the Auditor
of State the amount of the "gross earnings so determined,"
(§ 93 of Act; §5482, Gen. Code),=--and that-"In the
month of November, the Auditor of State shall charge for

collection, from each railroad company, a sum in the
nature of an excise tax, for the privilege of carrying on its
intrastate business, to be computed on the amount so
fixed and reported to him by the Commission, as the gross
earnings of such company on its intrastate business for
the year . . . by taking four per cent. of all such gross
earnings." (Section 97 of Act; § 5486, Gen. Code.). The
tax is imposed equally and alike on corporations, partnerships, and individuals. (Section 39 of Act; § 5415, Gen.
Code.)

The Federal jurisdiction rests upon the presence of
Federal questions.
The equity jurisdiction rests upon prevention of cloud
upon real estate title, inadequacy of legal remedies,
threatened irreparable damage and prevention of multiplicity of suits. Cooley on Taxation, p. 536; Dows v.

Under the constitution of Ohio, as construed by the
Ohio Supreme Court in Southern Gum Co. v. Laylin, 66 Oh.
St. 578, the legislature is without power to impose a privilege tax which is in excess of the value of the privilege
taxed. Inasmuch as the admitted facts show the present
tax upon appellants to wholly exceed such value, its exaction as to them violates the state constitution, and
amounts to confiscation and a taking of their property
without due process of law. Adler v. Whitbeck, 44 Oh. St.

The four per cent. tax, in the case of railroads, was imposed because of their being extensively engaged in interstate commerce, and was intended to be and is a burden
upon interstate commerce, in violation of the commerce
clause of the Federal Constitution. Brimmer v. Rebman,

the Laylin Case, the result is double taxation. Adams
Exp. Co. v. Ohio, 165 U. S. 194; S. C., 166 U. S. 185.
The tax is based upon all gross earnings, excepting only
such as are derived wholly from interstate business and
business for the Federal Government. The failure to exclude also earnings from foreign commerce, in which appellants are engaged, renders act invalid under commerce
clause. Eidman v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 578; Hepburn v.

prevent judicial inquiry and force obedience to its terms

Mr. Frank Davis, Jr., and Mr. Clarence D. Laylin, with
whom Mr. Timothy S. Hogan, Attorney General of the
State of Ohio, was on the brief, for appellees:
It is necessary to examine into entire system of taxation of the State applicable to railroad companies in order
to determine the validity and effect of the tax involved
in the cases at bar. See Gat., H. & S. An. R. R. Co. v.
Texas, 210 U. S. 217, 226; Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.,
142 U. S. 217; U. S. Exp. Co. v. Minnesota, 223 U. S. 323.
The contention is unfounded in law or in fact that under
the constitution of Ohio, as construed by the Ohio Supreme Court, the legislature is without power to impose
any privilege tax which is in excess of the value of the
privilege taxed, and that inasmuch as the admitted facts
show, it is alleged, the present tax upon appellants to
wholly exceed such value, its exaction as to them violates
the state constitution and amounts to confiscation and
the taking of their property without due process of law.

For the nature of the privilege taxed by the law as involved in Southern Gum Company v. Laylin, and as to its
being the privilege of corporate existence, as distinguished
from the privilege of doing business as a corporation; and
as to the tax being one on the franchise as distinguished
from an excise occupation tax, see 1 Cooley on Taxation,

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

These two cases depend upon practically identical
facts, and present the same questions of law.
The Federal jurisdiction arose because of the Federal
questions presented in the record, and did not depend
upon diversity of citizenship; and it extends of course to

the determination of all the questions presented, irrespective of the disposition that may be made of the Federal
questions. Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 213
U. S. 175, 191; Michigan Central R. Co. v. Vreeland, 227
U. S. 59, 63.
The right to invoke the equity jurisdiction is clear; for
the Act specifically makes the tax a lien upon the real
estate of appellantsr from the cloud of which they sought
,to free it by the bringing of these actions (§ 117 of Act;
§ 5506, Gen. Code); and the bills alleged threatened
irreparable injury through the enforcement of the penalties and coercive features of the Act. Shelton v. Platt,
139 U. S. 591, 598; Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123.
The following are the questions to be disposed of:
First, it is insisted by appellants that under the state
constitution, as construed by the Ohio Supreme Court in
Southern Gum Co. v. Laylin, 66 Oh. St. 578, the legislature is without power to impose a privilege tax which is
in excess of the value of the privilege; that the admitted
facts show the present tax upon appellants respectively
to be in excess of such value; and that therefore as to them
its exaction violates the state constitution, and amounts to
confiscation, and a taking of property without due process
of law.
As to the facts upon which this contention is based, the
bill of complaint of the Marietta, Columbus & Cleveland
Railroad Company shows that the tax charged against it
for the year 1911 amounts to $2,301.24; that the capital
of the company is all, or practically all, invested in its
railroad; that this investment was and is a reasonable
and proper one; that due care and prudence have been
used in the construction, maintenance and operation of
the property and the conduct of the business;, that the
greatest economy has been and is being practiced in the
effort to make the railroad yield a fair return upon the
investment; but that notwithstanding these efforts it has

never been able to earn, and is not now able to earn, from
interstate or intrastate business, or both combined, after
paying necessary and proper expenses, including taxes
other than the excise tax, a return on the investment in its
railroad, or on the value thereof, equal to the current rate
of return on legitimate high-grade investments at all
times readily available in the market; nor have its intrastate earnings, after deducting operating expenses
properly attributable thereto, been sufficient to yield a
return on that portion of its investment properly attributable to intrastate, operations, equal to the current rate
of return on legitimate high-grade investments; that,
on the contrary, the gross earnings have not been and are
not sufficient to pay actual operating expenses, and that
this condition will continue to exist during the year which
the excise tax is intended to cover.
The bill of complaint of the Ohio River and Western
Railway Company contains similar averments, except
as to its inability to pay actual operating expenses. Its
tax amounts to $6,653.60.
The case referred to, Southern Gum Co. v. Laylin, 66
Oh. St. 578, dealt with an Act of April 11, 1902, known as
the Willis Law. The court held it to be an excise or
franchise tax, not a property tax, and therefore not subject to the express limitations imposed by the state constitution upon taxes of the latter kind, but only to such
limitations as were to be implied from certain other provisions of the constitution, respecting which the court
said (p. 594): "The constitution was established to
'promote our common welfare.' Preamble to the constitution. Government is instituted for the equal protection and benefit of the people. Section two of the bill of
rights. Private property shall ever be held inviolate, but
subservient to the public welfare. Section nineteen of the
bill of rights. These provisions of the constitution are
implied limitations upon the power of taxation of privileges

and franchises, and limit such taxation to the reasonable
value of the privilege or franchise conferred originally, or
to its continued value from year to year. Ashley v.
Ryan, 49 Ohio St. 504; State ex rel. v. Ferris, 53 Ohio St.
314; and Hagerty v. State, 55 Ohio St. 613, are examples of
taxing the privilege or franchise conferred; while Telegraph Company v. Mayer, 28 Ohio St. 521, and Express
Company v. State, 55 Ohio St. 69, are examples of taxing
the continued value of the existing privilege or franchise
from year to year. These limitations prevent confiscation
and oppression under the guise of thxation, and the power
of such taxation cannot extend beyond what is for the
common or public welfare, and the equal protection and
benefit of the people; but the ascertaining and fixing of
such values rests largely in the general assembly, but
finally in the courts."
This proposition is carried into the syllabus, which,
under the rules ,f practice of the Supreme Court, is to be
prepared by the judge assigned to prepare the opinion, is to
be confined to the points of law arising from the facts of the
cause- that have been determined by the court, is to be submitted to the judges concurring therein for revisal before
its publication, and is to be inserted in the book of reports.
An examination of the state decisions cited in the
Laylin Case, with others referred to in the opinion of the
District Court and in the briefs of counsel, convinces us
that the District Court was correct in its conclusion that
the state court, in the Laylin Case, dealt with a general
law and its operation on all corporations of given classes
throughout the State, and not with its effect upon specific
financially weak corporations; that it was not intended to
hold that the courts as final arbiters might overthrow a
law imposing a tax on privileges and franchises merely
because in isolated cases such law might impose a hardship,
but only that those excise laws whose general operation is
confiscatory and oppressive are unconstitutional.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

Nor do we think that from the facts of the present case
it is to be inferred that the franchises of plaintiffs in error
are valueless merely because it appears that the present
earnings of the railroads are not sufficient to pay more
than can be derived from legitimate high-grade investment securities that are readily available on the market, or
(in the case of one of the roads), are not even sufficient to
pay operating expenses. Upon this point we are content to refer to, without repeating, the language employed
by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for this court in State
Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 606.
Secondly, it is contended that the Act arbitrarily discriminates against plaintiffs in error and other railroad
companies in that (a), it does not include all other public
utilities carrying on business within the State; those
omitted, as is said, being grain elevators, stock-yards,
ferries, bridge companies, and inn-keepers; and (b), the
law does not operate uniformly among the utilities that
are taxed, since, on electric light, gas, natural gas, water
works, telephone, messenger or signal, union depot,
heating, coaling, and water transportation companies, the
tax amounts to 1.2% of gross intrastate receipts, as to
suburban and interurban railroads it is fixed at 1.2% of
gross intrastate earnings, and on express and telegraph
companies, it is 2%; while on railroads, including plaintiffs in error, it is 4% of such earnings, and the same on
pipe line companies.
Both of these contentions turn upon the familiar question of classification, concerning which so much has been
written. We agree with the court below that whether the
question be considered in view of the uniformity and
equality provisions of the Ohio constitution, or of the
"equal protection" clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
the result is the same; it cannot be said that the classification rests upon no reasonable and sufficient basis of distinction. Strte v. Guilbert, 70 Oh. St. 229, 253; Kentucky

OHIO TAX CASES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

RailroadTax Cases, 115 U. S. 321, 337; Bell's Gap Railroad
Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232, 237; Magoun v.
Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283, 293; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, 217 U. S. 114, 121 et seq.
In the third place, it is insisted that the act, as applied
to railroads, is a burden upon their foreign commerce.
This contention is rested in part upon the language of
§§ 83 and 88, which in terms provide for ascertaining the
earnings of the railroad "from whatever source derived,
for business done within this State, excluding therefrom
all earnings derived wholly from interstate business or
business done for the Federal government." This, it is
argued, has the effect of imposing a tax with respect to the
gross receipts from foreign commerce, because such commerce is not expressly excepted. Section 97, however,
indicates an intent to take into consideration for the
purpose of measuring the excise tax only the earnings upon
intrastate business, and it seems clear enough that in the
former sections the word "interstate" was used as meaning "not intrastate," rather than in its technically correct
signification. Certainly, in the absence of a construction
by the state court of last resort to the effect that the
receipts from foreign commerce are to be included, and
without any attempt on the part of the taxing authorities
to include them, the Federal courts ought not to place a
construction upon the act that would render it unconstitutional.
Fourthly, it is contended that the history of the legislation upon the subject shows that the act of May 31,
1911, was really contrived to impose upon the railroad
companies a franchise tax proportionate to their interstate
commerce, and that such is its acfual as well as intended
effect.
It is said that the present act is a reenactment, without
material change so far as present purposes are concerned,
of an act of March 10, 1910; that prior to the latter act

a law known as the Cole Law was in force, under which
each railroad was compelled to pay a tax equal to one per
centum of its entire gross earnings, computed by multiplying the average gross earnings per mile over the entire
system by the number of miles in Ohio; that this act was
obnoxious to the "commerce clause" of the Federal Constitution, for the reasons that entered into the decision
of this court in Galveston, Harrisburg &c. Ry. Co. v. Texas,
210 U. S. 217; that after the decision of this case in May,
1908, it was anticipated that the Cole Law would probably be held unconstitutional (as it has since been held
by an inferior state court in Ohio), and so the Legislature
contrived the act of March 10, 1910, for the purpose of
imposing a tax upon the railroads as heavy as that imposed by the Cole Law, while avoiding the form of that
enactment; and that for this reason the act of March 10,
1910, increased the percentages in accordance with which
the taxes were to be severally determined as follows: Railroads and pipe line companies from 1 to 4 per cent.;
express and telegraph companies from 1 to 2 per cent.; all
other utilities from 1 to 1 1-5 per cent.; but that instead of
taking all the gross earnings, the new percentages were to
be applied only to intrastate earnings. It is contended
that the increase in the percentages as to railroad and
pipe line companies was due to the fact that it was conceived that about three-fourths of their business was interstate, and that therefore a tax of 4% on the intrastate
earnings would be about equal to a tax of 1% on the total;
in other words, that the tax rate was increased fourfold
because such utilities were engaged in interstate commerce.
The tax is, however, in substance as well as in form, an
excise or privilege tax. Its reasonableness, unless some
Federal right be violated, is within the discretion of the
state legislature. We have seen that the classification
adopted cannot be deemed illusory; that is, there is no

OHIO TAX CASES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

apparent violation of the equality provisions of the state
constitution or of the "equal protection" clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, although railroad and pipe line
companies are required to pay at the rate of four per cent.
of the annual intrastate earnings, while other public service corporations pay a less percentage. It is, of course,
entirely settled that a State cannot, consistently with the
Federal control of interstate commerce, lay such taxes,
either upon property rights or upon franchises or privileges, as in effect to burden such commerce. But the line
is not always easily drawn, as recent cases sufficiently
show. Galveston, Harrisburg &c. Ry. Co. v. Texas, 210
U. S. 217, 225, 229; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota,
223 U. S. 335, 344; Williams v. Talladega, 226 U. S. 404,
416; Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, 231 U. S. 68, 82.
The present act does not on its face manifest a purpose
to interfere with interstate commerce, and we are unable
to accept the historical facts alluded to as sufficient evidence of a sinister purpose, such as would justify this
court in striking down the law. We could not do this
without in effect denouncing the legislature of the State
as guilty of a conscious attempt to evade the obligations
of the Federal Constitution. Assuming the law was
changed in 1910 because of a fear that the Cole Law
would be held unconstitutional, the mere fact that, while
excluding interstate earnings from the multiplicand, the
multiplier was increased, is not of itself deemed sufficient
evidence of an unlawful effort to burden a privilege that
is not a proper subject of state taxation.
Fifthly, it is contended that the act is in effect a double
tax upon property, and hence lacking in the uniformity
required by the state constitution. But, as was pointed
out by the District Court, the exaction of four per cent.
of the gross intrastate earnings is not a property tax but
an excise tax, whose amount is fixed and measured by such
earnings; and double taxation in a legal sense does not

232 U. S.

exist unless the double tax is levied upon the same property within the same jurisdiction. Plaintiffs in error pay
one tax with respect to property, another with respect to
the privilege or occupation; hence the taxation is not
double. Bradley v. Bauder, 36 Oh. St. 28, 35; Southern
Gum Co. v. Laylin, 66 Oh. St. 578, 596.
The so-called double tax is also laid hold of as a grouiid
for the contention that there is a denial of equal protection within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.
This, however, is but another form of the objection to
the classification, which has already been disposed of.
Finally, it is contended that the act is unconstitutional
because of the severity of the penalties imposed for withholding the tax. But these actions do not involve any
present attempt to enforce the penalties; and the act contains a section (160) which in terms declares: "The sections of this act, and every part of such sections, are hereby
declared to be independent sections and parts of sections,
and the holding of any section or part thereof to be void
or ineffective shall not affect any other section or part
thereof." The penalty clauses, if themselves unconstitutional, are severable, and there is therefore no present occasion to pass upon their validity. Ex parte Young, 209
U. S. 123; Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U. S. 19, 53,
