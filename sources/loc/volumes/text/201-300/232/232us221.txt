and less than carload lots. It may decide whether the
difference in revenue, due to a difference in method of
loading, warrants a difference in the rate on carload shipments of the same article. It may prescribe the form in
which schedules shall be prepared and arranged (§ 6) and
may approve tariffs stating that the single rate includes
both the line haul and accessorial services absorbed in the
rate. Conversely, it may prescribe a tariff fixing a through
rate which includes not only the haul of the fruit, but the
haul of the ice necessary to keep the fruit in condition. All
these are matters committed to the decision of the administrative body, which, in each instance, is required to
fix reasonable rates and establish reasonable practices.
The courts have not been vested with any such power.
They cannot make rates. They cannot interfere with
rates fixed or practices established by the Commission
unless it is made plainly to appear that those ordered are

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 171.

Argued January 19, 1914.-Decided February 2, 1914.

While a corporation cannot, without authority from the stockholders,
make them answerable in a way not contemplated by the charter,
a provision in the charter of a corporation organized in one State
authorizing it to do business in another State may subject the stock-

latter State, notwithstanding
there are other provisions in the charter exempting. stockholders
from liability for debts of the corporation.
Stockholders of a corporation organized in one State under a charter
expressly authorizing it to do business in another State create the
corporation their agent for the making of contracts within the
latter State in accordance with its laws.
Stockholders of a corporation organized in Arizona under a charter
which expressly authorized the corporation to do business in California held, in this case, subject to the liability imposed by § 322,
Civil Code of the latter State.
Under the laws of Caliornia a stockholder is liable for his proportion
of the debts of the corporation as a principal and not as a surety;
nor in this case was he relieved of liability on notes held by a bank
which had deposits to the credit of the corporation and did not
apply the same to payment of the notes.
192 Fed. Rep. 495, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the liability under the laws of
California of a stockholder of a corporation organized in
Arizona for the purpose of carrying on business in California, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Alfred Adams Wheat, with whom Mr. Philip Ashton Rollins was on the brief, for petitioner:
This case is controlled by Pinney v. Nelson, 183 U. S.
144, the doctrine enunciated in which has been accepted
by the courts of California and has been approved by
State v. New Orleans Warehouse Co., 109 Louisiana, 72.
See also Peck v. Noee, 154 California, 341.
In Thomas v. Wentworth Hotel Co., 158 California, 275,
the court met every point that could be used to distinguish this case from Pinney v. Nelson, except the facts
that defendant is not a resident of California, and that
there is a finding of fact that it was the purpose and intent
of subscribers that their obligations as such and as stockholders should be controlled and determined by the articles of incorporation of said company and by the-laws of
Arizona. Neither of these findings supplies a sound rea-

son for varying the rule and therefore defendant is liable
under the law of California.
The fact that the articles of incorporation contain a
declaration, as authorized by the Arizona law, that the
stockholders shall not be personally liable for the debts of
the corporation, does not distinguish this case from Pinney v. Nelson. See 26 Am. & Eng. Enc. (2d ed.), 1017;
Terry v. Little, 101 U. S. 216; Citizens Savings Bank v.
Owensboro, 173 U. S. 636, 644; Knights of Pythiasv. Weller,
93 Virginia, 605, 613; Danville v. Water Co., 178 Illinois,
299, 306.
The finding that it was the purpose and intent of the
stockholders that their obligations should be controlled by
the articles of incorporation and by the laws of Arizona,
does not distinguish this case from Pinney v. Nelson.

Risdon Iron Works v. Furness, L. R. (1906) 1 K. B. 49,
does not apply. See Keener on Quasi-Contracts, p. 5.
The fact that defendant is not a resident of California
does not distinguish this case from Pinney v. Nelson.
As defendant contracted to assume the liabilities imposed by the California law for debts incurred by the
corporation in that State the place of his residence is not
material.
The stockholders' liability imposed by the law of
California is contractual in nature. Kennedy v. California

The California statute provides no peculiar remedy and
therefore the general liability created thereby may be enforced by a common-law action in the Federal court.
Mills v. Scott, 99 U. S. 25; National ParkBank v. Peary, 64
Fed. Rep. 912; Aldrich v. Anchor Coal Co., 24 Oregon, 32.
The liability of a stockholder under the California law
is not that of a surety but is primary, absolute, unconditional, and in no wise contingent, and it is distinct from
that of the corporation. A suspension or bar of the remedy against the corporation does not suspend or bar it
against the stockholder. It is not affected by any security
given to or held by the creditor or by any lien acquired by
him through judgment, attachment or otherwise. It is
not released or diminished by any extension of time given
to the corporation, and if the stockholder discharges his
liability to a creditor he can recover no portion of the same
back, either by subrogation or otherwise. Mokelumne Hill
Co. v. Woodburn, 14 California, 265; Davidson v. Rankin,

Even though the personal liability of a stockholder
under the California law were merely that of a surety the
facts alleged in the supplemental answer would not constitute a defense.
A bank, the payee or holder of a note, does not discharge a surety by failing to apply money of the maker

Pinney v. Nelson, 183 U. S. 144, does not establish the
right of the petitioner to a recovery. In that case the only
question decided by the California court was the constitutionality of § 322 of the Civil Code of California. That
was the sole question presented for determination.

The decision in that case that when a corporation is
formed in one State and "by the express terms of its
charter it is created for doing business in another State and
business is done in that State it must be assumed that the
charter contract was made with reference to" the laws of
the latter State, was expressly based upon the special and
peculiar provision of the charter there under consideration,
that the company was "created for doing business" in
the other State. The court did not hold that if it clearly
appeared upon a fair construction of the charter that the
parties in fact contracted with a view to the laws of the
incorporating State, the court must nevertheless assume
the contrary in order to impose upon the stockholders a liability which they never agreed to assume and from which
they were exempt by the laws of the incorporating State*
and by the company's express charter provisions. Risdon
Iron Works v. Furness,L. R. (1905) 1 K. B. 304, S. C., L. R.
(1906) 1 K. B. 49; Thomas v. Matthiessen, 192 Fed. Rep. 495.
. In this case the charter provided that the capital stock
should be non-assessable, and that the private property
of the stockholders in the company should be forever
"exempt from all, liability for its debts and obligations."
The trial below having been by the court without a
jury, the court's findings of fact are not a mere report of
the evidence, but a statement of the ultimate facts on
which the law of the case must determine the rights of the
parties. Norris v. Jackson, 9 Wall. 125. And see Miller
v. Life-Ins. Co., 12 Wall. 285; Raimond v. Terre Bonne, 132
U. S.192; Collins v. Riley, 104 U. S.322.
The law cannot read into the contract of the incorporators and stockholders an agreement to assume a
liability under the California statute which is inconsistent
with their actual intent and with the express stipulations
of the charter. Grover & Baker v. Radcliffe, 137 U. S.287.

No court outside of California has ever considered that
the Pinney Case declared or was authority for any such
rule of liability as petitioner contends. Coulter Dry Goods

involving the existence or enforceability of liability of

If, under any such rule of liability as plaintiff contends
for, innocent stockholders are chargeable not merely with
the liabilities imposed by the law of the domicil of the
corporation, but as well with the varying liabilities prescribed by the laws of the various States where the corporation under its charter powers, may engage in business,
corporate stock is liable to become in this country an
uncertain and even dangerous asset. Tnomas v. Matthiessen, 192 Fed. Rep. 495, 498; Leyner EngineeringWorks

California is not sufficient to overcome the inference as to
the intent of the incorporators to contract with reference

to the laws of Arizona.
While the laws of a foreign State in which the company may attempt to do business may prevent the doing
of business or limit the exercise of the corporate powers,
Relfe v. Rundle, 103 U. S. 222, 226, such laws cannot enlarge the powers of the corporation or provide for the

conduct of its business in a way which is not permitted
by the law of its incorporation. Nor can such laws affect
the position of the stockholders in the company by enlarging, limiting or modifying their rights as members
of the corporation or by altering their liabilities to its
creditors as fixed by the law under and subject to which
they became stockholders. Railway Co. v. Allerton,

MR. JuSTICE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit by a citizen of California, the-holder of
two notes made in California by the Wentworth Hotel
Company, to recover from a stockholder in that corporation, a citizen of New York, a proportionate share of the
sums due upon the same. The facts as agreed and found
are as follows. The corporation was formed under the
laws of the Territory of Arizona, among many other
things, to'buy and sell real estate, 'to build, maintain,
operate and carry on, in all its branches, the business of
hotel keeping' and to build or purchase gas or electric
works in Arizona or California, 'both for its own use in
the hotel business and for the purpose of selling and disposing of the same.' The principal place of business in
Arizona was Tucson, and that outside of it was Los
Angeles, California, with power to change to Pasadena, in
that State. Before the incorpotation, the defendant, re-

Opinion of the Court.

siding in New York, signed a writing reciting the intent
of the subscribers to form a corporation in Arizona for the
purpose of acquiring a portion of the Oak Knoll, and building a first class hotel thereon; and he thereby subscribed
for a certain number of shares. Later he took and paid
for one thousand shares. The Oak Knoll is near Pasadena
in California, and the defendant and his associates intended the corporation to have the power to build and
manage a hotel in that neighborhood and expected that
it would do so, but intended their liability to be controlled
by the laws of Arizona.
The corporation complied with the laws of California,
bought the land, built the hotel, went into business, and
finally was adjudged insolvent. The notes in question
were given for loans to the Company. At the time of
subscribing the defendant agreed with the Company that
he should be exempt from personal liability and that neither the corporation nor its officers should have power to
subject him or the other stockholders to it.. Such exemption was expressed also in the certificate of incorporation.
But by the statutes of California each stockholder of a
corporation is personally liable for such proportion of the
debts contracted while he is such, as the amount of his
stock bears to the whole subscribed, and the liability of
each stockholder of a corporation formed under the laws
of any other State or Territory of the United States but
doing business in California is the same. Civil Code,
§ 322. The courts below ruled that the defendant could
not be held, the Circuit Court of Appeals citing Risdon
Iron & Locomotive Works v. Furness (1906), 1 K. B. 49,
in which it was held that the law of California could not
impose liability upon an English shareholder in an English

contemplated by the charter. We will assume for purposes of decision, although we express no opinion upon the
point, that a provision for doing business in other States
without any express reference to the possible difference in
their laws would not be enough to change the rule. But a
provision exempting the stockholder alongside of one authorizing the doing of business elsewhere cannot be taken
to limit the latter authority to those States that grant a
like exemption or be deemed an attempt to override the
law of the place where the business is to be done. That
law may fail to operate for want of power over the person
sought to be affected, but the charter leaves it open to that
person to come in under it by assent. If the law of
California forbade a foreign corporation to do business
there unless all the stockholders filed a written assent to
its conditions, the Arizona charter would not make such
an agreement void. If this be true then a particular
stockholder may give such assent outside of the instrument
of incorporation and be bound by it.
In this case the defendant expressed in writing his wish
that the corporation should set up a hotel in California.
It is true that he also desired and stipulated that he should
be free from personal charge. But that is merely the not
infrequent occurrence of a party bringing about the facts
and attempting to prohibit their legal consequence to
which we lately had occasion to advert in National City
Bank v. Hotchkiss, 231 U. S. 50, 56. See also Butler v.
Farnsworth, 4 Wash. C. C. 101, 103, 104. This of course
he cannot do. In such cases the only question is which of
two inconsistent orders is the dominant command. Here
the usual prevalence of the specific over the general is
fortified by the consideration that the building and carrying on of the California hotel was the main object for
which the parties came together. When the defendant
authorized that, he could not avoid the consequences by
saying that he did not foresee or intend, or that he forbade

them. He knew that California had laws and he took his
risk of what they might be, when, as we must hold, he
gave his assent to doing business there. We cannot interpret his words as giving merely a conditional assent.
We follow the language of Pinney v. Nelson, 183 U. S.
144, so far as it sanctions the views that we have expressed.

275, 280.
There remains only the question whether the liability is
of a kind that will be enforced outside of the California
courts. Analysis on this point often is blurred by the
vague statement that the liability is 'contractual.' An
obligation to pay money generally is enforced by an action
of assumpsit and to that extent is referred to a contract
even though it be one existing only by fiction of law. But
such obligations when imposed upon the members of a
corporation may vary very largely. The incorporation
may create a chartered partnership the members of which
are primary contractors, or it may go no farther than to
impose a penalty; or again it may create a secondary
remedy for a debt treated as that of the corporation
alone, like the right to attach the corporation's real estate;
or the liability may be inseparable from the local procedure,
or the law may be so ambiguous as to leave it doubtful
whether the liability is matter of remedy and' local or
creates a contract on the part of the members that will
go with them wherever they are found. McClaine v.
Rankin, 197 U. S. 154, 161. Christopher v. Norvell, 201
U. S. 216, 225, 226. In the present case we think that
there can be no doubt of the meaning of the California
statute. It reads 'Each stockholder of a corporation is
individually and personally liable for such proportion of
its debts and liabilities' &c., as we have stated, and supposes the action against him to be brought 'upon such
debt.' Civil Code §322. This means that by force of the
statute, if the corporation incurs a debt within the juris-

diction, the stockholder is a party to it and joins in the
contract in the proportion of his shares. And while the
statutes of California cannot force an agent upon a foreign
principal, still, if he has created such an agency in advance, he has come within the jurisdiction by his agent, as
in other cases of contract made within a State from outside, and will be bound. Flash V. Conn, 109 U. S. 371.

No. 20.

Argued October 31, 1913.-Decided February 2, 1914.

Although the record is meager of attempts to raise it, if.the state court
holds that a Federal question is made before it, according t its
practice, and proceeds to determine it, this court regards the question as duly made.
It is only in exceptional cases, where what purports to be a finding of
fact is not strictly such but is so involved with, and dependent upon,
questions of law, that this court departs from the rule that it accepts
