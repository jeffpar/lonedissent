Argument for Appellant.

THURSTON v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 605.

Submitted December 22, 1913.-Decided February 24, 1914.

The Court of Claims has no general jurisdiction over claims against
the United States and can take cognizance only of those which are
committed to it by some act of Congress. Johnson v. United States,
160 U. S. 546.
A claim embraced by § 1 of the Indian Depredation Act of March 3,
1891, but which accrued prior to July 1, 1865, is not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims if it falls within the restriction clause
of § 2 because not allowed or pending prior to the passage of the act.
An appeal to the bounty or generosity of Congress for damages sustained from depredations by other than Indians cannot be considered
as a claim for reparation for depredations of Indian wards of the
Government within the meaning of the act of 1891.
Jurisdiction of a claim which accrued in 1857, was never allowed and
was not pending as a claim for depredations by Indians, was expressly
withheld by the act of 1891, and the fact that the same claim was
presented to Congress as a claim for depredations by Mormons does
not bring it within the jurisdiction.
THE facts, whici involve the jurisdiction of the Court of
Claims under the Indian Depredation Act of March 3,
1891, and what constitutes a presentation of a claim
against the United States for depredations by Indians under the act, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Harry Peyton, Mr. F. Sprigg Perry and Mr. J. W.
Clark for appellant:
The Indian Depredation Act does not require that the
word "Indian" should have been used in the petition
which was filed in Congress.
If the words of a law are clear, there can be no construction which will alter the plain meaning of the words themselves. United States v. Temple, 105 U. S. 97, 99; Maxwell

232 U. S.

v: Moore, 22 How. 185, 191; Thornley v. United States,
113 U. S. 310, 313.
In this act Congress has stated that there must have
been a claim pending. It did not say that there must have
been a claim pending against Indians, or that the tribe
of Indians should be named, or that the word "Indian"
should appear.
The definition of the term "claim pending" is a claim
for a depredation committed by Indians which was pending at the time of the passage of the act. That term is
plainly used in the act as a definition of the character of
the claim. It is simply a phrase descriptive of a certain
class of cases, and was not intended as a technical rule
of pleading. Appellant's claim falls within this definition.
Throughout the entire act, the purpose of Congress is
shown to be that of the utmost liberality in the manner
of presenting claims. A claim must necessarily be one for
a depredation committed by Indians. No technicalities
are permitted to stand in the way of a just claim.

United

States v. Gorham, 165 U. S. 316.
The claim of the appellant arose out of an Indian
depredation. There is no question but that the Indians

committed the outrage and took the property and the
Court of Claims has so held.
As to rules governing construction of statutes bearing
on this case, see United States v. Fisher, 2 Cr. 358.
There can be no construction where there is no ambiguity. This is peculiarly applicable .to the present case.
A survey of the entire act strengthens this contention
and shows that Congress intended to waive technical
objections and to include all just claims. See Johnson v.
United States, 160 U. S. 546; White v. United States, 191
U. S. 545, 550; Sturges v. Crowninshield,4 Wheat. 122, 202;
Potter's edition of Dwarris, p. 199; 2 Lewis' Sutherland,
2d ed., § 367.

THURSTON v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Argument for Appellant.

The act must be read literally so as to include all claims
embraced by this clause. Lewis v. United States, 92 U. S.
618; Bate RefrigeratingCo. v. Sulzberger, 157'U. S. 1, citing
Scott v. Reid, 10 Pet. 524, 527; Brewer v. Blougher, 14
Pet. 178, 198. See also Market Co. v. Hoffman, 101 U. S.
116; Petri v. Commercial Bank, 142 U. S. 650; McKee v.
United States, 164 U. S. 23; United States v. Goldenberg,
168 U. S. 95.
Congress is presumed to know the meaning of words
and the rules of grammar. When Congress used the term
"claim pending" it meant what it said and not that a
claim had to be pending against the Indians. Lake Co. v.
Rollins, 130 U. S. 662; Dewey v. United States, 178 U. S.
510; Marks v. United States, 161 U. S. 297; Yerke v. United
States, 173 U. S. 439.
As to the proviso, it plainly relates solely to the part
of the enacting clause which provides for the time of
filing claims.
The enacting clause that "all questions of the manner of
presenting claims is hereby waived" applies equally to
claims for depredations which occurred before and after
July 1, 1865.
For the rule limiting the effeot of a proviso to the clause
which it affects, see Sedgwick on Interpretation, § 186,
p. 257; Spring v. Collector, 78 Illinois, 101; Lehigh Co. v.
Meyer, 102 Pa. St. 479; Minis v. United States, 15 Pet.
423, 445.
The office of this proviso is to qualify that portion of
the enacting clause which relates to the time of the filing
of claims and to exclude certain cases from its operation.
This is the usual and regular office of a proviso and it is so
used in the present act. Compare cases of American Exp.
Co. v. United States, 212 U. S. 422, 434; Burlingham v.
Crouse, 228 U. S. 459, 471; White v. United States, 191
U. S. 545.
The general office of the proviso is to restrain generality

and to prevent misinterpretation. Interstate Comm.
Commn. v. Baird; 194 U. S. 25, 36.
In this case the proviso does not relate to that part of
the enacting clause which waives all questions of the
manner of presenting claims. This is an entirely separate
and distinct part of the enacting clause and the dependent
proviso is in no way connected with it. Nesbitt v. United
States, 186 U. S. 153.
Congress was in no way bound by any rules or regulations of the Secretary of the Interior. Leahy v. United
States, 41 Ct. Cls. 266. And see United States v. Martinez,
195 U. S. 469.
The saving clause of § 2 preserves from the operation
of the proviso those cases which were pending at the time
of the passage of the act. United States v. Martinez, 195
U. S. 476.
For the rule of construction relative to the interpretation of dependent clauses, see Ryan v. Carter, 93 U. S.
78; United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141.
Unless this case falls clearly within the terms of the proviso it is to be consialered as falling within the terms of the
general enacting and saving clauses. Schlemmer v. Buffalo
&c. Railroad, 205 U. S. 1, 10; Javierre v. Central Alta-,
gracia, 217 U. S. 502.
In the determination of claims for Indian depredations
filed in the Interior Department, it was not necessary that
notice be given to the Indians. Jaeger v. United States, 27
Ct. Cls. 278, 287; Leahy v. United States, 41 Ct. Cls. 266.
The court will not undertake to prescribe for Congress
any technical rules for pleading.
For a further construction of the term "claim pending"
as used in the Tucker and Bowman acts, see cases of
Cahalan, 42 Ct. Cls. 281, and Cofer, 30 Ct. Cls. 131,
134.
The purpose of § 2 was to protect diligent claimants
and to prevent the filing of stale claims. Weston v. United

The Government cannot claim it was in any way prejudiced by the defective manner in which this claim was
filed before Congress.
The massacre which occurred at Mountain Meadows
was a public event of great and horrible interest and was
of general notoriety throughout the length and breadth of
the land. Numerous official investigations and reports to
Congress were made by the Indian Office and War Department as early as 1858 and 1859. In all of these reports it officially appeared that the Indians committed
the massacre under the leadership of the Mormons.
The courts, and Congress as well, will take judicial
notice of a matter of history. Bank of Augusta v. Earle,
13 Pet. 519, 590; United States v. Union Pac. R. R., 91
U. S. 72, 79; 1 Greenleaf's Evidence, 15th ed., § 5; Swinnerton v. Columbia Ins. Co., 37 N. Y. 174.
A recovery can be denied in this case only upon highly
technical grounds. The equities of the case are all in
favor of the claimant. The claimant lost her property
as set out in the petition and the Court of Claims has found
this fact from the evidence. It is only by a forced and
strained construction of the act that the Government
can exclude this claim.
A construction of this statute in accordance with the
contention of the Government would be in violation of
that liberality which characterizes the act.
The findings disclose that they are full and adequate
and protect every substantial right of the Government.

546; Wisconsin Cent. R. R. Co. v. United States, 164 U. S.
190, 202.
The Indian Depredation Act required that a claim
which accrued previous to July 1, 1865, must, as presented
to Congress, have charged Indians with having committed
the depredation. All records show that in all cases the
claim of the petitioner for redress charges the Mormons
with having committed the depredations. Nowhere are
Indians mentioned. Under the act the claim, having
arisen previous to July 1, 1865, as presented to Congress
must have named and charged Indians with having committed the -depredation, and the bills introduced must
also have charged Indians. Otherwise, this claim was not
pending prior to the passage of the Indian Depredation
Act of 1891. Marks v. United States, 161 U. S. 297,
306.
The proviso of the act is one of limitation, and in order
that the Court of Claims might have jurisdiction, a claim
which accrued prior to July 1, 1865, must have been filed
in Congress prior to March 3, 1891.
Appellant's petition before Congress, having prayed for
a gratuity, did not allege a claim.
Under Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 615, a claim
is a demand of some matter as of right.
Appellant had no claim against the Mormons for which
the United States would be liable. At the same time the
petitions and the affidavits filed therein, having failed to
name Indians, would lead to the irresistible conclusion
that she had abandoned what claim, if any, she had
against them. Therefore, her asserted "claim pending"
was not a claim, but merely an appeal to the generosity
of Congress, and did not come within the meaning of the
proviso of § 2 of the act.
The court, having found from the evidence that both
Indians and Mormons confiscated the property, could not

have entered any other judgment than that of dismissal
of the petition.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This suit was begun in the Court of Claims in 1892,
under the Indian Depredation Act of March 3, 1891,
c. 538, 26 Stat. 851, to recover from the United States and
the Ute Indians the value of certain personal property
alleged to have belonged to appellant's intestate and to
have been taken and destroyed by members of the Ute
tribe in 1857. It was also alleged that the claim had been
presented to, and was pending before, the House of
Representatives in 1877 and 1878. The allegations of the
petition were traversed, and a trial resulted in a judgment
of dismissal for want of jurisdiction, upon the ground that
the claim accrued before July 1, 1865, and had not been
presented to Congress, or any officer authorized to inquire
into such claims, prior to the act of 1891, and so was not
cognizable under that act.
The facts disclosed in the findings and material to be
noticed are these: The depredation occurred at Mountain
Meadows, Utah, September 11, 1857, while the appellant's
intestate was en route, with an emigrant train, from
Arkansas to California, his life being taken at the time.
In 1877 and again in 1878 one of his daughters, on behalf
of his heirs, presented to Congress a petition praying that
they be reimbursed for the property from the public
treasury. The petitions, as also the accompanying affidavits, represented that the depredation was committed by
Mormons acting under the direction of Brigham Young,
and contained no suggestion that it was in any wise
chargeable to Ute Indians or to any Indians.. In response
to each of the petitions a bill was introduced in the House
of Representatives, reciting that the depredation was con,

mitted by Mormons at the instance of Brigham Young,
and making an appropriation to reimburse the heirs as
prayed in the petition, but neither bill was passed and the
claim was not otherwise recognized by Congress. In no
other way or form was the claim presented to or pending
-before any department of the Government, or any of its
officers or agents, prior to the passage of the act of 1891.
Preliminarily, it is well to observe that the Court of
Claims has no general jurisdiction over claims against the
United States and can take cognizance only of those
which by the terms of some act of Congress are committed
to it. Johnson v. United States, 160 U. S.546, 549.
Turning to the act of 1891 we find that it is not couched
in general terms, but, on the contrary, carefully specifies
what claims may be considered and as carefully points
out some which it is intended shall not be considered.
It is entitled "An Act to provide -for the adjudication
and payment of claims arising from Indian depredations."
Its first section empowers the court to inquire into and
adjudicate, among others not material here, "All claims
for property of citizens of the United States taken or
destroyed by Indians belonging to any band, tribe, or
nation in amity with the United States, without just
cause or provocation on the part of the owner or agent
in charge, and not returned or paid for." And the second
section declares, 26 Stat. 852:
"That all questions of limitations as to time and manner of presenting claims are hereby waived, and no claim
shall be excluded from the jurisdiction of the court because not heretofore presented to the Secretary of the Interior or other officer or department of the Government:
Provided, That no claim accruing prior to July first,
eighteen hundred and sixty-five, shall be considered by
the court unless the claim shall be allowed or has been
or is pending prior to the passage of this act, before the
Secretary of the Interior or the Congress of the United

THURSTON v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

States, or before any superintendent, agent, sub-agent
or commissioner, authorized under any act of Congress
to enquire into such claims; but no case shall be considered pending unless evidence has been presented
therein:

"

Assuming, without so deciding, that the clause quoted
from the first section, if not otherwise restrained, is broad
enough to embrace the present claim, notwithstanding
some of its particulars not here noticed, we come to consider whether it is within the restrictive clause in the
second section, declaring that no claim accruing prior
to July 1, 1865, shall be considered unless it was allowed
or was pending prior to the passage of the act. To a
bette understanding of this clause and the preceding
one in the same section it is well to recall that there.was an
existing limitation of time upon the presecution of claims
against the Government, (Rev. Stat., § 1069,) and that
there had been and were then various statutory and treaty
provisions regulating the manner of presenting claims for
Indian depredations, by whom they were to be examined,
and the evidence required to sustain them. 4 Stat. 729,
731, c. 161, § 17; 11 Stat. 388, 401, c. 66, § 8; 12 Stat. 120,
Res. No. 26; 16 Stat. 335, 360, c. 296, § 4; 17 Stat. 165,
190, c. 233, § 7; Rev. Stat., §§ 466, 2098, 2156, 2157;
23 Stat. 362, 376, c. 341; 13 Stat. 674, Art. 6; 15 Stat. 620,
Arts. 5 and 6. Both clauses must be read in the light of
those limitations and provisions, and when this is done, it
is apparent that Congress, while disposed to be very liberal
in waiving prior restrictions upon the time and mode of
presenting such claims, deemed it unwise to open the door
so wide in respect of claims accruing prior to July 1, 1865,
and therefore declared that the 'court should not consider
them, save where they had been allowed or had been pending prior to the passage of the act.
The present claim accrued in 1857, was never allowed,
and was not a pending claim before the date of the act,

unless it can be said that it was pending before Congress
in 1877 and 1878. We think this cannot properly be said.
The claim to which the attention of Congress was invited
in those years was not for an act of depredation by Indians,
but, as was stated in the petitions and accompanying affidavits and in the bills introduced in response thereto,
was for a depredation by Mormons. No one could understand from the petitions and affidavits or from the bills
that there was any purpose to claim indemnity from the
Government on the ground that the depredation was
committed by its Indian wards or to obtain reparation
from the latter through the exertion of the Government's
control over them. Rightly speaking, it was merely an
appeal to the bounty or generosity of Congress, and probably was so regarded by the latter. At all events it was
not an assertion or presentation of the claim which is
the subject of this suit, for the latter is for an act of depredation by Indians, not by Mormons. We are accordingly of opinion that the claim is one, jurisdiction of which
is expressly withheld from the Court of Claims by the
act of 1891.
Judgment affirmed.
