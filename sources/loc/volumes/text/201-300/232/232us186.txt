under governmental control, and are transferred by the
delivery of such documents as we have here. There is no
warrant for saying that creditors are misled by delusive
appearances. The usage serves a fair purpose and there
is no public policy which requires that the trade should be
thrown into disorder by a refusal to uphold it. It is urged
that frauds may be perpetrated by the duplication of such
documents; but the present dispute does not call for the
determination of the equities as between two innocent
purchasers. We are concerned here simply with the
rights of creditors represented by a trustee in bankruptcy
and we agree with the court below in its conclusion that,
in the circumstances disclosed, his right is inferior to that
of the appellee.

CHAPMAN & DEWEY LUMBER CO. v. ST. FRANCIS
LEVEE DISTRICT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
ARKANSAS.
No. 82. Argued December 12, 1913.-Decided January 26, 1914.
Whether particular lands patented by the.United States to a State have
passed from the latter to one or the other of two persons claiming
adversely through the State is a question of local law, but whether
the patent from the United States embraced the lands is a Federal
question.
Where public lands are patented "according to the official plat of the
survey returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General," the notes, lines, landmarks and other particulars appearing
upon the plat become as much a part of the patent, and are as much

to be considered in determining what it is intended to include, as if
they were set forth in it.
The specification in a patent of the acreage of the land conveyed is an
element of the description, and, while of less influence than other
elements, is yet an aid in ascertaining what land was intended.
A patent for "the whole" of a township "according to the official plat
of the survey" is here construed, in view of what appeared upon
the plat and of the-acreage specified in the patent, as embracing the
whole of the surveyed lands in the township, but not an unsurveyed
area, approximating 8,000 acres, which was represented upon the
plat as a meandered body of water.
The Swamp Land Act of 1850 in itself passed to the State only an inchoate title, and not until the lands were listed and patented under
the act could the title become perfect.
The compromise and settlement negotiated in 1895 between the
United States and the State of Arkansas, whereby the latter relinquished its inchoate title to all swamp lands not theretofore patented, approved or confirmed to it, is binding on the St. Francis
Levee District as a subordinate agency of the State. Little v. Williams, 231 U. S. 335.
100 Arkansas, 94, reversed.

The facts, which involve the construction of a patent
for swamp lands to a State and the extent of the lands
conveyed thereby, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Henry D. Ashley, with whom Mr. William S.
Gilbertwas on the brief, for plaintiffs in error:
The whole township theory, which is the only one which,
would put the title in the Levee Board, is against decisions
of this court, rulings of the Land Department and the
entire system for the survey and disposition of the public
lands. 37 L. D. 345; 37 L. D. 462; Cragin v. Powell, 128

lakes from natural or artificial causes, since the survey and
disposition of the adjacent shore lands, do not belong to
the United States but to the riparian owners. Hardin v.
Jordan, 140 U. S. 371; Mitchell v. Smale, 140 U. S. 406;
Kean v. Calumet Club, 190 U. S. 466; Whittaker v. McBride,
197 U. S. 510; Harrisonv. Fite, 148 Fed. Rep. 781; Grand
Rapids & I. R. Co. v. Butler, 159 U. S. 87.
The common-law doctrine of riparian rights is fully
recognized in Arkansas. Harrisonv. Fite, 148 Fed. Rep.
781; Warren v. Chambers, 25 Arkansas, 120; Rhodes v.
Cissell, 82 Arkansas, 367; Little v. Williams, 88 Arkansas,
37.
On the question whether the title is still in the United
States or in plaintiff in error, so far as the Land Department has power to pass on this question it has rendered
diametrically opposed decisions. Hardin v. Jordan, 140
U. S. 371.
While the courts have generally held the doctrine of
estoppel as not applicable to the United States, where
private rights have accrued and parties have changed their
condition on the faith of the ruling of the Land Department, there should be some consistent continuity to such
rulings. Noble v. Union Logging Co., 147 U. S. p. 176;
United States v. Stone, 2 Wall. 525, 535. See also application for survey, 23 L. D. 430; Ex parte Michael Denody,
11 L. D. 504; United States v. Bank of Metropolis, 15 Pet.
377.
It does not appear from the circumstances of this case
that any action has been taken by the Government through
any of its officers which should operate as an equitable
estoppel.
Riparian rights are based upon the common law and are
older than this Government, are part of Lex Nature,
have no dependence on plats or surveys, and are important
legal incidents to grants. Both by the common law and
by the provisions of ยง 2476, Rev. Stat. (Kean v. Calumet

Argument for the United States, as amicus curix.

Canal Co., 190 U. S. p. 480; Scott v. Lattig, 227 U. S. 229)
in the absence of the survey system a description of
this property would carry the bottom of non-navigable
lakes.
Nothing but surveyed area can pass as swamp land
because the entire vesting of title has its origin in the
Swamp-Land Act of 1850, which, though in the earlier
cases described as a grant in prcesenti, calls for surveys and
selections and patents.
The mistake in the surveys which prevented the doctrine
of Hardinv. Jordanand cases following from being applied
in cases of Horne v. Smith, 159 U. S. p. 40, and Niles v.
Cedar Point Club, 175 U. S. p. 300, would equally apply
to mistake in a metes and bounds description which was
based on a private survey or on no survey at all, but called
for ancient monuments, such as trees, and so forth, and
failed in its courses and distances to go to the water
covered area for which the description called.
Whether areas outside meander lines as marked on
government plats passed as swamp lands under the
act of 1850, and surveys, selections, and patents made in
pursuance thereof is a pure question of the construction of
the Federal statutes, but the question of whether nonnavigable lakes and ponds have passed by riparian right
as an incident to a conveyance of bordering lands meandered in any method on such lakes and ponds is a question
of common law.
By leave of the court, The Solicitor General, on behalf
of the United States as amicus curice, submitted:
The lands involved in this controversy, and other
similar areas in the State of Arkansas, generally known as
"sunk lands" and sometimes erroneously designated as
"lakes," were omitted from the original public land surveys. In the year 1908 the Secretary of the Interior, after
hearing persons interested, including the parties to this

232 U. S.

litigation, decided that the "sunk lands" here involved
and other areas of like character, not having been surveyed or specifically disposed of, remained the property of
the United States, and accordingly ordered that they be surveyed and held for disposition under the general land laws.
See "Arkansas Sunk Lands," 37 L. D. 345, S.C., ib. 462.
Homestead rights are being asserted to a large part, if not
practically all, of these "sunk lands," and suits have been
begun by the United States, and others are in immediate
prospect, for the purpose of clearing its title against all
adverse claims, including such as are asserted by the
respective parties to the case at bar. Approximately
40,000 acres will be embraced in these suits.
The record in the present case being silent as to the
existence of the Government's claim, this suggestion of it is
made, not as bearing upon the merits of the controversy
now presented, but as a matter of possible interest to the
court in guarding its opinion.
Mr. Samuel Adams, with whom Mr. H. F. Roleson,
Mr. J. C. Hawthorne and Mr. N. F. Lamb were on the
brief, for defendant in error:
Complete title to the entire township passed to the
State of Arkansas under the Swamp-Land Act (9 Stat.
520; Rev. Stat. ยง2479), and see 11 Stat. 251.
The Swamp-Land Act did not require that the lands be
surveyed but only identified as coming within the terms
of the act. See In re Florida, 8 L. D. 65, 18 L. D. 26,
19 L. D. 251, 24 L. D. 147.
It may be noted also that some of the earlier surveys
ordered by Congress in the Northwest Territory provided
that only part of the townships should be subdivided.

Where the description of lands in a conveyance is clear
the entire area within the description will pass and no

As the areas shown on plats of surveys made before the
Swamp-Land Acts were passed, were made primarily for
the purpose of ascertaining the quantity of upland for

Property rights of municipal corporations cannot be
taken away by legislative action without compensation.
This rule especially applies where it is contemplated that
the district should expend money and incur financial
obligations on the faith of the grant made.
Concerning the suggestions filed by the Solicitor General
on behalf of the United States as amicus curix, it is to be
noted that the decisions in 37 L. D. 342 and 462 are contrary to two former opinions of the Department in August,
1894, and November 17, 1892, and are based principally
on the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court in Little v.
Williams, 88 Arkansas, 37, now pending in this court on
writ of error and expressly distinguished by the Arkansas
Supreme Court in this case. Nowhere in the departmental
opinions is there any finding that the lands were not
swamp or overflowed. In fact, it is stated that they were
such. 37 L. D. 348.
If homesteaders are going on these lands, it is of importance that the proper interpretation of thL State's
original title should be fixed in order that innocent persons
may be guarded against a waste of their time and labor.

This court, in guarding the rights of owners of real

VOL. ccxxxii-13

OCTOBER TERM. 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of

the court.
The chief controversy in this case is over the title to
about 1,500 acres of unsurveyed lands in Poinsett County,
Arkansas, which were part of the public domain at the
date of the Swamp-Land Act of September 28, 1850,
c. 84, 9 Stat. 519, and the Federal question to be considered is, whether under the operation and administration of that act these lands have passed from the United
States or are still its property.
Although within the exterior lines of a township surveyed in 1840 and 1841, they, with other lands, were
excluded from the survey, were meandered as if they were
a lake, and were designated upon the official plat as a
meandered body of water called "Sunk Lands," a name
frequently applied in that region to areas which subsided
during the New Madrid earthquake, a little more than a
century ago, and subsequently became submerged. Other
unsurveyed areas, designated as meandered bodies of
water, were also shown upon the plat. The township was
approximately six miles square and the plat bore an
inscription to the effect that the total of the surveyed
areas was 14,329.97 acres,, so the unsurveyed areas represented as water must have amounted to 8,000 acres or
more.
After the enactment of the Swamp-Land Act, the
State requested that the township be listed as swamp
lands and patented to it under that act, both of which were
done, the former in 1853 and the latter in 1858. In requesting the listing, the State described the township as
containing 14,329.97 acres, the total of the surveyed areas
as inscribed upon the plat, and in making the list, the
Secretary of the Interior took the same total and deducted 514.30 acres in fractional section 16, which already
had passed to the State under the school-land grant,

CHAPMAN & DEWEY v. ST. FRANCIS.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

thereby making the listed area 13,815.67 acres. The patent embraced lands in several townships, the portion of the
description material here being: "Township 12 North of
Range 7 East. The whole of the Township (except
Section sixteen), containing thirteen thousand, eight
hundred and fifteen acres and sixty-seven hundredths of
an acre . .
according to the official plats of survey
of said lands returned to the General Land Office by the
Surveyor General."
In the state courts the levee district, the plaintiff,
claimed title to the lands in controversy under the SwampLand Act and an act of the state legislature in 1893
(Laws Ark. 1893, p. 172) granting to the levee district
"all the lands of this State" lying within the boundaries
of the district; and the defendants opposed this claim
upon two grounds: One, that if these lands had passed to
the State the defendants had succeeded to the title by
riparian right in virtue of their ownership, under conveyances from the State in 1871, of the fractional sections
and subdivisions abutting on the meandered area called
"Sunk Lands;" and the other, that the lands in controversy had not passed to the State, but were still the
property of the United States. The trial court sustained
the plaintiff's claim and entered a decree accordingly,
which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, the
Chief Justice dissenting. 100 Arkansas, 94.
Both courts found as matter of fact from the evidence
produced at the trial that at the time of the survey and at
the date of the Swamp-Land Act .the unsurveyed area
designated upon the plat as "Sunk Lands" was not a
lake or permanent body of water, but only temporarily
overflowed, and was not distinctly lower or materially
different from the adjoining lands; and with this as a
premise it was held that the lands in controversy did not
pass to the State or to the defendants with the adjoining
lands as an incident of riparian ownership, but were con-

veyed to the State by the patent issued in 1858, and
thence to the levee district by the state act of 1893.
If the patent conveyed these lands to the State we are
not concerned with their subsequent disposal, for that is a
question of local law. But did the patent include them?
This, of course, is g6 Federal question. In answering it in

the affirmative, the state courts regarded the words
"Sunk Lands," shown upon the plat, as meaning that
the unsurveyed area to which they were applied was land
and not water, and also regarded the words "The whole of
the Township (except Section sixteen)," as used in the
patent, as embracing all that was within the exterior lines
of the township, except Section 16, whether surveyed or
unsurveyed and even although meandered and excluded
from the survey. We are unable to accede to this view of
either the plat or the patent.
Had the plat shown that all the lands were surveyed, it
doubtless is true that the words "Sunk Lands" would
not have indicated the presence of a body of water, but
would have been taken in much the same way as would
such words as "valley," "broken hills" or "level plateau."
But the plat showed, as did also the field notes, that the
area to which the words were applied was not included in
the survey, but was excluded therefrom and meandered as
a body of water, and also that the adjoining sections and
subdivisions were surveyed as fractional, as is usual with
lands abutting on a lake or similar body of water. Thus,
what appeared upon the plat had the same meaning as if
this area had been called "Sunk Lands Lake." And that
the officers of the State and of the United States so understood is shown by the fact that in the proceedings preliminary to the issuance of the patent, as also in the
patent, this and similar areas were excluded in specifying
the amount of land in the township.
Of course, the words in the patent "The whole of the
Township (except Section sixteen)" are comprehensive,

CHAPMAN & DEWEY v. ST. FRANCIS.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

but they are only one element in the description and must
be read in the light of the others. The explanatory words
"according to the official plats of survey of said lands
returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor
General" constitute another element, and a very important one, for it is a familiar rule that where lands are
patented according to such a plat, the notes, lines, landmarks and other particulars appearing thereon become as
much a part of the patent and are as much to be considered in determining what it is intended to include as if
they were set forth in the patent. Cragin v. Powell,
128 U. S. 691, 696; Jefferis v. East Omaha Land Co., 134
U. S. 178, 194. The specification of the acreage is still
another element, and, while of less influence than either
of the others, it is yet an aid in ascertaining what was
intended, for a purpose to convey upwards of 22,000
acres is hardly consistent with a specification of 13,815.67
acres. Ainsa v. United States, 161 U. S. 208, 229; Security
Land Co. v. Burns, 193 U.S. 167, 180; 3 Washburn on Real
Property, 5th ed., 427. Giving to each of these elements
its appropriate influence and bearing in mind that the
terms of description are all such as are usually employed
in designating surveyed lands, we are of opinion that the
purpose was to patent the whole of the lands surveyed,
except fractional section 16, and not the areas meandered
and returned, as shown upon the plat, as bodies of water.
That it is now found, as shown by the decisions below,
that these areas ought not to have been so meandered and
returned, but should have been surveyed and returned as
land, does not detract from the effect which must be given
to the plat in determining what was intended to pass under
the patent. Niles v. Cedar Point Club, 175 U. S. 300, 306;
Hardinv. Shedd, 190 U. S. 508, 520.
As, then, the lands in controversy were not included in
the patent, and, under the findings below, did not pass to
the State or to the defendants by riparian right with the

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

232 U. S.

adjoining fractional sections and subdivisions, it follows
that they remain the property of the United States.
Niles v. Cedar Point Club, supra; French-Glenn Live Stock
Co. v. Springer, 185 U. S. 47; Security Land Co. v. Burns,
supra.
But it is said on behalf of the levee district that, even
though the lands were not included in the patent, they
passed to the State under the Swamp-Land Act independently of any patent, and passed thence to the district
under the state act of 1893. The contention is not tenable.
The lands were never listed as swamp lands and theif
listing does not appear to have been even requested,
doubtless because they were not surveyed. Assuming that
in fact they were swamp lands, the State's title under the
Swamp-Land Act was at most inchoate and never was
perfected. Not only so, but the State relinquished its
inchoate title to the United States as part of a compromise
and settlement negotiated in 1895, and the relinquishment
is binding upon the levee district as a subordinate agency
of the State. Little v. Williams, 231 U. S. 335. See Carson
v. St. Francis Levee District, 59 Arkansas, 513, 533-535.
The levee district was therefore not entitled to prevail in
respect of the unsurveyed lands.
Decree reversed.
