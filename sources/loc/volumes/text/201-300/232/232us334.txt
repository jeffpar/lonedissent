BACCUS v. STATE OF LOUISIANA.
ERROR TO THE THIRD JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT, PARISH OF
CLAIBORNE, STATE OF LOUISIANA.
No. 170.

Argued January 19, 1914.-Decided February 24, 1914.

This court will not disregard the construction placed upon a state statute by the highest court of the State especially if it involves giving
the statute one meaning for the purpose of determining whether the
acts in question are within its terms and another meaning for the
purpose of escaping the Federal question.
A State may classify and regulate itinerant vendors and peddlers,
Emert v. Missouri, 156 U. S. 296, and may also regulate the sale of
drugs and medicines.
The statute of Louisiana of 1894, prohibiting sale of drugs, etc., by
itinerant vendors or peddlers, is not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment either as denying due process of law by preventing a citizen from pursuing a lawful vocation or as denying equal
protection of the law.

THIS writ of error was directed to a district court of the
State of Louisiana, as that court had jurisdiction, in last
resort, over the conviction sought to be reviewed. The
information upon which the conviction was based charged
that the accused had, in violation of ยง 12 of Act 49 of the
Laws of Louisiana for 1894, illegally, as an itinerant vendor
or peddler, "sold drugs, ointments, nostrums and applications intended for the treatment of diseases and deformity."

A motion was made to quash on the following

Statement of the Case.

grounds: First, because the statute upon which the charge
was based provided for no offense; second, because if it did,
the acts charged were not, generally speaking, within the
statute, and especially were not embraced by its provisions
because the sale of drugs or proprietary preparations put
up in sealed packages with directions for use, did not constitute the practice of medicine; third, because if the statute embraced, as asserted, the acts charged, it was in conflict with the state constitution, since it permitted all
persons to sell drugs, ointments, etc., except itinerant
vendors; fourth, because if the statute operated as contended for, it was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States "a, because
it prevents a citizen from pursuing a lawful vocation; b, it
denies to other citizens rights enjoyed by all others in the
State, and
. .
is class legislation in its effect, as it
gives to the local dealer a monopoly in the sale of such
drugs, etc., and deprives the itinerant vendor or dealer of
the privilege to sell such articles . . " The motion to
quash having been overruled, the case was submitted to
the court without a jury, upon an agreed statement of
facts to the following effect: 1st, "that the defendant was
an itinerant vendor of drugs, nostrums," etc., and as such
had sold the articles "intended for the treatment of
diseases as alleged in 'the information." 2nd, "that the
drugs so sold by the defendant as an itinerant vendor were
compounded and prepared by the Rawleigh Medical Co.
of the State of Illinois, and that said remedies, drugs,
nostrums, ointments and applications wer put up in
sealed packages or bottles ready for use with printed directions on the packages or bottles and that defendant was
an itinerant vendor of same in original packages and
bottles and prepared by the proprietors." 3rd, "that all
persons except itinerant vendors have the right to sell
said remedies, that is, patent and proprietary drugs, nostrums, ointments and applications, intended for the cure

of diseases." By requests to charge which were overruled,
and to which exceptions were reserved, the defenses based*
both upon the state and the United States Constitution,
embodied in the motion to quash were reiterated and on
conviction and sentence after an unsuccessful effort by
certiorari to procure as an act of grace, a review of the
case by the Supreme Court of the State, this writ of error
was sued out.
Mr. Thomas D. O'Brien, with whom Mr. John A. Barnes
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The act cannot be sustained if interpreted to prohibit
the mere selling of drugs by an itinerant while permitting
such selling by all others.
The enforcement of *the statute would unwarrantably
deprive plaintiff in error of liberty.
The business and occupation attempted to be prohibited
is lawful.
The statute denies to plaintiff in error equal protection
of the laws.
The statute is equally obnoxious under the construction
placed upon it by the Supreme Court of Louisiana.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE,

We accept the construction affixed by the court below
to the statute and upon which alone it could in reason
have held that the acts charged were embraced by its
provisions. We hence disregard an intimation made in
the argument of the defendant in error, that the statute
is susceptible of a different interpretation and therefore
that the claim of Federal right which was made below and
which was necessarily passed upon need not be here considered. It is inconceivable that the statute should mean
one thing for the purpose of determining whether the acts
charged were within its terms and should then be held to
mean another, for the purpose of escaping the Federal
question. Thus considering the case in its true aspect, the
single issue to be decided is, Did the State have power,
without violating the equal protection or due process of

law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to forbid the
sale by itinerant vendors of "any drug, nostrum, ointment
or application of any kind intended for the treatment of
disease or injury," although allowing the sale of such
articles by other persons? That it did have such authority
is so clearly the result of a previous ruling of this court
(Emert v. Missouri, 156 U. S. 296), or at all events is so
persuasively made manifest by the authorities cited and
the reasoning which sustained the ruling of the court in
the case just stated, as to leave no room for controversy
on the subject (pp. 306-307). Moreover, the power which
the state Government possessed to classify and regulate
itinerant vendors or peddlers exerted in the statute under
consideration is cumulatively sustaihed and made if possible more obviously lawful by the fact that the regulation
in question deals with the selling by itinerant vendors or
peddlers of drugs or medicinal compounds, objects plainly
within the power of government to regulate.
Affirmed.
