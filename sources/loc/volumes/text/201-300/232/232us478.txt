unless it can be said that it was pending before Congress
in 1877 and 1878. We think this cannot properly be said.
The claim to which the attention of Congress was invited
in those years was not for an act of depredation by Indians,
but, as was stated in the petitions and accompanying affidavits and in the bills introduced in response thereto,
was for a depredation by Mormons. No one could understand from the petitions and affidavits or from the bills
that there was any purpose to claim indemnity from the
Government on the ground that the depredation was
committed by its Indian wards or to obtain reparation
from the latter through the exertion of the Government's
control over them. Rightly speaking, it was merely an
appeal to the bounty or generosity of Congress, and probably was so regarded by the latter. At all events it was
not an assertion or presentation of the claim which is
the subject of this suit, for the latter is for an act of depredation by Indians, not by Mormons. We are accordingly of opinion that the claim is one, jurisdiction of which
is expressly withheld from the Court of Claims by the
act of 1891.

ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF SOUTH DAKOTA.
No. 707.

Submitted January 13, 1914.-Decided February 24, 1914.

Congress has power to prohibit the introduction of intoxicating liquors
into an Indian reservation wheresoever situate and to prohibit traffic
in such liquors with tribal Indians whether upon or off a reservation, and whether within or without the limits of a State.
That power is sufficiently comprehensive to enable Congress When

securing the cession of a part of an Indian reservation within a State
to prohibit the sale of intoxicants upon the ceded lands, if in its
judgment the prohibition is reasonably essential to the protection of
the Indians residing on the unceded lands.
As Congress possesses this power, the State possesses no exclusive
control over the subject and the congressional prohibition is supreme.
The provision in Art. 17 of the agreement with the Yankton Sioux
against the sale of intoxicating liquor on the lands ceded to the
United States and the prohibition in the act of August 15, 1894,
ratifying the agreement, are both within the power of Congress and
are proper regulations for the protection of the Indian wards of the
Nation.
While a prohibition by act of Congress against the sale of liquor on
lands ceded by Indians to the United States within the limits of a
State, to be a constitutional exercise of the power of Congress, must
not go beyond what is reasonably essential to the protection of the
Indians, and may become inoperative when all the Indians affected
thereby become completely emancipated from Federal control, Congress is invested with wide discretion and its action, unless purely
arbitrary, must be accepted and given full effect by the courts.
The prohibition against the sale of liquor on land ceded by the Yankton
Sioux, under the agreement ratified by the act of August 15, 1894,
properly remains in force so long as conditions remain, as they still
do, substantially the same, and, unless sooner altered by Congress,
will continue so long as the presence and status of the Indians sustain
it as a Federal regulation.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the provisions in the treaty and statutes establishing the Yankton
Sioux Indian Reservation against the sale of liquor and
the effect of such provisions on the sale of liquor on ceded
lands forming a part of such Reservation, are stated in
the opinion.

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This direct writ of error brings under review a judgment
of conviction for unlawfully selling intoxicating liquors
upon ceded lands formerly included in the Yankton Sioux
Indian Reservation, in the State of South Dakota. This
reservation was created by the treaty of April 19, 1858,
11 Stat. 743, for the use of the Yankton tribe of Sioux
Indians, and originally embraced 400,000 acres. A considerable part of it was allotted in severalty to the members of the tribe under the act of February 8, 1887, c. 119,
24 Stat. 388, and the amendatory act of February 28, 1891,
c. 383, 26 Stat. 794, the allotments being in small tracts
scattered throughout the reservation. By an agreement
ratified and confirmed by Congress August 15, 1894,
28 Stat. 286, 314, c. 290, the tribe ceded and relinquished
to the United States all the unallotted lands. In article 17 of the agreement it was stipulated: "No intoxicating liquors nor other intoxicants shall ever be sold or given
away upon any of the lands by this agreement ceded and
sold to the United States, nor upon any other lands
within or comprising the reservations of the Yankton
Sioux or Dakota Indians as described in the treaty between the said Indians and the United States, dated
April 19th, 1858, and as afterwards surveyed and set off
to the said Indians. The penalty for the violation of this
provision shall be such as Congress may prescribe in the
act ratifying this agreement." And in the ratifying act
it was provided, 28 Stat. 319: "That every person who
shall sell or give away any intoxicating liquors or other
intoxicants upon any of the lands by said agreement
ceded, or upon any of the lands included in the Yankton
Sioux Indian Reservation as created by the treaty of
April nineteenth, eighteen hundred and fifty-eight, shall
be punishable by imprisonment for not more than two

years and by a fine of not more than three hundred
dollars."
Conformably to ยง 5 of the act of 1887, each allottee was
given a trust certificate declaring that the United States
would hold the land embraced in his allotment, for the
period of twenty-five years or such extended period as
the President might direct, in trust for him, or, in case
of his decease, for his heirs, but without power in him
or them to convey or make any contract touching the
land during the trust period, and at the expiration of
that period would issue to him or them a patent conveying the title in fee, discharged of the trust. Some of the
allotted lands were subsequently disposed of pursuant
to express authority from Congress, and those remaining
approach 100,000 acres, occupied by more than 1,500
Indians. Rep. Com. Ind. Affairs, 1911, p. 72. The
trust period has not expired, nor has the tribal relation
of the Indians been dissolved. An agent or superintendent remains in charge of their affairs and they are still
wards of the Government. Hallowell v. United States,
221 U. S.317; United States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S.28.
The ceded lands, excepting some small tracts retained
by the Government as sites for an Indian agency, Indian
schools, and the like, were opened to disposition under
the homestead and townsite laws, May 21, 1895, 29
Stat. 865, and have largely passed into private ownership.
The place at which the intoxicating liquors were sold
was within the defendant's own premises in the town of
Dante, an organized municipality located upon a part of
the ceded lands then held in private ownership by the
inhabitants, none of whom was an Indian. The defendant
is a white man, but whether the persons to whom the
liquors were sold were white or Indian does not appear,
and is immaterial under the statutory provision before
quoted, upon which the prosecution was founded.
The objections urged in the District Court against the

conviction, and now renewed, call in question the validity
of that statutory provision and are, first, that the power
to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors upon all ceded
lands rests exclusively in the State, and, second, that if
Congress possesses any such power it necessarily is limited
to what is reasonably essential to the protection of the
Indians occupying the unceded lands, and that this limitation is transcended by the provision in question because
it embraces territory greatly in excess of what the situation
reasonably requires and because its operation is not confined to a designated period, reasonable in duration, but
apparently is intended to be perpetual.
The power of Congress to prohibit the introduction of
intoxicating liquors into an Indian reservation, wheresoever situate, and to prohibit traffic in such liquors, with
tribal Indians, whether upon or off a reservation and
whether within or without the limits of a State, does not
admit of any doubt. It arises in part from the clause in
the Constitution investing Congress with authority "to
regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the
several States, and with the Indian tribes," and in" part
from the recognized relation of tribal Indians to the
Federal Government. United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall.
407, 417; United States v. Sutton, 215 U. S. 291; Hallowell
v. United States, supra; Ex parte Webb, 225 U. S. 663,
683, 691; United States v. Wright, 229 U. S. 226; United
States v. Sandoval, supra. "These Indian tribes are the
wards of the Nation. They are communities dependent
on the United States. . . . From their very weakness and helplessness, so largely due to the course of dealing of the Federal Government with them and the treaties
in which it has been promised, there arises the duty of
protection, and with it the power. This has always been
recognized by the Executive and by Congress, and by
this court, whenever the question has arisen." United
States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375, 383.

PERRIN v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Whether this power to protect the Government's Indian
wards against the evils of intemperance, of which they
are easy victims, is sufficiently comprehensive to enable
Congress, when securing the cession of part of an Indian
reservation within a State, to prohibit the sale of intoxicants upon the ceded lands, if in its judgment that is
reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians residing upon the unceded lands, is the real question presented by the first of the defendant's objections. We say
it is the real question, because if Congress possesses power
to do this it follows that the State possesses no exclusive
control over the subject and that the congressional prohibition is supreme. United States v. Holliday, supra,
p. 419.
The stipulation before quoted shows that when the
Iadians and the commissioners representing the United
States agreed upon a cession of the unallotted lands,
among which the allotted tracts were interspersed, both
were of opinion that due regard for the welfare of the
Indians required that traffic in intoxicants upon the
ceded lands be interdicted, as it was before the cession;
and Congress, evidently being of a like opinion, inserted
in the ratifying act the provision making it a punishable
offense for any person to sell or give away any intoxicating
liquors or other intoxicants upon any of the ceded lands.
Stipulations and provisions of this character are not
new, but have occasionally appeared in Indian treaties and
legislation for more than fifty years. The case of United
States v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U. S. 188, arose
out of a treaty with the Chippewas in 1863, 13 Stat. 668,
wherein a considerable portion of a reservation in the
State of Minnesota was ceded to the United States. The
treaty contained a stipulation that the laws of the United
States, then in force or thereafter enacted, prohibiting the
introduction and sale of spirituous liquors in the Indian
country should be operative throughout the ceded lands

until Congress or the President should direct otherwise,
and the principal question in the case was whether this
stipulation encroached upon the power of the State and
upon its equal footing with the original States. This
court upheld the stipulation, and in the course of the
opinion, after observing (p. 194) that the power of Congress to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes is "as
broad and as free from restrictions as that to regulate
commerce with foreign nations," said (p. 195): "As long
as these Indians remain a distinct people, with an existing
tribal organization, recognized by the political department
of the Government, Congress has the power to say with
whom, and on what terms, they shall deal, and what
articles shall be contraband. If liquor is injurious to
them inside of a reservation, it is equally so outside of it;
and why cannot Congress forbid its introduction into a
place near by, which they would be likely to frequent?
It is easy to see that the love of liquor would tempt them
to stray beyond their borders to obtain it; and that bad
white men, knowing this, would carry on the traffic in
adjoining localities, rather than venture upon forbidden
ground." And again (p. 197): "The chiefs doubtless saw,
from the curtailment of their reservation, and the consequent restriction of the limits of the 'Indian country,'
that the ceded lands would be used to store liquors for
sale to the young men of the tribe; and they well knew,
that, if there was no cession, they were already sufficiently
protected by the extent of their reservation. Under such
circumstances, it was natural that they should be unwilling
to sell, until assured that the commercial regulation respecting the introduction of spirituous liquors should
remain in force in the ceded country, until otherwise
directed by Congress or the President. This stipulation
was not only reasonable in itself, but was justly due from a
strong government to a weak people it had engaged to
protect.

.

. . Based as it is exclusively on the Federal

authority over the subject-matter, there is no disturbance
of the principle of state equality." The case came here a
second time and the views before expressed were reaffirmed. 108 U. S. 491.
The case of Dick v. United States, 208 U. S. 340, is even
more in point. There the Nez Perce tribe, by an agreement
ratified by Congress, had ceded to the United States a
large portion of their reservation in the State of Idaho,
and in the agreement was a stipulation subjecting the
ceded lands, for a period of twenty-five years, to the
Federal laws prohibiting the introduction of intoxicants
into the Indian country. The major part of the unceded
lands was allotted in severalty to members of the tribe
under the acts of 1887 and 1891, supra, and the ceded
lands were opened to disposition under the public-land
laws. In regular course, some of the ceded lands were
patented to white men and came to be the site of a town.
Under the stipulation, Dick was prosecuted for introducing
intoxicating liquors into the town and was convicted;
whereupon he brought the judgment here for review, his
chief contention being that, in view of Idaho's position as
a State, Congress was without constitutional power to
authorize or ratify the stipulation. Upon full consideration this court affirmed the judgment, and, following
United States v. Forty-three Gallons of. Whiskey, supra,
and other cases, held that the stipulation wa a valid
regulation and not subject to objection on constitutional
grounds. See also Bates v. Clark, 95 U. S. 204, 208;
Clairmontv. United States, 225 U. S.551, 558.
We could not sustain the defendant's first objection
without departing from the principles announced and
applied in those cases, and this we have no disposition to
do, for we regard them as embodying a right conception of
the power of Congress in dealing with the Indian wards
and adopting measures for their protection.
We come, then, to the objection that the prohibition in

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

the act of 1894 covers an unnecessarily extensive territory
and is not limited in duration, and so transcends the
power of Congress.
As the power is incident only to the presence of the
Indians and their status as wards of the Government, it
must be conceded that it does not go beyond what is
reasonably essential to their protection, and that, to be
effective, its exercise must not be purely arbitrary, but
founded upon some reasonable basis. Thus, a prohibition
like that now before us, if covering an entire State when
there were only a few Indian wards in a single county,
undoubtedly would be condemned as arbitrary. And a
prohibition valid in the beginning doubtless would become inoperative when in regular course the Indians
affected were completely emancipated from Federal
guardianship and control. A different view in either case
would involve an unjustifiable encroachment upon a
power obviously residing in the State. On the other
hand, it must also be conceded that, in determining what
is reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians,
Congress is invested with a wide discretion, and its
action, unless purely arbitrary, must be accepted and
given full effect by the courts.
The clajm that the territory covered by this prohibition
is so excessive as to make it purely arbitrary is devoid of
merit. The original reservation embraced 400,000 acres,
a district practically 25 miles square. The allotments are
in small tracts scattered throughout this district and
aggregate nearly 100,000 acres. The number of Indians
affected is upwards of 1,500 and they are more or less in a
state of transition from an unsettled to a settled life. In
this situation, and having some regard to the weakness of
Indians in respect of the use of intoxicants, we are far
from believing that Congress exceeded the limits of its
discretion in applying the prohibition to all the ceded
lands.

PRONOVOST v. UNITED STATES.
232 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

Of the claim that the prohibition is not expressly limited
in its duration it is enough to observe that this objection
cannot be of present avail. The conditions justifying the
prohibition remain substantially the same as when it was
adopted. The trust period has not expired, the tribal
relation has not been dissolved, and the wardship of the
Indians has not been terminated. See Tiger v. Western
Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 315; Act May 8, 1906, 34
Stat. 182, c. 2348; United States v. Pelican (decided this
day, ante, p. 442). The fact that the conditions may
become so changed in the future as to render the prohibition inoperative affords no reason for condemning it
now. Unless sooner repealed, it will continue in force as
long as the presence and status of the Indians sustain it as
a Federal regulation.
Judgment affirmed.

ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA.
No. 128.

Submitted January 15, 1914.-Decided February'24, 1914.

Under the act of January 30, 1897, 29 Stat. 506, it is an offense against
the United States to introduce liquor into ,the Indian country, and
this act embraces Indian country within a State.
An Indian reservation is Indian country, and this court takes judicial
notice of the existence at a specified time of a reservation established
by treaty and statute.
With exceptions immaterial here, the jurisdiction of the District Court
of the United States, as prescribed by law, embraces all offenses
against the United States committed within the district.
