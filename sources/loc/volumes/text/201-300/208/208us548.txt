FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF ALBUQUERQUE v.
ALBRIGHT.:
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRfITORY OV NEW
MEXICO.
No. 1.23.

Argued January 22. 1908.-Decided February 24i 1908.

A county treasurer accepting that part'.of the tax which a party aamsed
admits to'be due is not thereby estopped to demand more.
Equity will not interfere to stop an -assessing officer from performing his

statutory.d uty for fear he may perform it wrongfully; the earliest moment is when an assessment has actually been made; and in this case
held that the court would not, at the instance of a national bank, enjoin
assessors in advance from making an assessment on a basis alleged to be

threatened and'which if made would be invalid under J 5219, Rev. Stat.
86:Pac. Rep. 548, affirmed.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Alonzo B. McMillen for appellant:
The right of the territorial legislature to impose taxes upon
national banks is limited to two classes of property:
1. Shares of stock in the name of the shareholder, provided
that the taxation shall not be at a greater rate than is as.sessed
upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens, and that shares of- non-residents shall be taxed in the
city or town where thd bank is located.
2. Real property of national banks to the same extent, according to its value, as other real -property is taxed. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Osborne v. Bank of the
United Staes, 9 Wheat. 738; Mercantile Bank v; New York,.
121 U. S. 156; Owensboro National Bank v. 0wensboro, 173
U. S. 664.
The Territory is without power, to- authorize the taxation
of the personal property of a national" bank, and therefore the
taxing officers have no power to levy a tax thereon.
Under chapter 40 of the territorial laws of 1891, if the real

estate of a national bank be assessed, such assessed value should
be deducted from the value of the shares of stock of the stockholders.
The threatened reassessment of the bank's real estate without making a corresponding deduction from the assessment
of the shares of stock, constituted a cloud upon the title to the
property of the bank which the court has power to remove.
by injunction directed to the taxing officers.
The adoption of the general rule announced by the assessor
that he would tax the shares of stock in banks at a rate based
upon a valuation of sixty per cent of their capital stock and
surplus, is a clear violation of the provision of the national
banking act that taxation of the shares of stock of a national
bank shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other
moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens. Whitbeck
v. Mercantile Bank, 127 U. S. 194.
The allegations, of the complaint in this case show gross
discrimination against bank stock as compared with all other
property, which necessarily includes money in the hands of
individuals. Bank of Garnett v. Ayers, 160 U. S. 660; Aberdeen Bank v. Chehalis County, 166 U. S. 440; Bank of Commerce v. Seattle, 166 U. S. 463, and National Bank of Wellington
v. Chapman, 173 U. S. 219, are not in conflict with this contention. As to the extent and nature of the term "other moneyed
capital," see MercantileNational Bank v. New York, 121 U. S.
155.
A discrimination forbidden by the national banking act is
illegal whether it arises from a difference in the rate of assessment or from a difference in the valuation of the property, if
the result is to make owners of shares of stock pay a greater
tax than is imposed upon other moneyed capital in the hands
of individuals. People v. Weaver, 100 U. S. 539; Pelton v.
National Bank, 101 U. S. 143; Boyer v. Boyer, 113 U. S. 695.
The territorial court had jurisdiction to enjoin the illegal
assessment complained of and should have done so, in view
of the facts of this case. Pelton v' National Bank, 101 U. S.

v. Louisville N. R. Co., 88 Fed. Rep. 350; S. C., 31 C. C. A. 537.
If the allegations of the complaint are to be taken-as true,
the bank paid all the taxes that might be assessed against the
shares of stock and real estate Upon any theory, and no valid
reassessment could be made.
Mr. Frank W. Clancy, for appellees, submitted:
There being no valid assessment, it was the duty of the
assessor or collector to make one. New Mexico v. U. S. Trust
Co., 174 U. S. 549-551; U. S. Trust Co. v. New MYexico, 183
U. S. 539, 541; U. S. Trust Co. v. Territory, 10 N. M. 421, 422.
The mere fact that other property is assessed at a smaller
percentage of its real value than the property.of this plaintiff
or any other special class of property, is not sufficient to invalidate the higher assessment. Nickerson v. Kimball, 1 N. B.
C. 409; Wagner v. Loomis, 37 Ohio St. 580, 581; Carroll v.
Alsup, .64 S. W. Rep. 199, 200.
The assessment makes no discrimination against national
banks. The restriction imposed by Congress is equality of
assessment .not with other property generally, but with that
property which passes under the description of moneyed capital. Talbot v. Silver Bow, 139 U. S. 447; Mercantile Bank
v. New York, 121 U. S. 155.
It is .iot alleged by complainant that there is any other
moneyed capital in New Mexico in favor of which there is any
..discrimination against national banks. Taking the complaint
most strongly against the pleader there is no such discrimination, especially when it is alleged by the pleader that all banks,
national or other, are treated alike.

FIRST NATIONAL BANK v. AILBRIGHT.
208 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Congress has specifically authorized the taxation of the real
estate of national banks. Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S.
106; Tennessee v. Whitworth, 117 U. S. 136, 137; New Orleans
v. Houston, 119 U. S. 277,.278.
No case of equitable jurisdiction is made out, by the complaint in this case. It will be time for a court of equity to
interpose when an assessment has actually been' made and
can be shown to offend in any. or all of the particulars mentioned in the complaint.
MR.

JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

.gaistte
Assessor, .the Treasurer
This is a complaint or bUl
and ex officio Collector, and the District:Attorney of the County
of Bernalillo, New Mexico, to enjoin the.reassessment of a tax
on stock and real estate for the year 1903 upon the plaintiff.
bank, which the plaintiff is informed and believes the defendants will attempt. The bill alleges that the plaintiff gave the.
Assessor a list in which capital stock, surplus and real estate
were lumped in a single item with a single valuation of $90,000.
Thereupon the Assessor made a different valuation, lumping
the capital stock and valuing it at sixty per cent of its par
value, and giving separate figures for the surplus and the peveral parcels of real estat4, the total being $150,542. . This was
affirmed by the Territorial Board- of Equalization on appeal.
Afterwards the plaintiff paid the amount admitted by it to be
due, and was sued for the residue; but the suit was dismissed,
the District Attorney giving out that a new assessment would
be made. It is alleged that the Assessor, in 1903, announced
as his method of valuation that all property except bank property and bank shares would be assessed at one-third of its real
value, but that he would assess banks at sixty per cent of the
capital stock and surplus in addition to their real estate; that
he did as he announced, and also assessed the real estate without deducting the value "from the valuation of other property
assessed against said banks." Beside the prayer for an in-

junction there is another that the Treasurer and ex ofio Col.lector be ordered to cancel the above mentioned assessment
upon his books. There was a demurrer, which was overruled
below but sustained by the Supremie Court of the Territory with
directions to dismiss the complaint.
The complaint admits that the plaintiff's return was not in
accordance with the law, and the Supreme Court of the Territory says that both that and the assessment were bad, and that
a reassessment is authorized by local law. We see no reason
to reverse its decision upon that point. If a reassessment is
made, that now on the Treasurer's books will be disposed of
and will be no cloud upon the plaintiff's title, so that the whole
,question is whether a reassessment shall be made. The plaintiff's objection is not the technical one that no reassessment is
authorized by statute, but the substantial apprehension that
the shares will be taxed' "at a greater rate than is assessed upon
other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens,"
contrary to the words of Rev. Stat. ยง5219, and that the value
of real estate separately assessed and taxed will not be deducted from the valuation of shares, as it is thought to be implied by that section and required by the territorial law of
February 20, 1891, c. 40; Compiled Laws, 1897, ยง259, that it
should be.
We assume that such an assessment of shares as is apprehended would. be invalid under Rev. Stat. ยง5219. First
National Banc o]- Wellington v. Chapman, 173 U. S.205, 219,
220. We assume that it would be invalid none the less if disguised as a tax on sixty per cent of the par value, if other
moneyed capital was uniformly and intentionally assessed at
one-third of its actual value -and if sixty per cent of the par
value of the bank shares was more than one-third of their
actual value.' Accidental inequality.is one thing, intentional.
and systematic discrimination another. See further Raymond v.
Chicago Traction Co., 207 U. S.20. We agree with the plainitiff
that the only taxes contemplated by ยง5219 are taxes on the
shares of stock and. tAxes on the real estate. Owensboro Nat.

Opinion of the Court.

Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S. 664, 669. Hence, while the law
does not consider the nature of the bank's investments not
taxed in fixing the value of its stock, Palmer v. McM4;on, 133
U. S. 660, it may be argued consistently with the decisions that
real estate taxed to the bank, and land out of the Territory,
which could not be taxed by it at all,'Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S.. 194, are meant to ie deducted by
Rev. Stat. ยง5219, and are required :to be by *the'territorial law.
But we agree with the Supreme Court of the territory that
the time for deciding these and othe, questions has not come.
The acceptance of what was admitted to be due created no
estoppel to demand more. There are no such precise avermentL
in the complaint as would warrant our assuming that no assessment could be made for a further'amount, still less th'A
none in any form could be made, when there is no valid one
upon the books. We cannot tell, and much more positive
averments of intent than 'those before us would not warrant
a court in prejudging; what the assessing officer will do. It is
not for a court to stop an officer of this kind from performing
'his statutory duty for fear he should perform it wrongly. The
earliest moment for equity to interfere- is when an assessment
has been made. Probably it wif1ibe made with caution; after
this case.
Judgment affirmed.
