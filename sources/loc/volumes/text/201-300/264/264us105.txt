PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION AND/OR MANDAMUS.

No. 26, Original.

Argued January 7, 8, 1924.-Decided February 18,
1924.

1. Upon the libel of a ship, for services and supplies, the District
Court acquires jurisdiction of the res, with power to pass upon the
form and substance of a claim of immunity presented by a foreign
minister alleging that the ship is owned and operated by a
department of his government. P. 108.
2. The overruling of such a claim, by the District Court and Circuit
Court of Appeals, is not reviewable here by prohibition and mandamus, where there was full opportunity to review in the customary
way. Id.
Rule discharged and petition dismissed.

PETITIONS for prohibition and mandamus, presented to
this Court by the Minister of the Republic of Portugal.

Mr. F. Dudley Kohler for petitioner.
The power to issue writs of prohibition is given to this
Court, and this remedy is assured to the petitioner by
Jud. Code, ยง 234. It is well settled that this remedy is
not in the nature of an appeal or to take the place of an
appeal. Its purpose as issuing to a District Court, sitting
as a court of admiralty, as in this case, is to prevent an
unlawful assumption or exercise of jurisdiction and lies
when the court is acting in excess of its jurisdiction or is
taking cognizance of matters not arising within its jurisdiction. Its office is to prevent an unlawful assumption
of jurisdiction; Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co., 118 U. S. 610:

Cornish, 109 Me. 384; In re Baiz, 135 U. S. 403.
It is not necessary where the District Court has no
jurisdiction of the parties or of the subject matter to
carry the case to, and exhaust the remedies by, appeal.
The proper remedy is by petitioning for a writ of prohibition which should issue in such a case. In re Fassett,
142 U. S. 479; The Western Maid, 257 U. S. 419; Ex parte
State of New York, 256 U. S. 490; Ex parte State of New
York, 256 U. S. 503; State v. Colbert, 129 La. 326; Ex
parte Indiana Transp. Co., 244 U. S. 456.
The rule here is that where the lack of jurisdiction in
the lower court is clear it is not necessary to show that
there was no remedy by appeal.
The exception to this rule of not requiring that there
be no remedy by appeal is in cases where the District
Court may have had in the first instance some jurisdiction
or reasonable grounds for believing that it had jurisdiction, that is where the question of jurisdiction might be
doubtful or in cases which are of such a character as those
of which the Court might ordinarily have jurisdiction.
The petitioner is entitled to a writ of prohibition as a
matter of right. Iberia, etc., R. R. Co. v. Morgan's S. S.
Co., 129 La. 492; In re Fassett, 142 U. S. 479; Smith v.

Ex parte Indiana Transp. Co., 244 U. S. 456; In re Rice,
155 U. S. 396; In re Cooper, 143 U. S. 472.
The lack of jurisdiction of the District Court is unquestionably clear. That this is a suit against a sovereign
government at peace with the United States is evident.

Opinion of the Court.
JusTIcE McREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion

f the

Court.
By this original petition the duly accredited Minister
of the Republic of Portugal asks for the writ of prohibition or mandamus to prevent further action in the
proceeding instituted by Stephen Ransom Dry Dock &
Repair Corporation in the District Court at New York,
April 14, 1921, to enforce payment for services and materials furnished the Sao Vicente. Recognizing the high
consideration always due diplomatic representatives of
friendly nations, we entertained the petition and directed
a rule to show cause why relief should not be granted.
The return is here and, after hearing oral argument, we
think the court below acted within its jurisdiction and
with due regard to the rights of all concerned.
The original libel in rein, filed April 14, 1921, claimed
for supplies and labor furnished the Sao Vicente and
prayed for condemnation and sale of the vessel. April
15th Transportes Maritimos do Estado intervened as the
true owner having possession when process issued; the
customary stipulation for value, bond and release of the
ship followed.
Answering by proctor, May 31, 1921, the vessel denied liability and objected to the jurisdiction because it
was "owned and operated by Transportes Maritimos do
Estado, a department of the sovereign foreign government of Portugal as aforesaid, and that it cannot be sued
in any of the courts of the United States without its consent and that this action is in substance and effect an action against the government of Portugal and as such is
not maintainable against this respondent." An interlocutory decree of June 9, 1923, directed the master to
ascertain the amount due.
July 5, 1923, the present petitioner filed a formal suggestion. He stated that the general appearance by

264 U. S.

counsel retained by the Vice Consul General of the Republic of Portugal was unauthorized by his government
and that the vessel was owned and operated by Transportes Maritimos do Estado, a department of the
sovereign government of Portugal. He protested against
exercise of jurisdiction by the court and asked that the
proceedings be dismissed. The Secretary of State gave
no sanction or approval to this course, but certified the
diplomatic position of the Minister. Upon motion the
suggestion was stricken from the files. Final judgment
for the libellant followed and, upon appeal, the Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed this with interest and damages,
October 1, 1923. No proper steps were taken to secure
an orderly review by this court.
Plainly the trial court obtained jurisdiction over the
re8 and, in the absence of any claim of immunity, it
would have been required to render judgment. It had
power to consider and pass upon both form and substance
of any objection to its jurisdiction because of ownership
and to decide whether it should proceed under the circumstances. There was a plain way to seek review here
if the defeated party had so desired.
We find no adequate ground for granting the extraordinary relief now asked. There has been ample time and
opportunity for advancing the claim of immunity in the
customary manner. Ex parte Muir, 254 U. S. 522; The
Pesaro, 255 U. S. 216, 218, 219; Ex parte Hussein Lutfi
Bey, 256 U. S. 616, 619.
Rule discharged and petition dismissed.
