Syllabus.

THE CHASTLETON CORPORATION ET AL. v.
SINCLAIR ET AL., RENT COMMISSION OF THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 467. Argued March 12, 13, 1924.-Decided April 21, 1924.
1. The remedy by appeal from orders of the Rent Commi.sion
afforded by the District of Columbia Rent Act, held not an
adequate remedy at law precluding equity jurisdiction of a suit
attacking an order upon the grounds that the statute itself is
unconstitutional and that the order affects parties who were
strangers to the proceedings in which it was made. P. 547.
2. The Act of October 22, 1919, regulating rents in the District of
Columbia, and upheld as an emergency measure in Block v. Hirsh,
256 U. S. 135, was continued in force by a subsequent act until
May 22, 1922, on which day a third act, declaring that the emergency still existed, regnacted the law with amendments and provided that it continue until May 22, 1924. Held:
(a) A law depending upon the existence of an emergency or other
certain state of facts to uphold it may cease to operate if the
emergency ceases or the facts change. P. 547.
(b) Where an order of the Rent Commission, although retrospective,
was passed some time after the last of the above mentioned statutes.
it was open to the courts to inquire whether the exigency still
existed upon which continued operation of the law depended.
P. 548.
(c) Allegations in the bill in this case that the emergency bad ceaseil
in 1922, cannot be declared offhand to be unmaintainable, in view
of judicial knowledge of present conditions in Washington. Id.
(d) This Court may ascertain as it sees fit any fact that is merely a
ground for laying down a rule of law. Id.
(e) But where it was material to know conditions at different date.
in the past, held that, for convenience, the facts should be gathered
and weighed by the court of first instance and the evidence preserved for consideration by this Court if necessary. P. .549,
290 Fed. 348, reversed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Argument for Appellants.

264 U. S.

APPEAL from a decree of the Court of Appeals of the
District of Columbia affirming a decree of the Supreme
Court of the District, which dismissed on motion a bill to
restrain the enforcement of an order of the Rent Commission cutting down the rents in an apartment house.

Mr. W. Gwynn Gardinerfor appellants.
The facts alleged by the bill and admitted by the
motion to dismiss establish that no emergency existed
in the District of Columbia, at the time of the passage
of the Rent Act in question, at the time of the proceedings before the Rent Commission involving the property
in question, or at the time of the filing of this suit.
In like manner it is an admitted fact that the demand
for apartments in the District of Columbia at the time
of the filing of this bill and at the time of the passage
of the act was not as great as the number of apartments
offered for rent.
While a declaration by a legislature concerning public
conditions is entitled to at least great respect, yet it may
not be held conclusive by the courts when the facts in
the record show contrary conditions to exist. See Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282; Hairston v. Danville & Western Ry. Co., 208 U. S. 598; Prentis v.
Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S. 210; ProducersTransp.
Co. v. Railroad Comm., 251 U. S. 228; Block v. Hirsh,
256 U. S. 135; Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 661; Buchanan
v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60.
There being no emergency, enforcement of the act
becomes violative of the Fifth Amendment. Missouri

Leland, 2 Pet. 627; Monongahela Nay. Co. v. United

CHASTLETON CORP. v. SINCLAIR.
543

Argument for Appellees.

The Rent Act and amendments provide for a, full judicial hearing by appeal.
The Rent Commission acquired full jurisdiction over
the parties in interest, and the subject matter to be
adjudicated.
When this Court, in Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135,
held the Rent Act of October 22. 1919, constitutional, it
necessarily decided that, when the same or sinilar conditions exist, Congress has the constitutional right to enact
the same or similar legislation, either of a temporary or
a permanent duration.
Acting upon this constitutional right, Congress, by Act
of August 24, 1921, first extended the Rent Act for seven
months, and by the Act of May 22, 1922, extended it for
two more years, to May 22, 1924. In the last mentioned
act, Congress determined: "That it is hereby declared
that the emergency described in Title II of the Food
Control and the District of Columbia Rents Act still
exists and continues in the District of Columbia, and that
the present housing and rental conditions therein require
the further extension of the provisions of such title."
This Court has decided that such a legislative declaration is binding upon the courts. United States v. Des
3oines Nay. & Ry. Co., 142 U. S. 510; Moeschcn v.
Tenement House Dept., 203 U. S. 583; Jacobson. v.
Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11; Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S.
391; Gardner v. Michigan, 199 U. S. 325; Levy Leasing
Co. v. Siegel, 258 U. S. 242.
The power of Congress over the District of Columbia
(Const. Art. I, ยง 8) is greater than that which the States
may exercise within their dominions. It is practically a
war power, even in times of peace, because the right "to
exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over
forts," etc., is in fact a war power, and Congress has the
same power to enact such legislation for the District of
Columbia, at all times.

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Opinion of the Court.

264 U. S.

The allegation in the bill that no emergency exists is a
mere conclusion, not admitted by the motion to dismiss.
Such allegations cannot overcome the solemn determination of Congress. United States v. Des Moines Nav. &
Ry. Co., 142 U. S. 510.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a bill in equity brought to restrain the enforcement of an order of the Rent Commission of the District
of Columbia cutting down the rents for apartments in the
Chastleton apartment house in this city. The defendants
are the Rent Commission and the tenants of the building.
The order was passed on August 7, 1922, and purports to
fix the reasonable rates from the preceding first of March.
The bill seems to have been filed on October 27, 1922, and
seeks relief on several grounds. The first and most important is that the emergency that justified interference
with the ordinarily existing private rights in 1919 had
come to an end in 1922, and no longer could be applied
consistently with the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Subordinate ones are that the plaintiff Hahn bought
the premises on September 25, 1922, it would seem under
foreclosure of a preexisting mortgage or deed of trust, and
that he and his grantee, the Chastleton Corporation, were
strangers to the proceeding before the Commission and
not bound by it, but that the tenants not only were relying upon it but were making it a ground for demanding
repayment from the Corporation of rents paid in excess of
the sums fixed by the Commission after March 1, 1922,
although the Corporation did not receive them. On motion the bill was dismissed by the Courts below, the Court
of Appeals, in view of Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135, leaving it for this Court to say whether conditions had so far
changed as to affect the constitutional applicability of the
law. The allegations do not make the position of the

CHASTLETON CORP. v. SINCLAIR.
543

Opinion of the Court.

Chastleton Corporation and Hahn sufficiently clear and
therefore we feel bound to consider the constitutional
question that the bill seeks to raise.
It is objected that the plaintiffs have an adequate
remedy at law by way of appeal. But apart from the fact
that it is doubtful whether the Chastleton Corporation
and Hahn were not entitled to treat the order as a nullity
so far as they were concerned, it is open to equal doubt
whether in a proceeding under the law they could assail
its validity. There are many tenants to be dealt with.
However looked at a bill in equity is the natural and best
way of settling the parties' rights. See e. g. Marcus Brown
Holding Co. v. Feldman,256 U. S. 170.
The original Act of October 22, 1919, c. 80, Title II, 41
Stat. 297, considered in Block v. Hirsh, was limited to
expire in two years. ยง 122. The Act of August 24, 1921,
c. 91, 42 Stat. 200, purported to continue it in force, with
some amendments, until May 22, 1922. On that day a
new act declared that the emergency described in the
original Title II still existed, reenacted with further
amendments the amended Act of 1919, and provided
that it was continued until May 22, 1924. Act of May
22, 1922, c. 197, 42 Stat. 543.
We repeat what was stated in Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S.
135, 154, as to the respect due to a declaration of this kind
by the legislature so far as it relates to present facts. But
even as to them a Court is not at liberty to shut its eyes
to an obvious mistake, when the validity of the law depends upon the truth of what is declared. 256 U. S. 154.
Chas. Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations,
262 U. S. 522, 536. And still more obviously so far as this
declaration looks to the future it can be no more than
prophecy and is liable to be controlled by events. A law
depending upon the existence of an emergency or other
certain state of facts to uphold it may cease to operate if
the emergency ceases or the facts change even though

valid when passed. Perrin v. United States, 232 U. S.
478, 486, 487. Missouri v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
R. R. Co., 241 U. S. 533, 539, 540. In Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 258 U. S. 165, a statutory rate that had
been sustained for earlier years in Willcox v. Consolidated
Gas Co., 212 U. S. 19, was held confiscatory for 1918
and 1919.
The order, although retrospective, was passed some
time after the latest statute, and long after the original
act would have expired. In our opinion it is open to
inquire whether the exigency still existed upon which the
continued operation of the law depended. It is a matter
of public knowledge that the Government has considerably diminished its demand for employees that was one
of the great causes of the sudden afflux of people to
Washington, and that other causes have lost at least much
of their power. It is conceivable that, as is shown in an
affidavit attached to the bill, extensive activity in building has added to the ease of finding an abode. If about
all that remains of war conditions is the increased cost of
living, that is not in itself a justification of the act.
Without going beyond the limits of judicial knowledge,
we can say at least that the plaintiffs' allegations cannot
be declared offhand to be unmaintainable, and that it is
not impossible that a full development of the facts will
show them to be true. In that case the operation of the
statute would be at an end.
We need not enquire how far this Court might go in
deciding the question for itself, on the principles explained in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S.
210, 227. See Gardner v. Collector, 6 Wall. 499. South
Ottawa v. Perkins, 94 U. S. 260. Jones v. United States,
137 U. S. 202. Travis v. Yale & Towne Manufacturing
Co., 252 U. S. 60, 80. These cases show that the Court
may ascertain as it sees fit any fact that is merely a
ground for laying down a rule of law, and if the question

were only whether the statute is in force today, upon the
facts that we judicially know we should be compelled to
say that the law has ceased to operate. Here however it
is material to know the condition of Washington at different dates in the past. Obviously the facts should be
accurately ascertained and carefully weighed, and this
can be done more conveniently in the Supreme Court of
the District than here. The evidence should be preserved
so that if necessary it can be considered by this Court.
Judgment reversed.
MR.JusTicE BRANDEis, concurring in part.

So far as concerns The Chastleton Corporation and
Hahn, I agree that the decree should be reversed. So far
as concerns the plaintiff Lake, the bill was properly dismissed for want of equity; among other reasons, because
his administrative appeal from the order of the Rent Commission was pending in the Supreme Court of the District
when this suit was begun, and still remains undisposed of.
Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S.210.
If protection of the rights of The Chastleton Corporation and Hahn required us to,pass upon the constitutionality of the District Rent Acts, I should agree, also, to
the procedure directing the lower court to ascertain the
facts. But, in my opinion, it does not. For (on facts
hereinafter stated which appear by the bill and which
were, also, admitted at the bar) the order entered by the
Commission is void as to them, even if the Rent Acts are
valid. To express an opinion upon the constitutionality
of the acts, or to sanction the enquiry directed, would,
therefore, be contrary to a long-prevailing practice of the
Court.'1"It [the Court] has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute,
either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable
with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adiudge the legal
rights of litigants in actual controversies.
In the exercise of that

The District Rent Act of 1921 (which was in force when

the proceeding before the Commission was begun, and
thereafter until May 22, 1922) provides, that in all "cases
the commission shall give notice personally or by registered mail and afford an opportunity to be heard to all
parties in interest." Act of October 22, 1919, c. 80, Title
II, ยง 106, 41 Stat. 297, 300, as amended by Act of August
24, 1921, c. 91, 42 Stat. 200. The District Rent Act of
1922 (which was in force when the order of the Commission was entered) amended this clause concerning notice
by adding thereto the words: "Provided, That notice
given by the commission to an agent for the collection of
rents due his principal shall be deemed and held to be
good and sufficient notice to the principal." Act of May
22, 1922, c. 197, ยง 7, 42 Stat. 543, 546.
The proceeding in which the order of the Rent Commission issued was begun January 25, 1922. Its order was
entered August 7, 1922. When the proceeding before the
Commission was begun, the plaintiff Lake was the owner
of the property subject to mortgages theretofore executed
jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered,

one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance
of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule
of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to
which it is to be applied. These rules are safe guides to sound judgment. It is the dictate of wisdom to follow them closely and carefully." Steamship Co. v. Emigration Commissioners, 113 U. S. 33, 39.

"Whenever, in pursuance of an honest and actual antagonistic
assertion of rights by one individual against another, there is presented a question involving the validity of any act of any legislature,
State or Federal, and the decision necessarily rests on the competency
of the legislature to so enact, the court must, in the exercise of its
solemn duties, determine whether the act be constitutional or not; but
such an exercise of power is the ultimate and supreme function of
courts. It is legitimate only in the last resort, and as a necessity
." Chicago & Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U. S.
339, 345. Compare Atherton Mills v. Johnston, 259 U. S. 13.

and duly recorded. After the order was entered (and
while that proceeding was pending on appeal in the Supreme Court of the District) the plaintiff Hahn purchased
the property under the foreclosure of one of these mortgages. Thereafter, aad before the institution of this suit,
Hahn conveyed the property to his co-plaintiff, The
Chastleton Corportion. Hahn and the corporation do
not claim title uider Lake. They claim title as purchasers under te foreclosure of a mortgage which antedated Lake's ourchase. Notice of the proceedings before
the Commisbn was never served on the holder of the
mortgage; aid, of course, not on Hahn or on The Chastleton Corporaion. The only notice ever served on anyone
was that fLven, on January 25, 1922, "To the F. H.
Smith Co.,Agent".-That company was then the rental
agent of fe property for Lake. It had no authority to
represe. + n any way either the mortgagee or those claiming under him.
As the required notice was not served on the mortgagee.
nor on those claiming under him, and as F. H. Smith Co.
was not the agent of any of them, the order is necesssrily
void as to The Chastleton Corporation and Hahn. The
doctrine of lis pendens has no application to persons so
situated. Terrell v. Allison, 21 Wall. 289; Pittsburgh,
Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Long Island
Loan & Trust Co., 172 U. S. 493. And Congress did not
undertake to make the proceeding one in rent binding
upon all the world regardless of lack of notice.
