Opinion of the Court.

NYANZA STEAMSHIP COMPANY, LTD. v.
JAHNCKE DRY DOCK No. 1, ET AL.
APPEAL FRONI THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

No. 307. Argued March 6, 1924.-Decided April 7, 1924.
The rule confining the jurisdiction of this Court by appeal to final
judgments completely disposing of litigation, applies to jurisdictional appeals, under Jud. Code, ยง 238, in admiralty cases.

P. 440.
Appeal dismissed.

ArPPEAL from a decree of the District Court dismissing,
for want of admiralty jurisdiction, three of four causes
of action contained in a single libel.
Mr. Richard B. Montgomery for appellant.
Mr. Walter Carroll,with whom Mr. Geo. H. Terriberry
was on the brief, for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The owners of the Steamship Nyanza filed, in the Federal Court for Eastern Louisiana, against Jahncke Drydock No. 1 and the owners thereof a single libel setting
forth these four causes of action: in rem for salvage, in
personam for salvage, in rem for damage from collision,
and in personam for such damage. The owners appeared
as claimants. Excepting to the libel, they prayed that
"in so far as the action is either in.rem or in personam for
salvage, and in rem for damage" it be dismissed for want
of admiralty jurisdiction. The court maintained the exception; entered a decree of dismissal precisely as prayed
for; and allowed an appeal under ยง 238 of the Judicial

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Syllabus.

264 U. S.

Code, with a certificate that "in this decree the question
of jurisdiction alone is in issue."
The decree leaves the cause of action in personam for
damage undisposed of. For this reason the appeal must
be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this Court,
although the objection was not taken by the appellee.
This Court has jurisdiction under ยง 238, as under others,
only of writs of error or appeals from final judgments.
And the judgment must be not only in its nature final,
but a complete disposition of the cause. Collins v. Miller,
252 U. S. 364, 370. This rule is applicable to appeals in
admiralty. Bowker v. United States, 186 U. S. 135;
OneidaNavigation Corporationv. W. & S. Job & Co., Inc.,
252 U. S. 521. There is nothing to the contrary in Withenbury v. United States, 5 Wall. 819, or in The Pesaro,
255 U. S. 216, 217. Counsel suggested that the dismissal
of this premature appeal might somehow release the drydock, to libelant's prejudice. It obviously cannot have
that effect.
Dismissed.

OF MEXICO AND NATIONAL RAILWAYS OF
MEXICO.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 662.

Argued March 13, 1924.-Decided April 7, 1924.

I. On a jurisdictional review under Jud. Code, ยง 238, the District
Judge's certificate of a jurisdictional question does not relieve this
Court of the duty of determining for itself whether the question

certified is one of the jurisdiction of the lower court as a federal
court.
