an obscure point in Maine to San Francisco via Boston,
New York and Chicago should be printed at $15.00, instead of $150, and the error remain undiscovered for
many months, could all who had paid more than $15.00
for passage along that route recover the excess without
proof of pecuniary loss?
After the challenged judgments were entered, Kansas

FOX, ET AL., TRUSTEES IN BANKRUPTCY OF
COWEN HOSIERY COMPANY, INC., BANKRUPT.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 188.

Argued January 22, 23, 1924.-Decided April 7, 1924.

I. Section 67f of the Bankruptcy Act does not invalidate a lien
obtained by levy of an execution within the four months preceding
the filing of the petition in bankruptcy on which the judgment
debtor is adjudged a bankrupt, if the debtor was in fact solvent
when the levy was made. P. 429.
2. Congress has power to confer upon the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights of trustees in bankruptcy to property
adversely claimed, even when not in the possession of the bankruptcy court, and may determine to what extent jurisdiction shall

be exercised by summary proceedings and to what extent by
plenary suit. Pp. 430, 438.
3. But the bankruptcy court has not been given jurisdiction by summary proceedings or otherwise to avoid, under § 67f, a lien created
by levy of an execution under a judgment of a state court within
four months preceding the filing of the petition in bankruptcy,
where the property is in the actual possession of the sheriff and
neither he nor the judgment creditor has appeared in or consented to adjudication by the bankruptcy court, and where the
claim of the creditor that the bankrupt was not insolvent at the
time of judgment and levy is not colorable but substantially
supported. Id.
4. Section 67f, in providing that the bankruptcy court may order
that a lien void as against the trustee shall be preserved for the
benefit of the estate, does not confer, by implication, jurisdiction
to determine whether the lien is void, but grants substantive rights
effected by means of subrogation. P. 435.

premises occupied by it. The levy created a lien upon
the property. New York Civil Practice Act, § 679. The
sheriff took, and thereafter retained, exclusive possession
and control of the property. Within four months of the
date of the levy, the Cowen Co. filed, in the Southern
District of New York, a voluntary petition in bankruptcy
and was adjudged a bankrupt. Relying upon subdivision f * of § 67 of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustees sought,
by a summary proceeding before the referee, to have the
lien on execution declared void and to obtain possession
of the property. The referee ordered that the judgment
creditor show cause before him why this should not be
done. Before the District Court, the judgment creditor
seasonably challenged the jurisdiction of the referee and
of the bankruptcy court; furnished substantial support
for its claim that tfe debtor was solvent at the date of
the entry of judgment and levy of execution thereon; and
linsisted that, since the bankrupt did not have, and the
bankruptcy court did not acquire, possession of the property, the execution lien and the right to possession under
"f. That all levies, judgments, attachments, or other liens, obtained through legal proceedings against a person who is insolvent,
at any time within four months prior to the filing of a petition in
bankruptcy against him, shall be deemed null and void in case he is
adjudged a bankrupt, and the property affected by the levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien shall be deemed wholly discharged
and released from the same, and shall pass to the trustee as a part
of the estate of the bankrupt, unless the court shall, on due notice,
order that the right under such levy, judgment, attachment, or other
lien shall be preserved for the benefit of the estate; and thereupon
the same may pass to and shall be preserved by the trustee for the
benefit of the estate as aforesaid. And the court may order such
conveyance as shall be necessary to carry the purposes of this section
into effect: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall have the
effect to destroy or impair the title obtained by such levy, judgment,
attachment, or other lien, of a bona fide purchaser for value who shall
have acquired the same without notice or reasonable cause for
inquiry."

the levy could not be assailed by the trustees except by a
plenary suit in the appropriate forum. The trustees, on
the other hand, urged that the referee had jurisdiction,
even if the adverse claim by the judgment creditor be
deemed a substantial one. The District Court sustained
the contention - of the judgment creditor and stayed the
proceeding before the referee. Upon a petition to revise,
its order was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
286 Fed. 351. The case is here on writ of certiorari. 260
U. S. 719.
A trustee seeking to have declared void, under subdivision f of § 67, a lien obtained through legal proceedings, and to recover possession of property, may be confronted with an adverse claim upon several grounds. It
may be asserted that the lien attacked is of a character
different from those provided for in that subdivision."
Or, although the lien (e. g., that obtained by levy of
execution) is clearly one to which subdivision f applies,
that it is valid by reason of other facts. For the statute
does not, as a matter of substantive law, declare void
every lien obtained through legal proceedings within four
months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. The
lien may be valid, because the debtor was, in fact, solvent
at the time the levy was made.' Or, although th& debtor

was then insolvent, because the property had passed into
the hands of a bona fide purchaser.' Or, although the
debtor was then insolvent and the levy was made within
the four months, because inchoate rights by way of lien
had been acquired earlier.' As the establishment of any
one of these facts would bar recovery by the trustee, their
assertion presents a judicial question. In this case, since
the possession of the sheriff was the possession of the state
court, the trustees' claim to the property would, under
general principles of law, have to be litigated in the state
court.' The question for decision is: Has Congress conferred upon the bankruptcy court, under these circumstances, jurisdiction to adjudicate the controverted rights
by summary proceedings?
Congress has, of course, power to confer upon the
bankruptcy court jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights of
trustees to property adversely claimed. In matters relating to bankruptcy its power is paramount.' Hence,
even if the property is not within the possession of the
bankruptcy court, Congress can confer upon it, as upon
any other lower federal court, jurisdiction of the controversy, by conferring jurisdiction over the person in

insolvent at the date of the attachment. In Chicago, Burlington &
Quincy R. R. Co. v. Hall, 229 U. S. 511, 514, it is found that the
debtor was insolvent at the time of the garnishment. See In re Ann
Arbor Machine Co., 278 Fed. 749, 752. As against an adverse claimant, the mere adjudication of bankruptcy does not, even in involuntary proceedings, conclusively establish insolvency at the date of the
attachment or levy. Compare Gratiot State Bank v. Johnson, 249

whose possession the property is. Congress has, also
(subject to the constitutional guaranties), power to determine to what extent jurisdiction conferred, whether
through possession of the res or otherwise, shall be exercised by summary proceedings and to what extent by
plenary suit.7 But Congress did not, either by § 2, § 23
of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 or any other provision
of the act, confer generally such broad jurisdiction over
claims by a trustee against third persons." Nor has it
provided, in terms, that a substantial adverse claim to
property which is not in the po-ssession of the bankruptcy
court and which is demanded by the trustee under subdivision f of § 67, may be litigated, without consent, by
a summary proceeding. To sustain the judgment under
review, a specific grant of power to so deal with such
a controversy must be shown. The contention is that
a specific grant of the power is implied in a clause contained in subdivision f. Before examining the clause, it
will be helpful to consider the rules, established by decisions of this Court, governing-Mfe proceedings under
provisions of the Bankruptcy Act cognate to subdivision
f of § 67.

definition of the scope of summary proceedings, it has been determined by decisions of this Court and the General Orders in Bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court may deal by summary proceeding
with property in its possession in all matters administrative in
their nature; and also with all matters judicial in their nature, to
the extent commonly practiced in coufts of equity. See United
States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Bray, 225 U. S. 205, 217;

ing to the bankrupt and which, within four months of
the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy, had
been subjected, in some manner, to a lien. The substantive rights of the trustee under these provisions
differ according to the nature of the lien or of the infirmity therein. Under subdivision e of § 67, where the
lien was created in pais, it is voidable if it was made,
within the four months, with the intent to hinder and
defraud creditors, or if, within that period, it was made
while insolvent under such circumstances that, under
the laws of the State where the property is situated, it
is void as to creditors. Under subdivision b of § 60,
the lien is voidable, whether it was created in pais or
through legal proceedings, if it was created within the
four months while the debtor was insolvent and the
effect of its enforcement would be to give a preference.
Under subdivision e of § 70 a lien, however created,
although not within the four months, is voidable by
the trustee, if any creditor of the bankrupt might
have avoided it. But the adjective rights of the
trustee to litigate in the bankruptcy court claims incident to the lien were the same under these differing
provisions.
By the Act of 1898, as originally enacted, the power of
the bankruptcy court to adjudicate, without consent, controversies concerning the title, arising under either § 67 e
or § 60 b, or § 70 e, was confined to property of which it
had possession. The possession, which was thus essential
to jurisdiction, need not be actual. Constructive possession is sufficient. It exists where the property was in the
physical possession of the debtor at the time of the filing
of the petition in bankruptcy, but was not delivered by
him to the trustee; 9 where the property was delivered to
the trustee, but was thereafter wrongfully withdrawn from

his custody;"0 where the property is in the hands of the
bankrupt's agent or bailee;" where the property is held
by some other person who makes no claim to it; 2 and
where the property is held by one who makes a claim, but
the claim is colorable only. 3 As every court must have
power to determine, in the first instance, whether it has
jurisdiction to proceed, the bankruptcy court has, in every
case, jurisdiction to determine whether it has possession
actual or constructive. 4 It may conclude, where it lacks
actual possession, that the physical possession held by
some other persons is of such a nature that the property
is constructively within the possession of the court.'"
Wherever the bankruptcy court had possession: it could,
under the Act of 1898, as originally enacted, and can now,
determine in a summary proceeding controversies involving substantial adverse claims of title under subdivision e
of § 67, under subdivision b of § 60 and under subdivision
e of § 70.1 But in no case where it lacked possession,

could the bankruptcy court, under the law as originally
enacted, nor can it now (without consent) adjudicate in
a summary proceeding the validity of a substantial adverse claim.' 7 In the absence of possession, there was
under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, as originally passed, no
jurisdiction, without consent, to adjudicate the controversy even by a plenary suit. 8 The Act of February 5,
1903, c. 487, § 8, 32 Stat. 797, 798, 800, together with the
Act of June 25, 1910, c. 412, § 7, 36 Stat. 838, 840, conferred upon the bankruptcy court jurisdiction, under certain circumstances, against the adverse claimant, in a plenary suit under § 60, subdivision b, § 67, subdivision e, and
§ 70, suldivision e. But no amendment has conferred
upon the bankruptcy court jurisdiction, even in a plenary suit, of proceedings under subdivision f of § 67.
The controversy presented when a trustee proceeding
under subdivision f of § 67 is confronted with a substantial
adverse claim to property not in his possession, does not
differ in character from that presented by like proceedings under the other sections discussed. No reason is suggested why the Act of 1898 should have granted to the
bankruptcy court jurisdiction in cases arising under § 67,
subdivision f, while it did not in like cases arising under
these other provisions. Nor is any reason suggested why
Congress should have granted by that act power to adjudicate the controversy arisilrg under subdivision f of § 67 in

Opinion of the Court.

a summary proceeding, while it has never permitted a like
controversy arising under any of the other provisions di5cussed above to be dealt with otherwise than in a plenary
suit.1"
The contention that Congress did confer upon the bankruptcy court the exceptional jurisdiction to determine in
a summary proceeding substantial adverse claims arising
under subdivision f, concerning the title and possession
of property not in its possession, rests wholly on the following clause of that subdivision:
"the property affected by the levy [held void]
shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate of the
bankrupt, unless the court shall, on due notice, order that
the right under such levy . . . shall be preserved by
the trustee for the benefit of the estate as aforesaid. And
the court may order such conveyance as shall be necessary
to carry the purposes of this section into effect."
The argument is that, since the bankruptcy court is
expressly empowered to order that a lien void as against
the trustee shall be preserved for the benefit of the estate,
it was given, by implication, jurisdiction to determine
whether the lien is void. The argument proceeds upon a
misapprehension of the nature and purpose of the clause
in question. It does not confer jurisdiction. It confers
substantive and adjective rights. Its grant of substantive
rights, effected by means of subrogation, is a grant of
property interests which the bankrupt did not own at the
19 The Act of 1841 was said, in Ex parte Christy, 3 How. 292,
312, to have conferred upon the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over
adverse claims, although the property was not in its possession; and
it was also said, that this jurisdiction might be exercised by summary proceeding. But see Bardes v. Hawardea Bank, 178 'T. S.
524, 533, 534. The Act of 1867 conferred the jurisdiction upon
the federal district and circuit courts; but required that the jurisdiction be exercised in a plenary suit. Smith v. Mason, 14 Wall.

time of filing the petition." Thus, an execution lien upon
property, owned by the debtor at the time of the levy
and good as against a subsequent purchaser but void as
against the trustee under subdivision f, may be preserved
for the benefit of the estate. If the lien were not so preserved, the benefit resulting from nullifying it would
enure to the purchaser. Subrogation is the process by
which this substantive right is made available. 1 Where
the bankrupt remained owner of the property until the
commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings and the
void lien remained the only encumbrance on the property, there is no need of preserving it. But in such a
case it may be desirable to invoke the strictly adjective
powers conferred by the clause, and to apply for an order
that a release or conveyance be made so as to remove
a cloud upon title.22
The substantive right of subrogation which the clause
confers can come into effect only after the invalidity of
the lien as against the trustee has been established either
by an admission of the holder of the lien or by an adjudication. It is entirely immaterial, so far as concerns
the enjoyment of the right of subrogation, in which of

Staake, 202 U. S. 150. Compare In re Hammond, 98 Fed. 845.
' The void lien is not preserved for the estate unless the trustee
requests that it be done. See Goodnough Mercantile & Stock Co. v.
Galloway, 171 Fed. 940; In re Walsh Bros., 195 Fed. 576; In re
Prentice, 267 Fed. 1019, 1020. Compare Thompson v. Fairbanks,196
U. S. 516, 527, 528; Dufly v. Charak, 236 U. S. 97, 100. The occasion
for seeking subrogation under this clause of § 67, subdivision f, has
been lessened by the amendment to § 47, clause 2, of subdivision a
of the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 412, § 8, 36 Stat. 838, 840, by which a
trustee in bankruptcy "as to all property in the custody or coming
into the custody of the bankruptcy court, shall be deemed vested
with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor holding a lien
by legal or equitable proceedings." Compare Bailey v. Baker Ice
Machine Co., 239 U. S.268, 276.

these ways the invalidity is established. It is entirely
immaterial, where it is established by an adjudication,
whether it be that of a state court, the bankruptcy court
or of the federal district court sitting at law or equity.
In every case in this Court in which this right to subrogation has been exercised (and in most cases in the
lower courts), -3 following an adjudication of invalidity
made by the bankruptcy court, there had been either
consent that jurisdiction be taken for that purpose 11 or
there was possession of the res by that court."

In this case, the sheriff had, before the filing of the
petition in bankruptcy, taken exclusive possession and
control of the property; and he had retained such possession and control after adjudication and the appointment
of the trustees. 8 The bankruptcy court, therefore, did
not have actual possession of the res. The adverse claim
of the judgment creditor was a substantial one. The
bankruptcy court, therefore, did not have constructive
possession of the res. Neither the judgment creditor,
nor the sheriff, had become a party to the bankruptcy
