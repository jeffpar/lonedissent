GUARANTY TITLE & TRUST CORPORATION,
RECEIVER OF VUE DE L'EAU COMPANY, v.
UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 109.

Argued November 14, 1923.-Decided February 18, 1924.

1. Under the Virginia Code, 1919, ยง 5805, providing that no person
shall make an entry on, or bring action to recover, any land lying
east of the Alleghany Mountains, but within 15 years next after
the time when the right to do so first accrued to himself or to
some person through whom he claims, adverse possession for the
required period not only bars the owner's right of entry or action
but vests title in the disseisor. P. 204.
2. The disseisor need not have a deed or writing giving color of title
or furnishing foundation for belief or claim of ownership or legal
right to enter and take possession; his intention to appropriate
and use the land as his own to the exclusion of all others suffices.
Id.
3. Acts sufficient to apprise exeryone of exclusive occupation and
use, with unequivocal, emphatic and public assertion of ownership,
held to have met the requirements of the Virginia law governing
title by adverse possession. P. 205.
4. Where one of two rival claimants in the Court of Claims was
rightly awarded the judgment, but payment of the money subsequently appropriated by Congress was withheld because of an
appeal taken by the other in which the former intervened as
appellee, this Couit, in affirming the judgment, required the appellant to pay the successful claimant costs and interest on the judgment from the date of the appropriation until funds should be

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Claims awarding recovery, for land taken by the United States, to one
of two rival claimants of the title. The defeated claimant, Guaranty Title & Trust Corporation, as receiver,
which had intervened in the Court of Claims, took the
appeal. The other claimant, Norfolk-Hampton Roads
Company, original plaintiff, was permitted to intervene
here as an appellee.

Mr. Solicitor General Beck and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat,
Special Assistant to the Attorney General, filed a brief
on behalf of the United States.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1873, the Vue de L'Eau Company, a Virginia corporation, owned a tract of about 294 acres at Hampton
Roads, Virginia. It platted the "Prize Lot Reserve"
(hereinafter called the "Reserve "), containing 4.55 acres,
into lots and streets. In January, 1874, after having sold
seven of these lots, it made an assignment for the benefit
of its creditors and conveyed to trustees all of its land except the Reserve. Then the company became dormant.
No organization was kept up. It had no directors or
officers. But there was no formal dissolution or surrender
of the charter. Thereafter, no action was taken by or in
behalf of the company in reference to this land. It was
allowed to remain in its former condition and to develop
forest growth.

Opinion of the Court.

264 U. S.

The Court of Claims found that in 1899 the NorfolkHampton Roads Company purchased'a large acreage of
land, including that immediately surrounding the Reserve,
and, in the language of the findings of fact,". . . upon
purchasing said lands the plaintiff company, [NorfolkHampton Roads Company] without any right, title or
interest, or claim of right, title or interest, in or to the
lots or land of said Prize Lot Reserve, and with full knowledge of the fact that it had no claim of right, title or interest in or to any part of said lots or land, deliberately set
about trying to acquire title to said lots and land by adverse possession; and in the course of its efforts to so
acquire title thereto, the following action was taken: The

plaintiff company
ings and from thenceforward to the time of its taking by
the Government in June, 1917, treated the land of said
Reserve as though it belonged to the plaintiff company.
It recorded plats of its said property in which the land of
said Reserve was included and indicated as a part of the
company's holdings. The company's advertising matter
issued in 1899 indicated as belonging to the company lands
which included the lands of said Reserve, and said land
was included in the company's subdivision known as
'Subdivision No. 1, Norfolk on the Roads,' a plat of which,
stating said subdivision to be the 'Property of NorfolkHampton Roads Company,' was recorded in the County
Clerk's office on June 14, 1901. In the development of its
said property, streets were opened and graded through the
land of said Reserve; timber was cut therefrom and used
or marketed by the company; and bulkheads were built by
the company in front of the property to protect it from
erosion by the waves and tides. Said company also leased
an area of its lands to the Jamestown Exposition Company, in 1907, including therewith said Prize Lot Reserve
land as belonging to plaintiff company, and thereafter,
upon the termination of the Exposition Company's lease,

Opinion of the Court.

said lands were leased by plaintiff company to another
tenant, by whom they were occupied for some time. And
in general, the land of said Reserve was held out and
treated by plaintiff company as being the property of
said company. It does not satisfactorily appear who, if
anyone, paid the taxes on said land between the years
1874 and 1917."
June 28, 1917, the United States, pursuant to an Act
of Congress of June 15, 1917. 40 Stat. 207. took 9.22 acres
of land fronting on Hampton Roads for a naval base, made
up of the Reserve and 4.67 acres immediately surrounding it. At that time the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company was in possession of the tract taken. The compensation fixed by the President, $37,000, was not satisfactory.
Payment of 75 per cent., as provided by the act, was not
made because there was a question as to the title to the
Reserve. The company sued the United States in the
Court of Claims. 40 Stat. 207, 208; Judicial Code, ยง 145.
Thereafter,, in a suit brought in the Circuit Court of the
City of Norfolk, Virginia, against the Vue de L'Eau Company by one of its stockholders, the Guaranty Title &
Trust Corporation was appointed receiver of the company
to take charge of its property and to prosecute claims and
suits for the protection of its rights and interests. The receiver intervened in this case in the Court of Claims,
alleging that the Vue de L'Eau Company was the owner of
the Reserve at the time of the taking, and that it is entitled to compensation therefor. The Court of Claims
found that, at the time of the taking, that part of the
tract, title to which is not in controversy, was worth
$35,500, and that the Reserve, claimed by both parties.
was worth $33,000, and gave judgment in favor of the
Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company for the whole $68,500. The receiver appealed. September 22, 1922, Congress made appropriation for the payment of this judg-

ment. 42 Stat. 1052. The amount fixed as compensation
for the land not claimed by appellant was paid. Because
of the claim of appellant, the United States withholds
payment of the balance until the determination of this
appeal. June 4, 1923, this Court granted leave to the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company to intervene as party appellee, and required appellant to give bond " . . . to
secure the payment of costs of the appeal as well as interest on $33,000 . . ." [262 U. S. 733.]
The owner at the time of the taking is entitled to the
balance remaining unpaid. The question for decision is
whether the Vue de L'Eau Company or the NorfolkHampton Roads Company was then the owner of the Reserve.
A Virginia statute provides that, "No person shall make
an entry on, or bring an action to recover, any land lying
east of the Alleghany mountains, but within fifteen years
. . . next after the time at which the right to make such
entry or bring such action shall have first accrued to himself or to some person through whom he claims.Code of 1919, ยง5805. By adverse possession and lapse of
time the owner's right of entry or action is barred, and
title is acquired by the occupant. Cochran v. Hiden, 130
Va. 123, 142; Virginia Midland R. R. Co. v. Barbour, 97
Va. 118, 123; Creekmur v. Creekmur,75 Va. 430, 435, 439;

The disseisor need not have a deed or other writing
giving color of title or furnishing foundation for belief or
claim of ownership or legal right to enter or take possession of land. Sometimes misapprehension arises from the
somewhat misleading, if not inaccurate terms frequently
used, such as "claim of right," "claim of title," and
"claim of ownership." "These terms, when used in this
connection, mean nothing more than the intention of the
disseisor to appropriate and use the land as his own to the

exclusion of all others." Carpenterv. Coles, 75 Minn. 9,
11. On the facts found, it is clear that the necessary adverse intent of the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company existed from 1899 to the time of the taking. Cochran v.
Hiden, supra; Brock v. Bear, 100 Va. 562, 565; Haney v.
Breeden, id. 781, 784; Virginia Midland R. R. Co. v. Barbour, supra, 122; Kincheloe v. Tracewells, 11 Gratt. 587.

85 Wis. 641, 645; Rennert v. Shirk, 163 Ind.542, 545, 546.
The Reserve was inclosed on all its sides, excepting the
waterfront, by land acquired by the Norfolk-Hampton
Roads Company in 1899. In that year, it issued advertising matter indicating the land as belonging to it. It
included the Reserve and asserted ownership of it in a plat
filed in 1901. It did not leave the land in a state of nature, but changed and improved it. It opened and graded
streets, cut and removed timber for its own use and for
sale, protected the waterfront by construction of bulkheads, and leased it to others. It platted, occupied and
treated the Reserve just as it did surrounding land which
it purchased. Its acts were sufficient to apprise everyone
of its exclusive occupation and use. Its assertion of ownership was unequivocal, emphatic and public. The findings show that the possession met all the requirements of
law under the decisions of the Supreme Court of Appeal,
of Virginia. Kincheloe v. Tracewells, supra, 602; Creekinur v. Creeknur,supra,434; Virginia Midland R. R. Co.
v. Barbour,supra. See also Taylor v. Burnsides, 1 Gratt.

Co. v. Wickline, 126 Va. 223, 232. And the facts make
out adverse possession under the rule generally applied.'

The judgment is affirmed. In addition to costs of this
appeal, the Norfolk-Hampton Roads Company is entitled
to interest to be paid by appellant on $33,000 since September 22, 1922, until funds are available for payment by
the United States of the balance of the judgment.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 195. Argued January 25, 1924.-Decided February 18, 1924.
1. The questions where the line run by a survey lies upon the ground,
and whether a particular tract lies on one side of it or the other,
are questions of fact, upon which this Court will accept the concurrent findings of the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals,
unless clear error is shown. P. 211.
2. The general rule is that, in matters of boundary, calls for natural
objects and fixed monuments control those for distances; and calls
for courses prevail over those for distances. Id.
3. After a tract of land has been surveyed and patented by the
United States, its boundary cannot be affected, to the prejudice of
the owner, by surveys and rulings of the Land Department. P. 212.
