SALEM TRUST COMPANY v. MANUFACTURERS'
FINANCE COMPANY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 74.

Argued October 15, 1923.-Decided February 18, 1924.

1. In a suit between citizens of different States to determine which
of them is entitled to a fund which by their agreement has been
collected by one and deposited to his special account, as trustee,
to be paid to himself or the other as the issue between them shall
be determined, the depositary is not a necessary party, and its
joinder as defendant in the state court will not prevent removal to
the federal court. P. 189.
2. In the absence of any local statute or usage, the question whether
prior notice to the debtor of the later of two assignments of an
account receivable subordinates the rights of the earlier to those
of the later assignee, is a question of general law in deciding which
the federal court is not bound by the decisions of the highest court
of the State. P. 191.
3. While there are contingencies which entitle the second of two
successive assignees of the same chose in action to prevail over the
first, mere priority of notice to the debtor by a second assignee
who lent money to the assignor in consideration of his assignment,
without making any inquiry of the debtor, is not sufficient to subordinate the first assignment to the second. Pp. 194, 197.
280 Fed. 803, reversed.
CERTIORARI to a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals
affirming a decree of the District Court which dismissed a
suit brought by the above named petitioner against the
above named respondent, and its corespondent, International Trust Company, to determine the rights of the
first two, as assignees, to a fund deposited with the third.

Mr. Alexander Whiteside, with whom Mr. Arthur
Drinkwater and Mr. Raymond P. Baldwin were on the
brief, for petitioner.
The proceeding was erroneously removed.

Argument for Petitioner.

The trust res is the debt the Trust Company owes the
Finance Company as trustee under the agreement between petitioner and respondent. This suit was brought
by petitioner not only to determine its rights, but to
collect the debt. The Trust Company was made a party
for the purpose of collection, and for that purpose must
be an indispensable party.
The agreement also provided that the question of the
ownership of the proceeds of the assigned accounts, if the
two parties should be unable to agree on the same, should
be determined by a proper proceeding, brought by either
party, in a court of competent jurisdiction. This amounts
to an agreement on the part of the Finance Company that
petitioner might bring a proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction. While an agreement not to remove
a case to a federal court is void, it does not follow that
an agreement that a party may prosecute an action in a
state court is not valid and enforceable where based on
adequate consideration.
By the great weight of authority an assignee of a chose
in action has priority without notice over attaching or
other creditors of the assignor. 5 Corpus Juris, 971-973.
The first assignee should have priority unless for some
reason it is estopped. The assignment of a chose in
action is valid and complete, and title to it passes, before
any notice is given to the obligor. Greey v. Dockendorff,
231 U. S. 513; Putnam v. Story, 132 Mass. 205; Thayer
v. Daniels,113 Mass. 129; Fortunato v. Patten, 147 N. Y.
277; In re Hawley Furnace Co., 238 Fed. 122; Petition
of National Discount Co., 272 Fed. 570. Whether legal
or equitable, some title passes,-all that the assignor has
power to give.
In Massachusetts, in the absence of estoppel, the claim
of the first assignee will prevail against that of a subsequent assignee regardless of notice to the obligor. Thayer
v. Daniels, 113 Mass. 129; Putnam v. Story, 132 Mass.

205; Herman v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 218 Mass. 181;
Rabinowitz v. People'sNatl. Bank, 235 Mass. 102.
Since the contracts of assignment were made and to be
performed in Massachusetts, and since all parties, except
the Finance Company, were Massachusetts corporations,
and since the forum was a Massachusetts forum, the law
of Massachusetts must govern all the questions involved.
The fact that the Finance Company was a Delaware corporation does not give it the right to demand the application of the law of some other geographical unit. Horn
Silver Mining Co. v. New York, 143 U. S. 305; Shaffer v.
Carter,252 U. S. 37.
The court below erroneously held that the relative
merits of the equities of successive assignees of the same
chose in action was a question of general jurisprudence
and that, consequently, the federal courts were not bound
by decisions of the state court in determining the territorial law of Massachusetts.
The federal decisions relied on by the majority of the
court below and by the Finance Company do not justify
this Court in approving the naked rule of mere priority of
notice. Methven v. Staten Island Light Co., 66 Fed. 113;

Foster v. Cockerell, 3 Cl. & F. 456; Ward v. Duncombe,
[1893] A. C. 369. The weight of authority in the various
state courts, and also the weight of federal decisions, are
against this rule. Greey v. Dockendorff, 231 U. S. 513;

Mr. Robert G. Dodge, with whom Mr. Laurence Curths
2d was on the brief, for respondents.
The fact that the International Trust Company, which,
like the plaintiff, is a Massachusetts corporation, was
made a party defendant, did not prevent the removal of
the case. It was in no sense a necessary party, as it had
no concern whatever with the outcome of the controversy
between the plaintiff and the Finance Company. A final
decree in favor of plaintiff would naturally run against
the Finance Company only, requiring that company to
draw a check on the account in favor of the plaintiff.
The Trust Company is a mere debtor of the Finance
Company, and the fact that the deposit stands in the
name of the latter as trustee does not change the relation.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
On May 16, 1919, the Nelson Blower & Furnace Company, a Massachusetts corporation, assigned to the petitioner for a valuable consideration indebtedness to the
amount of $45,000 due or to become due to the Nelson
Company from the Murray & Tregurtha Corporation,
under a contract whereby the Nelson Company was to
construct certain engines for the latter. July 15, 1919,

the Nelson Company for a valid consideration assigned to
the respondent, Manufacturers' Finance Company, the
same indebtedness to the amount of $40,000, and on September 20 made another assignment to the Finance Company of the same indebtedness to the amount of $10,000.
Later, about the last mentioned date, the Finance Company notified the debtor of its assignment. Up to that
time it had made no inquiry of the debtor as to its indebtedness to the Nelson Company, and neither it nor the
debtor had any knowledge of the prior assignment to the
petitioner. September 26, 1919, the United States District Court in a suit in equity appointed a receiver of the
Nelson Company. About that time each assignee learned
of the assignment to the other. October 6, 1919, petitioner and respondent Finance Company agreed that the
Nelson Company, acting by its receiver, should finish the
work being done for the debtor, and that the net proceeds,
which amounted to $7,963.36, a sum less than the amount
of the claim of either assignee, should be deposited with
the respondent International Trust Company, a Massachusetts corporation, in a special account in the name of
the Finance Company as trustee for the one or the other
of such assignees thereafter to be agreed by them, or
found by some court of competent jurisdiction, to be entitled thereto. They failed to agree, and petitioner
brought a bill in equity in the state court against the respondents to establish its right to the amount so on deposit, and to have the same paid to it. For the removal
of the suit to the District Court of the United States, the
Finance Company filed its petition stating that the International Trust Company is not a necessary party to
the suit but is a mere nominal party, being only a stakeholder and without any interest whatever in the result,
and that the controversy in the suit is entirely between
citizens of different States, Salem Trust Company, a Massachusetts corporation, and the Manufacturers' Finance

Opinion of the Court.

Company, a Delaware corporation. Other proper steps
were taken, and the case was removed from the state to
the federal court. Petitioner moved to remand, asserting
that the International Trust Company is a necessary party
to the suit, and that the case was improperly removeL because the plaintiff and one of the defendants are citizens
of the same State. The motion was denied. The case
was tried in the District Court and dismissed on final decree which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
There are two questions for decision: Did the District
Court have jurisdiction? Which of the parties is entitled
to the fund?
The District Courts have original jurisdiction of coiitroversies between citizens of different States (Constitiition, Art. III, § 2; Judicial Code, § 24); and when in any
suit brought in a state court, there is a controversy, which
is wholly between citizens of different States, and which
can be fully determined as between them, a defendant interested in such controversy may remove the suit to the
proper District Court of the United States. Judicial
Code, § 28. District Courts have jurisdiction if all the
parties on the one side are of citizenship diverse to those
on the other side.' Jurisdiction cannot be defeated by
joining formal or unnecessary parties.' The right of r'moval depends upon the case disclosed by the pleadings
when the petition therefor is filed, (Barney v. Lathain,

and is not affected by the fact that one of the defendants
is a citizen of the same State as the plaintiff, if that defendant is not an indispensable party to the controversy
between plaintiff and defendant who are citizens of different States. Barney v. Latham, supra,213. The facts
set forth in the present bill are substantially those already
stated. This suit involves a controversy between the petitioner, a citizen of Massachusetts, and the respondent,
the Finance Company, a citizen of Delaware, which can
be determined without affecting any interest of the other
respondent, the International Trust Company, a citizen
of Massachusetts. The latter is not an indispensable
party. See Niles-Bement Co. v. Iron Moulders Union,
254 U. S. 77, 80. It has no interest in the controversy
between the petitioner and the other respondent. Its
only obligation is to pay over the amount deposited with
it when it is ascertained which of the other parties is entitled to it. On the question of jurisdiction, an unnecessary and dispensable party, will not be considered. Walden v. Skinner, 101 U. S. 577, 589; Bacon v. Rives, 106
U. S. 99, 104; Ex parte Nebraska, supra. The cases of
Wilson v. Oswego Township, 151 U. S. 56, and Construction Co. v. Cane Creek, 155 U. S. 283, do not support the
contention that this case was not properly removed to the
federal court. These cases hold that where the object
of the suit is to recover possession of personal property the
one in possession is a necessary and indispensable, and not
a formal, party. Here, no cause of action exists against
the International Trust Company, because it has not been
determined which of the other parties is entitled to payment. The District Court had jurisdiction. The motion
to remand was rightly denied.
As between successive assignees of the same account receivable, does prior notice to the debtor of the later assignment without more subordinate the rights of the
earlier to those of the later assignee?

SALEM CO. v. MANUFACTURERS' CO.

191

Opinion of the Court.

There is a conflict of authority on the question. Under
decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts,
which are in harmony with the decisions of the highest
courts in a number of the States,' the earlier assignee
would prevail. The courts below held the question to be
one of general jurisprudence, declined to be bound by
the Massachusetts decisions, and followed what they understood the rule to be, as applied by this and other federal
courts,4 and in a number of the States,5 and decided that

the later assignee, the first to give notice to the debtor, is
entitled to. the money.
The question is one of general law, not based on any
legislation of the State or local law or usage, and the

lower court rightly decided that it was not bound by the
rule applied in the decisions of the highest court of Massachusetts. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 18; Boyce v. Tabb, 18

Power Co., 66 Fed. 113; In re Leterman, Becher & Co.,
260 Fed. 543, 547.
The precise question now before us was not involved,
and therefore was not decided, in any of the decisions of
this Court cited by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
In Judson v. Corcoran, 17 How. 612, one Williams had a
claim against Mexico for the illegal confiscation of a cargo.
Under a treaty with Mexico (9 Stat. 922) such clahns were
to be adjusted by the United States upon allowance by a
board of commissioners created by an act of Congress.
9 Stat. 393. Judson obtained from Williams an assignment
of an interest in the claim. Later Corcoran obtained assignments covering the whole claim. The board found
that Corcoran owned the whole claim and made an award
in his favor. Judson set up no pretensions to the claim
until after the award, some six years from the time he
obtained the assignment. This Court (p. 614) pointed
out that the assignor, having parted with his interest by
the first assignment, the second assignee could take
nothing by the later assignment; that the purchaser is
entitled only to the remedies of the seller, and hence has
arisen the maxim that "he who is first in time is best in
right." The second assignee had drawn to his equity a
legal title to the fund (the award of the board of commissioners); and it was said that,-assuming that no
negligence could be imputed to the earlier assignee and
that the case was one where an equity in the same chose
in action was successively assigned to two innocent persons whose equities are equal,-there must be applied the
rule that "the equities being equal, the law must prevail."

SALEM CO. v. MANUFACTURERS' CO.
1S2

193

Opinion of the Court.

The court said (p. 615): "There may be cases in which
a purchaser, by sustaining the character of a bona fide
assignee, will be in a better situation than the person was
of whom he bought; as, for instance, where the purchaser,
who alone had made inquiry and given notice to the
debtor, or to a trustee holding the fund, (as in this instance,) would be preferred over the prior purchaser, who
neglected to give notice of his assignment, and warn others
not to buy."
Judson took his assignment in 1845 and first produced
it in 1851. In the meantime, Corcoran got his assignment, gave notice, and prosecuted it to final award. It
was held that he was entitled to the fund. Clearly that
case does not hold that mere priority of notice by a later
assignee will subordinate the rights of the first purchaser.
In Spain v. Hamilton's Administrator, 1 Wall. 604, the
fund was one-tenth of the amount to be received from the
United States on account of bonds of the Republic of
Texas, after payment of a debt owed by a bank to one
Wetmore, which the bonds were pledged to secure. Wetmore was trustee to make collection. The bank gave
Hamilton an order on him for the fund. Hamilton made
the following assignments: February 12, 1850, to Spain
in general terms, without limit as to amount and not
identifying the fund. August 30, 1850, to Wetmore for
$2,500. September 21, 1850, to Corcoran & Riggs for
$30,000, which was presented to and accepted by Wetmore. April 30, 1851, to Robb, the whole fund, subject
to Wetmore's claim and that of Corcoran & Riggs. Robb
gave notice immediately and later obtained judgment and
made seizure of the residuary fund. Hill succeeded to
the rights of Robb. The one-tenth covered by the order
of the bank in favor of Hamilton was left in the Treasury,
subject to the assignments. May 10, 1856, Spain brought
suit, claiming the fund under the document of February
12. 1850. Up to this time. neither Wetmore nor any of

264 U. S.

the other assignees had heard of Spain's claim against
the fund.
In its decision, this Court referred to Spain's negligence
and delay. It adverted to the rule that the assignee is
entitled to the remedies of the assignor and is subject to
all the equities between him and his debtor, and said:
(p. 624) "But in order to perfect his title against the
debtor it is indispensable that the assignee should immediately give notice of the assignment to the debtor,
for otherwise a priority of right may be obtained by a
subsequent assignee, or the debt may be discharged by a
payment to the assignee [assignor] before such notice."
If a debtor pays, or becomes bound to pay, a later
assignee, he is not liable to an earlier assignee who failed
to give him notice of his assignment. And if, without
notice of any assignment, he pays the assignor he cannot
be held by the assignee. To safeguard against such
things, it is necessary for an assignee to give the debtor
notice of his assignment. But it does not follow that
mere priority of notice of the later assignee, who took
nothing by his assignment, will subordinate the rights of
an earlier assignee. That case does not establish or apply
the rule contended for by respondent.
In Laclede Bank v. Schuler, 120 U. S. 511, it was held
that a bank is not liable to a holder of a check which was
not presented for payment until after the drawer had
made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors,
and directed the bank to hold the fund subject to the
order of the assignee. This case does not support the rule
applied by the Circuit Court of Appeals. A check in
usual form does not constitute an assignment. It is an
order which may be countermanded at any time before
it is cashed. Fourth Street Bank v. Yardley, 165 U. S.

earlier assignee of a chose in action is generally referred to
Dearle v. Hall and Loveridge v. Cooper, 3 Russell, 1, decided at the same time and upon the same principle. The
leading case is Dearle v. Hall. In that case, there was
much more in favor of the second assignee than mere priority of notice. Brown, cestui que trust under his father's
will, made three assignments of income payable to him
during his life by the executors. The two earlier assignments were made to Dearle and Sherring, respectively.
Each was for a part of the annual income. By the ternis
of the assignments the assignor was permitted to continue
to collect, and for years he did collect, the income assigned.
No notice of the earlier assignments was given to the executors. Before he purchased, Hall, the latest assigne,.
diligently inquired of the trustees as to Brown's title and
the amount of income paid him. The trustees knew of no
assignments, and without any suspicion of prior incum.brance, Hall in good faith purchased the entire claim. IIe
gave immediate notice of his assignment to the trustees
and received assurance that the income would be paid to
him. When it became due, an instalhnent was paid to
hin. Thereafter, the earlier assignees gave notice and demanded payment under their respective assignments.
The trustees withheld all payments. Suit was brought
by Dearle and Sherring against Hall to establish priority
of their assignments over his. In the lower court, Sir
Thomas Plumer, M. R., gave judgment in favor of Hall,
and it was affirmed by Lord Lyndhurst, L. C. Two
grounds of the decision may be gathered from the opinions:
(1) That the negligence of the prior assignees in failing to
give notice to the trustees resulted in Hall being induced
to purchase without knowledge of the prior assigmnents.
(2) That notice to the trustees was necessary to perfect
title,-as, "the act of giving the trustee notice is in a
certain degree taking possession of the fund." (See Ward
v. Duncombe, L. R. A. C. [1893] 369, 387.) These cases

did not decide that notice by a subsequent assignee after
his purchase, without any inquiry in advance of his pur
chase, will subordinate the title of the prior assignor to
that of the later. No such questions were involved. But
later, in the case of Foster v. Cockerell, in the House of
Lords, 3 Cl. &' F. 456, that question was decided in favor
of the subsequent assignee, and it appears to have become
the settled rule in England. However, it has been the
subject of much discussion and explanation by the English courts. See Wilmot v. Pike, 5 Hare, 14; Ward v.
Duncombe, supra. It appears that in 1814 in Cooper v.
Fynmore, 3 Russell, 60, Sir Thomas Plumer, V. C., himself decided that mere neglect of notice was not sufficient
to postpone the first assignee, and held (p. 64): "In
order to deprive him of his priority, it was necessary that
there should be such laches as, in a court of equity,
amounted to fraud." In 1827. Dearie v. Hail and Loveridge v. Cooper were decided. In 1833, Lord Lyndhurst,
then Chief Baron, in Smith v. Smith, 2 Cr. & Al. 231, in
the Court of Exchequer, held that the second assignee in
order to obtain priority must show that he exercised proper
caution in taking the assignment, and that he had applied to the trustees to know if any previous assignment
had been made, and that, unless he so applied to each of
the trustees, he would not have exercised due caution or
done all that he ought to have done. Lord Herschell. in
Ward v. Duncom e, supra, said (p. 380): "The language thus used by the Chief Baron is somewhat remarkable. It would seem, if correctly reported, to indicate the
view that a second incumbrancer would only obtain priority over an earlier one if he had used due caution, and had.
in fact, made such inquiry as a prudent man would of
each of the trustees. This view is in direct conflict with
the decision of this House two years later in Foster v.
Cockerell in which Lord Lyndhurst himself delivered the
leading opinion." Undoubtedly the first application of

the rule that mere priority of notice gives priority of right
was in Foster v. Cockerell, but it is always referred to
Dearie v. Hall and Loveridge v. Cooper. In Ward .v
Duncornbe, the earlier decisions by which the rule was established were discussed by Lord Herschell and Lord Macnaghten. The opinions leave the impression that the rule
itself was not deemed to be wholly satisfactory, and that
it is not very clear upon what principle it rests. Ward v.
Duncornbe, supra, 391.
There is no decision of this Court which sustains the
contention that, as between successive assignees of the
same chose in action, mere priority of notice gives priority
of right. It seems to us that the better reasons are
against such a rule. By the first assignment, the rights
of the assignor pass to the assignee. The creditor has a
right to dispose of his own property as he chooses and to
require the debt to be paid as he directs, without the assent
of the debtor. See Story, Equity Jurisprudence, 11th ed.,
§ 1057. Notice of the assignment to the debtor adds
nothing to the right or title transferred. A subsequent
assignee takes nothing by his assignment, because the
assignor has nothing to give. See Judson v. Corcoran.
supra, 614. If, after assignment, the assignor receives
payment from the debtor, he is liable to the assignee.
Failure of the first assignee to give notice does not divest
him of any title or right or vest any claim in a subsequent purchaser. It cannot injuriously affect an intendling purchaser who makes no inquiry of the debtor concerning the assignor's title. The debtor is not bound to
answer inquiries concerning the assignor's title, and there
can be no assurance that an intending purchaser can ascertain the incumbrance by inquiry of the debtor having notice of the earlier assignment. Low v. Bouverie, (1891)
L. R. 3 Ch. 82, 99. Compare Ward v. Duicombe, supra,
393. It is impossible to eliminate all risk from such a
transaction. If the second assignee elects to rely on the

representations of the vendor as to his title, and is deceived, he cannot shift his loss to the first assignee, unless
some act or omission of the latter was proximate to the
deception.
Facts and circumstances may create an equitable estoppel against the first assignee. Herman v. Mutual Life
Insurance Co., 218 Mass. 181; Rabinowitz v. People's
National Bank, 235 Mass. 102.6 It would be unconscionable to permit him to prevail over a later assignee whom
he had misled or deceived in respect of the assignor's title
at the time of purchase by the latter. But, assuming a
duty on the first purchaser to protect a subsequent assignee against deception and fraud by the assignor, there is
no ground for subordinating his claim, unless his failure
was an element in or contributed to the deception. In the
absence of inquiry by the subsequent purchaser, the
failure of the first to give notice is immaterial.
In a case where, as here, the later assignee has made-no
inquiry of the debtor in advance of taking his assignment,
there is no analogy between the giving of notice by the
'In Ward v. Duncombe, Lord Macnaghten said (p. 391):
"The general principle applicable to all equitable titles is, I think,
well expressed by Lord Cairns in Shropshire Union Railways and
Canal Company v. The Queen (L. R. 7 E. & I. at p. 506): 'A preexisting equitable title,' said Lord Cairns, 'may be defeated by a
supervening legal title obtained by transfer '-he was there speaking
of an equitable title to shares. Then he goes on: 'And I agree with
i hat has been contended, that it may also be defeated by conduct, by
representations, by misstatements of a character which would operate
and enure to forfeit and to take away the pre-existing equitable title.
But I conceive it to be clear and undoubted law, and law the enforcement of which is required for the safety of mankind, that in order to
take away any pre-existing admitted equitable title, that which is
relied upon for such a purpose must be shewn and proved by those
upon whom the burden to shew and prove it lies, and that it must
amount to something tangible and distinct, something which can have
the grave and strong effect to accomplish the purpose for which it is
said to have been produced.'"

first assignee to the debtor and the taking of possession of
tangible personal property by a purchaser. It is impossible in any real sense to transfer possession of accounts
receivable or the like, and, as to them, an assignee does not
become clothed with the indicia of ownership as does one
taking possession of tangible things. It is not accurate to
say that notice is necessary to perfect title in the assignee
of a chose in action. While failure to give notice may
become an important element in a situation from which
equitable estoppel may arise against the first assignee, it
cannot be said to be necessary to or an element in
acquisition of title.
The result will be the same if it be assumed that each
bona fide purchaser takes merely an equity in the chose in
action assigned. If equities are equal, the first in time is
best in right. Otherwise the stronger equity will prevail.
While there are contingencies which entitle the second to
prevail over the first assignee,7 we hold that mere priority
of notice to the debtor by a second assignee, who lent his
money to the assignor without making any inquiry of the
In Professor James Barr Ames' Cases on Trusts, 2nd ed., in a note
on Dearle v. Hall, it is said (p. 328): "Whatever view may be entertained as to the English doctrine which prefers the asignee who
first gives notice, the second assignee is in several contingencies clearly
entitled to supplant the first assignee. E. g. (1) If, acting in good
faith, he obtains payment of the claim assigned; Judrson v. Corcoran,
17 How. 612; Bridge v. Conn. Company, 152 Mass. :343; Bentley v.
Root, 5 Paige 632, 640; or (2) if he reduces his claim to a judgment
in his own name; Judson v. Corcoran, 17 How. 612; Mercantile Conpany v. Corcoran, 1 Gray 75; or (3) if he effects a novation with the
obligor, whereby the obligation in favor of the assignor is superseded
by a new one running to himself, N. Y. Company v. Schnyler, 34
N. Y. 30, 80; Strange v. Houston Company, 53 T'ex. 162; or (4) if he
obtains the document, containing the obligation, when the latter is in
the form of a specialty. Re Gillespie, 15 Fed. 734; Bridge v. Conn.
Company, 152 Mass. 343; Fisher v. Knox, 13 Pa. 622. In all these

prior assignee cannot properly deprive him of this legal right,"

GUARANTY TITLE & TRUST CORPORATION,
RECEIVER OF VUE DE L'EAU COMPANY, v.
UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 109.

Argued November 14, 1923.-Decided February 18, 1924.

1. Under the Virginia Code, 1919, § 5805, providing that no person
shall make an entry on, or bring action to recover, any land lying
east of the Alleghany Mountains, but within 15 years next after
the time when the right to do so first accrued to himself or to
some person through whom he claims, adverse possession for the
required period not only bars the owner's right of entry or action
but vests title in the disseisor. P. 204.
2. The disseisor need not have a deed or writing giving color of title
or furnishing foundation for belief or claim of ownership or legal
right to enter and take possession; his intention to appropriate
and use the land as his own to the exclusion of all others suffices.
Id.
3. Acts sufficient to apprise exeryone of exclusive occupation and
use, with unequivocal, emphatic and public assertion of ownership,
held to have met the requirements of the Virginia law governing
title by adverse possession. P. 205.
4. Where one of two rival claimants in the Court of Claims was
rightly awarded the judgment, but payment of the money subsequently appropriated by Congress was withheld because of an
appeal taken by the other in which the former intervened as
appellee, this Couit, in affirming the judgment, required the appellant to pay the successful claimant costs and interest on the judgment from the date of the appropriation until funds should be
