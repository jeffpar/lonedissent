ELECTRICAL COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 93. Argued March 6, 7, 1924.-Decided April 7, 1924.
1. Upon a review by certiorari, the Court is not called upon to consider questions not raised by the petition for the writ. P. 464.
2. Claims 7 and 8 of Patent No. 1,280,105, issued to Kane, September
24, 1918, for a rigid unitary and integral support for mounting parts
of an electrical ignition device, held void because of laches in presenting them to the Patent Office. P. 465.
3. The rule that a reissue patent, expanding the patentee's original
claims, will be invalidated by a delay of two years in applying for
it unless special circumstances be proven justifying a longer delay,

of Illinois, 255 Fed. 907, and directing a dismissal of the
bill. Three patents were involved. The decision in respect of two of them turned upon the question whether
a license contract between the patentees, Henry and Emil
Podlesak, and petitioner, had the effect of precluding an
assignment of patent rights made by the Podlesaks to
respondent. But the petition upon which the writ was
granted challenged the decision below only in respect
of the third patent; and we are not called upon to consider
the contentions now advanced as to the others. Alice
State Bank v. Houston Pasture Co., 247 U. S. 240, 242.
The bill alleges that the Splitdorf Electrical Company
had infringed claims 7 and 8 of Kane patent No. 1,280,105,
issued September 24, 1918, for a rigid unitary and integral
support for mounting the various parts of an electrical
ignition device. The original application was filed by
Kane February 2, 1910, on which patent No. 1,204,573
was granted November 14, 1916. On October 24, 1914,
Kane endeavored to amend his application by introducing
six claims copied from Milton's patent, issued May 12,
1914, for the purpose of securing an interference. The
amendment was refused and Kane was directed by the
examiner to file a divisional application if he desired to
contest an interference with Milton. This was done. The
Webster Company, however, acquired the rights of both
Milton and Kane and through their attorneys conducted
the proceedings for both sides in the Patent Office, resulting in an award of priority in favor of Kane.
Subsequently, in 1915, Kane filed a divisional application, presenting nine additional claims, copied from Podlesaks' patent No. 1,055,076, issued March 4, 1913, and reissue patent No. 13,878, dated February 9, 1915; all of
which claims were ultimately decided in favor of the Podlesaks. Thereafter, on June 17, 1918, an amendment was
filed embracing the new and broader claims here in question, which were allowed upon an ex parte showing and,

Opinion of the Court.

as already stated, patent issued September 24, 1918, to
the petitioner, to whom all rights had been assigned. The
original bill was filed in 1915; and claims 7 and 8 were
brought into the suit by a supplemental bill filed October
25, 1918.
It will thus be seen that claims 7 and 8 were for the
first time presented to the Patent Office, by an amendment to a divisional application eight years and four
months after the filing of the original application, five
years after the date of the original Podlesak patent, disclosing the subject matter, and three years after the commencement of the present suit. A comparison of these
claims, as set forth in the patent, with the claims in the
original application, to say the least, leaves in doubt the
question whether they were not so materially enlarged as
to preclude their allowance on the original application.
Railway Co. v. Sayles, 97 U. S. 554, 563; Hobbs v. Beach,
180 U. S. 383, 396; Dunham v. Dennison Manufacturing
Co., 154 U. S. 103, 110; Michigan Cent. R. Co. v. Consolidated Car-Heating Co., 67 Fed. 121, 126. But this
aside, the evidence establishes to our satisfaction that
Kane did not originally intend to assert these amended
claims, because he considered their subject matter one
merely of design and not of invention; and the inference
is fully warranted that the intention to do so was not entertained prior to 1918. During all of this time their subject matter was disclosed and in general use; and Kane
and his assignee, so far as claims 7 and 8 are concerned,
simply stood by and awaited developments. We are not
here dealing, therefore, with the simple case of a division
of a single application for several independent inventions,
Patent Office Rules 41 and 42; Bennet v. Fowler, 8 Wall.
445, 448; American Laundry Machinery Co. v. Prosperity
Co., Inc., 295 Fed. 819, but with a case of unreasonable
delay and neglect on the part of the applicant and his
assignee in bringing forward claims broader than those

264 U. S.

originally sought. The repeated assertion of interferences
in narrower terms, resulting in delays incident to their
determination, affords no just excuse for the failure to
assert the broader claims, 7 and 8, at an earlier date.
The subject matter of these claims is not of such complicated character that it might not have been readily described in the original application or in one of the subsequent applications-in 1915, for example,-as it was described in 1918; and the long delay of Kane and his assignee in coming to the point tends strongly to confirm
the view that the final determination to do so was an exigent afterthought, rather than a logical development of
the original application. We have no hesitation in saying
that the delay was unreasonable, and, under the circumstances shown by the record, constitutes laches, by which
the petitioner lost whatever rights it might otherwise have
been entitled to.
We do not overlook the importance of not applying so
narrowly the patent law as to discourage the inventor
from exercising his creative genius, or the manufacturer
or capitalist from assisting in the necessary work of bringing the invention into beneficial use; but it is no less
important that the law shall not be so loosely construed
and enforced as to subvert its limitations, and bring about
an undue extension of the patent monopoly against private and public rights. In suits to enforce reissue patents,
the settled rule of this Court is that a delay for two years
or more will "invalidate the reissue, unless the delay is
accounted for and excused by special circumstances, which
show it to have been not unreasonable." Woltensak v.
Reiher, 115 U. S. 96, 101. In that case it appeared that
the reissue patent was issued to complainant December
26, 1882, upon the surrender of the original patent of
March 10, 1874. The Patent Office decided that because
of special circumstances the applicant was not guilty of
laches; but this Court held otherwise. The claims alleged

WEBSTER CO. v. SPLITDORF CO.

Opinion of the Court.

to have been infringed were expansions of the original
claims as embraced within the invention set forth in the
original patent. This Court (pp. 99-100) said:
"It follows from this, that if, at the date of the issue of
the original patent, the patentee had been conscious of
the nature and extent of his invention, an inspection
of the patent, when issued, and an examination
of its terms, made with that reasonable degree of care
which is habitual to and expected of men, in the management of their own interests, in the ordinary affairs of life,
would have immediately informed him that the patent
had failed fully to cover the area of his invention. And
this must be deemed to be notice to him of the fact, for
the law imputes knowledge when opportunity and interest,
combined with reasonable care, would necessarily impart it.
"Not to improve such opportunity, under the stimulus
of self-interest, with reasonable diligence, constitutes
laches which in equity disables the party, who seeks to
revive a right which he has allowed to lie unclaimed,
from enforcing it to the detriment of those who have, in
consequence, been led to act as though it were abandoned.
"This general doctrine of equity was applied with great
distinctness to the correction of alleged mistakes in patents, by reissues, in the case of Miler v. Brass Company,
104 U. S. 350. It was there declared, that where the mistake suggested was merely that the claim was not as broad
as it might have been, it was apparent upon the first inspection of the patent, and, if any correction was desired,
it should have been applied for immediately; that the
granting of a reissue for such a purpose, after an unreasonable delay, is clearly an abuse of the power to grant reissues, and may justly be declared illegal and void; that,
in reference to reissues made for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the patent, the rule of laches should be
strictly applied, and no one should be relieved who has

slept upon his rights, and has thus led the public to rely
on the implied disclaimer involved in the terms of the
original patent; and that when this is a matter apparent
on the face of the instrument, upon a mere comparison of
the original patent with the reissue, it is competent for
the courts to decide whether the delay was unreasonable
and whether the reissue was, therefore, contrary to law
and void.
" This doctrine has been reiterated in many cases since.
and at the present term has been reconsidered and emphatically repeated as the settled law, in the case of Mahn
*v. Harwood, 112 U. S. 354, where it is said, by Mr. Justice
Bradley, delivering the opinion of the court: 'We repeat,
then, if a patentee has not claimed as much as he is entitled to claim, he is bound to discover the defect in a
reasonable time, or he loses all right to a reissue; and if
the Commissioner of Patents, after the lapse of such
reasonable time, undertakes to grant a reissue for the purpose of correcting the supposed mistake, he exceeds his
power, and acts under a mistaken view of the law; and
the court, seeing this, has a right, and it is its duty, to
declare the reissue pro tanto void, in any suit founded
upon it.' It was also there said, that, while no invariable
rule can be laid down as to what is reasonable time within
which the patentee should seek for the correction of a
claim which he considers too narrow, a delay of two years,
by analogy to the law of public use before an application
for a patent, should be construed equally favorable to the
public, and that excuse for any longer delay than that
should be made manifest by the special circumstances of
the case."
In Ives v. Sargent, 119 U. S. 652, 661, the duty of the
patentee to examine his letters patent within a reasonable
time to ascertain whether the latter fully covered his invention was reiterated. And where this was neglected for
a period of three years, when, finding the real invention

Opinion of the Court.

had been infringed but without infringing the patent as
originally granted, an application for a reissue was made
and allowed, it was held that the patentee was guilty of
laches and the reissue came too late. The doctrine of
Wollensalc v. Reiher was restated (p. 662) to the effect
that while no invariable rule can be laid down, a delay of
two years, by analogy to the law of public use before an
application for a patent, will be fatal unless excuse for a
longer delay shall be made manifest by the special circumstances of the case. See also Topliff v. Topbfl, 145 U. S.
156; Wollensak v. Sargent, 151 U. S. 221.
While the analogy between the case of a reissue patent
and that of copying for interference is not always an exact one, it is sufficiently so, as applied to the present case,
to make these decisions pertinent; and the principle which
they announce is controlling. We brought this case here
by certiorari because of the claim that the decision of the
Court of Appeals rested primarily on Chapman v. Wintroath, 252 U. S. 126; and the contention was that the
opinion there had been misunderstood and misapplied.'
The question as thus presented, was important and one
which it was thought should be authoritatively determined. The court below finally put its decision substantially on the ground which we have stated as the basis of
our conclusion. But before doing so, it said (283 Fed.
93): "Appellants contend, however, and we agree with
the courts that have passed upon the question, that the
effect of the holding [in the Wintroath Casel is to fix the
period during which such application mlist be filed at two
years from the date of the issuance of the other patent.
No other deduction can fairly or logically be drawn from
the discussion of the question in that opinion." But
Chapmanv. Wintroath is not to be so narrowly construed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Opinion of the Court.

264 U. S.

The facts of the case were: The Chapmans filed their
application in 1909. The invention was a complicated
one and the application met with much difficulty in the
Patent Office, and, though regularly prosecuted, no patent
had been issued in 1915 when the controversy arose.
Wintroath filed an application in 1912. His invention
was also elaborate and intricate. Twenty months after
this latter application, the Chapmans filed a divisional
application in which the claims of the Wintroath patent
were copied and an interference was declared. The examiner without hearing evidence, entered judgment in
favor of Wintroath on the ground that the failure of the
Chapmans to present the interference issue for more than
a year after the date of the Wintroath patent constituted
laches, and that they were estopped. This decision was
reversed by the Commissioner of Patents, and his decision,
in turn, was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, that court holding that the one year
period should apply, on the ground that the divisional
application was to be regarded substantially as an amendment to the parent application, and that it would be
inequitable to permit a longer time than that allowed by
Rev. Stats. § 4894, for further prosecution of an application after office action. This Court, in reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals, referred to § 4886, as
amended, March 3, 1897, c. 391, 29 Stat. 692, and §§ 4887,
4897 and 4920 of the Revised Statutes, all of which contain provisions for a time limit of two years for filing applications, and said (p. 136): " Thus through all of these
statutes runs the time limit of two years for the filing
of an application, there is no modification in any of them
of the like provisions in Rev. Stats. § 4886, as amended,
and no distinction is made between an original and a later
or a divisional application, with respect to this filing
right."
If this were all, it might justify the conclusion that a
hard and fast time limit of two years is to be applied in

WEBSTER CO. v. SPLITDORF CO.
463

Opinion of the Court.

every case of a divisional application. But a reading of
the entire opinion demonstrates that this conclusion is erroneous. The Court proceeds to say that divisional applications are not to be dealt with in a,hostile spirit, but are
to be "favored to the extent that where an invention
clearly disclosed in an application . . . is not claimed
therein but is subsequently claimed in another application, the original will be deemed a constructive reduction
of the invention to practice and the later one will be given
the filing date of the earlier, with all of its priority of
right." Reference is made to Wollensak v. Reiher, supra,
and other reissue cases, which, as we have seen, adopt the
two-year time limit by analogy to the law of public use
before application for patent; and, while it is not said in
terms, the plain import of the citation of and reliance upon
these cases is that the effect of the two years' delay, as
recognized in those cases, may be overcome where it "is
accounted for and excused by special circumstances, which
show it to have been not unreasonable; " and, properly
understood, there is nothing in the opinion to the contrary.
Our conclusion, therefore, is that in cases involving
laches, equitable estoppel or intervening private or public
rights, the two-year time limit prima facie applies to
divisional applications and can only be avoided by proof
of special circumstances justifying a longer delay. In
other words, we follow in that respect the analogy furnished by the patent reissue cases.
