Nos. 690 and 691.

Argued March 17, 1924.-Decided April 7, 1924.

1. Business so nearly akin to banking as to be equally clothed with
a public interest may be brought under state supervision by confinement to corporations. P. 373.
2. So held of a business, conducted by a common-law trust, of soliciting and receiving loans in small monthly payments under loan
contracts which entitled the respective lenders, when they had paid
in a stated percentage, to borrow the face value of their contracts
in the order of their applications therefor on real estate security,
or, upon sale of this borrowing right, to receive the amounts paid
in on their contracts with a problematical "bonus ", or, by paying
up contracts in full, to receive back their face value with a share
in a "surplus,"--with provisions as to forfeiture, etc. Id.
:3.
A law of New York forbidding any individual, partnership or unincorporated association to engage in the business of receiving
deposits or payments of money in installments, for coiperative,
mutual loan, savings or investment purposes, in sums of less than
$500 each, held not violative of the Equal Protection Clause in

Opinion of the Court.

CRoss appeals from a decree of the District Court in
a suit brought by Dillingham et al., trustees, against New
York officials, to enjoin them from enforcing a New York
statute making the continuance of the plaintiffs' business
a misdemeanor. Laws, N. Y., 1923, c. 895.

Mr. Oliver D. Burden, with whom Mr. Terry A. Lyon
was on the briefs, for appellants and cross-appellees.
Mr. Edward G. Griffin, Deputy Attorney General of the
State of New York, with whom Mr. Carl Sherman, Attorney General, was on the brief, for appellees and crossappellants.
Mr. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.
The plaintiffs in this case are the president, vice-president and secretary and treasurer, who are also trustees, of
the Mutual Benefit League of North America, described in
the bill as a common law trust and sometimes denominated plaintiff. The defendants are the Superintendent
of Banks of the State of New York, the Attorney General
and the District Attorneys of the same State. The suit
is a proceeding in equity brought to prevent the enforcement of an act of the state legislature approved June 1,
1923, Laws of 1923, c. 895, which makes the continuance
of the plaintiffs' business a misdemeanor. The ground of
the bill is that the statute impairs the obligation of contracts, deprives the plaintiffs and those whom they represent of their liberty and property without due process
of law, and denies them the equal protection of the law,
contrary to ยง 10, Article I, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The case
was heard by three judges under ยง 266 of the Judicial
Code, and an interlocutory injunction was issued against
prosecuting "this plaintiff" and enforcing the law as to
contracts actually entered into on or before June 25, 1923,

the date of the hearing, but except to that extent was
denied. Both parties appeal.
The statute forbids any individual, partnership or unincorporated association to engage in the business of receiving deposits .or payments of money in installments,
for coperative, mutual loan, savings or investment purposes in sums of less than five hundred dollars each; or
to conduct a business similar to the business of a savings
bank or a savings and loan association, or to promise to
make loans upon real estate security for building &c.
purposes as an inducement for the payment of such sums.
There are amplifications to stop rat holes, but they need
not be stated as it is not denied that the plaintiffs are
within the act. The plaintiffs' business consists in soliciting and receiving payments under a complicated document which it is unlikely that the applicant will understand. It is called a three per cent. loan contract and
bears the large letters "Face Value $-".
The so-called
face value is the amount ultimately to be paid by the
applicant, and is $100 or more. One per cent. of the
amount is to be paid by the applicant monthly.. The contracts are placed in a series which is closed at $140,000.
The first four and one-half payments are applied by the
plaintiffs to the expenses of the business. The subsequent
receipts go into a fund appropriated to the series, as do
also interest on loans and lapses within the series. When
that fund is equal to the face value of a contract, the
first apjilicant in the order in time, if he has paid ten per
cent., may borrow the face value of his contract at three per
cent. on an approved first mortgage of real estate, repaying at least seven dollars per thousand every month, or
he may permit the plaintiffs to sell his right, and receive
the amount that he has paid in, with a problematical
bonus that need not be described. If he prefers to keep
on and pay the full face value the plaintiffs thirty months
later will repay it without interest but with a share in

Opinion of the Court.

a surplus, if any, that we need not explain. Failure to
pay five installments forfeits the contract, but after six
payments the applicant may get a certificate for a considerably less sum than he has paid, increasing however
with the increase in the number of the payments, and
payable in one hundred months or less at the option of
the trustees. Further particulars are superfluous, but it
is obvious that the position and rights of the applicant are
very largely dependent upon chance so far as he is concerned. It is true that his position in the series is certain,
but it is extremely improbable that he is told what it will
be, as a man would not be likely to come into a series
if he knew that a large number of people were entitled
ahead of him to whatever advantages the scheme offered.
What a man does not know and cannot find out is chance
as to him, and is recognized as chance by the law. Otherwise insurance lost or not lost would not be a valid contract.
That however is not the question here. The statute
in controversy is not aimed at gaming of any sort, but
is a regulation of a business so far akin to banking as to
be at least equally clothed with a public interest, and subject to regulation. A State may confine banking to corporations. Shallenbergerv. First State Bank of Holstein,
219 U. S. 114. We see no reason why it may not confine
the plaintiffs' business in the same way. It is argued
that the business is prohibited altogether, because the
statute makes "any person" violating it a criminal. It
is said truly enough that a corporation is a person in the
sense of the New York laws. But a corporation could
not violate this law because its commands are addressed
only to individuals, partnerships, and unincorporated
associations. So far as this section is concerned it does
not prevent the plaintiffs from going on with their business if they will subject themselves to the supervision
incident to the corporate form.

Opinion of the Court.

264 U. S.

The distinction between the businesses of receiving
small deposits and those above five hundred dollars is
legitimate. The small sums generally come from people
without much knowledge of such affairs. Whatever may
be one's own opinion about the wisdom of trying to save
the ignorant and rash from folly, it is a recognized power
that is used in many ways. We have adverted to the element of chance in this very undertaking because it is
one not likely to be realized by an applicant. This and
the long delay and loss that may ensue upon any particular deposit would be sufficient warrant for the State's
effort at least to bring such business under supervision and control, if not to prevent it altogether. It is
said that the statute as drawn extends to cases with which
it would be irrational to interfere. The Judges below
were careful to exclude such a construction, but at all
events it is no concern of the plaintiffs. The statute so
far as it applies to -them must be upheld. Engel v.
O'Malley, 219 U. S. 128.
We do not agree with the Court below as to present
contracts. The operation of reasonable laws for the
protection of the public cannot be headed off by making
contracts reaching into the future. Manigault v. Springs,
199 U. S. 473, 480. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v.
Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 482. Atlantic Coast Line R. R.
Co. v. Goldsboro, 232 U. S. 548, 558. Denver & Rio
Grande R. R. Co. v. Denver, 250 U. S. 241, 244. We are
of opinion that the injunction should have been denied
altogether. If there are objections to the law under the
the State constitution that we do not perceive, they will
be open to the present plaintiffs when proceedings are
instituted in the State Courts.
Decree reversed.
Preliminaryinjunction denied.
