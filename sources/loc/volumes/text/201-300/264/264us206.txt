APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 195. Argued January 25, 1924.-Decided February 18, 1924.
1. The questions where the line run by a survey lies upon the ground,
and whether a particular tract lies on one side of it or the other,
are questions of fact, upon which this Court will accept the concurrent findings of the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals,
unless clear error is shown. P. 211.
2. The general rule is that, in matters of boundary, calls for natural
objects and fixed monuments control those for distances; and calls
for courses prevail over those for distances. Id.
3. After a tract of land has been surveyed and patented by the
United States, its boundary cannot be affected, to the prejudice of
the owner, by surveys and rulings of the Land Department. P. 212.

APPEAL

Argument for the United States.

from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals

affirming a decree of the District Court for the defendants
in a suit by the United States to quiet title to land.
Mr. S. W. Williams, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Mr. Solicitor General Beck was on
the brief, for the United States.
The court erred in refusing to admit in evidence the
plats and field notes showing the closing of the public
land surveys on the west boundary of the grant and also
in refusing to admit the decisions of the Land Department, holding that the west boundary of the grant was
along the line run by surveyor Compton.
The power to make and correct surveys of public lands
belongs to the political department of the Government
and not to the judicial. Cragin v. Powell, 128 U. S. 691;
Kirwan v. M11urphy, 189 U. S. 35. Therefore, the survey
of 1882 was admissible on the trial of this cause in 1918
as an archive of the General Land Office, if upon no other
ground. Ayers v. Watson, 137 U. S. 584.
It is stipulated that the Walker survey was not approved by the Interior Department. His location of the
Means line was never adopted by the Department, but
the latter accepted the Compton survey as the west
boundary of the grant. The plaintiff was clearly entitled
to show what the Secretary of the Interior had decided
on this question.
The Walker line must be rejected because it was not
accepted or approved by the Land Department and because the stones found by Walker do not answer either
the calls of the patent or the calls of the grant.
Means' survey was so erroneous as to be fraudulent;
indeed, it was no survey at all and is not binding upon
the Government. It follows therefore, that if the court
is not satisfied with the Compton survey it should order
a new survey by the Land Department.

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Opinion of the Court.

264 U. S.

The line run by the deputy surveyors in 1882 has been
regarded as the west boundary of the grant from the time
it was run until the question was agitated by the grant
claimants about the year 1907, a period of some 25 years.
During all that time the land here involved was regarded
as public land of the United States and administered accordingly. When the question was raised by the grant
claimants, the Interior Department adhered to this line
and refused to change it.
It was held in Iowa v. Carr, 191 Fed. 257, that possession
was prima facie evidence of title to real estate. Where the
lands of respective owners adjoin, and for many years one,
with the silent acquiescence of the other, has had possession and occupation to a certain line between them
claiming title, these facts constitute strong evidence of the
correctness of the line, and that line should be taken as the
correct line in the absence of persuasive countervailing evidence. See also United States v. Stone, 2 Wall. 525,
537; Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503.
The grant claimants have no equities to be considered.
They have never been in possession of the land in controversy; and for 25 years after the public land surveys
were closed upon the west boundary in 1882 they set up
no claim to it. They have received an area enormously
larger than that granted by the Mexican authorities, and
have no cause to complain. The boundary was fixed by
the public land survey of 1882 and should not be disturbed.

to a. large strip of land claimed as part of the public lands.
The defendants claim title under the "Mora Grant".
which was segregated from the public domain by a patent
issued in 1876. The United States does not challenge the
validity of the grant, and admits that the west boundary
of the grant is the east line of the public lands. The ,ole
question is whether the strip of land in dispute lies within
the limits of the grant.' This depends entirely upon the
location of the west boundary of the grant.
The Mora Grant was originally a community grant
made by the Republic of Mexico in 1835. The west boundary was described as "the Estillero." After the ces4oin t,
the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the
claim under this grant was confirmed by Congress by the
Act of June 21, 1860, c. 167, 12 Stat. 71. The grant was
surveyed, in 1861, by Thomas Means, a Deputy United
States Surveyor, under instructions of the United States
Surveyor General for New Mexico. The patent, after
setting forth the descriptive notes of Means' survey,
authenticated by the Surveyor General. granted to the
patentees "the tract of land embraced and describe,d in
the foregoing survey," covering an area of more than
800,000 acres.
The survey describes the west boundary as a line ioore
than thirty-three miles long, running south from the
northwest corner, a point "inaccessible in the mountain
and not set": passing successively, at given distance, :t
large stone marked W.B.M.G. and EO., with given bearings to aspen and pine trees marked W.B.M.G., and
Estillero and a stone marked W.B.M.G.; a trail to Picuris;
the Pueblo river; and a large stone at the foot of a high
mountain, marked W.B.M.G.; and ending at a large stone
on the bank of the Sapello river, marked S.W.C.M.G.

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Opinion of the Court.

264 U. S.

The defendants contend that the west boundary as surveyed by Means is a north and south line passing through
"the Estillero ", and now established by stones marked by
Means and by the natural objects called for in the survey.
The Government contends that it is located more than
three miles farther east, as established by a survey made
for the Government by one Compton in 1909.
The District Judge, in an opinion reviewing the evidence, found that "the Estillero," at which Means was
instructed to establish the west boundary of the grant, is
a place in the valley of the Pueblo river; that no monuinents were found on or near the so-called Compton line;
and that the west boundary "being established from the
evidence on the ground, that is, natural objects-the
Estillero, the trail to Picuris, and Pueblo River, and the
permanent monuments, stone marked EO on one side and
W.B.M.G. on the other, stone marked W.B.M.G. and stone
south of the Pueblo River marked W.B.M.G., all now
being located in the relative positions called for in the
patent, these calls for natural objects and permanent
monuments on the ground definitely located" must control. He therefore concluded that the west boundary of
the grant is a north and south line drawn through the
monuments set by Means in 1861 at the Estillero on the
Pueblo river and now in place on the ground; and that the
United States by the patent had conveyed the land lying
east of this line and has no title thereto. A decree was
accordingly entered in favor of the defendants; quieting
their title to the land in dispute against any adverse claim
of the United States.'
On an appeal taken by- the United States, the Circuit
Court of Appeals, again reviewing the evidence, concurred in the finding of the District Court as to the location of the Estillero; found that the so-called Compton
line ran about three miles east of the monuments at the
'This relief was prayed in the defendants' answer,

Opinion of the Courf.

Estillero, did not cross the Pueblo river, and was "without
support;" and held that the west boundary of the grant
is "the north and south line through Means' monuments
at the Estillero," as had been found by the District Court.
The decree of that court was accordingly affirmed. 285
Fed. 128.
1. The questions where the line run by a survey lies on
the ground, and whether any particular tract is on one side
or the other of that line, are questions of fact. Russell v.
Land Grant Co., 158 U. S. 253, 259. In the present case
both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals
have found, from the evidence, that the west line of
Means' survey lies upon the ground in the location
claimed by the defendants, and that the land in dispute is
east of that line and within the boundary of the grant.
Under the well settled rule these concurrent findings on
questions of fact will be accepted by this Court unless
clear error is shown. Wright-Blodgett Co. v. United
States, 236 U. S. 397, 402; Bodkin v. Edwards, 255 U. S.
221, 223; Brewer Oil Co. v. United'States, 260 U. S. 77,
86. An examination of the evidence-which need not be
recited here-discloses no such error; and, on the contrary, leads us to the conclusion that the findings of the
lower courts are in accordance with the greater weight of
the testimony.
2. These findings, although extending the lines of the
grant farther west and south than the distances called for
in the survey, do not involve any erroneous application of
the law. The west line of the grant was correctly located
by reference to the Estillero, the marked stones and the
natural objects called for. The general rule is that in
matters of boundaries calls for natural objects and fixed
monuments control those for distances. Newsonz v.

v. Development Co. (C. C. A.) 254 Fed. 656, 658.
And calls for courses likewise prevail over those for distances. Ewart v. Squire (C. C. A.) 239 Fed. 34, 36. No
ground appears here for any exception to these rules.
3. The District Court did not err in refusing to admit
public land surveys made in 1882 as evidence showing the
closing of such surveys on the west boundary of the grant,
and decisions of the Land Department holding that its
west boundary was along the line run by Compton.
Although the power to correct surveys of the public land
belongs to the political department of the Government
and the Land Department has jurisdiction to decide as
to such matters while the land is subject to its supervision
and before it takes final action, Cragin v. Powell, 128 U. S.
691, 698; Knight v. Land Association, 142 U. S. 161, 177;
Kirwan v. Murphy, 189 tT. S. 35, 54, this power of supervision and correction by the Department is " subject to the
necessary and decided limitation" that when it has once
made and approved a governmental survey of public lands,.
and has disposed of them, the courts may protect the
private rights acquired against interference by corrective
surveys subsequently made by the Department. Cragin
v. Powell, supra,p. 699. A resurvey by the United States
after the issuance of a patent does not affect the rights of
the patentee; the Government, after conveyance of the
lands, having "no jurisdiction to intermeddle with them
in the form of a second survey." Kean v. Canal Co., 190
U. S. 452, 461. And although the United States, so long
as it has not conveyed its land, may survey and resurvey
what it owns, and establish and re~stablish boundaries,
what it thus does is " for its own information" and "cannot affect the rights of owners on the other side of the line
already existing." Lane v. Darlington,249 U. S. 331, 333.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
