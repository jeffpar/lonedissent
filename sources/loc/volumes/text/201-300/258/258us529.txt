DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH
CIRCUIT.

No. 200. Argued April 17, 1922.-Decided 'May 1, 1922.
1. Laws are not to be considered as applying to cases that arose before
their passage unless that intention be clearly expressed. P. 534.
2. The Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, §,202, 39 Stat. 777, imposed
a tax on the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying
after its passage "to the extent of any interest therein of which the
decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which
he has created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take.
effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death," excepting
bona fide sales for a fair consideration in money or money's worth,
and further declared, that "any transfer of a material part of his
property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof,
made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without
such a consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed
to have been made in contemplation of death." Held, that the act
does not apply to transactions consummated before its passage.

P. 534.
3. The reenactment of these provisions with an added provision that
the transfer or trust should be taxed whether made before or after
the passage of the act (February 24, 1919, c. 18, § 402 (c), 40 Stat.
1097) is not a construction of the earlier act as retroactive but the
expression of a new purpose. P. 536.

Mr. James A.-Fowler, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Mr. Solicitor General Beck was on
the brief, for defendant in error.
The act is within the taxing powerof Congress.
It plainly intends ' to' cover transfers made before' its
passage.
The words "at any time" have often been construed
and given a broad signification. Appeal of Snyder, 95

Statutes having a retroactive effect were familiar when
this law was passed. See English Succession Duty Act

of the specific provision requiring that transfers made in
contemplation of death shall be included "whether such

Opinion of the Court.

transfer or trust is made or created before or after the
passage of this act," was intended as a legislative construction of the previous act, and was not intended to include a cdsus omissus. United States v. Field, 256 U. S.
257, and Smietanka v. First Trust & Savings Bank, 257
U. S. 602, do not apply, because the specific provisions of
the later acts there construed were not -embraced in the
general provisions of the former act, while here the contrary is true. This case is governed by Bailey v. Clark, 21
Wall. 284, 288; Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., 196 U. S.

States v. Coulby, 251 Fed. 982, 985; Matter of Reynolds
Estate, 169 Cal. 600.
The statute did not contemplate that a fraudulent motive to avoid the payment of taxes was necessary for the
transfer to be taxable. Ross on Inheritance Taxes, § 111.
The phrase " in contemplation of death" does not refer
exclusively to gifts causa mortis, nor alone to gifts made
under the apprehension of death arising fr6m some present disease or some other impending peril.
The court did not err in directing the jury to consider
the presumption declared by the statute that the trust
was created in contemplation of death if made within two
years before the death.
Mr. Garret W. McEnerney, by leave of-court, filed a
brief as amicus curiae.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the -opinion of the
court.
Augusta Dickel by a deed dated April 21, 1915, assigned
and delivered to the Detroit Trust Company, stocks,

derived therefrom, both principal and income, in trust to
invest and reinvest and to pay the net income for life to.

Victor E. Shwab or on his written order. After his death
.the net income was directed to be paid to six beneficiaries,
his children. A power of delegating and selling or exchanging all securities was given to Shwab, and of reinvestment. During the life of Shwab the net income was
to be paid to him or his order. After his death the trust
was to continue during the lives of the beneficiaries and
the net income was to be paid to them during their respective lives in equal shares.
Therewere other rights and powers given to plaintiff
and the beneficiaries not necessary to mention.
The trust deed was accepted by the Detroit Trust Company on or before June 3, 1915.
Augusta Dickel died September 16, 1916, possessed of
an estate of $800,000. Seven days before her death Congress passed an act entitled, "Estate Tax Act ", 39 Stat.
777-780. The act provided that, according to certain percentages of the value of the net estate, a tax was to be
imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of the act, "to the extent
of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any
time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has
created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take
effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,
except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration
in money or money's worth. Any transfer of a material
part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or
distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two
years prior to his death without such a consideration,
shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have
been made in contemplation of death within the meaning
of this title; '

,Under the assumption that the act was applicable to
the deed made by Augusta Dickel to the Detroit Trust
Company, a tax was assessed and exacted from plaintiff
in error (here called plaintiff) in the sum of $56,548.41.

SHWAB v. DOYLE.
529.

Opinion of the Court.

Plaintiff paid it under protest and then to recover it
brought this action in the District Court of the United
States for the Western District of Michigan, Southern
Division.
A jury being impaneled to try the case, the plaintiff
presented his contentions in requests for charges. These
were: (1) To find for plaintiff. (2) Upon refusal of the
court to so charge but not otherwise, that the deed of
Mrs. Dickel to the Detroit Trust Company took effect
more than a year before the enactment of the Act of September 8, 1916, that is, took effect immediately, not in
possession or enjoyment at or after the death of Mrs.
Dickel. (3) The words "in contemplation of death" do
not refer to that general expectation of death which every
mortal entertains, but rather the apprehension which
arises from some existing condition of body or some impending peril. (4) If Mrs. Dickel when she made the
trust deed was not in that apprehension arising from that
condition of body or of an impending peril, -it was not
made in contemplation of death within the meaning of
the act of Congress. (5) Mrs. Dickel having made the
deed before the act of Congress was passed, her purpose
was not to defeat or evade the Federal Revenue Law.
There were other requests for instructions to the jury
not material to be considered except that the act of Congress was not retrospective in character and, therefore,
did not impose a tax on the deed from Mrs. Dickel to the
Trust Company. And that if it could be considered to
have that character and effect, it would be unconstitutional and void as a denial of due process of law, and the
taking of private property for public use without just
compensation, contrary to the Fifth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States.
The court ruled against all of the requests so far as the
court considered them as presenting questions of law, but
considered that whether the trust deed was made in con-

templihtion of death was a question for the jury and sub.mittedit to them, with aiding and defining explanations,
and concluded by declaring, "the whole question is the
question whether the transfer was made in contemplation
of death; that is all there is to it."
The verdict of the jury was in favor of the defendant,
upon which judgment was duly entered. It was affirmed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals (269 Fed. 321), to the
action of which this writ of error is directed.
. Plaintiff urges against the judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals all of the contentions presented in his
requests made to the District Court for instructions to the
jury, but so diverse and extensive consideration is only
necessary if the act of Congress be of retrospective operation. To that proposition we shall, therefore, address our
attention.
The initial admonition is that laws are not to be considered as applying to cases which arose before their passage unless that intention be clearly declared. 1 Kent.
455; Ridman v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 578; White v. United
States, 191 U. S. 545; Gould v. Gould, 245 U. S. 151;
Story, Const., § 1398. The comment of Story is, "retrospective laws are, indeed, generally unjust; and, as has
been forcibly said, neither accord withsound legislation
nor with the fundamental principles of the social conipact."
There is absolute prohibition against them when their
purpose is punitive; they then being denominated ex post
facto laws. It is the sense of the situation that that
which impels prohibition in such case exacts clearness of
declaration when burdens are imposed upon completed
and remote transactions, or consequences given to them of
which there could have been no foresight or contemplation when they were designed and consummated
The Act of September 8, 1916, is within the condemnation.

SHWAB v. DOYLE.
529.

Opinion of the Court.

There is certainly in it no declaration of retroactivity,
"clear, strong and imperative'!, which is the condition
expressed in United States v. Heth, 3 Cranch, 398, 413;
also United States v. Burr, 159 U. S. 78, 82-83.
If the absence of such determining declaration leaves
to the statute a double sense, it is the command of the
cases, that that which rejects retroactive operatiori must
be selected.
The circumstances of this case impel to such selection.
If retroactivity be accepted, what shall mark its limit?
The Circuit Court of Appeals found the interrogation not
troublesome. It said, "Congress would, we think, scarcely
be impressed with a practical likelihood 'that a transfer
made many years before a grantor's death (say 25 years,
to use plaintiff's suggestion) would be judicially found to
be made in contemplation of death under the legal definition applicable thereto, and without the aid of the two
years prima facie provision." In other words, the sense
of courts and juries, good or otherwise, might, against the
words of the statute, and against what might be the evidence in the case, unhelped by the presumption declared,
fix the years of its retrospect. This would seem tb make
the difficulty or ease of proof a substitute for the condition which the statute makes necessary to the imposition
of the tax, that is, -the disposition with which the transfer
is made; and certainly whether that disposition exist at
an instant before death or years before death, it is a condition of the tax.
The construction of the Governmeqt is more tenable
though more unrestrained. It accepted in bold consistency, at the oral argument, the challenge of twentyfive years, and a ruling of the Commissioner of*Internal
Revenue, in bolder, confidence, extends the statute to
"transfers of any kind made in contemplation of death
at any time whatsoever [italics ours] prior to September
8, 1916." The sole test in the opinion of that officer is

538

Opinion of the Court.

258 U. S.

"the date of the death of the decedent." He fixes no
period to the retrospect he declares, but reserves, if he be
taken at his word, the transfers of all times to the demands of revenue. In this there is much to allure an administrative officer. Indeed, its simplicity attracts anyone. It removes puzzle from construction and perplexity
and pertinence on account of the distance of death from
the transfer, risking no chances of courts or juries, in repugnance or revolt, taking liberties with the act to relieve
from its exactions to satisfy the demands of revenue.
If Congress, however, had the purpose assigned by the
Commissioner it should have declared it; when it had
that purpose it did declare it. In the Revenue Act of
1918, 40 Stat. 1097, it reenacted § 202 of the Act of September 8, 1916, and provided that the transfer or trust
should be taxed whether "made or created before or after
the passage of" the act. And we cannot accept the explanation that this was an elucidation of the Act of 1916,
and not an addition to it, as averred by defendant, but
regard the Act of 1918 rather as a declaration of a new
purpose; not the explanation of an old one. But granting the contention of the defendant has plausibility, it is
to be remembered that we are dealing with a tax measure
and whatever doubts exist must be resolved against it.
This we have seen is the declaration of the cases and
this the basis of.our decision, that is, has determined our
judgment against the retroactive operation, of the statute.
There are adverse considerations and the Government has
urged them all. To enter into a detail of them or of the
cases cited to sustain them and of those cited to oppose
them, either directly or in tendency, and the examples of
the States for and against them, would extend this opinion
to repellent length. We need only say that we have given
careful consideration to the opposing argument and cases,
and a careful study of the text of the act of Congress, and
have resolved that it should be not construed to apply to

transactions complete'd when the act became a law. And
this, we repeat, is in accord with principle and -authority.
It is the proclamation of both that a statute should not be
given a retrospective operation unless its words make that
imperative and this cannot be said of the words of the Act
of September 8, 1916.
