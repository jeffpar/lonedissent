visions of the act; and it could be eliminated without
affecting the operation of any other feature of the 'state
system. Compare Presserv. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252; Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., 256 U. S. 642. And it is clear
that the Legislature would have wished to secure the protection afforded by the other provisions, if this one should
be held to be beyond the power of the State. That it was
not the purpose of Congress to supersede state inspection
and grading acts is made manifest by ยง 29 of the United
States Grain Standards Act (p. 490). Merchants Exchange v. MIissouri, supra, p. 368.
To strike down this inspection law, instead of limiting
the sphere of its operation, seems to me a serious curtailment of the functions of the State and leaves the farmers
of North Dakota defenseless against what are asserted. to
be persistent, palpable frauds.

briefs.
MR. JUsTIcE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.
This suit was brought by companies representing 692
elevators in the State of North Dakota to enjoin*the en.,forcement of the North Dakota Grain Grading and Inspection Act, c. 138 of the Laws of North Dakota of 1919.
This act was considered and passed upon in No. 456, just

The matter was heard before three judges, and a temporary injunction was granted upon the authority of the
decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals which we have just
reviewed, and affirmed. Appeal from that order was
taken to this court. The facts are not materially different
from those presented -in the former case, and the reasons
therein stated for the conclusion reached are controlling
here, and need not be repeated.
The order of the District Court is
Affirmed.
