GREINER; EXECUTRIX OF KINGSLEY, v. LEWELLYN, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE WESTERN "DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA

No. 187.

Argued March 22, 1922.-Decided April 10, 1922.

In imposing a tax on the transfer of an estate by death, Congress has
power to require that state municipal bofids forming part of the
estate be included in determining its net value, by which the tax is
measured. Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756. P. 387.
Affirmed.

ERROR to a judgment of the District Court, for the defendant, in an action to recover taxes alleged to have been
illegally collected.

Mr. W. D. Stewart and Mr. Levi Cooke, with whom
Mr. Charles M. Thorp and Mr. R. G. Bostwick were on
the brief, for plaintiff in error.
The Federal Government cannot tax municipal securities directly or indirectly. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &
Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, 583.
.It is true that in United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S.
625, and Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S. 115, it was held in
the one case that an inheritance tax of the State of New
York could be taken out of a bequest to the United States,
and in the other that a bequest of bonds of the United
States was subject to a state inheritance tax. It is also
true that in Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, it was
decided that the United States had the power *to impose
an inheritance tax. But th6 state taxes were upheld in
the first two cases, not simply on the authority of the
State to impose an inheritance tax, but upon its admitted right to regulate the transmission or receipt of
property by death. On the other hand, the right of the
United States to levy an inheritance tax, which was
upheld in Knowlton v. More, .was based solely upbn the

GREINER v. LEWELLYN.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

general power of the United States to tax, and that case
therefore conveys no intimation that there is authority
in the United States to levy an inheritance tax upon an
object which it has no power under the Constitution to
tax at all, either directly or indirectly. The distinction
between the two, that is, between the broader power of a
State resulting from its authority not only to tax but also
to regulate the transmission or receipt of property by
death, and the narrower power, that is, of taxation alone
vested in the Government of the United States, was explicitly pointed out in Knowlton v. Moore, supra, p. 58.
This court, in United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625,
628, recognized that the inheritance tax of New York was
not a tax at all, although it was levied in the form of a
tax. Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278; Mager v. Grima, 8
How. 490; Matter of Sherman, 153 N. Y. 1; Estate of
Swift, 137 N. Y. 77, 81; Billings v. Illinois, 188 U. S. 97,
104; Strauss v. State, 36 N. Dak. 594, 601; People v.
Griffith, 245 Ill. 532, 537; Matter of Hamilton, 148 N. Y.
310, 313; Warner v. Corbin, 91 Conn. 536.
The power of testamentary disposition or succession to
a decedent's estate is purely a matter of statutory grant,
and if the State sees fit, it may withhold the privilege
altogether, Neilson v. Russell, 76 N. J. L. 27; United
States v. Perkins, supra; Matter of Watson, 226 N. Y.
384, 395; and it therefore becomes clear that it is entirely
immaterial whether the estate of a decedent be composed
of United States bonds or anything else, for to assert the
contrary would be to hold that the State could be deprived of its indisputable sovereign right of regulation
merely by the form of decedent's investment. The right
of testamentary disposition is purely a matter of grace
oh the part of the various States. Mager v. Grima,
supra; Knowlton v. Moore, supra, 55; Uterhart v. United
States, 240 U. S.598, 603; Maxwell v. Bugbee, 250 U. S.
525. A State can absolutely prohibit a devise to the

In Snyder v. Bettman, 190 U. S. 249, involving the
question whether the Federal Government could tax a
legacy to a state municipality, the municipality could
not assert that it was taking the property in its governmental capacity. It was simply taking a bequest of the
testator's proper~v and the tax was upon the testator's
roperty. Plummer v. Coler, supra. There was therefore no interference with any governmental function.
The municipality -took solely by virtue of the testator's
act and the legacy paid the tax.
1Mr. Solicitor General Beck, with whom Mr. Robert P.
Reeder, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, was on
the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
court.
This action was brought in the federal court for Western Pennsylvania against the Collector of Internal Revenue to recover part of dn amount assessed as estate tax
under the Act of September 8, 1916, c: 463, Title 11, 39
Stat. 756, 777, and paid by the plaintiff as executrix of
the estate of Kate B. Kingsley. In determining tle net
value of the estate upon the transfer of which the tax
was imposed, the Collector had included bonds issued by
political subdivisions of the State of Pennsylvania. The
exe~utrLx claimed that to include these municipal bonds
was in effect to tax them-which the Federal Government
is under the Constitution without power to do. Pollock v.
Farmers' Loan.& Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, 583, 654; 158
U. S. 601, 618, 693. The Dist.rict Court overruled this
claim and entered. judgment for defendant. The case
comes here on writ of error under § 238 of the Judicial
Code. Whether Congress has power to require that state

Opinion of the Court.

municipal bonds held by a decedent be included for
the purpose of determining the net value on which the
estate tax is imposed is the sole question presented for
decision.
That the Federal Government has power to tax the
transmission of legacies was settled by Knowlton v.
Moore, 178 U. S. 41; and that it has the power to tax the
transfer of the net assets of a decedent's estate was settled by New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345. The
latter case has established also that the estate tax imposed b' the Act of 1916, like'°the earlier legacy or succession tax, is a duty or excise, and not a direct tax like
that on income from municipal bonds. , Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra. A State may impose a
legacy tax on a bequest to the United States, United
States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625, or on a bequest which
consists wholly of United States bonds, Plummer v. Coler,
178 U. S. 115; Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278. Likewise
the Federal Government may impose a succession tax
upon a bequest to a municipal corporation of a State,
Snyder v. Bettman, 190 U. S. 249, or may, in determining
the amount for which the estate tax is assessable, under
the Act of 1916, include sums required to be paid to a
State as inheritance tax, for the estate tax is the antithesis
of a direct tax, New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, supra.
Municipal bonds of a State stand in this respect in no
different position from money payable to it. The transfer upon death is taxable, whatsoever the character of
the property transferred and to whomsoever the trinsfer
is made. It follows that in determining the amount of
decedent's net estate municipal bonds were properly included.
Affirmed.
