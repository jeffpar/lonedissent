CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 170. Argued March 17, 1922.-Decided April 10, 1922..
1. In the absence of a statute or special contract, the liability of a
connecting qarrier on a through route for the safety of freight begins when it receives it and is discharged by its delivery to and
acceptance by the succeeding carrier or its authorized agent. P. 413.
2. The Cummins Amendment deals with and modifies the commonlaw liability only of the initial carrier, xendering that carrier liable
for loss or-damage of property con~mitted to its care until delivered
to the consignee, but leaving the relation of all connecting carriers, including the terminal carrier, to the shipper or consignee
or to each other, entirely unaffected. P. 413.
3. Where a bill of lading for a through sliipment of livestock provided that no carrier, except the initial carrier, should be liable for
loss or injury not caused by it, held that the terminal carrier was
not liable to the consignee for an injury on the line of an intermediate carrier. P. 412. Georgia, Florida & Alabama Ry. Co. v.

Argument for Respondent.

258 U..S.

Mr. William R. Harr, with whom Mr. A. C. Spencer,
Mr. C. E. Cochran and Mr. John F. Reilly were on the
brief, for petitioner.
Mr. R. L. Edmiston, for respondent, submitted.
While neither-the statute nor the bill of lading contract,
in express words, makes the delivering carrier liable for
all loss and damage to the shipment, as it "does the receiving carrier, yet both necessarily imply this. And the
contract, in this case, provides for notice, in case of loss,
to be given "to the station agent at point of delivery or
at point of origin," thus distinguishing the initial and
delivering carriers from all others and making the delivering carrier equal to the initial carrier as a source to whom
the owner or holder of the bill may look to claim and
recover damage for loss or failure to deliver a shipment
in good condition and in due time.
The 1916 amendment, c. 415, ยง 19, 39 Stat. 54, provides: "No right or title of a third person, unless enforced by legal process, shall be a defense to an action,
brought by the consignee of a straight bill or by the holder
of an order bill against the carrier for failure to deliver
the goods on demand." Manifestly, this does not mean
that a consignee in San Francisco, of goods in the hands
of a carrier there which were shipped from New York,
must make his demand and institute his abtion for relief
against the initial carrier in a New York court. This
would not be a just and adequate remedy for a consignee.
In Georgia, Florida& Alabama Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling
Co., 241 U. S. 190, this court said that "the aim was to
establish unity of responsibility . . . for all losses resulting from any failure to discharge a carrier's duty as
to any part of the agreed transportation, which, as defined
in the Federal Act, includes delivery."
This statutory "unity of responsibility" necessarily
brings about " unity of contract" for each interstate ship-

ment, in which the consignee or holder is an important
party and must be accorded a just and adequate remedy,
from his standpoint.
MR. JUsTIcE CLARYE delivered the opinion of the court.
The respondent shipped two carloads of horses from
Grand -Island, Nebraska, to Spokane, Washington, for
which the initial carrier, the Union Pacific Railroad Company, issued a through bill of lading, in the form of the
customary livestock contract, and routed the shipment
over its own lines to Granger, Wyoming, thence over the
line of the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company to Huntington, Oregon, and 'thence over the lines of petitioner
to Spokane, Washington.
. While in transit the animals'developed disease, which
resulted in the death of several and in such condition -of
the others that they were delivered to the shipper-consignee on the line of the petitioner before reaching the
destination to which they were billed. The illness is
alleged to have been caused by the stock having been
given unwholesome food and water at Pocatello, Idaho,
a station on the line of the intermediate carrier, the
Oregon Short Line Railroad Company.
This suit to recover damages is against the delivering,
the terminal, carrier, the allegation of the complaint, however, being that the unwholesome food and water were.
given to the stock while in transit over the route of the
intermediate carrier, the Oregon Short Line Railroad
Company. Thus, we have presented for decision the
question, Is a terminal carrier liable to a shipper who. in
this case, is also the consignee, for injury to horses caused
by the negligence of a prior and independent carrier from
which they were received?
The livestock contract, under which the shipment
moved, contained the following provisions:

412

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Opinion of the Court.

258 U. S.

"1. Except as otherwise provided by statute law, tne
carrier undertakes to transport said shipment only over
its own line, and acts only as the agent of the shipper
with respect to the portion of the route beyond its own
line. No carrier shall be liable for damages for loss, death,
injury or delay to said animals, or any thereof, not caused
by it, but nothing contained in this contract shall be
deemed to exempt the initial carrier in case of a through
interstate transportation from any liability for loss, death,
damage or injury caused by it or any common carrier,
railroad or transportation company to which the livestock may be delivered under this contract."
/ It
is plain that this paragraph was framed to comply
with the, requirements -of the Cummins Amendment to
the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce
Act (c. 3591, ยง 20, 34 Stat. 593, 595; c. 176, 38 Stat. 1196),
but, except as therein provided, the initial carrier limits
its undertaking to its own line, declares that it acts only
as the agent of the shipper with respect to the route
beyond its own line, and the express contract is that
"no carrier shall be liable for damages for loss, death,
injury or delay to said animals, or any thereof, not
caused by it."
A verdict was rendered in favor' of the shipper-consignee, subject to the court's action on a question reserved
by stipulation of the parties; and the court, acting thereunder, set aside the verdict and rendered judgment for
the defendant. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
the District Court and held that Georgia, Florida &
Alabama 1?y. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., 241 U. S. 190, required that under the Carmack (now Cummins) Amendment, the terminal carrier should be bound by the contract of the initial carrier to deliver, precisely as the
initial carrier is bound, and was therefore liable for any
loss or damage to the property that had been occasioned
in transit through the conduct of any of the carriers.

OREGON-WASHINGTON CO. v. McGINN.
409.

413

Opinion of the Court.

In this we think the Circuit Court of Appeals fell into
error.
The settled federal rule is that, in the absence of statute.
or special contract, each connecting carrier on a through
route is bound only to safely carry over its own line and
safely deliver to the next connecting carrier, Myrick v.
Michigan Central R. R. Co., 107 U. S. 102, 107; Railroad
Co. v. Manufacturing Co., 16 Wall. 318, 324, and the liability of a connecting carrier for the safety of property
delivered to it for transportation, commences when it is
received and is discharged by its delivery to and acceptance by a succeeding carrier, or its authorized agent.
Pratt v. Railway Co., 95 U. S. 43.
The Cummins Amendment deals with and modifies the
common-law liability only of the initial carrier. It renders that carrier liable for loss or damage to the property
committed to its care throughout the entire route by
which it is billed until delivered to the consignee, but it
leaves the relation of all connecting carriers, including the
terminal carrier, to the shipper or consignee and to each
other, entirely unaffected, (Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co.
v. Riverside Mills, 219 U. S. 186, 195, 196, 197; Adams
Express Co. v. Croninger,226 U. S. 491, 511), and therefore their liability is as we have stated it unless modified by contract, and in this case, as we Lave seen, the
livestock contract, under which the shipment moved, by
expressly providing that "no carrier [other than the
initial carrier] shall be liable for damages for loss, death,
injury or delay to said animals, or any thereof, not caused
by it" leaves the common-law liability of the intermediate carrier entirely unaffected, just as the statute
leaves it.
The Blish Case, supra, was against the terminal carrier,
and one contention in that case was that under the Carmack (now Cummins) Amendment the shipper's remedy
against the initial carrier was exclusive, even where the

258 U. S.

default claimed was mis-delivery by the terminal carrier.
In denying this, this court said:
"The connecting carrier is not relieved from liability
by the Carmack [Cummins] Amendment, but the bill of
lading required to be issued by the initial carrier upon an
interstate shipment governs the entire transportation and
thus fixes the obligations of all participating carriers to
the extent that the terms of the-bill of lading are applicable and valid."
We have seen that the Amendment did not alter the
common-law liability of other than the initial carrier, and
in this case the "applicable and valid" terms of the bill
of lading expressly negative liability of any connecting
carrier for damage not caused by it.
The other contention in the'Blish Case, supra, was that
the action was barred because notice of claim, in writing,
had not been given within the time required by the bill of
lading.
In the discussion of this question this court used the
language following, by which the Circuit Court of Appeals was misled:
"When it [the initial carrier] inserts in its bill of lading
a provision requiring reasonable notice of claims 'in case
of failure to make delivery' the fair meaning of the stipulation is that it includes all cases of such failure, as well
those due to misdelivery as those due to the loss of the
goods. But the proyision in question is not to be construed in one way with respect to the initial carrier and
in another with respect to the connecting or terminal
carrier. As w6 have said, the latter takes the goods under
the bill of lading issued by the initial carrier, and its obligations are measured by its terms; . . . and if the
clatise must be deemed to cover a case of misdelivery
when the action is brought against the initial carrier, it
must equally have that effect in the case of the terminal

OREGON-WASHINGTON CO. v. McGINN.

415

Opinion of the Court.

carrier which in the contemplation of the parties was to
make the delivery."
From this language the Circuit Court of Appeals concludes, that under the Amendment the terminal carrier is
bound, by the bill of lading and the contract of the initial
carrier, to deliver as the initial carrier is bound and is
therefore liable for any loss or damage to the property
which has been occasioned through the conduct of any of
the carriers while in transit, and this led the court to the
holding that the terminal carrier was liable for the loss
and injury " although occasioned while in transit over the
Oregon Short Line."
We think the Circuit Court of Appeals misinterpreted
the only relevant expression in the above quotation from
the language by this court, viz: The .terminal carrier
"takes the goods under the bill of lading issued by thei
initial carrier, and its obligations are measured by its
terms; . . . and if the clause must be deemed to cover
a case of misdelivery when the action is brought against
the initial carrier, it must equally have that effect in the
case of the terminal carrier which in the contemplation of
the parties was to make the delivery."
What was decided in the Blish Case was that the terminal carrier was liable for failure to make delivery, just
as the initial carrier would have been if it had been sued
for mis-delivery, because by the terms of the bill of lading
each was under obligation to make final delivery. The
suit before us is not for mis-delivery or other fault of the
carrier sued, but for the fault, as alleged, of a prior connecting carrier. In express terms the bill of lading we
have here declares that no carrier shall be liable for loss or
damage not caused by it, and, therefore, -the statute not
providing otherwise, the petitioner cannot be liable for the
damage alleged to have been caused before the stock
reached its line.

416

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Syllabus.

258 U. S.

'The Carmack and Cummins Amendments were enacted
to enable the holder of a bill of lading to sue the initial
carrier for any loss or damage to property suffered on any
part of a through route, and thereby to relieve him from
the necessity of searching out and proving a case against
a terminal or intermediate carrier. 219 U. S.186, supra,p.
200. Having regard to the customary methods of doing
a through business in this country it may have been important to have given like rights against others of connecting carriers, but plainly, either from design or accident, the terms of the Amendment limit its application
to the initial carrier.
We think that the Circuit Court of Appeals was mistaken in its interpretation of the language used in the
B~ish Case opinion, and its judgment must be reversed
and the judgment of the District Court affirmed.
Reversed.
