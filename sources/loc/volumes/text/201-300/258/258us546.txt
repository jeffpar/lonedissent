U. S. 1, that an action could not be maintained against
a Collector of Internal Revenue for the recovery of a tax
in the collection and disbursement of which he had no
agency.
This was Flynn's situation and bringing him into the
case was error. Therefore, upon return of the case to the
District Court he shall be permitted to set up the defense
of non-liability, if so advised, and, if he set up the defense, it shall be ruled as sufficient for the reasons we
have given.
Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

546.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE, McKDNNA delivered the opinion of the
court.
This case involves the same'principles and contentions
passed on in Nos. 200, 236 and 303, ante, 529, 537, 542.
It, as they, is an action to recover a tax ($11,819.74)
assessed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as an
additional estate tax on the estate of Jonas B. Kis~am,
deceased, under the Act of September 8, 1916, as amended
in 1917. The action was brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The complaint was a voluminous paper and contained
at least four causes of action. As to the first, consisting
of twenty-two paragraphs, McElligott filed a demurrer.
Plaintiff made a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion was granted and a final judgment was
awarded against" defendant on the merits for the relief
prayed for in the first cause of action set forth" in the
complaint.
The judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of
Appeals, 275 Fed. 545.
The following four paragraphs are a summary of the
allegations of the complaint stated narratively:
In 1912 the decedent, Jonas B. Kissam, was the owner
of certain bonds and mortgages and corporate bonds. In
that year he conveyed the property to the plaintiff in
error, John C. Knox who, shortly thereafter, reconveyed
the same to Kissam and his wife Cornelia B. Kissam, as
joint tenants. All of the parties resided in the State of
New York.
In 1917 Kissam died leaving Mrs. Kissam surviving
him. She was made one of the executors of the will as
well as sole beneficiary thereunder.
On December 7, 1917, she as executrix and Knox as
executor, made a return of the federal estate tax on the
entire estate of Jonas B. Kissam. They included in the
return the value of one-half of the jointly owned'property

which was owned and enjoyed by decedent, but did not include the value of the one-half of the jointly owned property which had been owned and enjoyed by Mrs. Kissam
since the creating of the joint estates in July and August of 1912.
A tax of $5,354.14 based upon the return was paid by
the]plaintiffs in error. On May 9, 1919, the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue added to the estate the one-half interest of the value of the estate and assessed as a tax in
addition to that which was paid, the sum of $13,668.60.
The additional tax was paid under protest and to recover
it is the purpose of the action.
The Circuit Court of Appeals stating the contention of
the executors said, that "they claimed that the assessment was void as to the half of the joint property which
vested in Cornelia [Mrs. Kissam] before the passage of the
Act of September 8, 1916, as amended, and also that the
act itself was unconstitutional as a direct tax upon property without apportionment among the several States as
required by Article I, ยง 9, subdivision 4, of the Constitution."
But this contention was the alternative of the contention which plaintiffs in error also made, that the Act of
September 8, 1916, as amended, was not intended to have
retrospective operation. And this was the decision of the
District Court, the court saying, "It is true that section
201 provides that the tax is imposed upon the transfer of
the net estate of ' every decedent dying after the passage
of this Act'; but the assumption must be that this relates
to estates thereafter created and not to then existing
vested property." And the court added "At the tine the
statute was passed Cornelia Kissam's interest belonged to
her." The court further observed, "From the structure of
the Act, to say that the measure of the tax is the extent
of the interest of both joint tenants is, in effect, to say
that a tax will be laid on the interest of Cornelia in respect
of which Jonas had in his lifetime no longer either title or

control." The court rejected that conclusion and denied
to the acts of Congress retroactive operation. To this the
Circuit Court of Appeals was opposed and reversed the
judgment based upon it.
It will be observed, therefore, that this case involves
the same question as that decided in Shwab v. Doyle,
ante, 529, and on the authority of that case the judgment
of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause
remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.
