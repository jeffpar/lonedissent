interposed in that court, and, if overruled, followed by invoking the revisory jurisdiction of this court, the final
judgment may be questioned collaterally, if in truth there
be a want of due process, either defensively, as in Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 723-733; see, also, York v.
Texas, 137 U. S. 15, 20-21; Western Indemnity Co. v.
Rupp, 235 U. S. 261, 273; Baker v. 'Baker, Eccles & Co.,
242 U. S. 394, 401-403; or by adopting the more aggressive method pursued in Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., supra;
see, also, Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, 254 U. S. 175,
183-185. In short, observance by the federal courts,
towards litigants in the state courts, of the comity prescribed by ยง 265, requires orderly procedure but involves
no impairment of the substance of constitutional right.
The case before us presents no exceptional feature, and
the courts below correctly disposed of it.

FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF GULFPORT, MISSISSIPPI, v. ADAMS, REVENUE AGENT OF THE
STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.
CERTIORARI TO THE

SUPRE'IE COURT OF THE STATE

OF

MISSISSIPPI.

No. 136. Argued March 2, 1922.-Decided April 10, 1922.
1. A state tax upon a national bank, based on its capital stock, surplus,
undivided profits and other property, is not equivalent to a tax
upon the shareholders in respect of their shares and is invalid under
Rev. Stats., ยง 5219. P. 364.
2. When the validity of an assessment by state officers is challenged
here, the court must determine the effect of the thing actually done;
what might have been done under the local statute is not controlling. P. 365.

FIRST NATL. BANK v. ADAMS.
362.

Opinion of the Court.

CERTIORARI to a judgment sustaining a tax on the

petitioner.
Mr. Win. H. Watkins for petitioner.
Mr. J. B. Harris,for respondent, submitted.
MR. JusTImE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
court.
Petitioner is a national bank located at Gulfport, Harrison County, Mississippi. The State Revenue Agent instructed the Tax Collector for that County as follows:
"The following described property, in said County, towit: Capital Stock, surplus, undivided profits, and any
and all other property properly assessable to banks,
amounting to $75,150, belonging to and wned by First
National Bank of Gulfport has escaped taxation during
each of the years 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906 and 1907,
by reason of not being assessed.
"You are by virtue of the Annotated Code of Mississippi of 1906, Chapter 131, See. 4740, now notified and
required to, within ten days hereafter, make the proper
assessment of said property by way of an additional assessment, on the roll or tax list in your hands, and to give
ten days' notice in writing to said First National Bank
whose property is so assessed, and also notify in writing
the Board of Supervisors of said County, of "Said assessment."
In obedience to this instruction, the Collector entered
upon the rolls of his office an assessment to the Bank in
these words-"Amount of all other personal property not
otherwise mentioned, $174,000.00."
Objection was duly offered upon the ground that the
corporation was assessed and not the stockholders as required by ยง 5219, Revised Statutes of the United States.
The Harrison Cqunty Circuit Court overruled this and
directed the Board of Supervisors:

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Opinion of the Court.

258 U. S

"To assess the First National Bank of Gulfport, Mississippi, with capital stock, surplus, undivided profits, and
any and all property assessable to said bank, in the sum
of $75,150.00, for the years 1903, 1906 and 1907, which
said property was at said time owned by said First National Bank and which had escaped taxation for each of
the years as hereinbefore set out; and said Board of Supervisors is hereby directed to make such assessment by
way of additional assessment on the roll and tax list of
Harrison County, Mississippi."
The Supreme Court of the State approved this judgment. See State Revenue Agent v. Bank, 108 Miss. 346;
Adams v. FirstNationalBank of Gulfport, 116 Miss. 450;
FirstNationalBank of Gulfport v. Adams, 123 Miss. 279.
Section 52191 Revised Statutes, .(copied below) prescribes the full measure of the power of the several States
to impose taxes upon national banking associations or
their stockholders. Any assessment not in conformity
therewith is unauthorized and invalid. Bank -of California v. Richardson, 248 U. S. 476, 483. "The tax assessed to shareholders may be required by law to be paid
in the first instance by the corporations themselves as the
1Nothing herein shall prevent all the shares in any association from
being included in the valuation of the personal property of the owner
or holder of such shares, in assessing taxes impbsed by aut hority of
the State within which the association is located; but the legislature
of each State may determine and direct the manner and place of
taxing all the shares of national banking assocations located within
the State, subject only to the two restrictions, that the taxation shall
not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital
in the hands of individual citizens of such State, and that the shares
of any national banking association owned by non-residents of any
State shall be taxed in the city or town where the bank is located,
,nd not elsewhere. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt the
real property of associations from either State, county, or municipal
taxes, to the same extent, according to"its value, as other real property is taxed.,

debt and in behalf. of the shareholder, leaving to the corporations the right to reimbursement for the tax paid from
their shareholders, either under some express statutory
authority for their recovery or under the general principle
of law that one who pays the debt of another at his request can recover the amount from him." Home Savings
Bank v. Des Moines, 205 U. S. 503, 518. But as pointed
out in Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S.
664, 676, 677, a tax levied upon a corporation measured
by the value of its shares is not equivalent to one upon
the shareholders in respect of their shares.
Where the validity of an assessment by officers of the
State is properly challenged, and the matter comes here,
this court must determine the effect of the thing actually
done. What might have been done under the local statute
is not controlling. We think it clear that the assessment
in the present case was against ihe corporation and beyond the power of the State definitely'delimited by ยง 5219.
The judgment of the court below must be reversed and
the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
