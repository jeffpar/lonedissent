delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit like the two just decided, ante, 34, to recover .taxes paid under the Act of 1909 there mentioned
and St. 1918, c. 253: In this case as in the other the statutes provided a remedy that excluded an action against
the Treasurer at common law. St. 1909, c. 490, Pt. III,
§ 70. St. 1918, c. 253, § 4. St. 1918, c. 255, § 7. The
District Court gave judgment for the defendant on the
merits. Without going into them it follows that the
judgment must be affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.

JONES v. UNITED) STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH

CIRCUIT.
No. 103.

Argued January 20, 1922.--Decided February 27, 1922.

1. One who, in pursuance of a scheme to acquire the land for himself, procures others to make homestead applications and entries,
knowing that they have no intention to establish residence or
otherwise comply with the law and that their proofs to the contrary, made with his connivance, and upon the faith of which the
patents are issued, are false, is guilty of defrauding the United
States of the value of the land. P. 47.
2. The right of the United States to recover damages for such a
fraud is not defeated by the facts that the period of residence
stated in the entry proofs was insufficient to comply with the
statute and that, but for a mistake of law in that regard upon
the part of the Land Department, the patents would not have
issued. P. 46.
3. In an action for fraud by inducing fraudulent entries resulting in
patents, evidence that the defendant induced other entrymen to
file on other land and of his conduct touching contracts on similar
claims, is admissible as bearing on his knowledge and intent, if

the judge in his discretion does n6t regard it as too remote or as
raising too lengthy and complex collateral issues, even if afterwards explained by the defendant. P. 48.
4. Evidence of current rates for similar lands situate in adjacent
townships, given by experts who learned the rates by experience
and report, held admissible to prove value of the lands in question.
P. 48.
5. In an action for defrauding the Government of public land by
procuring false proofs upon which patents were issued, held that
an instruction directing the jury, if they found for the plaintiff, to
measure the damages at the market value 'with legal interest at 6
per cent. from the date of the Enal certificate to that of the trial,
was not a ground for reversing the judgment rendered for the
United States. P. 49.

'UnitedStates v. Biggs, 211 U. S. 507.
Fraud is never presumed, and when alleged must be
clearly made out. Where cancellation of a patent is
sought on the ground of fraud, the-proof of the fraud must
be clear and convincing.
It is conceded that the statute specially required that
the entrymen should have actually resided on the land
three years. Therefore, proof that the entryman in any
of the cases had resided on the land but one year, or one
and one-half years, was immaterial, because, if true, it
would not furnish to the officers any excuse for issuing a
final receipt or patent; and it therefore became immaterial
whether the representations made by the entrymen as to
the time and character of their residence, and as to their
intent to make the land their home, were true or false.

300. This question has not been directly passed on by
this court; the nearest approach is the case of Kerr v.
South Park Commissioners, 117 U. S. 379.
In order to support the allegations in the complaint,
the action of the entrymen must have been intentionally
wrong and fraudulent. If they were acting under an
honest mistake of the law, they were not endeavoring to
deceive the Government.
A period of about eighteen years had expired from the
time of the issuance of the final certificates until the trial
of the case. The Government had allowed the six years
to go by without bringing a suit to cancel the patents,
although it was fully advised, as shown by the record,
very shortly after the patents were issued, when it canceled the entries of other settlers to land entered and
proved up at or about the same time. To permit it to
collect interest as a matter of right would be inequitable
and unjust. In any event, this question of interest
should have been submitted to the jury, and it was error
for the court to direct them to return interest upon any
sum that they might determine was the value of the land
taken. Eddy v. Lafayette, 163 U. S. 456, 467; White v.

There was ample evidence to support the finding of the
jury that defendant was guilty of the fraud charged
against him.
Defendant's action as to other matters of like nature
was relevant in establishing his motive or intent in this
case. Moreover, a reasonable discretion is allowed the
trial court in letting in such evidence. Wood v. United
States, 16 Pet. 342, 347, 349, 360; New York Mutual Life
Insurance Co. v. Armstrong, 117 U. S. 591, 598, 599;
Moore v. United States, 150 U. S. 57, 60, 61; Exchange
Bank v. Moss, 149 Fed. 340, 341.
In establishing the value of land, evidence may be
received of the value of nearby similar land, or of sales
of such land not too remote in point of time, and evidence regarding sales is not incompetent because based
upon hearsay, or knowledge obtained by one in the course
of business, or through such sources as are commonly
relied upon in such transactions. Cliquot's Champagne,
3 Wall. 114, 141; Montana By. Co. v. Warren, 137 U. S.

107, 108; Bates v. Dresser,251 U. S. 524, 531. That the
question of its allowance is for the discretion of the jury,
is undoubtedly supported by the decisions of this court
cited; but it is not clear that the court did not by its
charge intend to indicate to the jury that interest was to
be allowed in its discretion. Wilson v. Troy, 135 N. Y.

Opinion of the Court.

Moreover, interest is allowable as a matter of right in
a case of conversion, and we can perceive no valid reason
why it should not be allowed when one's real property
is wrongfully taken.
M .JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit brought by the United States to recover
the value of lands that it alleges it was induced to part
with through the defendant's fraud. The lands concerned
had been in the Siletz Indian Reservation in Oregon and
had been thrown open to homestead entry by the Act of
August 15, 1894, c. 290, § 15, 28 Stat. 286, 326. In addition to the usual fees a payment of $1.50 per acre was required, and three years' actual residence on the land
was to be established by such evidence as was required
in homestead proofs. The complaint alleges that the defendant, with intent to acquire title to the lands mentioned for himself and associates, procured certain old'
soldiers, named, to make homestead applications and entries upon land pointed out by him, each previously signing an agreement with him by which for his information
and services in drawing papers and affidavits the entryman was to pay him $185; the entryman was to employ
him to build a home upon the land, paying him for that
$100, and to clear or cultivate the land so far as required
by the laws in order to perfect title, paying him for that
$175. The entryman agreed to comply with the laws as
to residence and the defendant agreed to do all the work
required. The defendant agreed to advance, if required,
not exceeding $60 for the fees of the land office, and,
after final proof, at the option of the entryman, to procure a loan not to exceed $720., to be secured by a first
mortgage on the claim, -all payments stipulated from the
entryman then to become due and to be payable out of
the loan, or if there was no loan to be paid upon final

proof, which was to be made as soon as the laws had been
complied with.
It is alleged that the agreement was intended by the
defendant to conceal his intent to acquire title to the
land; that the entryman did not intend to establish a
residence upon the lands so entered and that the defend.ant knew that they did not intend to and intended that
they should not. The complaint goes on to allege fraudulent proofs made by the defendant's procurement, the
issue of final certificates and subsequently of patents, in
ignorance. of the fraudulent character of the entries, the
defendant in each case having received a mortgage as
agreed. The answer-admits the contract, denies all fraud
and sets up that the final proof of the entrymen disclosed
that they had not resided for three years upon the land as
required by the Act of- August 15, 1894, it then being
supposed by everyone that soldiers were allowed to count
their time of service, as by Rev. Stats., §§ 2304, 2305.
The facts are admitted, and it is pleaded and argued that
the issue of patents by officers of the United States with
knowledge of these facts was due to a mistake of law for
which the -defendant could not be held responsible. The
defendant pleaded some other matters to which it is not
necessary to refer, including the fact that the causes of
action did not accrue vithin six years-a defence that is
not pressed here. See United States v. Jones, 218 Fed.
973; 242 Fed. 609, 616.
After the skirmishes reported in the two volumes of
the Federal Reporter the case came on for trial and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for 18,204.84. The
judgment of the District Court was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 265 Fed. 235. The first question'
argued there, as here, was whether the knowledge attributable to the United States that the entrymen had not
been upon the land three years is a bar to a recovery. We
agree with the Circuit Cotrt of Appeals that' it is not

JONES v. UNITED STATES.

Opinionpf the Court.

necessarily a bar. If the defendant is responsible for
fraudulent representations of intent to establish a resi-,
dence and to fulfill in good faith the other requirements
for a homestead, and those representations induced the
issue of the patents, knowledge of another fact that also
would have prevented the issue but for a mistake of law
does not take the right to recover away. We can see no
reason why failure through ignorance of law to insist upon
an independent ground for refusal should deprive a party
to a bargain of its rights upon other grounds, or of its
right to require good faith in regard to them. An express waiver would have no such effect.
The defendant presents the case as if the only fraudulent representations. charged were that the entrymen had
been upon the land for a year or year and a half whereas
in fact they were there much less, and then presses the
argument that the falsity of such statements was immaterial because the statement as made disclosed the entrymen's want of right. But as we have implied, the charge
of the Government goes much farther, and if the evidence
as a whole tended to show the fraud that *as charged,
perjury as to the duration of residence would be a fact to
be considered, especially if the time of residence fixed in
the affidavits satisfied what everyone then thought were
the requirements of the law..
We may assume for the purposes of decision that the
agreement and mortgage were not unlawful on their face
and that the defendant took pains to make them known
to the authorities; but obviously they might be made an
instrument for the scheme alleged. They were prepared
in contemplation of a plan to collect old soldiers for the
purpose of making entries, the defendant paying an
agent five dollars a piece for every contract brought in.
The defendant admitted that he looked to the land not
to the soldiers as his security and that he supposed the
soldiers would sbll the land to pay their debt to him. The

land was timber land. There was evidence that the
soldiers were not intending to make their residence
upon it; that the agent employed to get their contracts knew that they were not intending to; that
the defendant treated the intent as matter of indifference, and in his conversations with the agent
indicated an expectation to get the land for himself
or his nominees without the need of a preliminary
contract to sell to him. He did get four of the
nine parcels. Without going into details it is evident
from the way in which the whole business was transacted
that all hands proceeded on the notion that if the entrymen put in a periodical appearance on the land they
would get it, and that no one troubled himself about adtual intent provided the affidavits were in due form. It
is impossible to say that the evidence did not warrant
finding the defendant guilty of fraud.
Some questions are raised as to the admissibility of evidence. The first colicerns the introduction by the Gov-ernment of similar arrangements with soldiers' widows to
file claims on land in the Siletz Indian Reservation without settlement. If the Court in its discretion did not regard the evidence as too remote or as raising too lengthy
or complex collateral issues, it properly might admit the
facts as bearihg on knowledge and intent, even if afterwards the defeihdant gave an explanation that the jury
might deem satisfactory. So as to similar transactions
with other soldiers. So as to the defendant's conduct
with regard to contracts upon similar claims, although
the evidence upon this point can have had but little
weight on either side. The other -question is upon the
admission of certain testimony as to value. The land as
we have said was timber land. There seems to have been
no sales in the t ownship where it lay, and timber experts
knowing by experience and report current rates- in adjoining townships were allowed to state them. Without

JONES v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

going into the specific questions asked it is enough to say
that we have examined them and find them all to have
been well within the discretion of the Court. See Virginia
v. West Virginia, 238 U. S. 202, 212. As the value found
by the jury was very near to that set by the defendant, if
not the same, we hardly see why the objection should
have been pressed.
The only occasion for difficulty or doubt is an instruction by the Court to the jury that if they found for the
plaintiff the measure of damages was the market value
"with legal interest at six per cent." from the date of the
final certificates to that of the trial. The Circuit Court
of Appeals disposed of this by saying that the attention
of the Court was not called to the question of interest.
The bill of exceptions states that the defendant excepted
to that part of the instruction, while on the other haiid
the transcript of the proceedings in Court so far as intelligible would indicate that the Circuit Court of Appeals
was right. The usual rule in tort cases has been to leave
the question of interest to the jury. Lincoln v. Claflin, 7
Wall. 132, 139. Eddy v. Lafayette, 163 U. S. 456, 467.
But when the wrong consists of depriving the owner of
property having a definite or ascertainable value there
would seem to be the same reason for allowing interest
as if there had been a misappropriation of money. The
discretion of the jury does not mean the right to gratify
a whim or a personal fancy. An indication of opinion on
the part of the judge certainly would have been allowable, Graham v. United States, 231 U. S. 474, 480, and
the tendency of late cases in this country is to sustain the
ruling. Shaw v. Gilbert, 111 Wise. 165, 196. Fellv. Union

LEMKE, AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE
OF NORTH DAKOTA, ET AL. v. FARMERS GRAIN
COMPANY OF EMBDEN, NORTH DAKOTA.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 456. Argued November 14, 1921.-Decided February 27, 1922.
1. In a suit in the District Court which arises under a law of the
United States as well as under the Constitution, in that the bill
attacks a state statute both as violative of the Constitution directly
and as in conflict with an act of Congress, the judgment may be
reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. P. 52.
2. In the general and usual course of its trade, a North Dakota association bought grain in that State, placed it in its elevator, loaded
it promptly on cars and shipped to other States for sale. The grain,
even after loading, was subject to be diverted and sold locally if
the price was offered, but local sales were unusual, the company's
entire market, practically, being outside North Dakota. Held:
(a) That the business, including the buying of the grain in North
Dakota, was interstate commerce. P. 54. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U. S. 282. (b) As applied to this business, a North Dakota statute, c. 138, Laws 1919, requiring purchasers of grain to obtain a license and pay a license fee, and to act
under a defined system of grading, inspection and weighing, and
subjecting the prices paid and profits made to regulation, was a
direct burden on interstate commerce. P. 55.
3. Even when the particular subject remains unregulated by Congress, a State cannot lay burdens on interstate commerce in the
guise of police regulations to protect the welfare of her people.
