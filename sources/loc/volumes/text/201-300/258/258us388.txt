GALVESTON ELECTRIC COMPANY v. CITY OF
GALVESTON ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.

No. 455. Argued December 15, 16, 1921.-Decided April 10, 1922.
1. The fact that a public utility, such as a street railway, may reach
financial success only in time, or not at all, is a reason for allowing
a liberal return on the money invested in the enterprise; but it
does not make past losses an element to be considered in deciding
what the base value is and whether a rate fixed is confiscatory.
P. 395.
2. A so-called "going concern value and development cost" based
on calculations, for various periods, of past deficiencies of net
income, allowing 4 per cent. for annual depreciation and 8 per cent.
compound interest on the value of the property used as a fair
return, should not be included in the base value of appellant's
street railway in determining whether an existing rate is confiscatory. P. 895.
3. Neither should an allowance for hypothetical brokerage fees based
on a percentage customarily obtained by bankers for financing such
enterprises. P. 397.
4. In determining the sufficiency of such rates, the amount normally
required for maintenance, not necessarily the amount expended,
annually, should be allowed; and many items included in overhead
cost of original construction may be excluded in calculating depreciation annuity. P. 398.
5. Appellant's request that prospective cost of maintenance deferred
during the war at the wish of the Government be allowed from
earnings of future years, in testing the rate, was an attempt to
capitalize past losses and rightly refused. P. 399.
6. In calculating whether a rate fixed will yield an adequate return,
income taxes which would be payable if a fair return were edrned
are appropriate deductions from gross revenue. P. 399.
7. But, where the federal corporate income tax, (Act of February
24, 1919, c. 18, §§ 230-238, 40 Stat. 1057, 1075-1080,) is thus
deducted,, the exemption of the stockholder from the "normal"
tax on dividends received from the corporation must be taken into
consideration in determining what rate of return to the corporation
shall be deemed fair. P. 399.

Opinion of the Court.

8. An ordinance rate inadequate .when adopted will be valid when,
through change of conditions, it yields a fair return. P. 400.
9. The court knows judicially that prices, in general, and current
rates of return on capital have declined since the conclusion of
the war, but not the extent to which the economic .changes occurring have affected- the gross revenues or the net return of the
appellant company. P. 402.
10. A decree of the District Court dismissing without prejudice the
bill of a street railway company to restrain enforcement of an
ordinance rate as confiscatory, affirmed, where an operation test
of more than a year and a half was inconclusive because of abnormal economic conditions then existing, and where the lower court's
view of the probable future adequacy of the rate was necessarily
based largely on prophecy,.and was free from substantial error as
to the elements to be considered, and where the actual facts were
substantially undisputed and the evidence did not compel a contrary conviction. P. 401.

APPEAL from a decree of the District Court, dismissing,

without prejudice, a bill brought by ,the appellant to
restrain the appellees from enforcing a rate fixed for its
street railway.
Mr. William E. Tucker for appellant.
Mr. Frank S. Anderson and Mr. James W" Wayman

for appellees.
MR. JUsTIcE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

court.
The street railway system of Galveston was started as a
horse-car line in 1881. It was electrified about 1890; and
after the hurricane of 1900 was largely' rebuilt. Upon
sale on foreclosure the railway passed in 1901 to a new
company; and in 1905 it was purchased by the Galveston
Electric Company which supplies to the inhabitants of
that city also electric light and power. At no ,time has
the full fare on the railway been more than five cents--:

except during the period of eight months, from October
1, 1918, to June 5,1919, when six cents was charged. This
higher fare was authorized by ordinance of the municipal
Board of Commissioners which possesses regulatory powers; and on June 5, 1919, the same Board reduced the
maximum fare to five cents. The latter ordinance was
passed after a hearing and a finding by the Board that
with the reduced rate the company would continue to
earn a fair return. Under the 1919 ordinance the company operated for eleven months. Then it brought this
suit, in the federal court for southern Texas, to enjoin its
enforcement. The company contends that the fare prescribed is confiscatory in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment; the city that it is sufficient to yield a return
of 8 per cent. on the value of the property used in the
public service.
A temporary injunction having been denied, the court
appointed a master to take the evidence and make advisory findings. There was substantially no dispute concerning the facts past or present. It was assumed, in view
of then prevailing money rates, that 8 per cent. was a
fair return upon money invested in the business. The
experts agreed on what they called the estimated undepreciated cost of reproduction on the historical basis; that
is, what the property ought to have cost on the basis of
prices prevailing at the time the system and its various
units were constructed. They agreed also on the amount
of gross revenue, and on the expenditures made in operation and for taxes, except as hereinafter stated. The
differences between the parties resulted mainly, either
from differences in prophecy as to the future trend of
prices or from differences in legal opinion as to the elements to be considered in determining whether a fair return would be earned. These differences affected both the
base value and the amount to be deemed net revenues.
The master, who heard the case in October, 1920, and

GALVESTON ELEC. CO. v. GALVESTON. "391

filed his report in November, made findings on which he
advised that the fare was confiscatory. The District
Judge, who heard the case in January, 1921, found a
much smaller base value and much larger net revenues;
stated that he did not deem it necessary to determine
whether the ordinance will "produce exactly 8 per cent., or
a little more or a little short of it"; declared that he was
"not satisfied .that the ordinance produces a return so
plainly inadequate as to justify this court in interfering
with the action of the municipality in the exercise of its
rate-making function "; and in March, 1921, entered a
decree dismissing the bill without prejudice. In April
he denied a petition for rehearing. 272 Fed. 147. The
case comes here on appeal under § 238 of the Judicial
Code.
The undepreciated reproduction cost on the historical
basis '-which seenp to be substantially equivalent to
what is often termed the prudent investment '--was
agreed to be $1,715,825. The parties failed to agree in
their estimates of the depreciation accrued up to 1921. The
master estimated that, based on the 1913 price level, it
was $390,000; and this estimate the court accepted. Thus
measured, the value of the property, less depreciation,
was $1,325,825. The court found that the net earnings

That is "the estimated undepreciated cost of reproduction of
railway property of the company on the historical basis, exclusive of
franchise value, going concerh value, bond discount and brokerage
fee," but with land and right of way which cost about $15,000 estimated at their present value of $58,836. It was also agreed, for. the
purpose of dividing joint items, that one-fifth of the property of the
company was devoted to its light and power business.

had been $90,159., and for the year ending December 31,
1920, $109,286; and estimated that for the year ending
June 30, 1921, they would be at least $111,285. The return so found for the year ending June 30, 1920, is 6.8 per
cent. of $1,325,825; for the calendar year 1920, 8.2 per
cent.; and for the year ending June 30, 1921, 8.4 per cent.
The master made calculations only for the year ending
June 30, 1920, and, mainly 1 because he allowed an
amount for maintenance and depreciation equal to nearly
18 per cent. of the prudent investment for the depreciable
property (less accrued depreciation), found the net earnings to be only $50,249.60. This sum is 3.8 per cent. on
the prudent investment value, less depreciation. But
neither the District Judge nor the master reached his conclusion as to net return by a calculation as simple as that
indicated above.
First. A9 the base value of the property, master and
court took-instead of the prudent investment valuethe estimated cost of reproduction at a later time less
depreciation; and in estimating reproduction cost both
refused to use as a basis the prices actually prevailing at
the time of the hearings. These had risen to 110 per cent.
above those of 1913. The basis for calculating reproduction cost adopted by all was prophecy as to the future
general 'price level of commodities, labor and money.
This predicted level, which they assumed would be stable
for an indefinite period, they called the new plateau of
prices. As to the height of this prophesied plateau there
was naturally wide divergence of opinion. The company's
expert prophesied that the level would be 60 to 70 per
cent. above 1913 prites; the master that an increase of
33 1/3 per cent. would prove fair; and the court accepted
H
=e allowed also on account of federal income taxes a sum of

$8,008 which the court disallowed.

Opinion of the Court.

the master's prophecy of 33 1/3 per cent.' Thus both
master and court assumed a reproduction cost, after deducting accrued depreciation, of about $1,625,000. On
this sum the net earnings found by the court yieldedafter deducting a 4 per cent. depreciation annuity on
property subject to depreciation, a maintenance charge.
and a charge for taxes, other than the federal income
tax-a net return of 51/. per cent. for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1920; of 6.7 per cent. for the calendar year
1920; and the promise of more for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1921. But to fix base value the master added,
and the court disallowed, items aggregating nearly
$600,000, which must now be considered.
The most important of these items is $520,000 for "development cost." The item is called by the master also
going concern value or values of plant in successful operation." He could not have meant by this to cover the
cost of establishing the system as a physically going concern, for the cost of converting the inert railway plant
into an operating system is covered in the agreed historical value by items aggregating $202,000. These included.
besides engineering, supervision, interest, taxes, law expenses, injuries and damages during construction, the sum
of $73,281 for the expenses of organization and business
management. The.going concern value for which the mas'From the agreed valuation of S1,715,825, the court deducted
$425,117 for property not subject to this appreciation-land, already
given its market value, and capital acquired recently (all acquisitions
before January 1, 1915, being assumed to have been at the 1913
price level, all since that date at the new level). The balance was
appreciated 1/3; the $425,117 was added again; and accrued depreciation, likewise appreciated 1/3, was subtracted. The court
thus obtained a base value of $1,626,061. The master's figure was
slightly smaller (but for his inclusion of development cost and brokerage) for he excepted more property from this 33 1/3 per cent. appreciation.

ter makes allowance is the cost of developing the operating railway system into a financially successful concern.
The only evidence offered, or relied upon, to support his
finding is a capitalization of-the net balance of alleged
past deficits in accordance with what was said to be the
Wisconsin Rule." The experts calculated this sum in various ways. One estimate placed the development cost at
$2,000,000; a more moderate estimate by the company's
expert was $575,300; and the city's expert made a calculation by which he estimated this so-called cost at $212,452.
If the rule were that a prescribed rate is to be held confiscatory in case net earnings are not sufficient to yield 8
per cent. on the amount prudently invested in the business, there might be propriety in counting as part of the
investment such amount, if any, as was necessarily expended at the start in overcoming initial difficulties incident to operation and in securing patronage. But no evidence of any such expenditure was introduced; and the
claim of the company does not proceed upon that basis.
What was presented by the witnesses are studies, on various theories, of what past deficiencies in net income would
aggregate, if 4 per cent. were allowed as a depreciation
annuity and 8 per cent. compound interest were charged
annually on the value of the property used. These calculations covered, on one basis, the period of 39 years
since the original horse-car line was built; on another, the
period of 15 years since the appellant purchased the property as a going concern. If net deficits so estimated were
made a factor in the rate base, recognition of 8 per cent.
as a fair return on the continuing investment would imply substantially a guarantee by the community that the

Opinion of the Court.

investor will net on his investment ultimately a return of
8 per cent. yearly, with interest compounded on deferred
payments; provided only that the traffic will in course of
time bear a rate high enough to produce that amount.'
The fact that a utility may reach financial success only
in time or not at all, is a reason for allowing a, liberal return on the money invested in the enterprisc; but it does
not make past losses an element to be considered in de-:
ciding what the base value is and whether the rate is confiscatory. A company which has failed to secure from
year to year sufficient earnings to keep the investment
unimpaired and to pay a fair return, whether its failure
was the result of imprudence in engaging in the enterprise, or of errors in management, or of omission to exact
proper prices for its output, cannot erect out of past
deficits a legal basis for holding confiscatory for the future,
rates which would, on the basis of present reproduction
value, otherwise be compensatory. Knoxville v. Knoxvile Water Co., 212 U. S. 1, 14.
Nor is there evidence in the record to justify the master's finding that a business brought to successful operation "should have a going concern value at least equal
to one-third of its physical properties." Past losses obviously do not tend to prove present values. The fact that
a sometime losing business becomes profitable eventually
through growth of the community or more efficient management, tends to prove merely that the adventure was
'On the other hand, if what is to be considered in determining the
net deficit is not the result of operations from the beginning of the
enterprise, but the result of operations since the present owner acquired it-in other words, the return on its "investment-we are left
without the data necessary to determine the fact. For the record
does not disclose what the~present company paid when it purchased
the property .in 1905 as a going:concern. For aught that appears,
appellant has received full 8 per cent. annually on that amount and

later additions to capital.

not wholly misconceived. It is doubtless true, as the
master indicated, that a prospective purchaser of the Galveston system would be willing to pay more for it with a
record of annual losses overcome, than he would if the
losses had continued. But would not the property be, at
least, as.valuable if the past had presented a record of
continuous successes? And shall the base value be
deemed less in law if there was no development cost, because success was instant and continuous? Or, if the success had been -so great that, besides paying an annual
return at the rate of 8 per cent., a large surplus had been
accumulated, could the city insist that the base value be
reduced by the amount of the surplus? Compare Newton
v. Consolidated Gas Co., ante, 165.
In determining the value of a business as between buyer
and seller, the goodwill and earning power due to effective
organization are often more important elements than
tangible property. Where the public acquires the business, compensation must be made for these, at least under some circumstances. Omaha v. Omaha Water Co.,
218 U. S. 180, 202, 203; National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City, 62 Fed. 853, 865. And they, like past losses,
should be considered in determining whether a rate
charged by a public utility is reasonable. Compare Venner Co. v. Urbana Waterw'orks, 174 Fed. 348, 352. But
in determining whether a rate is confiscatory, goodwill
and franchise value were excluded from the base value
in CedarRapids Gas Light Co. v. CedarRapids, 223 U. S.
655, 669, and Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238
U. S. 153, 169; and the expressions in Denver v. Denver
Union Water Co., 246 U. S. 178, 184, 191, and in Lincoln
Gas & Electric Light Co. v. Lincoln, 250 U. S. 256, 267,
are not to be taken as modifying in any respect the rule

cost, in the sense in which the master used these terms,

GALVESTON ELEC. CO. v. GALVESTON.

Opinion of the Court.

are not to be included in the base value for the purpose of
determining whether a rate is confiscatory.
The other item included by the master in determining
base value, but disallowed by the court, is $67,078 for
brokerage fees. There is no evidence that any sum was
in fact paid as brokerage, and there was included, as above
shown, the sum of $73,281 for organization and business
management in calculating the historical reproduction
cost. The finding of the master rests upon testimony that
bankers customarily get, in some form, compensation
equal to 4 per cent. on the money procured by them for
such enterprises.' But compensation for bankers' services
is often paid in the lessened price at which they take the
company's securities, and is thus represented in the higher
rate of interest or dividerd paid on the money actually
received by the company as capital. The reason given
by the master for including the allowance for an assumed
brokerage fee, is that a brokerage fee is "a normal incident of large industrial investments, and has not been
amortized," since "the record shows that . . . the
plant has been operated at a loss." If base value were to
be fixed by the money expended, brokerage fees actually
paid might with propriety be included, as are taxes paid
pending construction. But as the base value consideredis the present value, that value must be measured by
money; and the customary cost of obtaining the money is
immaterial. We cannot say that the court erred in refusing to include in base value an allowance for hypothetical brokers' fees.
The appellant insisted also that the base value should
be raised by assuming that the future plateau of prices
would be 60 to 70 per cent. -above the historical reproduce'The record cost o'f the property was originally- used as the base for
this calculation. But, the figure $67,078 was tacitly agreed by both
parties to be the amount, if any, that should-be allowed for brokerage.

tion value instead of 33 1/3 per cent. as the master and
the court assumed. The appellees insisted, on the other
hand, that an item of $142,281 for grade raising included
by master and court in the.historical cost should be eliminated. We camot say that there was error in overruling
these contentions.
Second. Concerning deductions to be made from gross
revenue in order to determine net earnings, the court differed from the master in regard both to the yearly charge
for maintenance and to the depreciation annuity. It appeared that in the fifteen years since appellant acquired
the system in 1905, the average annual expenditure for
maintenance had been $42,771; that during the war the
property had been admittedly undermaintained; that the
expenditure was $64,108 in the calendar year 1919;
$80,322 in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1920, and $90,-,
861.28 in the calendar year 1920. The court estimated
the proper charge for current maintenance at $70,000, and
allowed, in addition, a depreciation annuity of $45,245
(that is, 4 per cent. on property subject to depreciation)
to provide a fund out of which annual replacements and
renewals could be made. Thus the court allowed for the
year's deprecidtion and maintenance $115,245, which is
nearly 14 per cent. of the historical reproduction value,
and about 10 per cent. of the assumed reproduction cost,
of the depreciable part of the system. The master allowed $147,146.40 for maintenance and depreciation during the year ending June 30, 1920. This larger figure was
arrived at, partly by charging as cost of maintenance the
full $80,322 expended during that year, and partly by including as depreciable property expenditures for overhead
items which the court excluded. The proper annual
charge for maintenance is the amount normally required
for that purpose during the period; it is not necessa rily
the amount actually expended within the year. Many
items included in the overhead cost of original construc-

GALVESTON ELEC. CO. v. GALVESTON.

399

Opinion of the Court.

tion may properly be excluded in calculating the.amount
of the depreciation annuity. We cannot say that the court
erred in limiting the year's maintenance and depreciation
allowances to an aggregate of $115,245.
The company asked to have allowed as a further charge
$29,500 a year on account of what it called deferred maintenance. The contention is that, during the war and two
years following, the company had deferred maintenance,
pursuant to a policy established at the express request of
the Government to the end that material and labor might
be released for war purposes; that to make good this deferred maintenance would cost $197,000; and that in order
to amortize this amount an annual allowance from earnings of $29,500 should be made for five years. This is an
attempt, in another form, to capitalize alleged past losses;
and the request was properly refused both by the master
and the court.
Third. The remaining item as to which the master and
the court differed relates to the income tax., The company assigns as error. that the master allowed, but the
court disallowed, as a part of the operating expenses for
the year ending June 30, 1920, the sum of $16,254 paid by
the company during that year for federal income taxes.
The tax referred to is presumably that imposed by the
Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, §§ 230-238, 40 Stat. 1057,
1075-1080, which for any year after 1918 is 10 per cent.
of the net income. In calculating whether the five-cent
fare will yield a properreturn, it is necessary to deduct
from gross revenue the expenses and charges; and all
taxes which would be payable if a fair return were earned
are appropriate deductions. There is no difference in this
respect between state and federal taxes or between income taxes and others. But the fact that it is the federal
corporate income tax for which deduction is made, must
be taken' into consideration in determining what rate of
return shall be deemed fair. For under § 216 the stock-

holder does not include in the income on which the normal federal tax is payable 'dividends received from the
corporation. This tax exemption is therefore, in effect,
part of the return on the investment.'
It isthus clear that both in the year ending June 30,
1920, and in the calendar year 1920, the net earnings of
the system were less than 8 per cent. of its value, whether
the value be estimated on the basis of prudent investment
or on the basis of the reproduction cost actually adopted.
When the court rendered its decision the-ordinance had
been tested for more than a year and a half-a period
ample in ordinary times to test the current effect of the
rate prescribed and to indicate its probable effect in the
near future. The times here involved were, however, in
a high degree abnormal. It did not follow that, because
the system had earned less tharn 8 per cent. in 1919 and
in 1920, it would earn less than 8 per cent. in 1921. A
rate ordinance invalid when adopted' may later become
valid, just as an ordinance valid when made may become
invalid by change in conditions. Municipal Gas Co. v.
'It is difficult to see how, on the facts presented, so large a sum as
S16,254 could have been paid on account of the year's operation.
Indeed the court, in disallowing the item of federal income tax, deducted not $16,254, but S8,008. -Even this seems too large, for 'the
net, earnings, without deduction of the $16,254 attributed to income
tax, for the year ending June 30, 1920; as found by the master, were
S66,503.60. From this, interest paid or accrued on indebtedness is
to be deducted before computing the net income on which the tax
is payable. A large part of the capital of utility companies is ordinarily represented by interesi-bearing bonds and notes; and there is
evidence that such ihdebtedness of the appellant was "in the neighbdrhood of $1,400,000." The interest on this debt chargeable to the
railway system would be at least $50,000. There is further an exemption from tax of $2,000 of the net income. So a 10 per cent. tax
on the balance would amount to less than $1,500.
.In the record and briefs elsewhere the income tax is reckoned at
between $8,0.00 and $10,000, which is a proper figure if there be an
8 per cent. return on $1,626,061.

Opinion of the Court.

Public Service Commiss&wn, 225 N. Y. 89, 96. Compare
Willcox v. ConsolidatedGas Co., 212 U. S. 19; Newton v.
Consolidated Gas Co., ante, 165.
The District Judge was obliged to form an opinion as
to the probable net earnings in the future. All relevant
facts, except as stated, and all applicable arguments were
fully and clearly presented by the parties and were carefully considered by the court. Although the District
Judge treated the master's report as advisory merely,
he passed upon the numerous exceptions taken to the
master's findings in order to indicate his view on the precise points raised. He allowed some exceptions and disallowed others. Upon petition for rehearing further careful consideration was given to the case. Views expressed
in the first opinion on some matters were modified; but
these changes did not call for any change in the decree.
The District Judge had before him some evidence not before the master; for the company's expert was recalled and
testified both to the result of operations of later months in
which there was a large increase in travel and to the
heavy decline in prices which occurred after October.
Concerning actual facts there was substantially no controversy. On the elements to be considered in determining whpther the rate would be confiscatory no error was
made which could substantially affect the result. His determination whether the prescribed rate would be confiscatory was necessarily based largely on a prophecy, for
normal conditions had not been restored. He found that
gross revenues were steadily increasing; and that they
were larger under the five-cent fare than they had been
during the preceding year when the six-cent rate was in
effect. He was convinced that operating costs would decrease largely during the-year. His two opinions show
that every element upon Which his prophecy should be
based received careful consideration. We cannot say that
the evidence compelled a conyiction that the rate would

prove inadequate. . Compare San Diego, Lajzd & Town
Co. v. National City, 174 U. S. 739, 754. San Diego Land
& Town Co. v. Jasperi, 189 U. S.439; Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., 212 U. S. 1, 17.'The occasion for the suit was solely the extraordinary
rise in prices incident to the war. There was no suggestion that the action of the Board evidenced hostility to
the utility, or .that the Board was arbitrary or hasty. It
had .been theretofore considerate of the company's rights
and needs. When prices rose rapidly in 1918, it raised the
fare limit to six cents, although the franchise ordinance
prescribed the five-cent fare. And this was before our
decision in San Antonio v. San Antonio Public Service
Co., 255 U. S. 547. Its reduction of the fare by ordinance
of June 5, 1919, was made after hearing, and was doubtless due to the conviction, shared by many, that, with the
cessation of hostilities and the negotiation of the Peace
Treaty, prices and operating cost would fall abruptly.
This prophecy, if such there was, 1roved false. But
nearly three years have elapsed since the Board adopted
the ordinance; and more than a year since entry of the
decree below. We know judicially that the period has, in
general, been one of continuous price recession, and that
the-curreht rates of return on capital are much lower than
they then were.' But we cannot know to what extent the
important changes occurring have affected either gross
revenues or the net return. There is no reason to believe
that the Board would not give full and fair consideration
to a proposed change in rate if application were now made
to it. And the District Judge stated in his opinion (272
Fed. 147), that the decree to be entered would be vacated
or amended in case it should later appear that the regulating board declined such adjustment of rates as the ac.1

and the decree was thereupon entered without prejudice.
The District Judge refused a temporary injunction and
did not exact a bond. Hence the only relief we can grant
is such as operates in futuro.. Compare Duplex Printing
Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 464. An injunction
should not issue now, unless conditions are such that the
prescribed rate is confiscatory. As by the reservation in
the decree appellant may secure protection against the
ordinance if under 'existing conditions the five-cent rate
appears to be inadequate, the decree should be affirmed.
