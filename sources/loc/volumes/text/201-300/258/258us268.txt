UNITED ZINC & CHEMICAL COMPANY v. BRITT
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 164. Submitted March 13, 1922.--Decided March 27, 1922.
1. A landowner owes no general duty to keep his land safe for children
of tender years, or even free from hidden danger, if he has not
directly or by implication invited them there. P. 275.
2. A road is not an invitation to leave it elsewhere than at its end.
P. 276.
3. Defendant owned a tract, on the outskirts of a town, on which
was an open and abandoned cellar wherein water had accumulated,
clear in appearance but dangerously poisoned with chemicals resulting from manufacturing operations formerly conducted there
by the defendant. A traveled way passed within 120 feet of the
pool and paths crossed the tract. Children came upon the land,
entered the water, were poisoned and died. Defendant knew the

condition of the water; but the pool, if visible to the children without trespass, was not proven to have caused their entry, nor were
children in the habit of going to it. Held, that no license or invitation could be implied and that the defendant was not liable. P. 274.
264 Fed. 785, reversed.
CERTIORARI to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed a judgment against the above petitioner in an' action brought in the District Court for
Kansas, by the above respondents, to recover damages for
the death of their two children. See Kans. Gen. Stats.,

268.

Argument for Petitioner.

The maxim sic utere tuo is not a principle of use in
the solution of difficult legal questions but a moral precept, which "teaches nothing but a benevolent yearning." Holmes, J., in 8 Harv. Law Rev. 3; Terry, Lead.
Prin. Anglo-Amer. Law, §§ 10, 11; Bonomi v. Backhouse,
96 E. C. L. 641; Frostv. Eastern R. R. Co., 64 N. H. 220;
Ratte v. Dawson, 50 Minn. 450; Walker v. Railroad Co.,
105 Va. 226; Deane v. Clayton, 7 Taunt. 489; Knight v.
Abert, 6 Pa. St. 472.
At common law, in force in Kansas by statutory enactment, there is no obligation on the part of landowners
to maintain fences about their land, and no statute in
Kansas requires it. Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Rollins, 5
Kans. 177. Owners of unenclosed land are not required
to make them safe for trespassing cattle, Knight v. Abert,
6 Pa. St. 472; Hughes v. Railroad Co., 66 Mo. 325; or for
children, Felton v. Aubrey,-74 Fed. 356.:
The fact that there was a path through the land by
which the children entered for their conveilience in reaching their father's camp, did not authorize them to stray
from this pathway. And the defendant by merely suffering or permitting such voluntary use, did not insure that
its 1jremises were safe.
That children of tender years under no circumstances
are classed with idlers, licensees or trespassers is contrary
to the decisions of the Court of Appeals in thp Aubrey
Case, supra; and in Duree v. Wabash Ry. Co., 241 Fed.
454; McCarthy v. Railroad Co., 240 Fed. 602; Ellsworth

are all cases where there was a wilful intent to injure
trespassers and are obviously inapplicable. The difference between these cases and the Stout Case, 17 Wall. 652,
is so plain as.to need no discussion. Salladay v. Old Dominion Copper Co.; 12 Ariz. 124; Stendal v. Boyd, 73
Minn. 53.
The cases cited by Mr. Justice Hunt in rendering the
opinion of the court in the Stout Case, except Daley v.
Railroad Co., 26 Conn. 591, (since overruled,) come
within other well-defined exceptions to the general rule
as is clearly pointed out in Daniels v. Railroad Co., 154
Mass. 349, and in Walker v. Railroad Co., 105 Va. 226,
and therefore do not add anything to the authority of
the Stout Case.
The remarkable confusion which exists today among
the federal courts of the several circuits and among the
courts of the several States over the question of liability
of landowners to trespassing children, which has followed
the decision of the Stout Case, is probably due to the
fact that the Stout Case is an exception to the rules of
nonliability of a landowner for accidents from visible
causes to trespassers on his premises, at common law, and
the uncertainty as to what actually was decided in the
Stout Case, caused by the citation of such cases as Bird
v. Holbrook, supra,"and other spring gun cases. That

such is the fact can be seen from Union Pacific Ry. Co.
v. McDonald, supra,approving the Stout Case, and citing
Townsend v. Wathen, 9 East, 277, 299.
The landowner owes no duty to trespassers or volunteers going upon his land for their own purposes; to
maintain it in any particular condition for their benefit.
Sweeney v. Railroad Co., 10 Allen, 372; Kelly v. Benas,
217 Mo. 9.
The case does not fall within the turntable doctrine
because: (1) this was not a dangerous and attractive
machine; (2) children were not accustomed to play at or
near this basement; (3) the Zinc Company had no knowledge of any danger to children; (4) no license can be
implied to children to play at this spot.
The case does not fall within the attractive nuisance
doctrine because: (1) it does not a'ppear that this basement was attractive to children; (2) the evidence do6s
not establish the fact that the basement was visible from
off the premises; (3) no invitation- to enter can be
implied.
Nor does the case fall within the theory of the trap
or spring gun cases because: (1) the Zinc Company had
no knowledge of the existence of this basement so filled
with water; (2) the element of wilful intent is completely
lacking.
In the following cases the turntable doctrine was not
accepted: Daniels v. Railroad Co., 154 Mass. 349; Ryan

The following cases, taken from*jurisdictions which in

tendency in them is to limit the doctrine strictly to turntable cases and not to extend it so as to embrace the socalled' "attractive nuisance" doctrine: Peters v. Bowman, 115 Cal. 345; Wilmot v. McPadden, 79 Conn. 367;

Argument for Respondents.

The decisions of the Supreme Court of Kansas directly
in point are Roman v. Leavenworth, 95 Kans. 513; Price
v. Water Co. 58 Kans. 551; Biggs v. Wire Co., 60 Kans.
217; Electric Co. v. Healy, 65 Kans. 798; Harperv. Topeka, .92 Kans. 11; Kansas City v. Siese, 71 Kans. 283.
This pond was attractive. The plaintiff in error had
knowledge of its danger, and left no barriers, warnings or
danger signals of any kind. The boys had no knowledge
whatever of the hidden danger, and, being of tender years,
would have been unable to appreciate the danger had
they even known that the pond had once been used as a
part of an acid plant. This pool could readily be seenby the boys while they were on a well traveled road, running north and . outhwest of it.
The rule we are contending for is upheld in Heller v.
New York, N. H. & H. R. R. Co., 265 Fed. 192; and
American Ry. Express Co. v. Crabtree, 271 Fed. 287.
Even though the boys were trespassers, which they
were not, the plaintiff in error would be liable. They
were not trespassers because of their tender age and because the plaintiff in error maintained three well traveled
roads over its premises, which were as many invitations
to the public and these boys to enter, with assurance that
if they did they would encounter no danger. Paolino v.
McKendall, 24 R. I. 432; Hobbs v. Blanchard & Sons Co.,
74 N. H. 116; Scheuerman v. Scharfenberg, 163 Ala. 337;
Walsh v. FitchburgR. R. Co., 145 N. Y. 301.
The poisons were as much of a hidden danger and as
fatal a death trap as a-spring gun; and hence come under
the rule announced in Palmerv. Gordon, 173 Mass. 410.
The statute- of Kansas under which this action was
brought and prosecuted is Gen. Stats., 1915; §§ 7323, 7324.

M

.JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit brought by the respondents against the
petitioner to recover for the death of two children, sons
of the respondents. The facts that for the purposes of decision we shall assume to have been proved are these.
The petitioner owned a tract of about twenty acres in the
outskirts of the town of Iola, Kansas. Formerly it had
there a plant for the making of sulphuric acid and zinc
spelter. In 1910 it tore the building down but left a basement and cellar, in which in July, 1916, water was accumulated, clear in appearance but in fact dangerously
poisoned by sulphuric acid and zinc sulphate that had
come in one way or another from the petitioner's works,
as the petitioner knew. The respondents had been travelling and encamped at some distance from this place. A
travelled way passed within 120 or 100 feet of it. On
July 27, 1916, the children, who were eight and eleven
years old, came upon the petitioner's land, went into the
water, were poisoned and died. The petitioner saved the
question whether it could be held liable. At the trial the
Judge instructed the jury that if the water looked clear
but in fact was poisonous and thus the children were
allured to it the petitioner was liable. The respondents
got a verdict and judgment, which was affirmed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. 264 Fed. 785.
Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. McDonald, 152 U. S.262, and
kindred cases were relied upon as leading to the result,
and perhaps there is language in that and in Railroad
Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, that might seem to justify it;
but the doctrine needs very careful statement not to
make an unjust and impracticable requirement. If the
children had been adults they would have had no case.

UNITED ZINC CO. v. BRITT.
268.

Opinion of the Court.

They would have been trespassers and the owner of the
land would have owed no duty to remove even hidden
danger; it would have been entitled to assume that they
would obey the law and not trespass. The liability for
spring guns and mantraps arises from the fact that the
defendant has not rested on that assumption, but on the
contrary has expected the trespasser and prepared an

injury that is no more justified than if he had held te
gun and fired it. Chenery v. Fitchburg R. R. Co., 160
Mass. 211, 213. Infants have no greater right to go upon
other peoples' land than adults, and the mere fact that
they are infants imposes no duty upon landowners to expect them and to prepare for their safety. On the other
hand the duty of one who invites another upon his land
not to lead him into a trap is well settled, and while it is
very plain that temptation is not invitation, it may be
held that knowingly to establish and expose, unfenced, to
children of an age when they follow a bait as mechanically
as a fish, something that is certain to attract them, has
the legal effect of an invitation to them although not to an
adult. But the principle if accepted must be very cautiously applied.
-In Railroad Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, the well-known
case of a boy injured on a turntable, it appeared that children had played there before to the knowledge of employees of the railroad, and in view of that fact and the
situation of the turntable near a road without visible
separation, it seems to have been assumed without much
discussion that the railroad owed a duty to the boy. Perhaps this was as strong a case as would be likely to occur
of maintaining a known temptation, where temptation
takes the place of invitation. A license was implied and
liability for a danger not manifest to a child was declared
in the very similar case of Cooke v. Midland Great Western Ry. of Ireland [1909], A. C. 229.
In the case at bar it is at least doubtfulwhether the water
could be seen from any.place -where the children lawfully

were and there is no evidence thai it was what led them to
enter the land. But that is necessary to start the supposed duty. There can be nogeneral duty on the part of
a landowner to keep his land safe for children, or even free
from hidden dangers, if he has not directly or by implication invited or licensed them to come there. The difficulties in the way of implying a license are adverted to in
Chenery v. Fitchbury R. R. Co., 160 Mass. 211, 212, but
need not be considered here. It does not appear that
children were in the habit of going to the place; so that

foundation also fails.
Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. McDonald, 152 U. S. 262, is
less in point. There a-boy was burned by falling into
burning coal slack close by the side of a path on which he
was running homeward from other boys who had frightened him. It hardly appears that he was a trespasser and
the path suggests an invitation; at all events boys habitually resorted to the place where he was. Also the defendant was under a statutory duty to fence the place

sufficiently to keep out cattle. The decision is very far
from establishing that the petitioner is liable for poisoned
water not bordering a road, not shown to have been the
inducement that led the children to trespass, if in any
event the law would deem it sufficient to excuse their

going there, and not shown to have been the indirect inducement because known to the children to be frequented

by others... It is suggested that the roads across the place
were invitations. A road is not an invitation to leave it
elsewhere than at its end.
Judgment reversed.

CLARKE,

J., TAFT, C. J., and DAY, J., dissenting.

At the head of one group, from 1873 until the decision
of today, has stood the Supreme Court of the United
States, applying what has been designated as the "Humane" doctrine. Quite distinctly the- courts of Massachusetts have stood at the head of the other group, applying what has been designated as a "Hard Doctrine "the "Draconian Doctrine." Thompson on Negligence,
vol. I, §§ 1027 to 1054 inclusive, especially §§ 1027, 1047
and 1048; Cooley on Torts, 3d ed., pp. 1269, et seq.
In 1873, in Railroad Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, this
court, in a turntable case, in a unanimous decision,
strongly approved the doctrine that he who places upon
his land, where children of tender years are likely to go, a
construction or agency, in its nature attractive, and therefore a temptation, to such children, is culpably negligent
if he does not take reasonable care to keep them away, or
to see that such dangerous thing is so guarded that they
will not be injured by it when following the instincts and
impulses of childhood, of which all mankind has notice.
The court also held that where the facts are such that
different minds may honestly draw different conclusions
from them, the case should go to the jury.
Twenty years later the principle of this Stout Case was
elaborately reexamined and unreservedly affirmed, again
in a unanimous decision in Union-PacificRy. Co. v. McDonald, 152 U. S.262. In each of these cases the contention that a child of tender years must be held to the same
understanding of the law wfth respect to'property.rights as
'an adult and that therefore, under the circumstances of
each, the child injured was a trespasser, ws-considered
and emphatically rejected. The attractiveness of the unguarded construction or agency--the temptation of it to
children-is an invitation to enter the premises that
purges their technical trespass. These have been regarded
as leading cases on the subject for now almost fifty years
and have been widely followed by state and federal

courts,-by the latter so recently as Heller v. New York,
?T. H. & H. R. R. Co., 265 Fed. 192, and American Ry.
Express Co. v. Crabtree,2.71 Fed. 287.
The dimensions of the pool of poisoned water were
about 20x45 feet. It was 2'/2 to 3 feet deep in part and
in part 10 or more feet deep. A photograph in the record
gives it the appearance of an attractive swimming pool,
with brick sides and the water coming nearly to the top
of the wall. The water is described by the witnesses as
appearing to be clear and pure, and, on the hot summer
day on which the children perished, attractively cool.
This pool is indefinitely located within a tract of land
about 1,000 feet wide by 1,200 feet long, about which
there had not been any fence whatever for many years,
and there was no sign or warning of any kind indicating
the dangerous character of the water in the pool. There
were several paths across the lot, a highway ran within
100 to 1,20 feet of the pool, and a railway track was not far
away. The land was immediately adjacent to a city of
about 10,000 inhabitants, with dwelling houses not far
distant from it. The testimony shows that not only the
two boys who perished had been attracted to the pool at
the time but that there were two or three other children
with them, whose cries attracted men who were passing
nearby, who, by getting into the water, succeeded in recovering the dead body of one child and in rescuing the
other in such condition that, after lingering for a day or
two, he died. The evidence shows that the 'water in the
pool was highly impregnated with sulphuric acid and zinc
sulphate, which certainly caused the death of the children,
and that the men who rescued the boys suffered seriously,
one of them for as much as two weeks, from the effects
of the poisoned water.
The case was given to the jury in a clear and comprehensive charge, and the judgment of the District Court
upon the verdict was affirmed by the Circuit Court of

UNITED ZINC CO. v. BRITT.
268.

CLARKE,

Appeals. The court charged the jury that if the water in
the pool was not poisonous and if the boys were simply
drowned there could be no recovery, but that if it was
found, that the defendant knew or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known, that the water was impregnated with poison, that children were likely to go to
its vicinity, that it was in appearance clear and pure and
attractive to young children as a place for bathing, and
that the death of the children was caused by its alluring
appearance and by its poisonous character, and because
no protection or warning was given against it, the case
came within the principle of the "attractive nuisance"
or "turntable" cases and recovery would be allowed.
. This was as favorable a view of the federal law, as it
has been until today, as the petitioner deserved. The
Supreme Court of Illinois, on the authority of the Stout
Case, held a city liable for the death of a child drowned
in a similar pool of water not poisoned. City of Pekin
v. McMahon, 154 Ill. 141.
The facts, as stated, make it very clear that in the view
most unfavorable to the plaintiffs below there might be
a difference of opinion between candid men as to, whether
the pool was so located that the owners of the land
should have anticipated that children might frequent its
vicinity, whether its appearance and character rendered
it attractive to childish instincts so as to make it a temptation to children of tender years, and -whether, therefore, it was culpable negligence to maintain it in that location, unprotected and without warning as to its poisonous condition. This being true, the case would seem to
be one clearly for a jury, under the ruling in the Stout
Case, supra.
Believing as I do that the doctrine of the Stout and
McDonald Cases, giving weight to,.and making allowance,
as they do, for, the instincts and habitoal conduct of
children of tender years, is a sound doctrine, calculated to

is now substituting for it, I cannot share in setting aside

1. An exception in a statute defining an offense is met in an indictment by alleging facts sufficient to show that the defendant was
not within the exception. P. 287.
2. An indictment need only describe the crime with sufficient clear* ness to show the violation of law and to inform the defendant of
the nature and cause of the accusation and enable him to plead
