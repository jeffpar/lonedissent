decision of this cause depends needs no further argument
and that the judgment should be affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.

MISSOURI, KANSAS & TEXAS RAILWAY COMPANY OF TEXAS v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT -OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 439.

Submitted October 24, 1913.-Decided November 10, 1913.

Under the Hours of Service Act of March 4, 907, c. 2939, 34 Stat.
1415, when several employ6s are kept on duty beyond the specified
time of sixteen hours, a separate penalty is incurred for the detention
of each employ6 although by reason of the same delay of a train.
Each overworked railroad employd presents towards the public a distinct source of danger,
The wrongful act under the statute is not the delay of the train but the
retention of the employA; and the principle that under one act having several consequences which the law seeks to prevent there is but
one liability attached thereto does not apply.
An employ6, who is waiting for the train to move and liable to be
called and who is not permitted to go away, is on duty under the
Hours of Service Act.
The penalty under the Hours of Service Act, not being in the nature
of compensation to the employ6 but punitive and measured by the
harm done, is to be determined by the judge and not by the jury.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the Hours
of Service of Railway Employ~s Act, are stated in the
opinion.

Argument for Petitioners..

The Hours of Service Act imposes a penalty for each
act of requiring or permitting employs to work overtime,_
whether one or more employds be involved, and not a
penalty for each employe required, or permitted to work
beyond the hours prescribed
While it is clear-that a penalty can be recovered for each
and every violation, what constitutes a violation is the
question at issue.
While in United States v. Chicago, M. & P. S. Ry. Co.,
197 Fed. Rep. 624, and United States v. Denver & R. G.
Ry.Co., 197 Fed. Rep. 629, the trial court imposed a penalty for each member of a train crew, in none of them
was the question of the right to impose a penalty for each
employd discussed
In B. & 0.S.W. R. R. Co. v. United States, 220 U. S. 94,
reversing 159 Fed. Rep. 33, it was held that under the
Cruelty Act a penalty was recoverable for each act of confinement beyond the statutory period.
For civil cases involving recovery of more than one penalty in state courts, see M., K. & T. Ry. Co. v. State, 97

Upon the request of either party the penalty to be assessed in a case arising under the Hours of Service Act
should be submitted to the jury, even where the court
instructs a verdict for the Government.
Suits by the Government for penalties under the Hours
of Service Act are actions at law for debt, and, as such, are
civil suits. Hepner v. United States, 213 U. S. 103; United
States v. Atlantic C. L. R. Co., 182 Fed. Rep. 285; United

In a civil suit, where the damages or penalties are not
made certain and fixed by the terms of a contract or statute, the court, upon request, should submit to the jury
the question of assessing the damages or penalties. Renner

In a consolidated cause, involving two suits of five
counts each, where in any event but one penalty can be
recovered in each case, it is plain error for the court to
instruct the jury to find against defendant on each count
and to assess a penalty on each count. United States v.

MR. JusucE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This case brings up two suits that were consolidated and
tried together, both being suits for penalties under the
Hours of Service Act of March 4, 1907, c. 2939, 34 Stat.
1415, for keeping employs on duty for more than sixteen
consecutive hours. The main question is whether, when
several persons thus are kept beyond the proper time by
reason of the same delay of a train, a separate penalty is
incurred for each or only one for all. The Circuit Court of
Appeals decided for the Government without discussion.
The petitioner cites many cases in favor of the proposition that generally, when one act has several consequences
that the law seeks to prevent, the liability is attached to
the act, and is but one. It argues that the delay of the
train was such an act and that the principle, which is a
very old one, applies. Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern R.
R. Co. v. United States, 220 U. S. 94. But unless the statute requires a different view, to call the delay of the traia
the act that produced the wrong, is to beg the question.
See Memphis & Charleston R. R. Co. v. Reeves, 10 Wall.
176. Denny v. New York Central R. R. Co., 13 Gray, 481.
The statute was not violated by the delay. That may have
made keeping the men overtime more likely, but was not
in itself wrongful conduct quoad hoc. The wrongful act
was keeping an employ6 at work.overtime, and that act
was distinct as to each employ6 so kept. Without stopping to consider whether, this argument would be met by
the proviso declaring a 'delay' in certain cases not to
be within the statute, it is enough to observe that there is
nothing to hinder making each consequence a separate
cause of action or offence, if by its proper construction the
law does so; see Flemister v. United States, 207 U. S. 372,

MISSOURI, K. & T. RY. CO. v. UNITED STATES.
231 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

375; so that the real question is simply what the statute
means. The statute makes the carrier who permits 'any
employ6' to remain on duty in violation of its terms,
liable to a penalty 'for each and every violation.' The
implication of these words cannot be made much plainer
by argument. But it may be observed as was said by the
Government that as towards the public every overworkedman presents a distinct danger, and as towards the employ6s each case of course is distinct. United States v.
St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., 184 Fed. Rep. 28; People
v. Spencer, 201 N. Y. 105, 111.
One of the delays was while the engine was sent off for
water and repairs. In the meantime the men were waiting,
doing nothing. It is argued that they were not on duty
during this period and that if :it be deducted, they were not
kept more than sixteen hours. But they were under orders, liable to be called upon at any moment, and not at
liberty to go away. They were none the less on duty when
inactive. Their duty was to stand and wait. United
States v. Chicago, M. & P. S. Ry. Co., 197 Fed. Rep. 624,
628; United States v. Denver d: R. G. R. Co., 197 Fed. Rep.
629.
It is urged that in one case the delay was the result of
a cause, a defective injector, that was not known to the
carrier, and could not have been foreseen when the employ~s left a terminal, and that therefore by the proviso in
§ 3 the act does not apply.' But the question was raised
only by a request to direct a verdict for the defendant and
the trouble might have been found to be due to. the scarcity and bad quality of the water, which was well known.
See Gleeson v. Virginia Midland Ry. Co., 140 U. S. 435.
The Majestic,. 166 U. S. 375, 386.
The statute provides for a penalty not to exceed five
hundred dollars. It is argued that the amount of the penalty was for the jury, the proceeding being a civil suit.
But the penalty is a deterrent not compensation. The

amount is not measured by the harm to the employs but
by the fault of the carrier, and being punitive, rightly was
determined by the judge. United States v. Atlantic Coast

CLEMENT NATIONAL

BANK, v. STATE OF

VERMONT.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF VERMONT.

No. 29.

Argued April 28, 29, 1913.-Decided November 10, 1913.

A tax upon deposits in a national bank to be iaid by the depositors held
in this case not to be a tax upon the franchise of the bank.
An interpretation by the state court of a state statute is controlling on
this court; and this court determines whether the statute as so delimited conflicts with Federal law.
The National Bank Act does not withdraw credits of depositors in
national banks from the taxing power of the State.
Under its broad powers of classification for taxation, a State may
classify depositors in national banks so long as the tax is not essentially inimical to such banks in frustrating the purpose of the legislation or impairing their efficiency as Federal agencies.
The object of § 5219, Rev. Stat., is to prevent hostile discrimination
against national banks; and a state tax to be in conflict therewith
must constitute such a discrimination.
A provision in a statute permitting a bank to stipulate with the State
to pay the taxes on deposits and thereby relieve its depositors from
making returns does not place the bank under duress.
This court finds no basis for the charge of injurious discrimination
against national banks in § 815 of Chapter 37 of the Public Statutes
of Vermont.
While a national bank can only transact such business as the Federal
statutes permit, it may, under its incidental powers, make reasonable
business agreements in regard to its deposits including the payment
