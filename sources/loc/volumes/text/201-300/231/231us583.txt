JOHN, GUARDIAN, v. PAULLIN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLA] IOMA.

No. 105.

Argued December 8, 9, 1913.-Dccided December 22, 1913.

No Federal right is denied by an appellate court of a State in dismissing
an appeal from a lower court, because its jurisdiction was not invoked in accordance with the laws of the State, and this court cannot
review such a judgment under § 709, Rev. Stat., now Judicial Code,
§ 237.
It rests with each State to prescribe the jurisdiction of its appellate
courts, and the mode of invoking it, and their rules are equally applicable when Federal, as when only local, rights are involved.
Section 12 of the act of March 3, 1905, 33 Stat. 1048, 1081, providing
for the review of judgments of the courts temporarily established in
the Indian Territory, related only to such judgments .and has no
application to judgments rendered by the state courts after Statehood.
The method of subjecting the judgments of a subordinate state court
to review by appellate courts of the State is a matter of local concern and not within the control of Congress. Coyle v. Smith, 221
U. S.559.

Opinion cf the Court.

231 U. S.

In this case, as nothing was decided but a preliminary question of the
jurisdiction of a state appellate court which turned entirely upon a
question of local law, the writ of error-is dismissed.

facts, which involve the jurisdiction of this court
under § 237 of the Judicial Code to review a judgment
of the appellate court of a State dismissing an appeal from
an inferior court, are stated in the opinion.
THE

Mr. Edward F. Colladay, with whom Mr. Napoleon B.
Maxey was on the brief, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. W. T. Sprowls, Mr. V. B. Hays and Mr. Robert
Crockett, for defendants in error, submitted.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEvANTER delivered the opinion of

the court.
Our jurisdiction in this case is challenged by a motion
to dismiss. The case was begun in the United States
Court for the Central District of the Indian Territory,
and was pending in that court when the Territory of
Oklahoma and the Indian Territory were admitted into
the Union as the State of Oklahoma. Under the combined
operation of the Oklahoma Enabling Act (June 16, 1906,
34 Stat. 267, c. 3335; March 4, 1907, Id. 1286, c. 2911)
and the state constitution (gee Benner v. Porter, 9 How.
235, 246) the case was then transferred to the district
court of Bryan County, where a trial resulted in a judgment determining the matters in controversy, which
turned in part upon the validity, under the laws of the
United States, of certain deeds and leases executed by an
Indian allottee, since deceased. The guardian of two
minor heirs of the allottee had intervened in the cause,
had asserted the invalidity o all the deeds and leases, and

the Court.

had set up a claim to the property in question as against
the other parties; but this claim was rejected, and the
guardian sought to have the judgment reviewed and reversed by the Supreme Court of the State. That court
held that some of the parties below, whose presence in the
appellate proceeding was essential, had not been brought
into that proceeding, or voluntarily appeared therein, in
accordance with the law of the State, and upon
that
ground dismissed the proceeding. 24 Oklahoma, 636.
The guardian then sued out the present writ of error.
As the Supreme Court of the State did not pass upon
the merits of the case or upon the correctness of any of
the rulings below, but, on the contrary, held that it was
powerless to do so because it,; appellate jurisdiction was not
invoked in accordance with the laws of the State, we do
not perceive any theory upon which its judgment of dismissal may be reviewed by us consistently with the familiar
limitations upon our authority. See Rev. Stat., § 709;
Judicial Code, § 237. Certainly no Federal right was
denied by that court, and if, as was held by it, its appellate
jurisdiction was not properly invoked, no Federal question
was before it for decision.
Without any doubt it rest;s with each State to prescribe
the jurisdiction of its appellate courts, the mode and time
of invoking that jurisdiction, and the rules of practice
to be applied in its exercise; and the state law and practice in this regard are no less applicable when Federal
rights are in controversy than when the case turns entirely
upon questions of local or general law. Callan v. Bransford, 139 U. S. 197; Brown v. Massachusetts, 144 U. S.
573; Jacobi v. Alabama, 187 U: S.133; Hulbert v. Chicago,
202 U. S.275, 281; Newman v. Gates, 204 U. S.89; Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. v. McDonald, 214 U. S.191, 195.
But it is said that the proceedings by which it was attempted to secure a review of the judgment of the trial
court should have been tested by the act of Congress of

OCTOBER TERM, 191,,.
Opinion of the Court.

231 U. S.

March 3, 1905, 33 Stat. 1048, 1081, c. 1479, § 12, and that
the Supreme Court of the State erred in holding otherwise. We cannot accede to the contention. The act of
1905, § 12, related to the review of judgments rendered
in the courts temporarily established by Congress in the
Indian Territory, and had no application to judgments
rendered after statehood in the courts of the State. Besides, the mode of subjecting the judgments of the State's
subordinate courts to review in its Supreme Court was a
matter of local concern only and not within the control of
Congress. See Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559.
The state constitution provided (Art. 7, § 8) that the
appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court should be
invoked in the manner prescribed by the laws of the Territory of Oklahoma, until the state legislature should provide otherwise, and also (Art. 25, § 2) that the laws of the
Territory of Oklahoma, not repugnant to the state constitution or locally inapplicable, should be extended over
the new State, which embraced the Indian Territory as
well as the Territory of Oklahoma. When the State was
admitted into the Union the Territory of Oklahoma
had a full complement of laws regulating appellate proceedings. Wilson's Rev. & Ann. Stat. 1903, §§ 4732 et
seq. It was by these constitutional provisions and laws
that the Supreme Court tested the appellate proceedings
in this instance, with the result that they were adjudged
inadequate because they had not brought before the court,
within the time prescribed (Wilson's Stat., §§ 4736, 4748),
parties whose presence was essential to enable it to review
the judgment below.
• Thus it appears that nothing was decided but the preliminary question of the court's jurisdiction to pass upon
the controverted matters shown in the record, and that
this question was resolved according to what the court
deemed to be the true construction and effect of applicable
provisions of the constitution and laws of the State. In

Opinion of the Court..

short, the judgment of dismissal turned entirely upon a
question of local law.
As particularly apposite, we quote the following from
the opinion in Newman v. Gates, supra, a case in which
this court declined to review a like judgment of dismissal
by a state court:
"Had the appeal been properly taken it would have
been the duty of the Supreme Court of Indiana to pass
upon the questions presented by the record before it,
including, it may be, a Federal question, based upon the
due faith and credit clause of the Constitution, which,
on various occasions, was pressed upon the attention of
the trial court. In legal effect, however, the case stands
as though no appeal had been prosecuted from the judgment rendered by the trial court. As the jurisdiction of
this court to review the judgments or decrees of state
courts when a Federal question is prbsented is limited to
the review of a final judgment or decree, actually or constructively deciding such a question, when rendered by
the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit
could be had, and as for the want of a proper appeal no
final judgment or decree in such court has been rendered,
it results that the statutory prerequisite for the exercise in
this case of the reviewing power of this court is wanting."
Writ of error dismissed.
