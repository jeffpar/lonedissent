a representative of the Woolen Company, and that an
agent of the Woolen Company frequently visited the concern inquiring into the sales and urging prompt collections.
The Horowitzes and the Niagara Company were not permitted to keep the proceeds of the sales or to use them for
their own benefit, and this was only done through the
fraudulent conduct of Philip Horowitz in violation of the
agreement and the purpose of the parties.
We are unable to find that this contract was either
actually or constructively fraudulent, and hold, as was
found in the Circuit Court of Appeals, that it was what it
purported to be, a consignment arrangement with the net
proceeds of sales to be accounted for to the consignor and
with the right to return the unsold goods. Finding no
error in the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, the

PEABODY v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 289. Argued February 27, 1913.-Decided December 15, 1913.
The subjection of land to the burden of governmental use by constantly
discharging heavy guns from a battery over it in time of peace in
such manner as to deprive the owner of its profitable use would constitute such a servitude as would amount to a taking of the property
within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and not merely a consequential damage.
In order, however, to maintain an action for such a taking it must appear that the servitude has actually been imposed on the property.
A suit against the Government must rest on contract as the Government has not consented to be sued for torts even though committed
by its officers in discharge of their official duties.

PEABODY v. UNITED STATES.
231 U.S.

Argument for Appellants.

A contract with the Government to take and pay for property. cannot
be implied unless the property has been actually appropriated.
The mere location of a battery i3 not an appropriation of property
within-the range-of its guns.
Where it appears that the guns in a battery have' not been fired for
more than eight years, and. the Government denies that it intends
to fire the guns over adjacent property except possibly in time of
war, this court will not say that the Government has taken that
property for military purposes.
46 Ct. Cis. 39, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the determination of whether
the establishment of a battery in connection with its military fortifications by the United States in the vicinity of
claimants' land amounted under the. circumstances of
this case to a taking of property under the Fifth Amendment, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. John Lowell, with whom Mr. William Frye White
and Mr. Chauncey Hackett were on the brief, for appellants:
The court below erred in not finding that the property
of the claimant has been taken without just compensation
where guns of a permanent battery established by the
United States. have been fired over and across the same;
and where the -guns are so fixed as to make it possible to
do so in the future.
It also erred in not holding that under the circumstances
of this case the property or a property right in the same
has not been taken within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and that the United States is liable for the value
thereof.
It is impossible to fire the guns with safety except over
the claimants' land.
The United States intended to fire the -guns over the
claimants'land in time of peace.
Property includes the collection of rights attaching to

the things or land. Those rights include rights of use,
exclusion and disposition. It is these rights which constitute property and it is the interference with these
rights which, if carried so far as to impair materially their
value, constitutes a taking. Old Colony R. R. Co. v.

Argument fcr Appellants.

Claimants' property has been taken.
It cannot possibly be said that with this menace constantly threatening the claimants' land, materially and
permanently impairing its value, their rights of use, exclusion and disposition, have not been so seriously interfered
with as to constitute a taking.
The claimants' land extends in contemplation of law
usque ad celum. Co. Litt. 4a; 2 Bla. Com. 18; 3 Kent

The property of the claimants consisted of the rights of
user, exclusion and disposition. So far as they are concerned, these rights have been greatly impaired, in fact
have become'valueless. The Court of Claims has found
that this impairment of the value of the property will
continue so long as the fort and artillery therein axe
maintained. The United States is in the enjoyment of the
greater part of these rights. It is clear, therefore, that the
United States has taken the claimants' property within
the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.
The decision of the Court of Claims is wrong. Emerson v. Taylor, 9 Maine, 42, relied on below, does not
apply, as the acts complained of in that case did not
constitute a taking within the meaning of the Fifth
Amendment.

Fifth Amendment are also clearly distinguishable. See
United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445.
The claimants' property has been taken: the United
States has taken title to the whole of the claimants' property commanded by the guns by acquiring the value
thereof and assuming dominion thereof in perpetuo.
The findings show that the land was of little value except
as a summer resort, and that it can no longer be used for
such purpose.
This is not a case of loss of access, nor a case where the
land was subject to a servitude in favor of the United
States; nor a case where the damage was consequential.
It is a case where upon the firing of the guns the United
States took the valuable use of the land and thereby virtually, though not formally, has appropriated the title as
well.
Mr. Frederick De C. Faust, with whom Mr. Assistant
Attorney General Thompson was on the brief, for the
United States:
Appellants, as record owners, are estopped from asserting that the property has been taken.
Appellants' fundamental proposition to establish the
taking rests upon a false premise.
There has been no taking of appellants' property within
rule established by decisions of this court.
The injury of which appellants complain is consequential, for which no right of compensation attaches.
In support of these contentions, see Bedford v. United
States, 192 U. S. 224; Benner v. Atlantic Dredging Co., 134

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Claims dismissing petitions for compensation for land
alleged to have been taken by the United States for public
use. 46 Ct. Cls. 39. Separate suits were brqught by Samuel Ellery Jennison, the.owner at the time the taking is
said to have occurred, by his mortgagees, Mary R. Peabody and the Saco and Biddeford Savings Institution, and
by his grantee, the Portsmouth Harbor Land and Hotel
Company. These suits were consolidated and the merits
were heard. The following facts are shown by the findings:
The land in question, comprising about two hundred
acres, forms the southern corner of Gerrish' Island, the
southernmost point on the coast of Maine. It lies about
three miles from Portsmouth, bordering on the south and

east the Atlantic ocean and on the west the entrance to
Portsmouth harbor. Its value consists almost entirely
in its adaptability for use as a summer resort and it had
been improved for this purpose by the erection of a hotel,
cottages, outbuildings and pier, by the construction of
ro.ds, and by the provision of facilities for. summer recreations.
In 1873, long before Jennison acquired title and improved the property, the United States began the construction of a twelve-gun battery upon a tract of seventy
acres lying north and west of the land in suit and abutting
upon it. This battery was to be one of the outer line of
defenses of Portsmouth harbor, for which appropriation
had been made by the act of February 21, 1873, c. 175,
17 Stat. 468. (See also act of April 3, 1874, c. 74, 18 Stat.
25.) By the year 1876, a large sum had been expended
upon the work which had reached an advanced stage of
construction. 'Operations were closed in September of
that year, however, for want of funds and the fortification
was not occupied by the United States thereafter until
work was resumed in 1898. The Government then constructed on the same site a battery consisting of three
ten-inch guns and two three-inch rapid fire guns. It was
practically completed on June 30, 1901, and was transferred to the artillery on December 16, 1901, being named
Fort Foster.
No part of the fort encroaches upon the land in suit;
the fort is within two hundred feet of its northwestern
corner and about one thousand feet from the hotel. The
claimants' land lies between the fort and the open sea to
the south and southeast; and the guns have a range of fire
over all the sea-front of the property. As the government reservation on its western side borders the entrance
to the harbor, the court found that there was an available
portion of the shore belonging to the reservation which
permitted the firing of the guns in a southwesterly direc-

tion "for practice and for all other necessary purposes in
time of peace" without the projectiles passing over the
land in question. This conclusion was reached by applying the local law governing the boundary lines of contiguous proprietors where there is a curvature of the shore.
Emerson v. Taylor, 9 Maine, 42. It may be noticed here
that the petitioners insist that the guns could not be fired
over the narrow area thus found to be a part of the reservation without endangering life and property along the
New Hampshire coast and they present in their brief a
map to support their assertion. The Government urges
that this map has not been identified and is wholly incompetent; and that, as the question is one of fact, the finding
must be deemed conclusive. But while thus finding that
there was a line of fire available to the Government over
its own shore property, the court also found that the most
suitable field of fire for practice and other purposes in time
of peace would be over the claimants' land.
On or about June 22, 1902, two of the guns were fired for
the purpose of testing them at a target off the coast, the
missiles passing over the land in suit; and another gun
was fired for the same purpose and to the same effect on
September 25, 1902, the resulting damage to buildings and
property amounting to $150.
None of the guns has been fired since, but they have been
kept in good condition by a detail from Fort Constitution
which is situated across the Piscataqua River. The court
below'further states in its findings that "it does not appear
from the evidence that there is any intention on the part of
the Government to fire any of its guns now installed, or
which may hereafter be installed, at said fort in time of
peace over and across the lands of the claimants so as to
deprive them of the use of the same or any part thereof or
to injure the same by concussion or otherwise, excepting
as such intention can be drawn from the fact that the guns
now installed in said fort are so fixed as to make it possible

Opinion of the Court.

231 U. S.

so to do and the further fact that they were so fired upon
the occasions as hereinbefore found."
In the years 1903 and 1904, the hotel which had previously been profitable was conducted at a loss; since 1904,
it has been closed and the cottages have-been rented only
in part and at reduced rates. It is found that the erection
of the fort and the installation of the guns have materially
impaired the value of the property and that this impairment will continue so long as the fort and artillery are
maintained. This is found to be due to the apprehension
that the guns will be fired over the property.
The question is whether upon this showing the petitioners were entitled to recover.
It may be assumed that if the Government had installed its battery, not simply as a means of defense in
war, but with the purpose and effect of subordinating the
strip of land between the battery aid the sea to the right
and privilege of the Government to fire projectiles directly across it for the purpose of practice or otherwise,
whenever it saw fit, in time of peace, with the result of
depriving the owner of its profitable use, the imposition
of such a servitude would constitute an appropriation of
property for which compensation should be made. The
subjection of the land to the burden of governmental use
in this manner might well be considered to be a 'taking'
within the principle of the decisions (Pumpelly v. Green
Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, 177, 178; United States v. Lynah,
188 U. S. 445, 469; United States v. Welch, 217 U. S. 333,
339) and not merely a consequential damage incident to a
public undertaking which must be borne without any right
to compensation (TransportationCo. v. Chicago, 99 U. S.
635, 642; Gibson v. United States, 166 U. S. 269; Scranton
v. Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141, 164; Bedford v. United States,
192 U. S. 217, 224; Jackson v. United States, 230 U. S. 1,
23).
But, in this view, the question remains whether it satis-

PEABODY v. UNITED STATES.
231 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

factorily appears that the servitude has been imposed;
that is, whether enough is shown to establish an intention
on the part of the Government to impose it. The suit
must rest upon contract, as the Government has not consented to be sued for torts even though committed by its
officers in the discharge of their official duties (Gibbons v.
United States, 8 Wall. 269, 275; Langford v; United States,
101 U. S. 341, 343; Sehillinger v. United States, 155 U. S.
163, 169; Russell v. United States, 182 U. S. 516, 530;
Harley v. United States, 198 U. S. 229, 234); and a contract to pay, in the present case, cannot be implied unless
there has been an actual appropriation of property (United
States v. Great Falls Mfg. Co., 112 U. S. 645, 656, 657).
The contention of the petitioners, therefore, is plainly
without merit so far as it rests upon the mere fact 'that
there iยง a suitable, or the rmost suitable, field of fire over
their property. Land, or an interest in land, cannot be
deemed to be taken by the Government merely because
it is suitable to be used in connection with an adjoining
tract which the GovernmerLt has acquired, or because of a
depreciation in its value due to the apprehension of such
use. The mere location oL a battery certainly is not an
appropriation of the property within the range of its guns.
The petitioners' argument, assumes that*the guns, for
proper practice, must be fired over the land in suit and,
hence, that this burden upon it was a necessary incident
to the maintenance of the fort. The fact of the necessity
of practice firing is said to be established by the finding
with respect to the line of fire over the Government's
portion of the shore in which it is said that this would be
sufficient "for purposes of practice and for all other necessary purposes in time of peace." But, in the light of
other findings, this is fax from affording a sufficient foundation for the conclusion upon which the petitioners insist.
On the contrary, that no such necessity as is now asserted
can be assumed from the mere fact that the fort is main-

tained is demonstrated by the facts of this case. This suit
was tried in the latter part of the year 1910 and it appeared that none of the guns had been fired for over eight
years. When the suit was brought in 1905, nearly two
years and a half had elapsed since the firing of a shot.
The guns have been fired only upon two occasions, or
three times in all, and this firing took place in 1902, shortly
after the installation of the guns, for the purpose of testing
them. It may be that practice in firing the guns would
be highly desirable, but it is too much to say upon this
record that the fort would be useless without it. Nor are
we at liberty to conclude that the Government has taken
property, which it denies that it has taken, by assuming
a military necessity in the case of this fort which is absolutely contradicted by the facts proved.
Reduced to the last analysis, the claim of the petitioners
rests upon the fact that the guns were fired upon the two
occasions in 1902, as stated, and upon the apprehension
that the firing will be repeated. That there is any intention to repeat it does not appear but rather is negatived.
There is no showing that the guns will ever be fired unless
in necessary defense in time of war. We deem the facts
found to be too slender a basis for a decision that the
property of the claimants has been actually appropriated
and that the Government has thus impliedly agreed to
pay for it.
The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.
