if the settler subsequently married. The only semblance
of difficulty is due to the coincidence in time of the acquisition of a separate right by the settler and the beginning of a community right in the wife. But this is
by no means an extreme illustration of the division of
an indivisible instant that is practiced by the law whenever it is necessary. A statute may give a man a right
of action against another for causing his death, that accrues to him at the instant that he is vivus et mortuus.
Higgins v. Central New England & Western R. R. Co.,
155 Massachusetts, 176, 179. In the present case the
acquisition under the United States law is complete and
that law has released its control before the state law
lays hold, and, upon grounds in no way connected or
interfering with the policy of Congress, brings the community regime into play. The special family relations
thus created are not like contracts with third persons
impliedly forbidden by the act of March 3, 1891, c. 561,
§ 5, 26 Stat. 1097, amending Rev. Stat., § 2290. They
are consistent with the policy of the statute which is to
enable the settler and his family to secure a home. See
§ 2291.

STRAUS v. FOXWORTH.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF
NEW MEXICO.
No. 191.

Submitted October 20, 1913.-Decided November 17, 1913.

A statement that a statutory sale was not sufficiently advertised is a
pure conclusion of law and, in the absence of allegations of fact to
sustain it, is an empty assertion that is not admitted by demurrer.
Statements that the amount of taxes for which the property was sold
was excessive must be read in connection with other statements in the
pleading admitting that the taxes were delinquent and therefore
augmented by the statutory penalties.

STRAUS v. FOXWORTH.
231 U. S.

Argument for Appellant.

A construction by the Supreme Court of the Territory that is not
manifestly wrong will not be rejected by this court, and so held as to
a construction of the words "in accordance with this act" as meaning
"under this act."

Treat v. Grand Canyon Railway Co., 222 U. S. 448.

A statute correcting irregularities in compliance with statutory provisions in regard to tax sales is remedial in nature and unless violative
of constitutional restrictions is not a denial of due process of law as
retrospective legislation; and so held as to § 25 of c. 22 of the laws of
New Mexico of 1899, providing that sales for taxes made under that
act shall not be invalidated except on the ground of prior payment of
the taxes or exemption of the property from taxation.
One attacking a statute on the ground that it is unconstitutional is
limited to his own case as the tatute has been applied therein; he
cannot rely on a possible construction of the statute that might make
it unconstitutional. Castillo v. McConnico, 168 U. S. 674.
16 New Mex. 442, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the validity of a tax sale and
the constitutionality of a statute of New Mexico relative

to tax deeds, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. William C. Reid and Mr. James M. Hervey for

appellant:
The case being on appeal from a Territory, this court
has jurisdiction to consider both the questions of "due
process of law" under the Fourteenth Amendment, and
the essentials under the territorial statute, which constitute due process of law.
Section 25, ch. 22, Laws of 1899 of New Mexico, per-

mits the taking of property for taxation, without assessient, levy, or notice of sale, as after sale the same cannot
be attacked, except on the ground that the tax had been
paid, or that the property was not subject to taxation.

99 U. S. 441; Sherry v. McKinley, 99 U. S. 496, relied upon
by appellee, all arose under the Insurrection Acts of 1862
and 1863 and do not apply to other times. They are not

deed may be made prima facie evidence of its validity.

This rule is not questioned in this case.
A legislature may not provide machinery for the collection of taxes, and then disregard the steps required, and
cure the failure to follow the essentials by a curative
statute or concurrent statute. 1 Cooley on Taxation (3d
ed.), p. 518.
While the legislature of a State may declare that a tax
deed shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity of the
sale, and of all proceedings prior thereto, it cannot make
such a deed conclusive evidence of the grantee's title.

231 U. S.

Argument for Appellant.

The notice is bad if it differs from the assessment in
giving the name of the person to whom the land is taxed.

168 U. S. 674; Alvord v. Col!in, 20 Pick. 418; Workingmen's Bank v. Lannes, 30 La. Ann. 871.
A tax deed cannot be made conclusive evidence of
title in the grantee. An attempt to do so is a violation of
the great principle of Magna Charter and would in many
cases deprive the citizen of his property, by proceedings
absolutely without warrant of law or of justice. It is not
in the power of any American legislature to deprive one
of his property by making his adversary's claim to it
conclusive of its own validity. It cannot, therefore, make
the tax deed conclusive evidence of the holder's title to
the land, or of the jurisdictional facts which would make
out title. Cases supra and Martin v. Barbour, 34 Fed.

Mr. Harry H. McElroy and Mr. Harry M. Dougherty
for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of
the court.
This was a suit to quiet the title to three tracts of land
in Quay County, in the Territ~ory of New Mexico. In the
court of first instance a demurrer to the complaint was
sustained and, the plaintiff declining to amend, a decree
of dismissal was entered, which subsequently was affirmed
by the Supreme Court of the Territory. 16 N. Mex. 442.
An appeal from the decree of affirmance brings the case
here, under the act of March 3, 1885, 23 Stat. 443, c. 355.
The complaint purported to state four causes of. action.
In the first, embracing all the tracts, it was alleged that
the plaintiff was the owner in fee simple and that the
defendant was making some adverse claim, not described.
In the others, each embracing a single tract, the plaintiff's ownership was reiterated and it was alleged that the
defendant was claiming title under tax deeds issued in
consummation of tax sales which were characterized as
void for designated reasons. But notwithstanding its
form, the complaint, as the :record discloses, was treated
in both of the territorial courts, with the acquiescence of
the parties, as intended to challenge the validity of the
tax deeds only upon the grounds designated in the last

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

231 U. S.

three causes of action; that is, as if the general charge in
the first cause of action was intended to be restrained and
limited by the more specific charges in the others. We
therefore treat the complaint in the same way.
It was not alleged that the lands were not subject to
taxation, or that the taxes on account of which the sales
were had were in any wise invalid, or that the taxes or any
part of them had been paid or tendered, or that they had
not been delinquent for such a period as justified their
enforcement by a sale of the lands, or that the sales were
in any wise tainted with fraud, or that there had been any
attempt to redeem the lands, or any of them, within the
three years allowed therefor, or that that period had not
elapsed after the sales and before the deeds were issued.
On the contrary, the sole grounds on which the complaint
assailed the tax title were (a) that the sales were "not
sufficiently advertised," (l) that proof of publication of
the notice of sale was not transmitted by the printer to the
county collector "immediately after the last publication,"
(c) that the collector did not cause to be made an affidavit
of the public posting of the notice of sale and did not
cause proof of publication or of posting to be deposited
with the probate clerk, (d) that the probate clerk did not
"carefully preserve" any such proofs, and (e) that the
amount of the delinquency sought to be satisfied by the
sales was in one instance 16 cents, and in another 24 cents,
more than the taxes levied on the particular tract.
Plainly, the allegation that the sales were "not sufficiently advertised" was purely a conclusion of law, and
must be disregarded. No facts being set forth to sustain
it, the statement of the conclusion was merely an empty
assertion, and, under the rule that a demurrer admits only
facts well pleaded, the conclusion was not admitted.
The charge that the delinquency sought to be satisfied
by the sales was in excess of the taxes levied must be
read in connection with the fact otherwise appearing in

STRAUS v. FOXWORTH.
231 U. S.

Opinion of tae Court.

the complaint, that the taxes were delinquent, and. in
connection with the statutory provisions augmenting the
delinquency by designated penalties and costs. When
this is done it is quite evident that the amount sought to be
collected was not excessive.
The remaining objections advanced in the complaint
are founded upon a failure to comply with local statutory
provisions directing the making and preserving of proofs
of the publication and posting of the notice of sale. The
Supreme Court of the Territory held, in effect, that
compliance with these statutory provisions was not
essential in a constitutional sense to the validity of tax
sales and therefore that the territorial legislature was
free to declare that non-compliance should not render the
sales invalid; and with this as a premise the court further
held that the objections could not prevail, because the
statute under which the sales were had contained a
provision that "no bill of review or other action attacking
the title to any property sold at tax sale in accordance with
this act shall be entertained by any court, nor shall such
sale or title be invalidated by any proceedings, except upon
the ground that the taxes, penalties, interest and costs
had been paid before the sale, or that the property was not
subject to taxation." Laws New Mexico, 1899, c. 22,
§ 25.
The appellant assigns error upon this ruling and insists
that the provision just quoted (a) is in terms restricted
to sales made "in accordance with this act." and so cannot
be applied to any sale wherein some requirements of the
act were not followed, and (b) is repugnant to the due
process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as
applied to the Territory by the organic act.
The Supreme Court of the Territory construed the
words "in accordance with this act" as meaning "under
this act," and we think this was right. At least, we
cannot say that it was manifestly wrong, as must be done

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

to 'justify us in rejecting the local interpretation of a
territorial statute. Fox v. Haarstick, 156 U. S. 674, 679;
Treat v. Grand Canyon Railway Co., 222 U. S. 448, 452.
Of course, the provision was intended to have some operation and effect, and it hardly could have any if restricted
to sales made in accordance with the act, in the stricter
sense, for such sales would be as valid without the provision as with it.
While statutes authorizing tax sales often provide for
making and preserving some designated form of record
evidence of compliance with the requirements respecting
notice of the sale, the subject is one which rests in legislative discretion, being quite apart from those fundamental
rights which are embraced in a right conception of due
process of law. And if there be legislative provision upon
the subject, it does not assume the dignity of an essential
element of due process of law in the constitutional sense
(Castillo v. McConnico, 168 U. S. 674, 683), but belongs to
that class of regulations of which it is said in Williams v.
Supervisors of Albany, 122 U. S. 154, 164: "Where directions upon the subject might originally have been dispensed with, or executed at another time, irregularities
arising from neglect to follow them may be remedied by
the legislature, unless its action in this respect is restrained
by constitutional provisions prohibiting retrospective
legislation." We are not here concerned with retrospective legislation or with any prohibition of it, for, as before
shown, the remedial or relieving provision was embodied
in the act under which the sales were had.
It is contended, however, that the remedial or relieving
provision is so broad in its terms as to give effect to a sale
not founded upon a prior assessment or where no opportunity was afforded for a hearing in opposition to the tax,
and therefore that it is violative of due process. To this
it is a sufficient answer to repeat what was said in Castillo
v. McConnico (p. 680), in disposing of a like contention:

TORRES v. LOTHROP.
231 U. S.

Syllabus.

"But, as thus stated, the proposition presents a purely
moot question. The plaintiff in error has no interest to
assert that the statute is unconstitutional because it
might be construed so as to cause it to violate the Constitution. His right is limited solely to the inquiry whether in
the case which he presents the effect of applying the
statute is to deprive him of his property without due
process of law."
As none of the objections advanced in the complaint
against the defendant's tax title appears to have been well
taken, we think the demurrer was rightly sustained.
Decree affirmed.

Although proceeds of a crop received by a mortgagee of the land may
by law be imputed to payment of interest on the mortgage and not
