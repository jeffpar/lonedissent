MUNSEY v. WEBB, ADMINISTRATOR OF
PENNINGTON.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 40.

Argued November 4, 5, 1913.-Decided November 17, 1913.

Where the possibility of their occurrence is clear to the ordinarily prudent eye, one operating an elevator must guard against accidents

even though they may occur in an unexpected manner. Washington & Georgetown R. R. Co. v. Hickey, 166 U. S. 521.
Where the jury-may properly find that negligence to guard against a
possible, although unusual, accident in an eleyator was the proximate
cause of the injury, the appellate court will not reverse because the
negligence was merely a passive omission.
Where there is a special source of danger in operating an elevator this
court will not say, against the finding of a jury, that such danger
need not*be constantly guarded against.
37 App. D. C. 185, affirmed.

facts, which involve questions of negligence in
operating an elevatbr and questions of proximate cause of
an injury sustained by a passenger therein, are stated in
the opinion.
THE

Mr. Charles A. Douglas and Mr. John W. Price, with
whom Mr. Hugh H. Obear, Mr. Wilton J. Lambert, Mr. C.
K. Mount, Mr. J. Norment Powell, Mr. H. H. Shelton and
Mr. Thos. Ruffin were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The law looks to the proximate and not to the remote
cause. Defendant is not liable in this case, because the
negligence complained of was merely the means and not
the proximate cause of the injury. The proximate cause
being the unknown thing which caused deceased to fall
and which, being absolutely unknown, cannot be imputed
to defendant. Also the accident which happened to the
deceased when apparently he was in an entirely normal

condition, alone in the car, except for the operator, and
without apparent reason, but absolutely without any
fault on the part of the defendant and consequent injury-was not the natural and probable consequence of
the acts of negligence complained of and could not reasonably have been anticipated by the defendant as likely
to occur by reason of such negligence.
Where there is an intervening efficient cause, such intervening cause is the proximate cause of the injury, and
responsible.
Where an act could not have been foreseen, nor anticipated, as the result of an act; of negligence it is not actionable.
In this case the fall of the plaintiff's intestate, for which
defendant was not responsible, was the intervening efficient
cause.
The fall and injury of deceased without apparent cause
could not have been foreseen nor reasonably anticipated.

In order to recover plaintiff must show some negligent
act on the part of the defendant and, also, that the accident and injury complained of were not only the natural
and probable consequence of such act claimed to be negligent, but, also, that the accident and injury were, in fact,
occasioned by such act, and, in addition, that the accident
and injury so suffered should have been foreseen and anticipated, and therefore guarded against, by a man of ordinary care and prudence.

Co., 74 Fed. Rep. 104; Choctaw Ry. v. Holloway, 191 U. S.
334, are not in conflict with the doctrine of anticipation,
and are not applicable to this case. While the question,
What is the proximate cause? is ordinarily for the jury,
where the whole evidence uffers no substantial dispute
on material points, and is of such conclusive character
that the court in an exercise of sound judicial discretion
would be compelled to set a verdict aside returned in
opposition to it, it is not only the province but the duty
of the court to direct a verdict. Guentherv. Met. R. R. Co.,

Under the particular circumstances of the case the car
was stopped in as short a distance as possible, and a jury
could not have found the facts to be otherwise. Even if
any act df omission of defendant relied upon by plaintiff
was negligence, it was not the proximate cause of the
injury.
Mr. Arthur Peter, with whom Mr. Preston B. Ray and
Mr. Julian W. Whiting were on the brief, for defendant
in error.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an action brought against the owner of a building for causing the death of the plaintiff's intestate in an
elevator in which the deceased was being carried to his
place of employment. Negligent construction and negligent management of the elevator are alleged. The plaintiff had a verdict against a request by the defendant that
one be directed for him, the judgment was affirmed by the
Court of Appeals, 37 App. D. C. 185, and the defendant
brought the case here.
The elevator car did not quite fill the well, or shaft, and
the bottom of the floor that it was approaching projected
at right angles into the well about three and one-half
inches. The car was equipped with a collapsible door,

MUNSEY v. WEBB.
231 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

which was open at the time of the accident and the boy
in charge did not have his arm across the space as he had
been instructed to do. Between the fourth and fifth floors
the deceased fell and his head was caught between the
projecting bottom of the fifth floor and the floor of the
car and was crushed. The negligence relied upon is the
leaving of the door open and failure to guard the space;
the not having a flange or piece of metal inclining from the
projecting floor to the shaft wall, and the failure to use an
emergency switch, the quickest means of stopping the
car, the boy in charge not having been instructed in the
use of it.
The plaintiff in error argued at some length that there
was no negligence, because the fall of the deceased was
something wholly out of the ordinary course and not to be
foreseen; or that, if there was negligence in any sense, it
was not the proximate cause of the death but merely a
passive condition made harmful by the fall. Neither argument can be maintained. it is true that it was not to be
anticipated specifically that a man should drop from internal causes into the open door of the car. But the possibility and the danger that in some way one in the 'car
should get some part of his person outside the car while
it was in motion was obvious and was shown to have been
anticipated by the door being there. In some circumstances at least it was a danger that ought to be and was
guarded against. It is said that the danger was manifest
only when the car was crowded, and that the door was
needed only for that. If the duty to have the car shut
on all sides had been created with reference only to conditions different in kind from those of the accident it may
be that the plaintiff could not avail himself of a requirement imposed alio intuitu. Eugene F. Moran, 212 U. S.
466, 476. But the accident was similar in kind to those
against which the door was provided, and we are not
prepared to say, contrary to the finding of the jury, that

the duty to keep it shut or to guard the space with the arm
did not exist in favor of all travellers in an elevator having
the structure that we have described. It was not necessary that the defendant should have had notice of the
particular method in which an accident would occur, if
the possibility of an accident was clear to the ordinarily
prudent eye. Washington & Georgetown R. R. Co. v.
Hickey, 166 U. S. 521, 526, 527.
If there was negligence it very properly could be found
to have been the proximate cause of the death. See
Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469.
Even if it were true that the neglect was merely a passive
omission, the deceased was invited into the elevator and
the principle of the trap cases would apply. Corby v. Hill,
4 C. B. (N. S.) 556, 563. Sweeney v. Old Colony & Newport R. R. Co., 10 Allen, 368, 374. But that is not the case.
The defendant is sued for having crushed the head of the
deceased by forces that he put in motion. He replies that
it would not have happened but for, the unforeseen fall of
the deceased without the defendant's fault, and to this
the plaintiff rejoins and the jury has found that the defendant was bound to take the easy precaution which he
had provided against any and all ways by which a passenger's body could get outside the car while it was going
up. Hayes v. Michigan Central R. R. Co., 111 U. S. 228,
241. Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf R. R. Co. v. Holloway,
191 U. S. 334, 339. The whole question comes down to
whether we are prepared to say as matter of law against
the finding of the jury that, in an elevator constructed
as this was with a special source of danger in the shaft
outside the car, to require the defendant to guard the door
space in transitu, at his peril, is too strict a rule. We cannot go so far. McDonald v. Toledo Consol. S. Ry. Co.,
74 Fed. Rep. 104, 109.
There was perhaps -evidence sufficient to warrant a
finding that there was negligence in not stopping the car

after the fall and before the harm was done, and a finding
on that ground would not open the questions that have
been discussed; but we have preferred to deal with the case
on the matters principally argued, as they seem to offer
the most obvious reasons foir the verdict, and therefore
have assumed that the jury found the facts and standard

of conduct to be as we have supposed.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 641.

Submitted November 3, 1913.-Decided November 17, 1913.

Unless the statutes of the United States control, this court follows the
state court as to whether real estate is separate or community
property.
Until the title of an entryman is completed the laws of the United
States control; but after completion the land becomes immediately
subject to state legislation. McCune v. Essig, 199 U. S. 382.
Even if the United States could impress a peculiar character upon land
within a State after parting with it, it would only be by clearly expressing it in a statute, which has not been done. Wright v. Morgan,
191 U. S. 55.
A state law that after completion of the entryman's title the property
becomes community property is not like a contract for sale to a third
party; but is consistent, and not in conflict, with the provisions of the
act of March .3, 1891, prohibiting alienation of homestead entries.
The highest court of the State of Washington having held that immediately on completion of title of an entrymaa the property becomes community property, and that on the death of the wife after
such completion her children have an interest therein, this court
follows that decision.
