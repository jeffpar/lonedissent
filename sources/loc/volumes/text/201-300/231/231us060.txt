OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK v. ERNST ET
AL., AS TRUSTEES IN BANKRUPTCY OF HUMPHREY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 446.

Argued October 20, 1913.-Decided November 3, 1913.

National City Bank v. Hotchkiss, ante, p. 50, followed to effect that
the delivery by the bankrupt of securities to a bank to secure a
clearance loan constituted an illegal preference.
This court approves the findings of the court below that the bank knew
of the impending bankruptcy when it demanded and accepted security for an existing loan.
An unusual proceeding in the banking business, such as an officer
leaving the bank and going to the customer's office and demanding
additional security for a loan made earlier the same day, indicates
knowledge of the impending bankruptcy of such customer.
A general promise to give security on demand puts the creditor in no
better position than an agreement to pay money and does not
justify a delivery of securities after knowledge of impending bankruptcy. It is an illegal preference.
A deposit made after the bank's officers !ave forbidden payment of
checks against the bankrupt's deposit account is a payment and a
preference and a set-off cannot be allowed.
200 Fed. Rep. 295, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the determination of the
question of whether the delivery of securities by a broker
immediately preceding his bankruptcy to a bank to
secure its loan was an illegar preference, are stated in
the opinion.

3ANK v. ERNST.

Argument for Appellant.

Under the agreement when the loan was made, as amplified and modified by the general custom, appellant acquired an equitable lien upon, or right in or to, the money
constituting the "day" or " clearance" loan and in or to
all securities or proceeds of whatever nature realized,
cleared or obtained possession of by the bankrupt Fiske &
Co. by the use of such loan in so far as such securities
or proceeds were or could be identified as so realized,
cleared or reduced to possession.
"A general custom is the common law itself, or a part of
it." Written contracts, by implication, incorporate custom into them. Underwoodv. Greenwich Ins. Co., 161 N. Y.

One may by express agreement create a charge or claim
in the nature of a lien on property of which he is the owner
or possessor, and equity will establish and enforce such
charge or claim not only against the party who stipulated
to give it, but also against third persons, who are either
volunteers, or who take the estate on which the lien is
agreed to be given, with notice of the stipulations. Ketchum

Appellee was entitled to set off the fifty-four thousand
dollar deposit.
The moment the checks composing that deposit were
received by appellant and passed to the credit of the
brokers the funds became appellant's property and the.
relation of debtor and creditor was created and the right
of set-off established. New York County Bank v. Massey,

The debtor must have been insolvent within the meaning of the statute, and insolvency in that sense has a

Where quotations vary enormously in a few moments,
as in "panicky" times, the law will recognize the fraction

fraction of a day is inapplicable. Upson v. Mount Morris

The payment did not enable the bank to obtain a greater
percentage of its claims than any other creditor of the

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of
Appeals reached upon the same opinion that disposed of
The National City Bank v.AHotchkiss, just decided, ante,
p. 50. (The judgment of the District Court willbe found
VOL. CCXXXI-5

in 200 Fed. Rep. 295.) This case arose at the same time
and differs but little from that in its facts, as to which, as
in the other case, the master, the District Court and the
Circuit Court of Appeals all agree.
The advance in this case was made at about ten on the
following note to the firm signing it "Please loan us today
$400000. Crediting this amount to our account and oblige.
J. M. Fiske & Company." This sum was credited on the
firm's deposit account, on which there was already
$36,239.47. Before noon the bank certified and afterwards
paid checks for $276,679.67. Between 11 and 12 the
cashier, hearing that there was trouble in the stock market
and with J. M. Fiske & Co., ordered that no more checks
should be paid or certified. He then went to the brokers'
office; saw Mr. Sherwood, a member of the firm, at about
twelve and after getting an evasive answer to an inquiry as to the rumor, said that the firm had made no
deposits on that day, and was told that one was on its
way. ($54,048.08 were in fact paid in after the cashier's
order to stop payment.) He then told Mr. Sherwood that
he had better give him some securities, that he ought to
give additional securities on the bank's loans, and after
consultation Mr. Sherwood did so and the cashier returned
to the bank. We may assume for purposes of decision
that the securities with a small exception were obtained by
the use of the clearance loan.
At forty minutes after twelve the brokers gave notice
to the stock exchange that they were unable to meet their
obligations and an involuntary petition in bankruptcy
was filed against them at twenty-five minutes past three.
This suit is for the proceeds of the securities, (which were
sold by the bank), and for the sum deposited as we have
stated. In view of our decision in the other case only one
or two matters need mention. It is somewhat more pressed
that the bank had not reasonable ground to believe that
the brokers' property at a fair valuation would be in-

MECHANICS' BANK v. ERNST.
231 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

sufficient to pay their debts, and therefore had not ground
to believe that the brokers were insolvent within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, § 1 (15),
30 Stat. 544. We think it too plain to need argument that
the findings below that the firm was insolvent, knew that
it was insolvent and intended a preference, were correct.
These brokers were ruined by the collapse of the pool
mentioned in the other case, and apart from any knowledge
that the bank may have had as to their interest in the
stock concerned, the entirely unusual course of the cashier
in leaving his bank to get additional security (not merely
proceeds of the clearance loan upon a claim of lien) and
the circumstances are sufficient to prevent our going behind
the findings below. Really no other conclusion could have
been reached.
On the question of lien the evidence does not differ
enough from that in the other case to need further discussion. The bankrupts were under an agreement with
the bank, of the usual sort, giving the bank a general
lien on all securities in its hands for all liabilities of the
firm and a right to require additional approved securities
to be lodged with it, &c. But a general promise to give
security on demand puts the creditor in no better position
than an agreement to pay money. Sexton v. Kessler, 225
U. S. 90, 98.
The so-called deposit of $54,048.08 was paid in after
the cashier had forbidden the payment of checks against
the deposit account and therefore rightly was held to be
a payment and a preference. A set-off properly was denied.
Decree affirmed.
