it could not have been produced before the Commission
by the exercise of reasonable diligence.
It thus appears that the two proceedings, though they
were conducted at the same time, were. distinct in their
nature. The one resulted.in a legislative rule for the
future; in the other, there was an award of specific sums
of money to particular persons upon the basis of past
transactions and this award, according to the provisions
of the statute, on being filed could be enforced by proceedings in the courts of the State. The persons in whose
favor the award was made were not parties to the suit,
and we think that the court was right in declining to determine its validity.

PANY v. BEAUCHAMP.
ERROR TO -THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

No. 54.

Submitted November 3, 1913.--Decided December 1, 1913.'

A State is entitled to prohibit the employment of persons of tender
years in dangerous occupations; and in order to make the prohibition
effective it may compel employers at their peril to ascertain whether
their employ~s are in fact below the age specified.
Absolute requirements as to ascertaining age of employ~s of tender
years are a proper exercise of the protective power of government;
and if the legislation has reasonable relation to the purpose which
the State is entitled to effect it is not an unconstitutional deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law.
A classification in employment of labor of persons below sixteen years
of age is reasonable and does not deny equal protection of the laws.
The provisions of the Child Labor Act of Illinois of 1903 involved in
this case are not unconstitutional as denying due process of law, as

depriving the employer of liberty of contract, or of his property by
requiring him at his peril to ascertain the age of the person employed,
or as denying him the equal protection of the law.

Act of 1903, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. George E. Gorman and Mr. John M. Pollock for
defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of the court.

The Sturges and Burn Manufacturing Company is a
corporation engaged in manufacturing tinware and other
metal products. It employed Arthur Beauchamp, the
defendant in error, who was under sixteen years of age,
as a press hand to operate a punch press used in stamping
sheet metal. Beauchamp was injured in operating the
press and brought an action through his next friend,
in the Superior Court of Cook County, to recover the
damages sustained, cou. iting on the statute of Illinois
passed in 1903 (Laws of 1903, p. 187, Hurd's Statutes,
1909, p. 1082) which, by § 11, prohibited the employment
of children under the age of sixteen years in various
hazardous occupations including that in which the injury
occurred. The trial court, refusing to direct a verdict
for the defendant, instructed the jury that if the plaintiff
was in fact less than sixteen years old and when injured

Opinion of the Court.

was employed by the defendant upon a stamping machine,
the defendant was guilty of a violation of the statute
and the plaintiff was entitled to recover. A verdict was
rendered for the plaintiff and judgment thereon was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 250 Illinois,
303. The case comes here on error.
The plaintiff in error complains of the ruling that a
violation of the statute gives a right of action to the employ6 in'case of his injury, but this is a question of state
law with which we are not concerned.
The Federal question presented is whether the statute
as construed by the state court contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment. It cannot be doubted that the State
was entitled to prohibit the employment of persons of
tender years in dangerous occupations. Holden v. Hardy,
169 U. S. 366, 392, 395; Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197
U. S. 11, 31; Muller v. Oregon, 208 U. S. 412, 421; Chicago,
Burlington & Quincy R.. R. Co. v. McGuire, 219 U. S.
549, 568, 569. - It is urged that the plaintiff in error was
not permitted to defend upon the ground that it acted
in good faith relying upon the representation made by
Beauchamp that he was over sixteen. It is said that,
being over fourteen, he at Least had attained the age at
which he should have been treated as responsible for his
statements. But, as it was competent for the State in
securing the safety of the young to prohibit such employment altogether, it could select means appropriate to
make its prohibition effective and could compel employers,
at their peril, to ascertain whether those they employed
were in fact under the age specified. The imposition of
absolute requirements of this sort is a familiar exercise
of the protective power of government. Reg. v. Prince,
L. R. 2 C. C. 154; People v. Werner, 174 N. Y. 132; State v.
Kinkead, 57 Connecticut, 173; Ulrich v. Commonwealth,

effect, it is not open to constitutional objection as a deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law.
Shevlin-CarpenterCo. v. Minnesota, 218 U. S. 57, 70.
It is also contended that the statute denied to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws, but the classification it established was clearly within the legislative
power. Heath & Milligan Co. v. Worst, 207 U. S. 338,,

UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 419.

Argued October 22, 1913.-Decided December 1, 1913.

While the act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505, broadened the
general jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, it was not repugnant to,
or inconsistent with, the limitations of § 1066, Rev. Stat., expressly
excluding from such jurisdiction all claims growing out of treaty
stipulations, and it did not, therefore, repeal that section.
Claims based on treaty stipulations within § 1066, Rev. Stat., include
those which arise solely as the result of cession of territory to the
United States.
The policy and spirit of a statute should be considered in construing it
as well as the letter.
