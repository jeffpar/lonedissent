APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

Nos. 935, 936, 937, 938.

Submitted April 13, 1925.-Decided May
25, 1925.

An order made by a United States Commissioner, after hearing, in a
removal proceeding (R. S. 1014), discharging the defendant for
want of probable cause, may be persuasive but it is not controlling
upon a like application made later in the same district to the District Judge. P. 393.

APPEALS from judgments of the District Court quashing

Mllessrs. Herbert Pope,Frank E. Harkness and Benjamin

Morse v. United States, 267 U. S. 80 decided only that a
discharge in removal proceedings did not preclude an arrest in the jurisdiction where the indictment was returned
and a trial on the indictment, and expressly recognized
that the effect of such a discharge in subsequent removal
proceedings presented a different question.
The passing remark in United States v. Haas, 167 Fed.
211, to the effect that "the decision of a committing magistrate refusing to hold a prisoner for trial or removal
...is not res adjudicata" was not necessary to the de-

cision and is entitled to little weight. The report shows
that counsel for the defense admitted that a decision of
a committing magistrate in removal proceedings was not

"technically res adjudicata" and therefore the question
was not in .controversy. Moreover, the authorities cited
in the opinion have nothing to do with removal proceedings, but deal only with preliminary examinations before
committing magistrates where the question was whether
an accused should be held for a crime committed in the
jurisdiction where the arrest took place. The court appears to have jumped to the conclusion that because a
decision in such a proceeding was not res judicata, a
decision of an examining magistrate in a removal proceeding could not be res judicata. But the distinction between the two proceedings is fundamental. This court
has often held that in the class of cases first mentioned the
preliminary hearing can be entirely dispensed with without violating any constitutional right of the accused.
Goldsby v. United States, 160 U. S. 70; Lent Woon v.
Oregon, 229 U. S. 586; Ocampo v. United States, 234

U. S. 91. But in Tinsley v. Treat, 205 U. S. 20, this
court squarely held that when a proceeding was brought
under ยง 1014 with a view to removing the accused to
another district, a preliminary hearing was a constitutional right of the accused and that the exclusion of evidence in rebuttal of the accusation was a violation of the
Constitution. It is, we submit, impossible to reconcile
this decision with the view advocated by the Government
that an order of discharge in a removal proceeding is not
only not technically res judicata but is a mere idle gesture
having no legal consequence, since it may be immediately
nullified by a new warrant and another arrest. In re
Wood, 95 Fed. 288.
Where an issue has been judicially determined, whether
that adjudication is technically res judicata or not, there
is a well settled rule that another judicial tribunal exer-

cising concurrent jurisdiction has no power to retry or
redetermine the same issue unless there is a showing of
arbit.rary action or exceptional impropriety in the judicial conduct of the first trial or hearing. United States
v. Oppenheimer, 242 U. S. 85; Johnson Company v.
Wharton, 152 U. S. 252; New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank,
167 U. S. 371; Lane v. Watts, 234 U. S. 525; Noble v. Union

States v. Yeung Chu Keng, 140 Fed. 748; Ex parte Wong
Yee Toon, 227 Fed. 247.
Decisions on the effect of a discharge in a habeas
corpus proceeding have a distinct bearing upon the question here involved. Even where the accused has been
remanded this court has indicated that in many circumstances the prior decision remanding the accused should
be given controlling weight. Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U. S.
224; Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U. S. 239.
There are particular reasons why the general rule as
to the effect of ,a former adjudication should be held to
apply to removal cases under ยง 1014 where the defendant
has been discharged after a full hearing. As we have
already pointed out, the right to a hearing is firmly based
upon the Constitution itself and any infringement of
that right is not mere error but a violation of the constitutional rights of the accused. Harlan v. McGourin,
218 U. S. 442.

porations, for a violation of the Sherman Act. Proceed-*
ings were brought under ยง 1014 R. S. before a United
States commissioner to remove them from Illinois to the
trial district in Ohio.' After a.hearing the commissioner
ordered their discharge for want of probable cause. Subsequently, similar proceedings were instituted -before a
federal district judge of the Illinois district, and appellants were taken into custody by the United States
marshaf upon a warrant issued by the district judge.
Thereupon, in advance of a hearing, they sued out writs
of habeas corpis in the court below seeking to be discharged' upon the ground 'that the proceedings before the
district judge-were without authority of law and in violation of their constitutional and statutory rights. The
specific ground relied upon was tl~at their discharge by
the commissioner for want of probable cause after a
hearing was an adjudication upon that question and a
bar to a second proceeding. The court below held otherwise and entered orders quashing, the .writs. 3 Fed. Rep.
(2d) 8i6. The Government has moved this Court to
dismiss the appeals or affirm'the judgments for lack of
substance and on-the groundthat the appeals were taken
solely for delay. The motion to affirm must be sustained.
Under state law it has uniformly been held that the
discharge of an accused person upon a preliminary examination for want of probable cause c nstitutes no barto
a subsequent preliminary examination before another'
magistrate. Such an examination is not a trial in .any
sense and does not operate to put the defendant -in
jeopardy. Marston v. Jenness, 11 N. I. 156, 161-162;
