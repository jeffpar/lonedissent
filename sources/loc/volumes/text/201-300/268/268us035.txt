Statement of the Case.

driven into the bottom of the river and attached in that
way only to the land, they were completely surrounded
by navigable water and were used exclusively as aids to
navigation. We think injuries to them by a ship come
fairly within the principle approved by The Blackheath,
195 U. S. 361, and The Raithmoor, 241 U. S. 166. -See
Hughes on Admiralty, 2d ed., § 100.
The District Court erred in denying jurisdiction, and
its decree must be reversed.

THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD v. THE
CITY OF PARKERSBURG.
APPEAL FROM AND CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.,
No. 305. Argued March 19, 1925.-Decided April 13, 1925.
1. This Court has not jurisdiction of an appeal from the Circuit
Court of Appeals where the jurisdiction of the District Court was
invoked solely on the ground of diversity of citizenship. P. 36.
2. A Maryland railway corporation, having purchased at foreclosure
the property and franchise of a West Virginia corporation, declaring, pursuant to West Virginia statutes, that it "would become
a corporation as to said property" by the name of the West
Virginia corporation, and having become also the sole stockholder
of the latter, sued a West Virginia municipality to enforce an
alleged exemption of the property from taxes. Held, that the
District Court had no jurisdiction, whether the plaintiff were
treated as in effect the West Virginia corporation, suing as property owner, or as the Maryland corporation suing as stockholder,
since in the latter case the West Virginia corporation would be an
iidispensable party plaintiff, and in either case diversity of citizenship would be lacking. P. 38.

REVIEW of a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals
which reversed a decree of the District Court in favor of
the Railroad in a suit to enjoin the City from levying
taxes on certain railroad property. The writ of certiorari
was granted.

Opinion of the Court.

268 U. S.

Mr. Frank T. Nesbit, with whom Messrs. James W.
Vandervort and Mason G. Ambler were on the briefs,
for appellant.
Messrs. R. B. McDougle and F. P. Moats, for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE BRA.NDEIS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This suit was commenced in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of West Virginia in 1894.
The plaintiff is the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, alleged
to be a Maryland corporation; the defendant is the City
of Parkersburg, a West Virginia corporation. The relief
sought was to enjoin the levying of taxes assessed upon
certain railroad property. The federal jurisdiction was
invoked solely on the ground of diversity of citizenship.
A temporary injunction issued -upon the filing of the bill.
In 1895, the case was heard upon demurrer to the bill and
upon a motion to dissolve the injunction. In 1897, a
decree was entered, which overruled the demurrer, but
made no order respecting the injunction. Within 30 days
thereafter an answer was filed by leave. Then the cause
stood without further action for 23 years. In 1921 activities were resumed leisurely. In 1923, upon demurrers
and motions, the District Court for the Northern District
of West Virginia (to which the case had been transferred

pursuant to § 290 of the Judicial Code) entered a final
decree for the plaintiff. The decree was reversed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. 296 Fed. 74. The railroad
appealed to this Court. It also filed a petition for a writ
of certiorari, consideration of which was postponed until
the hearing on the appeal.
The decision in both lower courts was rendered on the
merits. These we have no occasion to consider. There
is no right of appeal to this Court, because the jurisdiction of the trial court was invoked solely on the ground

of diversity of citizenship. Judicial Code, § 128. The
writ of certiorari is granted. But, as the bill does not
show that the trial court had jurisdiction of the controversy, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be
reversed with directions to remand the cause to the District Court.
The claim asserted by the bill is this. In 1855, the
Northwestern Virginia Railroad Company, a corporation
organized under the laws of Virginia, acquired from the
Town of Parkersburg an exemption from, or commutation of, municipal taxes on certain property within its
limits. In 1863, the railroad and the municipality became domestic corporations of West Virginia, upon the
organization of that State. In 1865 the property and
franchises of the railroad were purchased by the Baltimore & Ohio at a foreclosure sale. Pursuant to the statutes of West Virginia then in force, the Baltimore & Ohio
declared "that it would become a corporation as to said
property, by the name of the Parkersburg Branch Railroad Company." The immunity from taxation asserted
in the bill was claimed as an incident of the property acquired on foreclosure, and also as having been conferred
by ordinances adopted, and contracts made with the Parkersburg Branch Railroad. The levy seems to have been
made upon property of that company. It was a West
Virginia corporation.' The bill sought to enforce its
right. The capacity in which the Baltimore & Ohio sued
to enforce the right to immunity was not stated clearly in
the bill. Apparently it sued either in its capacity as

owner (sole stockhblder) of the West Virginia corporation
or on the theory that, as to the property purchased on
forclosure, it became itself the Parkersburg Branch Railroad Company. In neither view did the trial court have
jurisdiction of the controversy.
If the plaintiff sued as the corporate owner of the
property, that is, as the Parkersburg Branch Railroad
Company, but under the name of the Baltimore & Ohio,
the trial court was without jurisdiction as a federal court,
because both the Branch Railroad and the defendant were
West Virginia corporations, and hence th6 controversy
was wholly between citizens of the same State. If the
1 altimore & Ohio sued as the Maryland corporation,
owner of all the stock in the Parkersburg Branch Railroad Company, the trial court was without jurisdiction
of the controversy, because the latter corporation, an indispensable party plaintiff, was not joined. Compare
Davenport v. Dows, 18 Wall. 626. And it could not have
been joined. Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders
Union, 254 U. S. 77. For then one of the plaintiffs would
have been a citizen of West Virginia; there would no
longer have been complete diversity of citizenship; and
the jurisdiction of the trial court would have been ousted.
So far as appears, the Branch Railroad was neither
merged in, nor consolidated with, the Baltimore & Ohio:
Nor was there a compulsory domestication of the latter
in West Virginia. Martin'&Administrator v. Baltimore
& Ohio R. R., 151 U. S.673. We have, therefore, no occasion to consider the questions involved in St. Louis &
San Francisco v. James, 161 U. S. 545; Louisville, New
Albany & Chicago Ry. v. Louisville Trust Co., 174 U. S.
552; Southern Ry. v. Allison, 190 U. S.326, 337; Missouri
Pacific Ry. v. Castle, 224 U. S. 541. Compare Memphis
& Charleston R. R. v. Alabama, 107 U. S.581; Patch v.
Wabash R. R., 207 U. S. 277.
It would seem that the District Court must, upon the
remand of the case to it, enter a decree of dismissal. But,
