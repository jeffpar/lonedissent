General, with whom the Solicitor General and Mr. Nelson

T. Hartsonwere on the brief, for plaintiff in error.

Plaintiff, a New Jersey corporation, owns and operates
a railroad in Cuba.

In March, 1917, it made return of its

income for 1916; and, in due time, paid the tax assessed

on the basis of its return. Plaintiff had receiVed in 1911
to 1916, inclusie, subsidy payments from the Republic
of Cuba, amounting in all to $1,696,216.20, but did riot
report any part of them as taxable income. January 1,
1918, the Commissioner of Intefial Reveihe assiessed
against plaintiff for 1916 an additional tax of $33,924.32,
being two per cent.-the rate prescribed in the Revenue
Act of 1916, (Act 6f September 8, 1916, c: 463, 39 Stat.
456)-on the total Of such panihents. Ndtithstanding
its bbjection that the assessmeiit was without authority
of law, plaintiff was required t6 pay the tix. It applied
for refund. The commissioner adhered to the view that
the amounts so receiied constituted incomb, but held that
the payments were taxable ii, the years when received.
Prior to the act of 1916, the tax rate was one per cent.
There was repaid to plaintiff one per cent. on the paymeits made before that ye6r, but its aplication was
denied as to the balance, $20;239.18. This action was
brought to recover that amoifnit with int~iest. The complaint alleged that the subsidy payments Were not income
within the meaning of the Sixteenth Ahendment. Defendant moved to dismiss the case on th6 ground that the
complaint failed to state a bause of action. The court
denied the motion and gave judgment for plaintiff. Defendant brought the case here on writ of error. ยง 238,
Judicial Code.
An act of the Congress of the Republic of Cuba of July
5, 1906, authorized the President to contract with one or
more companies for the construction and operation of certain lines of railroad on designated routes between places
specified. The Republic granted a subsidy up to $6,000
per kilometer, payable in six annual instalments, to the
companies constructing and maintaining in use the specified lines. Any company having such a contract was entitled to receive subsidies for that part of the railroad constructed after the passage of the act, as well as for the

part constructed after the making of the contract. March
25, 1909, the President of the Republic and the plaintiff
made a contract, by which the latter agreed, in consideration of $6,000 per kilometer to be paid by the Republic
as specified in the law of 1906, to construct and operate a
railroad on the routes and between the places specified.
And the plaintiff agreed to reduce by one-third the tariffs
then in force for the transportation of permanent employees and troops of the government, and, in case of war
or any disturbance of the public order, to transport troops
in special trains at the rate of one cent per man per kilometer; and also agreed to reduce the fares for all first-class
passengers. The entire line covered by this contract was
completed in 1911. The subsidy payments amounted in
all to $1,642,216.20, about one-third of the cost of the
railroad.
An act of June 1, 1914, added to the law of 1906 an
article which provided that the subsidy per kilometer for
the construction of a railroad from Casilda to Placetas
del Sur should be 6,000 pesos for a part and 12,000 pesos
for the rest of the distance. June 30, 1915, in accordance
with that act, the Presiden-t of the Republic and plaintiff
made a contract for the construction of the railroad. It
bound the company to carry public correspondence free of
charge on the lines of this railroad, to carry small produce
for 50 per cent. of the tariff, and to allow telegraph and
telephone stations to be established by the government
alongside the railroad. And there was handed over to the
plaintiff certain land, buildings, construction and equipment then in the possession of the State, which theretofore had been acquired and built in an earlier effort to
complete that line. The subsidy payment in 1916 was
$54,000.
All the subsidy payments under both contracts were
credited to a suspense account and, June 30, 1916, were
transferred to the surplus account, and were used for

capital expenditures. The cost of construction as carried
on the books was not reduced by such payments.
The power given Congress by the Sixteenth Amendment is to "lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived." Defendant insists that the subsidy
payment made in 1916 was taxable under the Revenue
Act of 1916, which imposes an annual tax of two percentum "upon the total net income received
from all sources by every corporation" (c. 463, 39 Stat.
765); that the payments made in 1913, 1914 and 1915
were taxable under the Income Tax Law of October 3,
1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 172, which imposes an annual tax
of one per centum "upon the entire net income arising or
accruing from all sources . . . to every corporation ",
and that the payments made in 1911 and 1912 were taxable under the Corporation Excise Tax Law of August 5,
1909, ยง 38, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112, which provides that
"every corporation . . . shall be subject to pay annually a special excise tax with respect to the carrying
on or doing business by such corporation
equivalent to one per centum upon the entire net infrom all sources." Defendant insists that
.
come
the subsidies were merely payments in advance on account
of transportation service, later to be performed by the
plaintiff for the government, and therefore are to be
deemed income and taxable as such.
In respect of these subsidy payments, the meaning of
"income" as used in the Corporation Excise Tax Law of
1909 is not to be distinguished from the meaning of the
same word as used in the Income Tax Law of 1913 and
the Revenue Act of 1916. Merchants' Loan & Trust Co.
v. Smietanka, 255 U. S. 509, 518-519.
The Sixteenth Amendment, like other laws authorizing
or imposing taxes, is to be taken as written and is not to
be extended beyond the meaning clearly indicated by the
language used. The Cuban laws and contracts are similar

to legislation and arrangements for the promotion of railroad construction which have been well known in the
United States for more than half a century. Such aids,
gifts and grants from the government, subordinate political subdivisions or private sources,-whether of land,
other property, credit or money,-in order to induce construction and operation of railroads for the service of the
public are not given as mere gratuities. Burke v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., 234 U. S. 669, 679; Louisville &
Nashville R. R. v. United States, 267 U. S. 395. Usually
they are given to promote settlement and to provide for
the development of the resources in the territory to be
served. The things so sought to be attained in the public
interest are numerous and varied. There is no support
for the view that the Cuban Government gave the subsidy
payments, lands, buildings, railroad construction and
equipment merely to obtain the specified concessions in
respect of rates for government transportation. Other
rates were considered. By the first contract, plaintiff
agreed to reduce fares for first class passengers and by the
second, it agreed to reduce the rates on small produce.
Clearly, the value of the lands and other physical property
handed over to aid plaintiff in the completion of the railroad from Casilda to Placetas del Sur was not taxable
income. These were to be used directly to complete the
undertaking. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue in
levying the tax did not include their value as income, and
defendant does not claim that it was income. Relying
on the contract for partial reimbursement, plaintiff found
the money necessary to construct the railroad. The subsidy payments were proportionate to mileage completed;
and this indicates a purpose to reimburse plaintiff for
capital expenditures. All-the physical properties and
the money subsidies-were given for the same purposes.
It cannot reasonably be held that one was contribution
to capital assets, and that the other was profit, gain or
