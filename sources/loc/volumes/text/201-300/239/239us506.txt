this has been the practice. See, e. g. Win. W. Bierce, Ltd.,
v. Hutchins, 205 U. S. 340. Whether or not the incidental
assumption in that decision that an appeal would lie was
correct, we are of opinion that the proceeding by writ of
error was justified by the plain meaning of § 246. So far
as the policy of Congress might permit, (see Act of
March 3, 1915, c. 90, § 274b, 38 Stat. 956,) we should be
disposed to be a little astute to save a party's rights from
being lost through mistakes upon a technical matter in the
somewhat confused condition of the statutes. But we cannot doubt that 'the path adopted was right.
Judgment affirmed.

HALLOWELL v. COMMONS, ACTING INDIAN
AGENT.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 135. Submitted December 15, 1915.-Decided January 10, 1916.
Under the act of June 25, 1910, the Secretary of the Interior has power
to ascertain the legal heirs of an allottee Omaha Indian dying during
the period in which an allotment made to him under the act of
August 7, 1882, was held in trust, and the decision of the Secretary
is final and conclusive.
Congress, by the act of June 25, 1910, restored to the Secretary of the
Interior the power taken from him by the Acts of 1894 and 1901 to
determine the heirs of allottee Indians dying during the trust period,
making his jurisdiction exclusive with no exceptions for pending
litigation.
The rule that the repeal of a statute does not extinguish liability incurred thereunder held, not applicable to the statute in this case
which simply changes the tribunal to hear the case and takes away
no substantive rights.
Congress in its plenary control of Indians has power to pass the act

Opinion of the Court.

of June 25, 1910, vesting in the Secretary of the Interior the determination of heirs of allottee Indians dying within the trust period;
the act evinces a change of policy on the part of Congress, and its
opinion as to the better manner in which the rights of the Indians
can be preserved.
Even though the District Court may have had jurisdiction of a suit to
determine the heirs of an allottee Omaha Indian who died during
the trust period when this suit was commenced, it has no jurisdiction
since the passage of the act of June 25, 1910, vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Secretary of the Interior to ascertain such heirs.
210 Fed. Rep. 793, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court of the United States of a suit affecting title to an
allotment made under the Act of August 7, 1882, to a
member of the Omaha Tribe of Indians, are stated in the
opinion.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Knaebel for appellant.
Mr. Hiram Chase and Mr. William Ross King for
appellees.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a bill to establish the equitable title of the plaintiff to an allotment made to Jacob Hallowell, deceased, a
member of the Omaha Tribe, in accordance with §§ 5, 6,
of the act of August 7, 1882, c. 434, 22 Stat. 341. The
patent to Jacob Hallowell followed the language of § 6
and declared that the United States would hold his land
for the period of 25 years in trust for :the sole use of the
allottee, 'or in case of his decease, of his heirs according
to the laws of the State of Nebraska.' The plaintiff says
that he is the sole heir as against various other claims
set forth in the bill. We do not go into further particulars
as we are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals
was right in holding that the District Court had no

jurisdiction of the case. 210 Fed. Rep. 793. 127 C. C. A.
.343.
It is unnecessary to consider whether there was jurisdiction when the suit was begun.' By the act of June 25,
1910, c. 431, 36 Stat. 855, it was provided that in a case
like this of the death of the allottee intestate during the
trust period the Secretary of the Interior should ascertain
the legal heirs of the decedent and his decision should be
final and conclusive; with considerable discretion as to
details. This act restored to the Secretary the power
that had been taken "from him by acts of 1894 and February 6, 1901, c. 217, 31 Stat. 760. McKay v. Kalyton,
204 U. S. 458, 468. It made his jurisdiction exclusive in
terms, it made no exception for pending litigation, but
purported to be universal and so to take away the jurisdiction that for a time had been conferred upon the courts
of the United States. The appellee contends for a different
construction on the strength of Rev. Stats., § 13, tha .
the repeal of any statute shall not extinguish any liability
incurred under it, Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, 216,
and refers to the decisions upon the statutes concerning
suits upon certain bonds given to the United States.
United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States,
209 U. S. 306. But apart from a question that we have
passed, whether the plaintiff even attempted to rely upon
the statutes giving jurisdiction to the courts in allotment
cases, the reference of the matter to the Secretary, unlike
the changes with regard to suits upon bonds, takes away
no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that
is to hear the case. In doing so it evinces a change of
policy, and an opinion that the rights of the Indians can
be better preserved by the quasi-paternal supervision of
the general head of Indian affairs. The consideration
applies with the same force to all cases and was embodied
in a statute thAt no doubt was intended to apply to all,
so far as construction is concerned.

HALLOWELL v. COMMONS.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

There is equally little doubt as to the power of Congress
to pass the act so construed. We presume that no one
would question it if the suit had not been begun. It is
a strong proposition that bringing this bill intensified,
strengthened or enlarged the plaintiff's rights, as suggested in De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 1, 199, 200. See
Simmons v. Hanover, 40 Pick. 188, 193, 194. Hepburn v.
Curts, 7 Watts, 300. Welch v. Wadsworth, 30 Connecticut,
149, 154. Atwood v. Buckingham, 78 Connecticut, 423.
The difficulty in applying such a proposition to the control
of Congress over the jurisdiction of courts of its own creation is especially obvious. See Bird v. United States, 187
U. S. 118, 124. In any event the rights of the Indians in
this matter remained subject to such control on principles
that have been illustrated in many ways. See Tiger v.
Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286; Hallowell v. United
States, 221 U. S. 317.
The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this
case is in accord with such earlier decisions as we have
seen. Bond v. United .States,181 Fed. Rep. 613; Pel-atayakot v. United States, 188 Fed. Rep. 387; Parrv. Colfax,
197 Fed. Rep. 302.
