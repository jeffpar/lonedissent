PHOENIX RY. v. GEARY.
239 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

PHOENIX RAILWAY COMPANY v. GEARY ET
AL., CORPORATION COMMISSION OF ARIZONA.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA.
No. 48. Submitted October 29, 1915.-Decided November 29, 1915.
The Federal court has jurisdiction of a suit by a rilway company
against members of a state railroad conmission to enjoin the enforcement of an order made by them which deprives the railway
company of its property without due process of law.
A temporary injunction should not be granted under § 266, Jud. Code,
in a suit to enjoin the enforcement of an order of a state railroad
commission unless the bill of complaint and supporting affidavits,
taken in view of the rebutting affidavits filed by defendant, make a
clear case of unreasonable, arbitrary or confiscatory action on the
part of the commission.
The presumption of reasonableness, existing ii favor of action of a
governmental agency, not having been overcome by the showing
made upon the application therefor, the court below rightly denied
the interlocutory injunction in this case.
Where, as is the case with the articles of the constitution and laws of
Arizona relating to public utility corporations, the penalty provisions are clearly separable from the order of the commission and the
constitutional and statutory authority therefor, this court will not,
in advance of an attempt to enforce the penalties, determine whether
such penalties are so excessive and severe as to amount to denial of
due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
In this case an order denying an interlocutory, injunction to restrain
an order of the corporation commission of Arizona requiring a
railroad company to double track a portion of its line is affirmed
without prejudice to the court below dealing with the question of
penalties.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under

the Fourteenth Amendment of certain provisions of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Argument for Appellant.

239 U. S.

statute of Arizona creating the Corporation Commission
of that State and of an order made by such Commission,
are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Louis H. Chalmers, Mr. EdwardKent, Mr. Floyd M.
Stahl, Mr. Alexander Britton, Mr. Evans Browne and
Mr. F. W. Clements for appellant:
The lower court had jurisdiction.
The case presented to the lower court made necessary
the issuance of an interlocutory injunction.
Irreparable damage to the appellant was certain to
result because of a denial of its application for an interlocutory injunction.
The order of the Arizona Corporation Commission
sought to be enjoined was beyond the power of the Commission.
The order of the Arizona Corporation Commission was
shown to be unreasonable and unnecessary and therefore
violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
In view of the relative degree of injury to the respective
parties by the granting or refusal of the interlocutory
injunction prayed for, the showing of the appellant presented to the lower court required the issuance of the
injunction pendente lite.

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
In June, 1913, the Corporation Commission of the State
of Arizona made an order directing appellant ' to doubletrack its line of street railway on West Washington Street
in the City of Phoenix, in that State, between Seventh
and Seventeenth Avenues, a distance of ten blocks; the
work to be commenced within 30 days from the date of
the order and completed on or before September 1. By a
subsequent order the time for completion was extended
until December 1, 1913. Having unsuccessfully, applied
to the Commission for a rehearing, appellant filed its
present bill of complaint in the United States District
Court, praying that the Commission's order be declared
null and void as in contravention of the Constitution of
the United States, and that the defendants (who include'
the members of the Corporation Commission, the Attorney General of the State, and the County Attorney), be
enjoined from enforcing or attempting to enforce it by

suit, prosecution, or other proceeding, and from instituting
any proceeding for tile recovery of fines or penalties for
any violation of or refusal to obey it; the grounAd of complaint being that the order was unjust, and unreasonable
because the service already rendered upon Washington.
Street by appellant was adequate and efficient; that the
construction of a double track was not required by the
needs of the public; that appellant's operating expenses
exceeded its reventles, and that it was unable to make the
additional expenditure of about $14,000 required for the
double-tracking; and that compliance with the order
would prevent appellant from making an adequate return,
or any return at all, upon the value of its property. The
bill further set up that under the constitution and statutes
of Arizona complainant was required, under severe penalties, to put the order into effect, and to keep it in effect
until modified or abrogated, and that while a right to
review, the reasonableness and lawfulness of the order in a
state court was given by statute, the court was prohibited
from issuing any injunction or restraining order until
after the final determination of the matter, and in the
meantime the order would be in full force and effect and
must be obeyed, under heavy penalties for each day's
continuance of the violation; and it was alleged that these
statutory and constitutional provisions were adopted for
the purpose of compelling acquiescence in any order made
by the Corporation Commission and preventing a resort
to the courts to test the reasonableness, justness, and
validity thereof, and thus had the effect of depriving complainant of its property without due process of law and
denying to it the equal protection of the laws, in violation
,of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Upon the filing of the bill, with accompanying affidavits,
a temporary restraining order, was granted, and a hearing
of the application for interlocutory injunction was thereafter had before three judges under the provisions of

PHOENIX RY. v. GEARY.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

§ 266, Jud. Code, Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat.
1087, 1162. The court held (209 Fed. Rep. 694) that
complainant's showing as to the alleged unreasonableness
of the Commission's order was not sufficiently strong to
warrant an injunction to restrain its enforcement pendente
lite, but the temporary restraining order was continued in
force pending the present appeal, taken direct to this
court under the cited section of the code.
The jurisdiction of a Federal court of equity over the
subject-matter is of course well settled. Ex parte Young,
209 U. S. 123, 144; The Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S.
352, 380; Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 213
U. S. 175, 190; Louis. & Nash. R. R. Co. v. Garrett, 231
U. S. 298, 303.
The sole question raised is whether the bill of complaint
and supporting affidavits, in view of the rebutting affidavits filed by the appellees, made so clear a case of unreasonable, arbitrary, or confiscatory action on the part
of the Corporation Commission as to call for an interlocutory injunction. The attempt was to show that there
was no reasonable necessity for the Commission's order,
in' view of the character of the community to be served,
the amount of traffic over the line, the financial condition
of complainant, the nature and extent of the service already rendered and capable of being rendered with the
existing facilities, and the advantage to accrue to the
public as compared with the expenditures to be sustained
by complainant in complying with the order. But the
facts and the inferences were much in dispute. Complainant is not required to open up new territory, but
only to give better service upon a street already occupied
by it under q public franchise. Its line of railway on
Washington Street is already double-tracked for a distance of 14 blocks in the business section of the city. The
10 blocks now required to be double-tracked lie between
the business section and the state Capitol, where are

located the offices of the governor, the assembly chambers
of the state legislature, the court room of the supreme
court of the State and the chambers of the judges, the
law library of the State, and the offices of the secretary of
state, the attorney general, the corporation commission,
and other state officials. On the line is located a public
library and a park, both much frequented, while in the
vicinity of the state Capitol there is an estimated population of from 1,200 to 1,500, the city as a whole having an
estimated population of 25,000.

There is abundant evi-

dence of substantial inconvenience to the public owing
to the fact that there is but a single track with one turnout between Seventh and Seventeenth Avenues, and some
evidence tending to create an inference that the revenues
of the company would be materially increased by the
double-tracking. The Commission's order appears to have
been made after full hearing and investigation respecting
these matters.

And, upon the whole, we agree with the

court below that the presumption of reasonableness existing in favor of the action of the Commission was not overcome in the showing that was made upon the application
for an injunction.
The penalty provisions, except as a ground for invoking
the jurisdiction of a Federal court in equity, are not relied
upon by appellant. They are contained in certain sections
of the constitution and statutes of Arizona applicable to
public service corporations. Constitution, Art. XV, §§ 16
and 17; Public Service Corporation Act, Laws 1912, ch. 90,
§§ 65, 68, 74 a & b, 76, 77, 79, 81; Rev. Stat. 1913, §§ 2341,
2344, 2350 a & b, 2352, 2353, 2355, 2357. They are clearly
separable from the order of the Commission and the
constitutional and statutory provisions under which it was
made. Constitution, Art. XV, § 5; Public Service Corporation Act, Laws 1912, ch. 90, § 36; Rev. Stat. 1913,
§ 2312.
Therefore, in advance of an attempt to enforce the pen-

The court below expressed the view that the cause
should be retained in order to restrain prosecutions for
penalties during such time as would be reasonably required to enable the corporation to comply with the order
of the Commission. The court's order, as entered upon
complainant's application, contains no provision upon the
subject. Our affirmance of that order will be without
prejudice to the authority of the District Court to deal
with the question of penalties.
Affirmed.

ELZABURU v. CHAVES.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PORTO RICO.
No. 52.

Submitted November 1, 1915.-Decided November 29, 1915.

The former practice in regard to appeals from the Supreme Court of
Porto Rico provided by § 35 of the Foraker Act of 1900, was superseded by § 244, Jud. Code, subjecting appeals from that court to the
same regulations as appeals from the District Courts of the United
States thus extending the review of this court to include questions
of fact, and § 244 has been repealed by section three of the act of
January 28, 1915, with a reservation of cases then pending in this
court.
In this case the record discloses no sufficient ground for reversing
the court below on questions of fact.

The courts of Porto Rico having held, prior to the decision in this case,
