was true the company was not liable, and the court so instructed the jury; If the testimony of plaintiffs was true
the company did not observe even ordinary care; and
which was the fact it was for the jury to decide, and their
judgment-in deciding could not have been embarrassed
by a consideration of degrees of negligence or care.
The other contentions of the company we think do not
require special comment. They are directed to the proposition, many times repeated, that the company owed
no duty to Bigger or else had observed it, and that Bigger
had not used care either in avoiding exposure or in preventing an injurious effect from it. They attack the
sufficiency of the evidence and assert, in effect, that its
conflicts should be resolved against plaintiffs. The propositions of law involved are those which we have considered.

ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FE RAILWAY
COMPANY v. SWEARINGEN.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 74.

Argued November 11, 1915.-Decided December 13, 1915.

Under the Employers' Liability Act of 1908, a breach of the Hours of
Service Act on the part of the carrier does not operate to deprive

it of the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk
unless the breach contributed to the injury.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Ai'gument for Plaintiff in Error.

239 U. S.

THE facts, which involve the construction and application of the Hours of Service Act, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Robert Dunlap, with whom Mr. Gardiner Lathrop,
Mr. J. W. Terry and Mr. A. H. Culwell were on the brief,
for plaintiff in error:
Violation of the Hours of Service Act is not negligence
per se destroying defenses of assumed risk and contributory
negligence regardless of whether or not it was the proximate cause. St. Louis &c. Ry. v. McWhirter, 229 U. S.
265; Nitro-Glycerine Case, 15 Wall. on p. 537.
A party charging negligence as a ground of action must
prove it. Such fact is not to be solved by indulging in
surmise or conjecture, or resorting to imaginary possibilities. Puget Sound Co. v. Hunt, 223 Fed. Rep. 952, 955; 29
Cyc. 600; Missouri &c. Ry. v. Foreman, 174 Fed. Rep. 377.
To enable plaintiff to recover there must be proof that
the cause which operated to produce the death had its
origin in some specific and particular negligent act of the
defendant, for the result of which it was legally liable. See
Midland R. R. v. Fulgham, 181 Fed. Rep. 91, 95; Felt v.
Boston & M. R. R., 161. Massachusetts, 311; 37 N. E. Rep.
375; Hannigan v. Lehigh R. R., 157 N. Y. 244.
The special charge requested by plaintiff in error as to
the Hours of Service Act as foundation for recovery
should have been given to the jury, as the charge of the
court did not comprehend all of relieving clauses contained in the proviso of the act and on which evidence
was offered. Southern Pacific Co.. v. Pool, 160 U. S. 438;
Slocum v. New York Life Ins. Co., 228 U. S. 364, 369;

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

It was not the intent of Congress to make railway companies insurers nor to exact from them practical impossibilities. Northern Pac.Ry. v. United States, 213 Fed. Rep.
163; United States v. Mo. Pac. Ry., 213 Fed. Rep. 170.
The court erred in directing the jury that plaintiff might
recover in any one of five contingencies mentioned ignoring
the question whether in any such case the alleged negligence was the proximate cause of the accident or injury,
and moreover the evidence was insufficient to justify the
submission of certain alleged grounds of recovery to the
jury. Chambers v. Everding, 71 Oregon, 521; 143 Pac.
Rep. 616; Tex. & Pac. Ry. v. Bigham, 90 Texas, 223;

Con. St. Ry., 185 Massachusetts, 315; Stone v. B. & A.
R. R., 171 Massachusetts, 536.
The evidence was conclusive that plaintiff assumed the
risk of the position of the engine and position and size
of the sill step. Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, 233 U. S.
504; Kohn v. McNulta, 147 U. S. 238; So. Pac. Co. v.
Seley, 152 U.S. 145.
The evidence was wholly insufficient to submit certain
grounds of alleged negligence to the jury and as to burden
of proof. Griffin v. Springfield Street Ry., 219 Massachusetts, 55; Beach on Cont. Neg., 3d ed., §§ 427, 428.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

Mr. Perry J. Lewis, Mr. C. P. Johnson and Mr. S.
Elgelking,-for defendant in error submitted:
The sixteen-hour law was enacted for the safety of
employ~s; if its violation contributes to the injury, the
railroad is liable, and the defenses of contributory negligence and assumed risk are not available. The general
law and the Employers' Liability Act forbid all argument
on this proposition. The McWhirter Case, 229 U. S. 265,
fails to support the contention of plaintiff in error; but
does support the decision of the court below.
Plaintiff had been on duty nearly eighteen hours when
he was injured; the testimony shows he was more dead
than alive: he was sleepy and tired after being on duty
from 7.00 P. M. to 1.25 P. M. the next day; in fact, he
was thrown from the pilot because he was not in a physical
condition to stay on.
The trial court did not make liability depend merely on

gence causing or contributing to the injury is made the
basis of recovery. Grand Trunk Ry. v. Ives, 144 U. S. 408.
No stronger case of proximate cause arising from the
evidence could be presented than in this case. Del., L. &
W. Ry. v. Converse, 139 U. S. 469, 472.
In support of contention of defendant in error as to
proximate cause and assumption of risk, see also Hartford
Life Ins. Co. v. Unsell, 144 U. S. 439, 447; Erie R. R. v.
Winter, 143 U. S. 60, 70; Robinson v. Belt, 187 U. S. 41;
I. & St. L. R. R. v. Horst, 93 U. S. 291, 298; Washington
& G. R. R. v. Harmon, 147 U. S. 571, 580.
MR. JUSTICE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff (defendant in error,) while acting as fireman upon and
in charge of a defective engine that had been picked up
by a train. He had been kept on duty for more than

Opinion of the Court.

sixteen hours, and, as we take it for present purposes,
contrary to the act of March 4, 1907, c. 2939, § 2, 34 Stat.
1415, 1416, without the justifications or excuses allowed
in § 3. While about to do some oiling according to directions, he fell from the running board of the pilot and his
leg was out off. There was evidence of negligence on the
part of the Railroad but the defendant set up that the
plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and. assumed the risk. The only matter that we have to consider
here is an instruction given to the jury touching the effect
of keeping the plaintiff on duty overtime upon these
matters alleged by the defence.
The delay that led to keeping the plaintiff on duty too
long was caused by the breaking of a valve yoke, and a
part of the charge was as follows: "If, however, you
believe that said breaking of the valve yoke was no such
casualty or unknown and unforeseeable cause as is provided by law, that is to say, if you find that the breaking
of the valve yoke could have been guarded against or
foreseen by the exercise of ordinary care, then you are
instructed that the law authorizes you to infer negligence
on the part of the defendant at the time of plaint'ff's
injury, in requiring him to be on duty more than sixteen
hours. And if in the breaking of the valve yoke you find
no casualty or such unknown and unforeseeable cause as
aforesaid, then and in that event you will entirely disregard defendant's pleas of contributory negligence and
assumed risk, as then the plaintiff can in no way be held
to have been guilty of contributory negligence in going
upon the pilot while the engine was moving, nor can he in
any way be held to have assumed any of the risks ordinarily
incident to his work or even open and apparent to him at
the time he was hurt."
The last half of this instruction was excepted to in the
presence of the jury, but the charge was not modified.
It was the one instruction specifically directed to the mat-

ter of overtime. The natural understanding of it by people
untrained in the law, if not by everybody, would be that
the unjustified retention of the plaintiff at his work for
more than sixteen hours would make -the defendant liable
whether the retention contributed to the injury or not.
The statute that excludes the defences of contributory
negligence and assumption of risk in such a case is not
the Hours of Labor Act itself but the subsequent Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, §§ 3, 4;
35 Stat. 65, 66. The latter has that operation only when
the breach of the law contributes to the injury. St. Louis &
Iron Mountain Ry. v. McWhirter, 229 U. S. 265, 279, 280.
We do not think it possible to read the absolute language
of the instruction as implicitly limited to such a case.
Judgment reversed.

UNITED STATES v. NORMILE.
NORMILE v. UNITED STATES.
APPEALS FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
Nos. 83, 84. Argued December 3, 1915.-Decided December 13, 1915.
A contract to produce a result does not bring the means employed to
provide it into the contract. United States v. O'Brien, 220 U. S. 321.
In this case, a contractor was not allowed the expense of erecting
temporary dams because the Government engineer suggested that
it be placed in a certain location that proved impracticable, necessitating relocation and rebuilding, as the contract only called for the
location of the permanent structure by the engineer.
An extension of time requested by claimant, without any suggestion
that it was made necessary by fault of the Government or by the
violence of the elements, held, in view of the warning given on granting.-the extension, not to absolve claimant from the extra expenses
specified in the contract in case such extension were allowed.
