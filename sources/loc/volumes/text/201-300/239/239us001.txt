CASES ADJUDGED
IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.

CERECEDO v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
PORTO RICO.

No. 285. Argued October 13, 1915.-Decided October 25, 1015.
Postponing consideration of a motion to dismiss until the hearing of
the case on the merits is not a decision that the court has power to
review the judgment.
The rule in cases coming from the District Court ol[ the United States
for Porto Rico is that the existence of constitutional questions must
appear in a bill of exceptions.
Even though this court may have an extraordinary discretion in extreme cases to supply the absence of a bill of exceptions, there is
no ground in this case for the exercise of such discretion.

THE

facts, which involve the jurisdiction of this court

to review judgments of the District Court of the United
States for Porto Rico, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Paul Fuller and Mr. Howard Thayer Kingsbury,

Opinion of the Court.

seizures made thereunder were in violation of the Constitution.
The trial court should have ordered the return of the
papers unlawfully seized and should not have admitied
them in evidence.
The United States attorney should have returned upon
defendants' demand the papers unlawfully seized.
Private papers written by the defendants or any of
them, taken from their possession by compulsory process,
should not have been admitted in evidence.
The trial court admitted other incompetent and irrelevant evidence.
The trial court's refusal to extend the time in which to
file a bill of excepticns, and to permit the substitution of
the supplemental assignment of errors was an abuse of
discretion.
In support of these contentions, see Adams v. New
York, 192 U. S. 585; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S.616;
Burton v. United States, 196 U. S.283; Chateaugay Iron

MR.CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE,

The plaintiffs in error prosecute this writ under the
assumption that the court below denied rights asserted

Syllabus.

by them under the Constitution, by refusing as prayed,
to return papers taken from them under a search warrant
and in permitting the papers over objection to be offered
in evidence. There is no bill of exceptions in the record
and nothing which enables us to lawfully ascertain the
existence of the constitutional questions relied upon.
Clune v. United States, 159 U. S. 590; Metropolitan R. R.
Co. v. District of Columbia, 195 U. S. 322; Porto Rico v.
Emanuel, 235 U. S. 251, 255.
There is nothing, therefore, before us unless there be
merit in contentions to the contrary which are pressed
and which we briefly dispose of. First: On the face of
things it is obvious that the postponing at the last term
of the consideration of a motion to dismiss was not a
decision of the question of power to review. Second:
Even indulging, for the sake of the argument only, in the
assumption of the correctness of the proposition urged
that an extraordinary discretion might exist in some extreme case to supply the entire absence of a bill of exceptions, we see no ground whatever for the premise that
this is a case of that character.
Dismissedfor want of jurisdiction.
