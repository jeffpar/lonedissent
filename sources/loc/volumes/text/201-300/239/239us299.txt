MACKENZIE v. HARE ET AL., BOARD OF
ELECTION OF SAN FRANCISCO.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA.
No. 79. Argued November 11, 12, 1915.-Decided December 6, 1915.
In construing a statute, whatever was said or given prominence in
debate gives way to its actual language as passed; all reasons that
induced its enactment and all of its purposes must be supposed to
be satisfied and expressed by its words as finally enacted.
Under the Constitution every person born in the United States is a
citizen thereof.
The provisions in § 3 of the Citizenship Act of March 2, 1907, that any
American woman who marries a foreigner takes the nationality of
her husband, is not limited as to place or effect prior to the termination of the marital relation.
Where an act of Congress is explicit and circumstantial, as is § 3 of the
Citizenship Act of 1907, it would transcend judicial power to insert
limitations or conditions upon disputable considerations.
Whatever may have been the law of England and the original law of
this country as to perpetual allegiance of persons to the land of
their birth, Congress by the act of 1868, now Rev. Stat. 1999,
explicitly declared the right of expatriation to have been the law.
The identity of hasband and wife is an ancient principle of our jurisdiction, and is still retained notwithstanding much relaxation thereof;

and while it has purpose, if not necessity, in domestic policy, it has
greater purpose, and possibly greater necessity, in international
policy.
As a Government, the United States is invested with all the attributes
of sovereignty and has the character and powers of nationality,
especially those concerning relations and intercourse with foreign
powers.
Citizenship is of tangible worth, but the possessor thereof may voluntarily renounce it even though Congress may not be able to arbitrarily impose such'renunciation.
Marriage of an American woman with a foreigner may involve national
complications of like kind as physical expatriation may involve and
is therefore within the control of Congress.
Marriage of an American woman with a foreigner is tantamount to
voluntary expatriation; and Congress may, without exceeding its
powers, make it so, as it has in fact done, by the act of March 2, 1907.
165 California, 776, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the construction and constitutionality of the Citizenship Act of March 2, 1907, and the
status as to citizenship of a woman born under the jurisdiction of the United States and married to a native of a
foreign State but residing in the United States, are stated
in the opinion.

Opinion of the Court.

The claim that at the time of the Statute of 1907, it was
the settled law of the United States that an American
woman marrying an alien did not lose her citizenship, by
reason of said marriage, if she continued to reside within
the jurisdiction of the United States, is a misapprehension;

The Act of 1907, is in clear and specific terms, and
mandatory in its expression, and intended the transfer of
allegiance to be immediate upon marriage, and did not
contemplate leaving open any question as to the nature of
residence abroad. The act has been so interpreted by
the State Department at Washington, and also by the
Federal courts. House Doc. No. 326, 59th Congress;

the Board of Election Commissioners of the city and
county of San Francisco, to compel her registration as a
qualified voter of the city and county, in the appropriate
precinct therein.
An alternative writ was issued but a permanent writ
was denied upon demurrer to the petition.
The facts are not in dispute and are stated by Mr.
Justice Shaw, who delivered the opinion of the court, as
follows:
"The plaintiff was born and ever since has resided in
the State of California. On August 14, 1909, being then
a resident and citizen of this State and of the United States,
she was lawfully married to Gordon Mackenzie, a native
and subject of the kingdom of Great Britain. He had resided in California prior to that time, still resides here and
it is his intention to make this State his permanent residence. He has not become naturalized as a citizen of
the United States and it does not appear that he intends
to do so. Ever since their marriage the plaintiff and her
husband have lived together as husband and wife. On
January 22, 1913, she applied to the defendants to be
registered as a voter. She was then over the age of twentyone years and had resided in San Francisco for more than
ninety days. Registration was refused to her on the
ground that by reason of her marriage to Gordon Mackenzie, a subject of Great Britain, she thereupon took the
nationality of her husband and ceased to be a citizen of
the United States."
Plaintiff in error claims a right as a voter of the State
under its constitution and the Constitution of the United
States.
The constitution of the State gives the privilege of
suffrage to "every native citizen of the United States,"
and it is contended that under the Constitution of the
United States every person born in the United States is a
citizen thereof. The latter must be conceded, and if

MACKENZIE v. HARE.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

plaintiff has not lost her citizenship by her marriage she
has the qualification of a voter prescribed by the constitution of the State of California. The question then is,
Did she cease to be a citizen by her marriage?
On March 2, 1907, c. 2534, 34 Stat. 1228,
that is, prior to
the marriage of Plaintiff in error, Congress enacted a statute
the third section of which provides "That any American
woman who marries a foreigner shall take the nationality
of her husband. At the termination of the marital relation
she may resume her American citizenship, if abroad, by
registration as an American citizen within one year with
a consul of the United States, or by returning to reside
in the United States, or, if residing in the United States
at the termination of the marital relation, by continuing
to reside therein."
Plaintiff contends that "such legislation, if intended
to apply 'to her, is beyond the authority of Congress."
Questions of construction and power are, therefore,
presented. Upon the construction of the act it is urged
that it was not the intention to deprive an American-born
woman, remaining within the jurisdiction of the United
States, of her citizenship by reason of her marriage to a
resident foreigner. The contention is attempted to be
based upon the history of the act and upon the report of
the committee upon which, it is said, the legislation was
enacted. Both history and report show, it is asserted,
"that the intention of CongTess was solely to legislate
concerning the status of citizens abroad and the questions
arising by reason thereof."
Does the act invite or permit such assistance? Its declaration is general, "that any American woman who
marries a foreigner shall take the nationality of her husband." There is no limitation of place; there is no limitation of effect, the marital relation having been constituted
and continuing. For its termination there is provision,
and explicit provision. At its termination she may resume

Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

her American citizenship if in the United States by simply
remaining therein; if abroad, by returning to the United
States, or, within one year, registering as an American
citizen. The act is therefore explicit and circumstantial.
It would transcend judicial power to insert limitations or
conditions upon disputable considerations of reasons
which impelled the law, or of conditions to which it might
be conjectured it was addressed and intended to accommodate.
Whatever was said in the debates on the bill or in the
reports concerning it, preceding its enactment or during
its enactment, must give way to its language, or, rather,
all the reasons that induced its enactment and all of its
purposes must be supposed to be satisfied and expressed
by its words, and it makes no difference that in discussion
some may have been given more prominence than others,
seemed more urgent and insistent than others, presented
the mischief intended to be remedied more conspicuously
than others,
The application of the law thus being determined, we
pass to a consideration of its validity.
An earnest argument is presented to demonstrate its
invalidity. Its basis is that the citizenship of plaintiff
was an incident to her birth in the United States, and,
under the Constitution and laws of the United States, it
became a right, privilege and immunity which could not
be taken away from her except as a punishment for crime
or by her voluntary expatriation.
The argument to support the contention and the argument to oppose it take a wide range through the principles
of the common law and international law and their development and change. Both plaintiff and defendants
agree that under the common law originally allegiance was
immutable. They do not agree as to when the rigidity of
the principle was relaxed. Plaintiff in error contests the
proposition which she attributes to defendants in error

MACKENZIE v. HARE.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"that the doctrine of perpetual allegiance maintained by
England was accepted by the United States," but contends "that the prevalent doctrine of this country always
has been that a citizen had a right to expatriate himself,"
and cites cases to show that expatriation is a natural and
inherent right.
Whether this was originally the law of this country or
became such by inevitable evolution it is not important
to inquire. The first view has certainly high authority
for its support. In Shanks v. Dupont, 3 Pet. 242, 246,
Mr. Justice Story, delivering the judgment of the court,
said: "The general doctrine is, that no persons can by any
act of their own, without the consent of the government,
put off their allegiance, and become aliens." And Kent,
in his commentaries, after a historical review of the principle and discussion in the Federal courts, declares that
"the better opinion would seem to be, that a citizen
cannot renounce his allegiance to the United States without the permission of government declared by law; and
that, as there is no existing legislative regulation on the
case, the rule of the English common law remains unaltered." 2 Kent, 14th ed. 49. The deduction would
seem to have been repelled by the naturalization laws,
and it was certainly opposed to executive opinion; and,
we may say, popular sentiment, so determined that it
sought its vindication by war. Further discussion would
lead us far afield, and, besides, would only have historical
interest.1 The condition which Kent suggested has occurred; there is a legislative declaration. In 1868, c. 249,
15 Stat. 223, Congress explicitly declared the right of expatriation to have been and to be the law. And the
declaration was in effect said to be the dictate of necessity.
1 The course of opinion and decision is set forth in Van Dyne's
"Citizenship of the United States" aqd in his "Naturalization in the
United States"; Moore's Digest of International Law. See also Cockburn on Nationality.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

The act recites that emigrants have been received and invested with citizenship in recognition of the principle of
the right of expatriation and that there should be a prompt
and final disavowal of the claim "that such American
citizens, with their descendants, are subjects of foreign
states." Rev. Stat., § 1999.
But plaintiff says, "Expatriation is evidenced only by
emigration, coupled with other acts indicating an intention to transfer one's allegiance." And all the acts must
be voluntary, "the result of a fixed determination to
change the domicile and permanently reside elsewhere,
as well as to throw off the former allegiance, and become
a citizen or subject of a foreign power."
The right and the condition of its exercise being thus
defined, it is said that the authority of Congress is limited
to giving its consent. This is variously declared and emphasized. "'No act of the legislature," plaintiff says,
"'can denationalize a citizen without his concurrence,'"
citing Burkett v. McCarty, 73 Kentucky (10 Bush), 758.
"'And the sovereign cannot discharge a subject from his
allegiance against his consent except by disfranchisement
as a punishment for crime,"' citing Ainslie v. Martin, 9
Massachusetts, 454. "'The Constitution does not authorize Congress to enlarge or abridge the rights of citizens,'" citing Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat.
737. "'The power of naturalization vested in Congress
by the Constitution is a power to confer citizenship, not
a power to take it away. . . . The Fourteenth Amendment, while it leaves the power where it was before, in
Congress, to regulate naturalization, has conferred no
authority upon Congress to restrict the effect of birth
declared by the Constitution to constitute a complete right
of citizenship,'" citing United States v. Wong Kim Ark,
169 U. S. at p. 703.
It will thus be seen that plaintiff's contention is in exact
antagonism to the statute. Only voluntary expatriation,

MACKENZIE v. HARE.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

as she defines it, can divest a woman of her citizenship,
she declares; the statute provides that by marriage with
a foreigner she takes his nationality.
It would make this opinion very voluminous to consider
in detail the argument and the cases urged in support of
or in attack upon the opposing conditions. Their foundation principles, we may assume, are known. The identity
of husband and wife is an ancient principle of our jurisprudence. It was neither accidental nor arbitrary and
worked in many instances for her protection. There has
been, it is true, much relaxation of it but in its retention
as in its origin it is determined by their intimate relation
and unity of interests, and this relation and unity may
make it of public concern in many instances to merge their
identity, and give dominance to the husband. It has
purpose, if not necessity, in purely domestic policy; it has
greater purpose and, it may be, necessity, in international
policy. And this was the dictate of the act in controversy.
Having this purpose, has it not the sanction of power?
Plaintiff contends, as we have seen, that it has not, and
bases her contention upon the absence of an express gift
of power. But there may be powers implied, necessary
orincidental to the expressed powers. As a government,
the United States is invested with all the attributes of
sovereignty. As it has the character of nationality it has
the powers of nationality, especially those which concern
its relations and intercourse with other countries. We
should hesitate long before limiting or embarrassing such
powers. But monition is not necessary in the present case.
There need be no dissent from the cases cited by plaintiff;
there need be no assertion of very extensive power over
the right of eitizenship or of the imperative imposition
of conditions upon it. It may be conceded that a change
of citizenship cannot be arbitrarily imposed, that is,
imposed without the concurrence of the citizen. The law
in controversy does not ha-ve that feature. It deals with

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

a condition voluntarily entered into, with notice of the
consequences. We concur with counsel that citizenship
is of tangible worth, and we sympathize with plaintiff in
her desire to retain it and in her earnest assertion of it.
But there is involved more than personal considerations.
As we have seen, the legislation was -urged by conditions
of national moment. And this is an answer to the apprehension of counsel that our construction of the legislation will make every act, though lawful, as marriage, of
course, is, a renunciation of citizenship. The marriage
of an American woman with a foreigner has consequences
of like kind, may involve national complications of like
kind, as her physical expatriation may involve. Therefore, as long as the relation lasts it is made tantamount to
expatriation. This is no arbitrary exercise of government.
It is one which, regarding the international aspects,
judicial opinion has taken for granted would not only be
valid but demanded. It is the conception of the legislation under review that such an act -may bring the
Government into embarrassments and, it may be, into
controversies. It is'
as. yoluntary and distinctive as expatriation and its consequence must be considered as elected.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUsTIcE MCREYNOLDS is of opinion that this court
is without jurisdiction, and that, therefore, this writ of
error should be dismissed.
