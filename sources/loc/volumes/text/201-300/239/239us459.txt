INTER-ISLAND STEAM NAVIGATION

COM-

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF
HAWAII.
No. 288.

Submitted November 29, 1915.-Decided December 20, 1915.

Subsequent legislation excluded seamen engaged in the coastwise
trade from the exemption from attachment of wages provided by

§ 4536, Rev. Stat.
22 Hawaii, 60, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction and application of the various statutes relating to seamen's wages and
garnishment of the same, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Charles R. Hemenway for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Frank E. Thompson and Mr. John W. Cathcartfor
defendants in error.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of
the court.
Defendant in error Byrne brought suit against Kaleiki in
the District Court of Honolulu and served the navigation
company with a garnishee summons in accordance with
the local statute. Answering, the company set up that
Kaleiki was hired directly by it (not through a shipping
commissioner) as a mate on the "Claudine," plying only
in the inter-island coast trade, and asked a discharge because of the- exemption from attachment of seamen's
wages by § 4536, Rev. Stat. The trial court held that subsequent legislation excluded seamen engaged in such coast-

wise trade from the exemption, and rendered judgment
against both Kaleiki and the company. This action was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii
(22 Hawaii, 60), and the cause is here upon writ of error.
By a comprehensive act containing sixty-eight sections,
approved June 7, 1872, c. 322, 17 Stat. 262, and entitled
"An Act to authorize the appointment of shipping commissioners by the several circuit courts of the United
States, to superintend the shipping and discharge of .seamen engaged in merchant ships belonging to the United
States, and for the further protection of seamen," Congress prescribed regulations concerning the employment,
wages, treatment and protection of seamen. Section 61
reads as follows, p. 276: "That no wages due or accruing
to any seaman or apprentice shall be subject to attachment or arrestment from any -court; and every payment
of wages to a seaman or apprentice shall be valid in law,
notwithstanding any previous sale or assignment of such
wages, or of any attachment, incumbrance, or arrestment
thereon; and no assignment or sale of such wages, or of
salvage made prior to the accruing thereof, shall bind the
party making the same, except such advanced securities
as are provided for in this act." Without material modification in language, this became § 4536 of the Revised
Statutes enacted into law June 22, 1874, with the following
limitation-§ 5601: "The enactment of the said revision
is not to affect or repeal any act of Congress passed since
the 1st day of December one thousand eight hundred and
seventy-three, and all acts passed since that date are to
have full effect as if passed after the enactment of this
revision, and so far as such acts vary from, or conflict with
any provision contained in said revision, they are to have
effect as subsequent statutes, aiqd as repealing any portion
of the revision inconsistent therewith."
The Act of June 9, 1874, c. 260, 18 Stat. 64, "in reference
to the operations of the shipping commissioners' act, ap-

proved June seventh, eighteen hundred and seventy-two,"
provided: "That none of the provisions of an act entitled
'An act to authorize the appointment of shipping commissioners by the several circuit courts of the United
States to superintend the shipping and discharge of seamen engaged in merchant ships belonging to the United
States, and for the further protection of seamen' shall
apply to sail or steam vessels engaged in the coastwise
trade, except the coastwise trade between the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts, or in the lake-going trade touching
at foreign ports or otherwise, or in the trade between the
United States and the British North American possessions,
or in any case where the seamen are by custom or agreement entitled to participate in the profits or result of a
cruise, or voyage."
The understanding of Congress concerning the effect
of the repealing act of 1874 is indicated by subsequent
legislation referred to below.
Section 2 Qf an act approved June 19, 1886, c. 421,
24 Stat. 79, specified that "shipping commissioners may
ship and discharge crews for any vessel engaged in the
coastwise trade .
.
at the request of the master
or owner of such vessel," etc.
"An Act to amend the laws relative to shipping commissioners," approved August 19, 1890, c. 801, 26 Stat.
320, declared that when a crew is shipped by a shipping
commissioner for any American vessel in the coastwise
trade
as authorized by § 2, act of 1886 above,
an agreement shall be made with each seaman
in the same manner as provided by §§ 4511 and 4512,
Rev. Stat. (both from the act of 1872); and it further
provided that other sections of the Revised Statutes (not
including § 4536) also originally in the act of 1872, shall
extend to and embrace such vessel to the same extent
as if mentioned therein.
By an act approved February 18, 1895, c. 97, 28 Stat.

Opinion of the Court.

667, the act of 1890, supra, was so amended as to render
applicable to seamen in the coastwise trade when shipped
by a shipping commissioner, certain other sections of the
Revised Statutes, including § 4536, from the act of
1872; and it further provided "but in all other respects
such shipment of seamen and such shipping agreement
shall be regarded as if both shipment -and agreement had
been entered into between the master of a vessel and a seaman without going before a shipping commissioner: Provided, That the clothing of any seaman shall be exempt
from attachment."
The Act of March 3, 1897, c. 389, 29 Stat. 687, 689,
amends the foregoing act of 1895 by adding another
section of the Revised Statutes to those therein enumerated.
Plaintiff in error maintains: "The words in the act of
.
shall apply to
1874 'none of the provisions
sail or steam vessels engaged in the coastwise trade'
are apt in their application to many of the sections in
the act of 1872, as, for example, §§ 4511 to 4519,
inclusive. These words are not such as would be expected if § 4536 was intended to be referred to, for
there is nothing in that section which applies to vessels
or the duties of masters and owners under the Shipping
Commissioners' Act. As we view it, § 4536 remained
unaffected by the act of 1874, neither specifically nor by
reasonable implication repealed as to seamen in the coastwise trade."
The fundamental purpose of the act of 1872 was to
afford protection to seamen in respect of their treatment
and wages. The act of 1874 by its express terms rendered
the provisions of the earlier act inapplicable to vessels
in the ordinary coastwise trade (United States v. The
Grace Lothrop, 95 U. S. 527, 532), and the suggested narrow construction would tend to defeat the particular
end in view-the relief of vessels making relatively short

voyages, with frequent opportunities for reaching ports,
from burdensome requirements not then deemed essential to the welfare of seamen -employed thereon. Certainly, we think, the provisions in the act of 1872 having
direct reference to wages (including those in § 4536, Rev.
Stat.), because of their intimate connection with the navigation of vessels, must be considered as applicable thereto
and therefore included within the scope of the amendment of 1874. Subsequent legislation clearly indicates
that Congress entertained this view. It would be difficult
to account for the acts of 1886, 1890, 1895, and 1897,
supra, upon any other theory.
The particular point now presented was reserved in
Wilder v. Inter-Island Navigation Co., 211 U. S. 239, 245.
It has become of less importance since the act of March 4,
1915, c. 153, 38 Stat. 1164, 1169, wherein the provisions
of § 61 of the act of 1872 were rednacted.
The judgment of the court below -is

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD
CIRCUIT.

No. 608. Argued December 1, 1915.-Decided December 20, 1915.
A railroad is not to be held as guaranteeing or warranting absolute
safety to its employ6s under all circumstances, but is bound to exercise the care which the exigency reasonably demands in furnishing
proper roadbed, tracks, and other structures.
Failure to exercise such care constitutes negligence; but the mere
existence of a great number of tracks close to each other in a ter-
