UNITED STATES v. FREEMAN.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS.
No. 481. Argued October 21, 1915.-Decided November 15, 1915.
The act prohibited by § 240, Criminal Code, making it punishable to
ship or cause to be shipped from one State into another State or from
a foreign country into a State, a package of intoxicating liquor not
marked as required by the statute is essentially a continuing act the
performance whereof is begun when the package is delivered to the
carrier and completed when it reaches its destination.
The word "ship" as used in § 240, Criminal Code, is not used in the
sense of "deliver for shipment," making the offense a completed one
upon delivery of the goods.
A criminal statute applicable alike to shipments in interstate and
foreign commerce will not be so construed as to render it obviously
futile as to foreign commerce; it should be so construed, if its words
permit, as to cause it to reach both classes of shipments and to
accomplish the object of its enactment.
Section 240, Criminal Code, refers to the continuing act of shipping
goods whereby the transportation into a State is accomplished, and
the District Court within the State into which the goods are shipped
has jurisdiction of the offense under § 42, Judicial Code, as well
as the District Court within the State from which the goods are
shipped.
THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court of the offense of shipping intoxicating liquor in
interstate and foreign commerce in violation of, and the
construction of § 240, Criminal Code, are stated in the
opinion.

States:

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Argument for the United States.

239 U. S.

The United States District Court for the District of
Kansas has jurisdiction of the prosecution of the defendant in error for shipping the unlabeled packages
from Missouri into Kansas, inasmuch as the offense
was not complete when the unlabeled packages were
delivered to the carrier, but continued throughout their
transportation.
The offense "causing" to be shipped constitutes a
separate crime from "shipping" and is capable of performance in a separate district.

There was no appearance or brief for defendant in error'
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This is an indictment under § 240 of the Criminal Code
making it a punishable offense knowingly to "ship or
cause to be shipped from one State,
into any
other State, . . . or from any foreign country into
any State,
" any package of or containing intoxicating liquor of any kind, "unless such package be
so labeled on the outside cover as to plainly show the name
of the consignee, the nature of its contents, and the quantity contained therein." The indictment was returned
in the District of Kansas and charges the defendant with
violating the statute by knowingly shipping and causing
to be shipped from Joplin, Missouri, into Cherokee County,
Kansas, six unlabeled trunks severally containing from
twelve to fifteen gallons of intoxicating liquor. By a
motion to quash and a demurrer it was objected that the
offense denounced by the statute is complete when the
package is delivered to the carrier for shipment, and
therefore that the offense charged was not cognizable
in the District of Kansas but only in the Western District
of Missouri. Acceding to this construction of the statute,
the District Court sustained the motion to quash and the
demurrer and entered a judgment discharging the defendant. The Government. brings the case here under the

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

Criminal Appeals Act, of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat.
1246.
As usually understood, to ship a package from one State
into another or from a foreign country into a State is to
accomplish its transportation from the one into the other
by a common carrier, and is essentially a continuing act
whose performance is begun when the package is delivered
to the carrier and is completed when it reaches its destination. We think it is to such an act that the statute
refers. To reach a different conclusion the word "ship"
must be read as if it were "deliver for shipment." No
doubt it sometimes has that meaning, but it plainly is not
so used in this instance. The statute deals with shipping
liquor from a foreign country into a State as well as with
shipping it from one State into another State. It puts both
upon the sane plane and makes .them equally criminal.
Whatever marks the completion of the offense in one
likewise marks it in the other. If it be the delivery to
the carrier in the case of interstate shipments it equally is
this delivery in the case of shipments from a foreign country. And yet all will concede that Congress did not intend to do anything so obviously futile as to denounce
as criminal an act wholly done in a foreign country, such
as is the delivery to the carrier where the shipment is
from a foreign country into a State. So, if its words
permit, as we think they do, the statute must be given a
construction which will cause it to reach both classes
of shipments, and thereby to accomplish the purpose of
its enactment. United States v. Chavez, 228 U. S. 525.
This, we think, requires that it be construed as referring to the continuing act before indicated whereby the
transportation into a State is accomplished, whether the
package comes from another State or from a foreign
country. In this view the completion of the offense will
always be within a jurisdiction where the statute can be
enforced.

Syllabus.

The District Court rightly recognized that, under Jud.
Code, § 42, formerly Rev. Stat., § 731, the offense charged
was cognizable in the District of Kansas, as well as in the
Western District of Missouri, if the place to which the

packages were transported was the place of the completion
of the offense.
Therefore nothing need be said upon that point.

Judgment reversed.

PANY.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO.
No. 38. Submitted October 29, 1915.-Decided November 15, 1915.

The jurisdictional amount involved in suits for injunction to restrain
nuisance or a continuing trespass is to be tested by the value of the
object to be gained by complainant.
The amount involved in a suit brought by a telephone company to
restrain another company from so erecting poles and wires as to
injure complainant's poles, wires and business, held, in this case, not
to be the expense of defendant's removing its conflicting poles and
wires but the value of the right of complainant to maintain and
operate its plant and conduct its business free from wrongful interference by defendant.
Complainant's right to conduct its business free from the acts of defendant sought to be enjoined having an uncontroverted value of
$3,000, held that the District Court had jurisdiction under Judicial
Code, § 24, so far as jurisdictional amount in controversy is concerned.
