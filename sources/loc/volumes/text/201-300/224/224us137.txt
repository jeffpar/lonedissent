PLUMMER v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 177.

Argued February 29, March 1, 1912.-Decided April 1, 1912.

Under § 13 of the Navy Personnel Act of March 3, 1899, 30 Stat. 1007,
c. 413, and the acts of June 7, 1900, 31 Stat. 697, e. 859, March 2,
1907, 34 Stat. 1167, c. 2511, and May 13, 1908, 35 Stat. 127, c. 166,
the pay of acting assistant surgeons was enhanced and assimilated
to that of assistant surgeons in the Army, and did not remain fixed
as regulated by § 1556, Rev. Stat.
Where an act of Congress, such as the Navy Personnel Act of 1899,
provides for a standard by which to determine rank and pay of officers, it will not be presumed that Congress intended to create an inequality of compensation while leaving unmodified equality of rank
and duty, and so held as to the provisions for pay of assistant surgeons and acting assistant surgeons in the Navy.
The construction of the statutes involved in this case is the contemporaneous construction given thereto by the Executive Department
charged with execution of the provisions thereof.
Longevity pay of officers of the Army and Navy under the act of
: May 13, 1908, 35 Stat. 127, c. 166, is computed on the sum of the
base pay and not the base pay and previous increases thereof.
Where Congress, after a decision of this court construing a certain
,expression used in a statute, passes a statute declaring that those

words shall be construed as having a definite meaning different from
that given by this court, that expression, when used in a later statute
on the same subject, will be presumed to have the meaning so given
to it by Congress and not that previously given by this court.
Congress having by the act of June 30, 1882, 22 Stat. 118, c. 254,
expressly provided that the current yearly pay on which longevity
pay of officers of the Army and Navy is to be computed is base pay,
and not base pay and increases, so as to overcome the construction
given to the words "current yearly pay" by this court in United States
v. Tyler, 105 U. S. 44, those words will be construed in the same
manner when used in the subsequent act of May 13, 1908, 35 Stat.
1125, c. 166, and not as construed in United States v. Tyler.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the provisions of acts of Congress relating to pay of acting assistant surgeons in the Navy, are stated in the opinion.

officers of the Navy.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of

the court.
This appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Claims
denying the right to recover from the United States an
alleged balance of compensation claimed to be due for
services rendered as an acting assistant surgeon, at the

Naval Station, Key West, Florida, from July 1, 1903,
to July 1, 1909.

PLUMMER v. UNITED STATES.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

By an act approved May 4, 1898, 30 Stat. 369, 380,
c. 234, the President was authorized "to appoint for temporary service twenty-five acting assistant surgeons, who
shall have the relative rank and compensation of assistant
surgeons. When the act of 1898 was passed the pay of
officers in the naval service was generally regulated by
§ 1556, Rev. Stat., and the pay of an assistant surgeon
for shore duty was fixed at $1,400 a year. By § 13
of the Naval Personnel Act of March 3, 1899, 30 Stat.
1004, 1007, c. 413, it was provided that commissioned
officers of the line of the Navy and of the Medical
and Pay Corps "shall receive the same pay and allowances, except forage, as are or may be provided by or in
pursuance of law, for the officers of corresponding rank in
the Army;" and in a proviso it was declared "That such
officers when on shore shall receive the allowances, but
fifteen per centum less pay than when on sea duty." The
effect of this act was to increase the pay of naval officers
generally, and therefore to enhance the pay of assistant
surgeons.
The act of June 7, 1900, 31 Stat. 697, c. 859, raised the
rank of assistant surgeons in the Navy by providing that
"Assistant Surgeons shall rank with Assistant Surgeons
in the Army." We say that this act raised the rank of
assistant surgeons in the Navy for the following reasons:
Prior to that act the rank of assistant surgeon in the Navy
upon entrance into the service was that of ensign. (Rev.
Stat., § 1474.) As by Rev. Stat., § 1168, the lowest rank
of an assistant surgeon in the Army during the first three
years of service was that of a lieutenant of cavalry, the
effect of the act of 1900 was therefore to give to assistant
surgeons in the Navy a higher rank, that is, to raise them
from the rank of ensign to that of lieutenant, junior grade.
On December 29, 1902, the Surgeon General of the
Navy published a circular soliciting applications for appointment "as acting assistant surgeons for three years

of service," and in the circular, among other things, it
was stated as follows:
"The Secretary of the Navy, in order to meet the exigencies of the service, has authorized the appointment of
25 acting assistant surgeons for three years' service, to
have the same rank and pay as assistant surgeons in the
regular service.
The pay is as follows:
At sea .................... $1,650.00 a year.
"
1,402.50
On shore, with quarters .....
On shore, without quarters.. 1,690.50
Plummer applied for appointment, and was commissioned by the President as an acting assistant surgeon
in the naval service, to serve for three years from July 1,
1903. After the expiration of the first appointment he
was reappointed for another term of three years, and his
commission under the first and second appointment stated
his rank to be that of lieutenant, junior grade.
During Plummer's second three year period of service
two acts were, passed which it is claimed enhanced the
compensation' of assistant surgeons, viz.: An act approved
March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1158, 1167, c. 2511, and an act
approved May 13, 1908, 35 Stat. 127, 128, c. 166. By
the act of 1907 assistant surgeons were allowed heat and
light for quarters and commutation for the same. By
the act of 1908, the pay of a lieutenant, junior grade, the
relative rank of an assistant surgeon, was fixed at $2,000.
During the term of both services Plummer was paid
not at the rate provided by law for the pay of assistant
surgeons at the time his services as acting assistant surgeon were rendered, but at the rate of pay which was
fixed for assistant surgeons at the time the act of 1898
was passed. That is to say, despite the change in rank
and pay of assistant surgeons in the Navy brought about
by the legislation subsequent to 1898, Plummer was paid

PLUMMER v. UNITED STATES.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

upon the theory that those changes had no effect upon
the pay of acting assistant surgeons, and therefore they
were entitled only to the sum which was allowed by law
(Rev. Stat., § 1556) at the time the appointment of acting
assistant surgeons was provided for.
By an express finding of the court below, as to which
there is no dispute, if Plummer had been paid at the rate
fixed by law for assistant surgeons at the time his services
as acting assistant surgeon were rendered he would have
been entitled, irrespective of the question of longevity
pay as to which there is dispute, to $1,814.78 more pay
than he received; to $2,007.20, as commutation of quarters, and to $341.88 for heat and light for quarters under
the act of March 2, 1907, in all $4,213.86. Whether,
therefore, an acting assistant surgeon under the legislation
to which we have referred was entitled to be paid as his
services were performed at the rate then fixed by law
as the pay and allowance of an assistant surgeon, and
what was the proper basis for the calculation of longevity
pay, are the two questions requiring solution.
The court below based its conclusion that the acting
assistant surgeon was only entitled to the pay which was
allowed assistant surgeons at the time of the passage of
the act authorizing the appointment of acting assistant
surgeons, and, hence, that acting assistant surgeons got
no benefit from subsequent increases of the pay of assistant surgeons, upon two previous decisions to that effectJames S. Taylor (38 Ct. Cl. 155), and Hugh T. Nelson
(41 Ibid. 157).
The reasoning of the court was thus expressed in the
Taylor Case (p. 161):
"In the act of March 3, 1899, we fail to find any express
provision applying to officers of the Navy in the temporary service. That was 'An act to reorganize and increase the efficiency of the personnel of the Navy and the
Marine Corps of the United States,' evidently referring

224 U. S.

to the officers of the Regular Navy, as it certainly could
not be contended that the Congress had in view the reorganization of the officers in the temporary service, or
that by that act they intended to incorporate them into
the permanent service. On the contrary, it was not until
the act of June 7, 1900, that provision was made for continuing them in the service by permanent commissions.
Those who received commissions in the permanent service prior to that act did so presumably after a proper
examination and approval by the board of naval surgeons
designated by the Secretary of the Navy under the act of
May 4, 1898."
But conceding the correctness of the premise upon which
the reasoning just quoted rests-that is, the purpose of
the Naval Personnel Act to deal with the standard of pay
of the regular naval establishment-we think it is not
conclusive or even in any -degree persuasive of the question
here for decision, which is not what was the purpose of
Congress in fixing a standard for the pay of the regular
naval establishment, but whether that standard as fixed
must be resorted to for the purpose of determining the
pay of acting assistant surgeons. The solution of that
question must primarily be found within the text of the
act of 1898, and as that text expressly gives to the acting
assistant surgeons whose appointment it provides for the
relative rank and compensation allowed by law to assistant surgeons, it must follow that in the absence of an
express provision or a necessary implication to the contrary in the statute fixing the pay of assistant surgeons
such standard became the measure by which the pay of
the officers provided for in the act of 1898 was to be ascertained and allowed. In other words, as the act of 1898
provided for a standard by which to determine the rank
and pay of the acting assistant surgeons-that is, the
rank and compensation allowed assistant surgeons-in
the nature of things it provided not for the application

PLUMMER v. UNITED STATES.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of a non-existing or obsolete standard, but for an existing
standard-that is, the rank and pay in force at the time
when the services of the acting assistant surgeons were
rendered. Looked at from a broader point of .view-that
is, testing the subject from a consideration of the obvious
intent and purpose of the act-of 1898-the same conclusion becomes necessary. It may not be doubted that the
relation which the act of 1898 established between the
rank and pay of acting assistant surgeons and assistant
surgeons in reason must rest upon the substantial identity
of the services to be rendered by the incumbents of both
offices. This being true, it of course necessarily also is
true that a mere increase of the compensation of assistant
surgeons without any change between the duties of those
officers and the duties of acting assistant surgeons cannot
justify the implication unless there was a clear manifestation of the purpose to do so-that it was the intention
of Congress to create an inequality of compensation while
leaving unmodified equality of rank and duty.
That the view which we take of the act of 1898 was also
the contemporaneous administrative construction given
to the act plainly results from the circular of the Surgeon
General under which Plummer was appointed, since the
pay stated in that circular was not that fixed in § 1556,
Rev. Stat., but was the sum fixed as the pay of assistant
surgeons in the Navy at the time the circular was issued,
Indeed that such also must have been the view entertained by the President when Plummer was commissioned
obviously is shown by the fact that Plummer was commissioned as a lieutenant, junior grade, the rank of an
assistant surgeon at the time of his appointment, and not
as an ensign, the rank accorded to assistant surgeons at
the time when the. act of 1898 was adopted.
The controversy as to the sum of the longevity pay
arises from a portion of the text of the act of May 13, 1908,
35 Stat. 127, 128, c. 166, reading as follows:

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

Opinion of the Court.

224 U.S.

"There shall be allowed and paid to each commissioned
officer below the rank of rear admiral ten per centum of
his current yearly pay for each term of five years' service
in the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The total amount
of such increase for length of service shall in no case exceed
forty per centum on the yearly pay of the grade as provided by law."
It is insisted that as the words "current yearly pay," as
employed in Rev. Stat., § 1262, were construed in United
States v. Tyler, 105 U. S. 244, to require that the calculation of the longevity pay should be made, not upon the
sum of the base pay, but on the base pay and previous increases thereof, that the same rule must be applied to the
words as used in the provision of the statute above quoted.
But, subsequent to the Tyler Case, by the act of June 30,
1882, 22 Stat. 118, c. 254, Congress expressly directed that
the ten per cent longevity increase provided for in § 1262,
Rev. Stat., should be "computed on the yearly pay of the
grade. . . ." That this act was passed for the express
purpose of commanding a method of computation which
would render inapplicable the construction adopted in the
Tyler Case is not open to controversy. United States v.
Miller, 208 U. S. 32, 38. Indeed, that from the date of the
act of 1882 down to the present time the longevity pay of
Army officers has been computed by the method directed
by the act of 1882 is not controverted. In view of the purpose of Congress to equalize as far as possible the pay of
Army and Navy officers, manifested by the adoption of
the Navy Personnel Act of 1899 and in all subsequent
legislation as to such pay, we think it plainly results that
the provision relied upon must be held to have been
adopted with reference to the settled rule prevailing for.
so many years, a rule consequent upon the act of 1882.
In other words, we think it may not be doubted that the
intention of Congress in the provision relied upon was
that the longevity pay therein prescribed should be con-

FIRST CIRCUIT.
No. 212.

Argued March 14, 1912.-Decided April 1, 1912.

A ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the petitioning creditors
held provable claims is not a judgment allowing or rejecting a claim
within the meaning of § 25b of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and
cannot under § 25a and subparagraph 1 be reviewed by this court.
Where the prerequisites for an appeal to this court specified in subparagraph 1 of § 25b of the Bankruptcy Act do not exist, and the Circuit
Court of Appeals does not make the findings of fact and conclusions
of law required by clause 3 of General Order 36, the appeal must be
dismissed. Chapman v. Bowen, 207 U. S. 89.
Appellate jurisdiction over a ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals
in a bankruptcy matter may not be exercised by this court by virtue
of § 6 of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, Tefft v. Munsuri,
