A further objection is that the bill is multifarious. But
in view of the numerous transfers which the Government
attacks, it was manifestly in the interest of the convenient
administration of justice that unnecessary suits should be
avoided and that transactions presenting the same question for determination should be grouped in a single
proceeding. The objection to- the misjoinder of causes
of action is likewise without merit.
Our conclusion is that the suit was well brought. The
judgment of the court below is affirmed with the modification that the cause shall proceed in conformity with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.

MULLEN v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 404.

Argued October 12, 13, 1911.-Decided April 15, 1912.

The relations of the United States and the Choctaw Indians by treaties
and statutes in regard to the allotment of lands and the restriction
of alienation reviewed, and held that where a person, whose name
appeared upon the rolls of the Choctaw Indians, died after the ratification of the agreement of distribution and before receiving the
allotment, there was no provision for restriction but the land passed
at once to his heirs; in such cases the United States cannot maintain

an action to set aside conveyances made by the heirs within the
period of restriction applicable to homestead allotments made to
members of the tribe during life.
179 Fed. Rep. 13, reversed as to this point.

Opinion of the Court.

THE facts, which involve the validity of certain conveyances of allotted land made by Choctaw Indians and
also the right of the United States to have such conveyances set aside, are stated in the opinion.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This suit was brought by the United States to cancel
certain conveyances of allotted lands, made by Choctaw
Indians in alleged violation of restrictions. The Circuit
Court sustained a demurrer to the bill upon the grounds
that the United States was not entitled to maintain a suit
of this character; that there was a defect of parties, owing
to the absence of the Indian grantors, and that the bill was
multifarious. This judgment was reversed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals, which directed the trial court to proceed with the cause in accordance with its opinion. United
States v. Allen, and similar cases, 179 Fed. Rep. 13. An
appeal to this court is taken by certain defendants under
ยง 3 of the act of June 25, 1910, c. 408, 36 Stat. 837. The
lands, conveyed to the appellants, are described as those
which had been allotted to Choctaws of the full-blood,
deceased, and the conveyances were made by their heirs
(also Choctaws of the full-blood) prior to April 26, 1906.
As early as 1786 (January 3) a treaty was made with
the representatives of the Choctaws by which it was acknowledged that these Indians were under the protection

of the United States and it was provided that for their
"benefit and comfort" and for the "prevention of injuries and oppressions" the United States should have
"the sole and exclusive right of regulating the trade with
the Indians, and managing all their affairs in such manner
as they think proper." 7 Stat. 21. By the treaty of 1820
(October 18) in order "to promote the civilization of the
Choctaw Indians, by the establishment of schools amongst
them; and to perpetuate them as a nation, by exchanging,
for a small part of their land here, a country beyond the
Mississippi River, where all, who live by hunting and will
not work, may be collected and settled together," there
was ceded to the Choctaws a tract west of the Mississippi
situated between the Arkansas and Red rivers. 7 Stat.
210. In furtherance of this purpose, another treaty was
made in 1830 (September 27) by which it was agreed that
the United States should "cause to be conveyed to the
Choctaw Nation a tract of country west of the Mississippi
River, in fee simple to them and their descendants, to
inure to them while they shall exist as a nation and live
on it," and the Choctaws ceded to the United States all
their lands east of the Mississippi and promised to remove
beyond that river as soon as possible. 7 Stat. 333, 334.
In 1837 (January 17), with the approval of the President
and Senate of the United States, an agreement was made
between the Choctaws and the Chickasaws that the, latter
should have the privilege of forming a district within the
limits of the Choctaw country "to be held on the same
terms that the Choctaws now hold it,
except the right of
disposing of it, which is held in common with the Choctaws and Chickasaws, to be called the Chickasaw district of
the Choctaw Nation." 11 Stat. 573. Controversies havifig arisen between these tribes, a treaty was made in 1855
(June 22) with the representatives of both, defining
boundaries and providing for the settlement of differences.
This contained the stipulation: "And pursuant to an act

Opinion of the Court.

of Congress approved May 28, 1830, the United States do
hereby forever secure and guarantee the lands embraced
within the said limits, to the members of the Choctaw and
Chickasaw tribes, their heirs and successors, to be held in
common; so that each and every member of either tribe
shall have an equal, undivided interest in the whole:
Provided, however, no part thereof shall ever be sold without the consent of both tribes; and that said land shall
revert to the United States if said Indians and their heirs
become extinct, or abandon the same." 11 Stat. 612.
After the Civil War, a new treaty was entered into reaffirming the obligations arising out of prior agreements
and legislation. April 8, 1866, 14 Stat. 765, 774. While
this treaty contemplated allotments in severalty and made
provision to that end, effective action was not taken until
the legislation of 1893, and subsequent years, relating to
the Five Civilized Tribes, which embodied the policy--of
individual allotments and the dissolution of the tribal
governments-made necessary by the changed conditions
in the Indian country. Acts of March 3, 1893, c. 209, 27
Stat. 645; June 10, 1896, c. 398, 29 Stat. 321, 339; June 7,
1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 62, 64; June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat.
495.
In the case of the Choctaws and Chickasaws, as in that
of the other tribes, the scheme of allotments embraced
certain restrictions upon the right of alienation which
Congress deemed necessary for the suitable protection of
the allottees. By virtue of the relation of the United
States to these Indians (Choctaw Nation v. United States,
119 U. S.1, 28; United States v. Choctaw Nation and Chickasaw Nation, 179 U. S.494, 532), and the obligations it
has assumed, it is entitled to invoke the equity jurisdiction
of its courts for the purpose of enforcing these restrictions.
The Indian grantors, being represented by the Government, were not necessary parties, and in the interest of the
convenient administration of justice it was competent to

embrace in one suit a class of transactions presenting the
same question for determination. Heckman v. United
States, ante, p. 413.
The question remains whether, in the execution of the
conveyances to the appellants, the restrictions imposed by
Congress have been violated.
The Dawes Commission, constituted by the act of 1893,
entered into an agreement with the Choctaws and Chickasaws-known as the Atoka agreement-which was approved by Congress and incorporated in ยง 29 of the act
of June 28, 1898. 30 Stat. 505. There was, however, a
supplemental agreement, found in the act of July 1, 1902,
32 Stat. 641, c. 1362, which contains the restrictions in
force at the time of the conveyances described in the bill.
This supplemental agreement provided that there
should be allotted to each member of the Choctaw and
Chickasaw tribes land equal in value to 320 acres of the
average allottable land of these tribes; and to each Choctaw and Chickasaw freedman, land equal in value to
forty acres. The scheme defined two classes of cases,
(1) allotments made to members of the tribes, and to
freedmen, living at the time of allotment, and (2) allotments made in the case of those whose names appeared
upon the tribal rolls but who had died after the ratification of the agreement and before the actual allotment had
been made.
With respect to allotments to living members, it was
provided that the allottee should designate 160 acres of
the allotted lands aa a homestead, for which separate
certificate and patent should issue. And the restrictions
upon the right of alienation of the allotted lands are found
in paragraphs 12, 13, 15 and 16 of the supplemental agreement, as follows:
"12. Each member of said tribes shall, at the time of
the selection of his allotment, designate as a homestead
out of said allotment land equal in value to one hundred

MULLEN v. UNITED STATES.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and sixty acres of the average allottable land of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, as nearly as may be, which
shall be inalienable during the lifetime of the allottee, not
exceeding twenty-one years from the date of certificate of
allotment, and separate certificate and patent shall issue
for said homestead.
"13. The allotment of each Choctaw and Chickasaw
freedman shall be inalienable during the lifetime of the
allottee, not exceeding twenty-one years from the date of
certificate of allotment.
"15. Lands allotted to members and freedmen shall not
be affected or encumbered by any deed, debt, or obligation of any character contracted prior to the time at which
said land may be alienated under this Act, nor shall said
lands be sold except as herein provided.
"16. All lands allotted to the members of said tribes,
except such land as is set aside to each for a homestead as
herein provided, shall be alienable after issuance of patent
as follows: One-fourth in acreage in one year, one-fourth
in acreage in three years, and the balance in five years; in
each case from date of patent; Provided, That such land
shall not be alienable by the allottee or his heirs at any
time before the expiration of the Choctaw and Chickasaw
tribal governments for less than its appraised value."
It will be observed that the homestead lands are made
inalienable "during the lifetime of the allottee, not exceeding twenty-one years from the date of certificate of allotment." The period of restriction is thus definitely limited,
and the clear implication is that when the prescribed period
expired the lands were to become alienable; that is, by
the heirs of the allottee upon his death, or by the allottee
himself at the end of the twenty-one years. Thus, with
respect to homestead lands, the supplemental agreement
imposed no restriction upon alienation by the heirs of a
deceased allottee. And the reason' may be found in the
fact that each member of the tribes--each minor child

224 U. S.

as well as each adult, duly enrolled as required-was to
have his or her allotment; so that each member was already provided with a homestead as a part of the allotment,' independently of the lands which might be acquired by descent. On the other hand, the proviso of
paragraph 16-which relates to the additional portion of
the allotment, or the so-called "surplus" lands-contains
a restriction upon alienation not only by the allottee, but
by his heirs. Whatever may have been the purpose, a
distinction was thus made with regard to the disposition
by heirs of the homestead and surplus lands respectively.
The. question now presented-with regard to the conveyances made to the appellants-arises in the second
class of cases, that is, where a person whose name appeared
upon the rolls died after the ratification of the agreement
and before receiving his allotment. In this event, provision was madefor allotment in the name of the deceased
person, and for the descent of the lands to his heirs. This is
contained in paragraph 22 of the supplemental agreement:
"22. If any person whose name appears upon the rolls,
prepared as herein provided, shall have died subsequent
to the ratification of this agreement and before receiving
his allotment of land the lands to which such person would
have been entitled if living shall be allotted in his name,
and shall, together with his proportionate share of other
tribal property, descend to his heirs. according to the laws
of descent and distribution as provided in chapter fortynine of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas:
Provided, That the allotment thus to be made shall be
selected by a duly appointed administrator or executor.
If, however, such administrator or executor be not duly
and expeditibusly appointed, or fails to act promptly
when appointed, or for any other cause such selection be
not so made within a reasonable and practicable time, the
Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes shall designate
the lands thus to be allotted."

MULLEN v. UNITED STATES.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

In the cases falling within this paragraph, there is no
requirement for the selection of any portion of the allotted
lands as a homestead, and there is no ground for supposing
that it was the intention of Congress that a provision for
such selection should be read into the paragraph so as to
assimilate it to paragraph 12 relating to allotments to living members. While the lands were to be allotted in the
name of the deceased allottee, they passed at once to his
heirs, and as each heir, if a member of the tribe, was already supplied with his homestead of 160 acres, there was
no occasion for a further selection for that purpose from
the inherited lands. No distinction is made between the
heirs; they might or might not be members of the tribe,
and where there were a number of heirs each would take
his undivided share. It is quite evident that there is no
basis for implying the requirement that in such case there
should be a selection of a portion of the allotment as a
homestead, and all the lands allotted under paragraph 22
are plainly upon the same footing. While it appears from
the record that, in the present case, separate certificates
of allotment were issued for homestead and surplus lands,
this was without the sanction of the statute.
In the agreement with the Creek Indians (act of
March 1, 1901; 31 Stat. 861, 870, c. 676) it was provided
that in the case of the death of a citizen of the tribe after
his name had been placed upon the tribal roll made by
the Commission, and before receiving his allotment, the
lands and money to which he would have been entitled,
if living, should descend to his heirs "and be allotted
and distributed to them accordingly." The question arose
whether in such cases there should be a designation of a
portion of the allotment as a homestead. In an opinion
under date of March 16, 1903, the then Assistant Attorney
General for the Interior Department (Mr. Van Devanter)
advised the Secretary of the Interior that this was not
required by the statute. He said: "After a careful con-

224 U. S.

sideration of the provisions of law pertinent to the question presented, and of the views of the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs and the Commission to the Five Civilized
Tribes, I agree with the latter that in all cases where
allotment is made directly to an enrolled citizen, it is
necessary that a homestead be selected therefrom and
conveyed to him by separate deed, but that where the
allotment is made directly to the heirs of a deceased citizen there is no reason or necessity for designating a homestead out of such lands or of giving the heirs a separate
deed for any portion of the allotment, and therefore advise the adoption of that rule." Itis true that under the
Creek agreement, in cases where the ancestor died before
allotment, the lands were to be allotted directly to the
heirs, while under the Choctaw and Chickasaw agreement
the allotment was to be made in the name of the deceased
member and "descend to his heirs." This, however, is a
merely formal distinction and implies no difference in
substance. In both cases the lands were to go immediately
to the heirs and the mere circumstance that under the
language of the statute the allotment was to be made in
the name of the deceased ancestor instead of the names of
the heirs furnishes no reason for implying a requirement
that there should be a designation of a portion of the lands
as homestead.
We have, then, a case where all the allotted lands going
to the heirs are of the same character and there is no restriction upon the right of alienation expressed in the
statute. Had the lands been allotted in the lifetime of the
ancestor, one-half of them, constituting homestead, would
have been free from restriction upon his death. The only
difficulty springs from the language of paragraph 16,
limiting the right of heirs to sell "surplus" lands. But, on
examining the context, it appears that this provision is
part of the scheme for allotments to living members, where
there is a segregation of homestead and surplus lands

MULLEN v. UNITED STATES.
224 U. S.

-Opinion of the Court.

respectively. Whatever the policy of such a distinction
which gives a greater freedom-for the disposition by heirs
of homestead lands than of the additional lands, there is
no warrant for importing it into paragraph 22 where
there is no such segregation. It would be manifestly inappropriate to imply the restriction in such cases so as to
make it applicable to all the lands taken by the heirs, and
there is no occasion, or authority, for creating a division
of the lands so as to impose a restriction upon a part of
them.
There being no restriction upon the right of alienation,
the heirs in the cases involved in this appeal were entitled
to make the conveyances. The bill alleged that the tracts
embraced in these conveyances were "allotted lands,"
and certificates of allotment had been issued. These
Indian heirs were vested with an interest in the property
which in the absence of any provision to the contrary was
the subject of sale. The fact that they were "full-blood"
Indians makes no difference in this case for, at the time of
the conveyances in question, heirs of the full-blood taking
under the provisions of paragraph 22 of the supplemental
agreement had the same right of alienation as other heirs.
It does not appear from the allegations of the bill
whether patents for the lands had been issued to the
Indian grantors before the conveyances were made. But
as the lands had been duly allotted, the right to patent
was established; and there was no restriction in cases
under paragraph 22 upon alienation of the lands prior to
the date of patent. There was undoubtedly a complete
equitable interest which, in the absence of restriction, the
owner could convey. Doe v. Wilson, 23 How. 457; Crews
v. Burcham, 1 Black, 352; Jones v. Meehan, 175 U. S. 1,
15-18. And any contention that the conveyances were
invalid, solely because they were made before the issuance
of patent-the lands not being under restriction-would
be met by the proviso contained in ยง 19 of the act of

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
224 U. S.

Syllabus.

April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137, 144, c. 1876: "Provided further, That conveyances heretofore made by members of
any of the Five Civilized Tribes subsequent to the selection of allotment and subsequent to removal of restriction,
where patents thereafter issue, shall not be deemed or
held invalid solely because said conveyances were made
prior to issuance and recording or delivery of patent or
deed; but this shall not be held or construed as affecting
the validity or invalidity of any such conveyance, except as
hereinabove provided; and every deed executed before, or
for the making of which a contract or agreement was entered into before the removal of restrictions, be and the
same is hereby, declared void."
We are therefore of the opinion that the bill is without
equity as against the appellants for the reason that the
conveyances were not executed in violation of any restrictions imposed by Congress, and that the demurrer
should have been sustained upon this ground. It follows
that, with respect to the appellants, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed an that of the
Circuit Court affirmed.
It is so ordered.
