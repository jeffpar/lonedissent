v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 332. Argued January 11, 1937.-Decided February 1, 1937.
1. A broker trading on the New York Cotton Exchange was instructed by a customer, for whose account cotton for future
delivery was being held, to transfer the account to other brokers.
The instructions were given at the request of the broker, who
wished to be relieved of the account, and no commission was
charged on the transaction. The transfer was effected, according
to the custom on the exchange in respect of all transfers from one
member to another, by the broker's delivering a "sold" memoran
dum to the transferees, and receiving a "bought" memorandum
in return. Held:
(1) The stamp tax imposed by ยง 800, Schedule A (4) of the
Revenue Act of 1926 upon "each sale, agreement of sale, or agreement to sell (not including so-called transferred or scratch sales)
โข . . at, or under the rules or usages of any exchange... for
future delivery. . . ." was applicable. P. 153.
(2) The transaction was not a "transferred" or "scratch" sale
within the meaning of the prescribed exemption. P. 152.
. (3) Under the rules and practice of the Cotton Exchange the
transaction was an actual sale. P. 153.
2. The tax imposed by ยง 800, Schedule A (4) of the Revenue Act
ol 1926 is not a tax upon the business transacted but is an excise
upon the privilege, opportunity, or facility offered at exchanges
for the transaction of the business. P. 153.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Section 800, Schedule A (4) of the Revenue Act, 1926,1
imposes a, stamp tax upon "each sale, agreement of sale,
or agreement to sell (not including so-called transferred
or scratch sales) . . . at, or under the rules or usages
of, any exchange . . .for future delivery."
Whether
the tax is payable upon a broker's transfer of a customer's account in cotton futures to another broker through
the cotton exchange is the- matter in controversy. The
Circuit Court of Appeals has held the transaction taxable.2 A conflict of decision moved us to grant certiorari. 8
Petitioners are members of a partnership trading on
the New York Cotton Exchange. On behalf of a customer they purchased cotton for future delivery. They
were instructed by the customer to transfer the account
to other brokers. To accomplish, this petitioners delivered a "sold" memorandum to ihe transferee of the
account, who,, in turn, delivered a "bought" memorandum to the petitioners. No commission was charged
because the instructions to transfer had been given at
petitioners' request, as they desired to be relieved of the
account. In order to record such a transfer with the
exchange the custom was to use bought and sold memoranda in the form invariably employed by members of
the exchange in purchase and sale of cotton for future
delivery. The petitioners affixed to the sold memorandum stamps in the proper amount and after denial
of a refund, brought action for thb amount of the tax.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

The petitioners contend that no sale, agreement of
sale or agreement to 'sell was in fact made, though for
convenience, and because of lack of other medium to
evidence the transfer, papers in form agreements of sale
were employed. The government insists that the tax
is essentially upon the privilege of using the facilities
of an exchange and petitioners here exercised this privilege and a sale was in fact made. We hold the tax was
lawfully imposed and the petitioners are not entitled to
recover the value of the stamps.
1. The transaction was not a "scratch" or "transferred" sale within the meaning of the exemption found
in the section. A scratch or transferred sale is one in
which there is an offsetting purchase and sale at the same
price on the same day. Where a broker, in order to
fill a customer's order, buys a larger amount and sells
the excess to a third broker, directing the selling broker
to deliver the excess to the broker who has purchased
it, and directing the broker who purchases the excess to
take delivery from the selling broker, the name of the
intermediate broker is erased from the records of the
exchange so that the sale of the excess appears as a sale
direct from the one to the other of the two remaining
broker . The exemption also covers trading by a scalping
broker who makes his profit in fractional movements on
the exchange, buying and selling with great rapidity,
thus often purchasing and selling the same amount of
the commodity at the same price within a few moments
or hours. By agreement amongst the members his name
is scratched out of the records of the exchange and his
ttemporary rights and liabilities do not appear upon its
records. Accordingly, the Treasury Regulations in force
since 1918 require that purchase and sale be consummated on the same day if the exemption is to apply

and that the intermediate broker instruct the broker who
sold to him to deliver to the other who bought from him.'
2. The tax is not upon the business transacted but is
an Jxcise upon the privilege, opportunity, or facility
offered at exchanges for the transaction of the business.
It is an excise upon the facilities used in the transaction
of the business separate and apart from the business
itself.' In this view it is immaterial whether the transfer
of the account constituted a sale. Unquestionably the
petitioners used the facilities of the exchange for offsetting their obligation as a purchasing broker by arranging that another broker should take over that obligation
under the rules of the exchange. Such a transaction
comes within the intent of the statute and renders petitioners liable for the tax.
3. Under the rules and practice of the Cotton Exchange the transaction taxed was an actual sale. The
fact that the sale was made for the purpose of transferring a brokerage account is irrelevant. When the petitioners purchased on the exchange the future contracts.
for their customer the selling broker handed the petitioners a memorandum agreeing to. deliver at the date
and price therein specified and the petitioners gave the
selling broker a similar purchase memorandum. This
each was required to do by the by-laws of the exchange.
As a result of the operations of the clearing house the petitioners would, at the close of the day's business, be under
obligation to pay the clearing house upon delivery being
made at the future date and they would have a correlative
right to receive from the clearing house the cotton purchased. Although the broker who made the sale to the
'Treasury Regulations 40 under R. A. 1918, Articles 23 (a) and
33 (3) (c). Treasury Regulations 71, Articles 44 (a) and 125 (3) (c).

Syllabus.

300 U. S.

petitioners would have a right to receive from his principal the necessary cotton to make delivery according
to the sale, and although the petitioners who had bought
the cotton would be under an obligation to their customer
to deliver to him, both brokers were, under the by-laws
of the exchange, principals in the transaction. When,
therefore, the customer ordered the transfer of the account the petitioners could only effect this by selling
the futures to the substituted broker who, in turn, became
obligated, so far as the exchange was concerned, as principal, to accept delivery of the cotton according to his
purchase from the petitioners. 'The obligation assumed
by the petitioners when they entered into purchase contracts could be satisfied by making payment to the clearing house or offset by selling to another broker and so
obtaining that broker's contract to take delivery of the
cotton from the clearing house. In no other way could
the petitioners relieve themselves of that obligation.
The judgment is
Affirmed.
GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY CO. v.
WASHINGTON.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON.

No. 20. Submitted October 14, 1936. Restored to the Docket
October 26, 1936. Argued December 7, 8, 1936.-Decided February 1, 1937.
1. A State may require a railroad company engaged in interstate

commerce to pay a fee, in addition to general taxati6n of its
property in the State, to cover the expense of local inspection and
supervision within the State's police power; but the exaction violates both the commerce clause and the Fourteenth Amendment
if, beyond those legitimate purposes, it is made and used to
defray the cost of other activities of the State, such as local reparation proceedings and litigation before the Interstate Commerce
Commission, in behalf of shippers. P. 159.
2. A statute (c. 107, L. Wash., 1929) requires public utilities generally, including railroads, to pay into a common fund each year
