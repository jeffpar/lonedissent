Counsel for Parties.

While the bond was under seal we need not consider
the effect to be given to this under the local law, for it
affirmatively appears that the bond was given for a
present and adequate consideration, which leads to the
same result as if the seal were given the effect which
would be accorded to it at, common law.
,It results that the judgment of the court of appeals
must be reversed and that of the district court affirmed.
Reversed.

SEVENTH

No. 255.

COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

CIRCUIT.

Argued January 5, 6, 1937.-Decided February 1, 1937.

1. Where there is substantial evidence to support a finding of the
Board of Tax Appeals upon a question of fact, its decision of such
question is conclusive upon review. P. 40.
2. Held, there was substantial evidence in this case to support the
finding of the Board in respect to the March 1, 1913 value of

cemetery lots subsequently disposed, of, and the reversal of its
decision of that question by the Circuit Court of Appeals amounted
to an unwarranted substitution of the court's judgment concerning
facts for that of the Board. P. 40.
83 F. (2d) 4, reversed; B. T. A. affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

Sewall Key and J. Louis Monarch were on the brief, for
respondent.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of
the Court.
Petitioner, in 1909, purchased one hundred and thirtyseven acres of land near Joliet, Illinois, for $60,000.00.
Thirty-seven acres were divided into plots and developed for cemetery purposes by grading, constructing
drives, planting shrubbery, etc., at a cost of $35,000.00.
Grave plots, varying in area from 150 to 1,500 square
feet, were sold from time to time under contracts for
perpetual care.
Some 36,000 square feet were disposed of during the
years 1909 to 1913 at prices ranging from 70.2 cents to
79.5 cents. The average between March 1, 1912, and
March 1, 1913, was 76.6 cents. In the three years 1926,
1927, and 1928, 42,000 square feet were sold for $1.55
to $1.77. To determine the taxable gains realized from
the latter sales it became necessary to ascertain the value
of the lots as of March 1, 1913. The petitioner's return estimated this at 76.6 cents. The Commissioner
adopted 23.96 cents and assessed deficiencies accordingly.
Upon petition for redetermination the Board Qf Tax
Appeals, after considering the evidence, approved the
76.6 cent valuation and found no deficiencies. The evidence consisted of a stipulation by counsel concerning
sales in 1909 to 1913 as detailed above, and the testimony
of the Cemetery Superintendent,
He stated the original cost of the one hundred and
thirty-seven acres, expense of development area sold in
1926, 1927, 1928, and prices obtained. He affirmed
familiarity with the property on March 1, 1913, prices
then prevailing, and stated that the sales of 1912 and
1913 were in normal course without extra effort. Also
that "the purchase price was established by my visiting

Opinion of the Court.

a good many cemeteries that I figured were practically
of the same class as that cemetery and situated near
cities of about the same population, and I established a
price from the price they were selling at." Further that
"every grave and lot in the cemetery sold since its organization is under perpetual care, and when perpetual
care is provided, it means keeping the roads and drives
in proper repair, keeping the drainage system in proper
repair, keeping the fences in repair, cutting the grass,
pruning the trees, shrubs, and keeping it in good condition." "We hope for a gradual increase in sales every
year because, as a general rule, for every head of a family
that is buried you secure four new families. That is the
rule cemetery companies have adopted." He thought it
might take seventy-five years to dispose of all lots.
The Board declared "the parties are now concerned
only with the value as of March 1, 1913, of that thirtyseven acres of petitioner's lands which have been improved and from which sales have been made." "Beyond
statements of counsel to the effect that respondent [Commissioner] has attempted by formula to reduce the value
of the improved land as of March 1, 1913, to present
value, we are uninformed as to the method by which he
chose the figures at which he fixes the basis for determining gain. Petitioner, however, has chosen as the
footage valuation as of March 1, 1913, the selling price
of its grave lots during the year just preceding that date76.6 cents-which is less than the average sales price
during the month of March, 1913. We are of opinion
that the valuation for which petitioner contends is reasonable and should be allowed. It is based upon actual sales,
and consequently comes as closely as may be to that fair
market value, so often judicially defined as the price
which property will bring when offered by a willing seller
to a willing buyer, neither being obligated to buy or sell."

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

Lots disposed of in 1912 and 1913 went with agreeinents for perpetual care; so did those sold in 1926, 1927,
and 1928; prices obtained in the latter years may be compared with those received in the earlier ones-they were
for like things.
The Commissioner asked review by the Circuit Court
of Appeals. IHe there urged that March 1, 1913, values
should be ascertained by discounting sale prices during
the preceding twelve months because of the time which
would be required in order to dispose of the whole. The
Court said: "The facts in this case necessitate the rejection of the selling price as the sole determinator of value.
Far more equitable is the selling price less discount for
years required to realize said selling price." "The Commissioner was liberal with the taxpayer." Accordingly it
reversed the Board and directed affirmance of the Commissioner's assessment.
This action, we think, amounted to an unwarranted
substitution of the Court's judgment concerning facts
for that of the Board. There was substantial evidence,
as appears above, to support the latter's conclusion, and
in such circumstances this must be accepted. It is the
function of the Board to weigh the evidence and declare
the result. We undertook to state the applicable rule in
Helvering v. Rankin, 295 U. S. 123, 131, and General
Utilities& OperatingCo. v. Helvering, 296 U. S. 200, 206.
The judgment here complained of must be reversed.
The action of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
Reversed.
