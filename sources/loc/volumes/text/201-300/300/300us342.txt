TOWING CO., INC., ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 460. Argued February 5, 8, 1937.-Decided March 1,1937.
1. The cause of action provided by the Merchant Marine Act, 46
U. S. C. 688, in connection with the Employers' Liability Act,
45 U. S. C. 51, on behalf of survivors or dependents of a seaman
who has suffered death by reason of his employer's negligence, is
not to be confused with any cause of action that may have accrued to the seaman himself between the time of his injury and
the time of his death, but is a new cause of action, enforcible by
his personal representative for the beneficiary in which the recovery is limited to the pecuniary loss sustained by the beneficiary,
through the death, as contrasted with the personal loss and suffering sustained by the decedent before his death. Pp. 344, 346.
2. A suit brought under the Merchant Marine Act, 46 U. S. C. 688,
and the Employers' Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. 51, by the administrator of a deceased mariner to compensate decedent's mother
for loss caused to her by his instantaneous death through his employer's negligence, does not abate at her death but may be
continued by the administrator of his estate (or by the administrator de bonis non if she was the administrator) for the recovery
of her pecuniary loss up to the moment of her death, the damages,
when collected, to be paid to her estate. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co.
v. Wells-Dickey Trust Co., 275 U. S. 161, distinguished. P. 347.
3. This case is not affected by statutes which regulate the continuance
of a proceeding in a court of the United States by the substitution
of the executor or administrator of a party dying while the suit is
pending. 28 U. S. C. 778. P. 350.

judgment dismissing an action by the administrator of a
deceased seaman to recover for the loss sustained by the
decedent's mother on account of his death.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. H. C. Hughes, with whom Mr. M. G. Adams was
on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. M. A. Grace for respondents.
MR.

JUSTICE CARDOZO

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (June 5, 1920, c.
250, § 33, 41 Stat. 1007; 46 U. S. C. § 688) gives a cause
of action for damages to the personal representative of a
seaman who has suffered death in the course of his employment by reason of his employer's negligence. The
question is whether the liability abates where the beneficiary of the cause of action, in this case the mother of
the seaman, dies during the pendency of a suit in her
behalf.
The steam tow-boat, Edgar F. Coney, sank on January
28, 1930, with the loss of all on board. The respondent,
Sabine Towing Company, Inc., the owner of the boat,
filed a libel in a United States District Court in Texas for
the limitation of liability. In that proceeding claims for
damages were filed by the personal representatives of
several members of the crew. Among such claims was
one for the pecuniary damage suffered through the death
of the second mate of the vessel, Edward C. Van Beeck.
He died unmarried, leaving a mother and several brothers.
There being neither wife nor child nor father, the mother
was the sole beneficiary of the statutory cause of action.
This results from the provisions of the Employers' Liability Act (45 U. S. C. § 51), governing injuries to railway
employees, which is made applicable by the Merchant
Marine Act in case of injuries to seamen. Cf. Cortes v.
Baltimore Insular Line, 287 U. S. 367, 376. The mother
was appointed administratrix of her son's estate, and acting as such administratrix filed her claim for damages.

She died in July 1931, and thereupon the petitioner, a
brother of the dead seaman, succeeded to her office by
appointment duly made, and was substituted as claimant
in the pending suit. In that suit a Commissioner reported that the mother had suffered loss up to the time
of her death in the sum of $700, and that there should be
an award of that amount for the use of her estate. The
District Court dismissed the claim on the ground that at
her death the liability abated, and the Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal. 85 F. (2d)
478. To settle the meaning of an important act of Congress, we granted certiorari.
The statutory cause of action to recover damages for
death ushered in a new policy and broke with old traditions. Its meaning is likely to be misread if shreds of the
discarded policy are treated as still clinging to it and
narrowing its scope. The case of Higgins v. Butcher,
Noy 18; Yelv. 89, which arose in the King's Bench in
1606, is the starting point of the rule, long accepted in
our law, though at times with mutterings of disapproval,'
that in an action of tort damages are not recoverable by
any one for the death of a human being.2 The rule is
often viewed as a derivative of the formula "actio personalis moritur cum personc," a maxim which "is one
of some antiquity," though "its origin is obscure and postclassical." I Even in classical times, however, the Roman
law enforced the principle that "no action of an essen'Tiffany, Death by Wrongful Act, §§ 3, 6-11; Pollock, Torts, 13th

tially penal character could be commenced after the death
of the person responsible for the injury." ' Vengeance,
though permissible during life, was not to "reach beyond
the grave." ' There was also an accepted doctrine that
no money value could be put on the life of a freeman.
The post-classical maxim, taken up by Coke and his
successors, 7 gave a new currency to these teachings of the
Digest, and, it seems, a new extension.' But the denial
of a cause of action for wrongs producing death has been
ascribed to other sources also. The explanation has been
found at times in the common law notion that trespass
as a civil wrong is drowned in a felony.' As to the adequacy of this explanation grave doubt has been expressed."0 None the less, the rule as to felony merger
seems to have coalesced, even if in a confused way, with
the rule as to abatement,1 and the effect of the two in
combination ivas to fasten upon the law a doctrine which
it took a series of statutes to dislodge.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

The adoption of Lord Campbell's Act in 1846 (9 & 10
Vict. c. 93), giving an action to the executor for the use
of wife, husband, parent or child, marks the dawn of a
new era. In this country, statutes substantially the same
in tenor followed in quick succession in one state after
another, till today there is not a state of the Union in
which a remedy is lacking.'2 Congress joined in the procession, first with the Employers' Liability Act for railway employees (45 U. S. C. §§ 51, 59), next with the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 for seamen and their survivors
(46 U. S. C. § 688), and again with an act of the same
year (March 30, 1920, c. 111, §§ 1, 2, 41 Stat. 537; 46
U. S. C. §§ 761, 762), not limited to seamen, which states
the legal consequences of death upon the high seas.
As already pointed out, the personal representative
of a seaman laying claim to damages under the Merchant
Marine Act is to have the benefit of "all statutes of the
United States conferring or regulating the right of action
for death in the case of railway employees." 46 U. S. C.
§ 688. The statutes thus referred tM as a standard display a double aspect. One of these is visible in the
Employers' Liability Act as it stood when first enacted
in 1908. Under the law as then in force (April 22, 1908,
c. 149, § 1, 35 Stat. 65; 45 U. S. C. § 51) the personal
representative does not step into the shoes of the employee, recovering the damages that would have been his
if he had lived. On the contrary, by § 1 of the statute
a new cause of action is created for the benefit of survivors or dependents of designated classes, the recovery
being limited to the losses sustained by them as contrasted with any losses sustained by the decedent."

Opinion of the Court.

However, with the adoption of an amendment in 1910
(April 5, 1910, c. 143, § 2, 36 Stat. 291; 45 U. S. C. § 59)
a new aspect of the statute emerges into view. Section 2
as then enacted continues any cause of action belonging
to the decedent, without abrogating or diminishing the1
then existing cause of action for the use of his survivors. '
"Although originating in the same wrongful act or neglect,
the two claims are quite distinct, no part of either being
embraced in the other. One is for the wrong to the
injured person and is confined to his personal loss and
suffering before he died, while the other is for the wrong
to the beneficiaries and is confined to their pecuniary
loss through his death." " It is loss of this last order,
and no other, that is the subject of the present suit. So
far as the record shows, the seaman died at once upon
the sinking of the vessel. In any event there is no claim
that his injuries were not immediately fatal." To what
extent the present problem would be altered, if intermediate loss and suffering had been made the basis of a
recovery, we have no occasion to consider. Our decision
must be limited to the necessities of the case before us.
Viewing the cause of action as one to compensate a
mother for the pecuniary loss caused to her by the negligent killing of her son, we think the mother's death does
not abate the suit, but that the administrator may continue it, for the recovery of her loss up to the moment of
her death, though not for anything thereafter,' the
damages when collected to be paid to her estate. Such
is the rule in many of the state courts in which like statutes are in force. It is the rule in New York, in Pennsylvania, in New Jersey, in Oklahoma, in Georgia, in

Kentucky, in North Carolina, and under statutes somewhat different in Connecticut and Massachusetts." It
is also the rule in the lower federal courts, applying the
statute of Illinois as well as the Act of Congress in respect of death upon the high seas.19 These cases take
the ground that "the damages awarded for the negligent
act are such as result to the property rights of the person or persons for whose benefit the cause of action was
created."
Indeed, even at common law, since statutes
adopted in the reign of Edward III (4 Edw. III, c. 7;
25 Edw. III, stat. 5, c. 5), which were extended beyond
their letter by an equitable construction, an administrator might recover where the wrong was an injury to
property and not an injury to the person.21' The general
rule was said to be that "executors and administrators
are the representatives of the temporal property, that is,
the debts and goods of the deceased, but not of their
wrongs, except where those wrongs operate to the temporal injury of their personal estate." 22 When we re'"JMeekin v. Brooklyn Heights R. Co., 164 N. Y. 145; 58 N. E. 50;

Opinion of the Court.

member that under the death statutes an independent
cause of action is created in favor of the beneficiaries for
their pecuniary damages, the conclusion is not difficult
that the cause of action once accrued is not divested or
extinguished by the death of one or more of the beneficiaries thereafter, but survives, like a cause of action for
injury to a property right or interest, to the extent that
the estate of the deceased beneficiary is proved to be impaired. To that extent, if no farther, a new property
right or interest, or one analogous thereto, has been
brought into being through legislative action. True,
there are decisions under the death statutes of some
states that teach a different doctrine, refusing to permit
a recovery by the administrator after the beneficiary has
died, 3 though the ruling has been made at times with
scant discussion of the problem. Indeed, the problem
now before us was not always presented to the attention
of the court, for at times the death of the beneficiary
followed hard upon the death of the person negligently
killed or the claim was not urged that there had been
damage in the interval. We think the cases favoring
survival within the limits already indicated are supported
by preponderant authority and also by the better reason.

At times state decisions have drawn a distinction between the death
of a beneficiary before and during suit. See, e. g., Frazier v. Georgia
R. R. & Banking Co., supra. The validity of that distinction is
irrelevant to the case at hand. Cf. however, Chicago, B. & Q. R.

Opinion of the Court.

300 U. S.

Nothing at war with that conclusion will be found in
our opinion in Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v.
Wells-Dickey Trust Co., 275 U. S. 161, on which the
court below leant heavily in deciding as it did. The suit
was under the Employers' Liability Act which gives a
cause of action (a) to the widow or children; (b) to the
parents if no widow or children survive; or (c) to dependent next of kin, if there be no surviving widow, child
or parent. A mother survived the employee, but died
before an administrator was appointed. The holding
was that the beneficial interest did not shift upon her
death to members of class (c). "The failure to bring
the action in the mother's lifetime did not result in creating a new cause of action after her death for the benefit
of the sister." 275 U. S. at p. 164.24 The question was
not raised whether the damages, if any, suffered by the
mother between the son's death and her own would have
been recoverable, if proved. Nor is the case at hand affected by statutes, invoked by the respondent, which regulate the continuance of a proceeding in a court of the
United States by the substitution of the executor or
administrator of a party dying while the suit is pending.

party was made without objection, and he continued in
the suit thereafter as if he had filed a claim anew.
Death statutes have their roots in dissatisfaction with
the archaisms of the law which have been traced to their
origin in the course of this opinion. It would be a misfortune if a narrow or grudging process of construction
were to exemplify and perpetuate the very evils to be

remedied.2 ' There are times when uncertain words are
to be wrought into consistency and unity with a legislative policy which is itself a source of law, a new generative impulse transmitted to the legal system. "The Legislature has the power to decide what the policy of the
law shall be, and if it has intimated its will, however
indirectly, that will should be recognized and obeyed." 1
Its intimation is clear enough in the statutes now before
us that their effects shall not be stifled, without the warrant of clear necessity, by the perpetuation of a policy
which now has had its day. 8
