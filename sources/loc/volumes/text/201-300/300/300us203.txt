CO. v. REESE

ET AL.*

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 440.

Argued January 15, 1937.-Decided February 1, 1937.

1. Fraud in the procurement of insurance is provable as a defense
in an action at law upon the policy. P. 212.
2. A "contest," within the purview of a provision .of a life insurance policy that it shall be incontestable after a period defined, has
generally been held to mean a present contest in a court, not a

notice of repudiation or of a contest to be waged thereafter.
P. 212.
3. No action at lav having been brought on the policy, an insurer
whose attack upon the ground of fraud is endangered by the
running of the time limited by the policy for contest may sue in

equity for cancelation. P. 212.

204

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Argument for Petitioner.

300 U. S.

In the present cases the period allowed for contest was two
years from the date of the two policies. The Insurance Company's suits for cancelation were brought when six months and
ten days of that period had passed.
4. Where equity can give relief, plaintiff ought not to be compelled
to speculate upon his chance of obtaining relief at law, or to
incur the danger that witnesses may disappear and evidence be
lost if he waits to be sued by his antagonist. P. 213.
5. A remedy at law does not exclude one in equity unless it is
equally prompt and certain and in other ways efficient. P. 214.
6. A remedy at law is not adequate if its adequacy depends upon
the will of the opposing party. P. 214.
7. Equitable jurisdiction existing at the filing of the bill is not destroyed by the subsequent availability of an adequate legal
remedy. P. 215.
In these cases the equity jurisdiction which attached on the
filing of the bills by the Insurance Company, was not lost when
actions on the policies were brought in the same court; though the
court, if requested, might have tried the law suits first.
80 F. (2d) 600; 85 id. 791, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 299 U. S. 536, to review the reversal of
decrees for the cancelation and surrender of policies of life
insurance.

Mr. William C. Michaels, with whom Messrs. Earle W.

Evans and Joseph G. Carey were on the brief, for

petitioner.
Cancellation of instruments procured by fraud is a wellsettled field of equity jurisdiction. The incontestable
clause required contest in court to preserve petitioner's
rights, and no law action was pending at the time the
bills were filed in which contest could be made by answer.
These facts demonstrate that petitioner did not have any

remedy at law, adequate or otherwise, and presented a
"special circumstance" authorizing petitioner to bring its

When a court of equity properly acquires jurisdiction
it will retain it until complete justice is done between the
parties. McGowan v. Parish, 237 U. S. 285, 296;
Alexander v. Hillman, 296 U. S. 222, 242; 21 C. J. 134,

Whether an equity court has jurisdiction depends on
the facts and circumstances existing at the time the bill
is filed and not on those that may subsequently develop.
A remedy at law cannot be adequate if its adequacy depends upon thewill of the opposing party. Boyce's
Executors v. Grundy, 3 Pet. 210, 215; Sullivan v. Portland R. Co., 94 U. S. 806, 811; Dawson v. Kentucky

U. S. 598, 600; Clark v. Wooster, 119 U. S. 322, 325; Bank
of Kentucky v. Stone, 88 Fed. 383, 391.
The case i§ controlled by the rule announced by this
Court in Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., 255 U. S.
288, 296, that equitable jurisdiction is not "lost because
since the filing of the bill an adequate legal remedy may
have become available." See also Busch v. Jones, 184
U. S.598, 600.
The foregoing points have been the subject of discussion and decision in policy cancellation cases, similar to
the ones at bar, in other Circuit Courts of Appeals, and
such decisions declare the principles above stated. This
decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth

Mr. Charles G. Yankey for respondents.
The claims were pure legal claims and the defenses
legal defenses. Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., 293
U. S. 379; Adamos v. New York Life Ins. Co., 293 U. S.
386. The beneficiaries were guaranteed a right to trial
by jury. Const., Seventh Amendment; Judiciary Act,
c. 20, § 16, 1 Stat. 82; Jud, Code, § 267; 28 U. S. C. 384.
The right of the court of equity to intercede was
entirely dependent upon the possible or threatened loss
of complainant's defense, if a controversy was not instituted within the period allowed. Necessarily, the
right was dependent entirely upon the probability of
losing it. See Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hurni Packing
Co., 263 U. S. 167, and cases cited in Enelow v. New York
Life Ins. Co., 293 U. S. 379, 384.
Under the allegations, we have merely an abstract
question; at most a mere apprehension or fear of a remote
injury. No allegations are made or facts stated to justify
even an inference that the beneficiaries would not
commence actions within the period.
This case is of that type of equity jurisdiction which is
to prevent injury as distinguished from the types which
determine controversies and adjudicate rights dependent
upon facts which have occurred. It is a fixed principle
that the occurrence or continuance of the injury must be
probable and imminent. Connecticut v. Massachusetts,

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Argument for Respondents.

300 U. S.

The Insurance Company has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court in the law actions by filing motions
to stay proceedings. Moreover, the following wellconsidered cases hold that the legal remedy of the Insu, ance Company became plain, adequate and complete
notwithstanding the pendency of the equity suits, upon
the filing of the law actions within the contbst period
by the respondents. Great Southern Life Ins. Co. v.
Burwell, 12 F. (2d) 244, cert. den., 271 U. S. 683; New
York Life Ins. Co. v. McCarthy, 22 F. (2d) 241; New
York Life Ins. Co. v. Thompson, 78 F. (2d) 940; Rohrbach v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 82 F. (2d) 291. And see
Griesa v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 169 Fed. 509, cert. den.,

U. S. 379; Adamos v. New York Life Ins: Co., 293 U. S.
386.
The motions to dismiss were considered as leveled at
both the original and the supplemental bills herein,
since the application fo injunction against the prosecution of the law actions, which came on for hearing at
the same time, is found only in the supplemental bills.
The supplemental bills recite that the law actions
have been filed by the respondents. Therefore, the
pleadings of the petitioner show upon their face that
petitioner had a plain, adequate and, complete remedy
at law within the contestable period, at the time the
motions to dismiss were considered. Under *such circumstances it is held that the actions to cancel the policies for fraud will not be entertained in a court of equity.

Argument for Respondents.

Rohrbach v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 82 F. (2d) 291; New
York Life Ins. Co. v. Thompson, 78 F. (2d) 946.
The records show the actions at law upon the policies
were at issue two months and twenty-three days before
the trial of these equity suits in the same court, and four
months and thirteen days before the expiration of the
contest period. The Insurance Company had thus
instituted a contest of the policies in actions at law.
A dismissal of the law actions thereafter would not deprive the company of the benefit of that c6ntest. Cable
v. United States Life Ins. Co., 191 U. S. 288, 309; New
York Life Ins. Co. v. Miller, 73 F. (2d) 350; New York
Life Ins. Co. v. Hurt, 35 F. (2d) 92, 96; Thomas v. Life
Insurance Co., 135 Kan. 381.
Moreover, the Insurance Company after the pendency
of the law action could plead as a counterclaim or crosspetition the very same cause of action which is set out in
the bill of complaint to cancel the policy for fraud. By
the Kansas Code of Procedure, the dismissal of an action
by the plaintiff does not dismiss any counterclaim pleaded
by the defendant. See Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Walker,
123 Wash. 203.
Respondents did not waive the right to trial by jury.
Jurisdiction in equity upon the ground that the complainant is without an adequate remedy at law, cannot be
conferred by consent or waiver. Jud. Code, § 267; 28
U. S. C. 384.
Whenever at any stage it appears that there is a plain,
adequate and complete remedy at law, the court must
dismiss the suit and leave the parties to their legal remedy, even though the point is not raised by the pleading,'s
nor suggested by counsel. Hipp v. Babin, 19 How. 279;

U. S. 316.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In these cases suits have been brought for the cancellation of policies of life insurance on the ground of
fraud in their procurement, the policies providing that
they shall cease to be contestable unless contest shall be
begun within a stated time. The question to be determined is the existence, in the circumstances, of a remedy
in equity.
On February 23, 1932, petitioner, a Colorado corporation, issued to Reese Smith Stewart, a citizen of Kansas,
two policies of life insurance, each for $5,000, one payable to his son, who is a respondent in No. 440, and the
other payable to his wife, who is a respondent in No.
441. Each policy contains a provision that it "shall be
incontestable, except for non-payment of the premium,
after one year from its date of issue if the Insured be
then living, otherwise after two years from its date of
issue." On May 31, 1932, three months and eight days
after obtaining the insurance, the insured died, having
made in his application fraudulent misstatements, or so
the insurer charges, as to his health and other matters
material to the risk. On September 3, 1932, the insurer
brought suit to cancel the insurance, a separate suit for
each policy, the executrix of the insured being joined as a
defendant with the respective beneficiaries. The complaint in each suit refers in a paragraph numbered 8 to
the provision that the policy shall be incontestable after
the lapse of two years. In the same paragraph it states

in substance that the beneficiary may delay the commencement of the action at law till the time for contest

Opinion of the Court.

has gone by, or, beginnin~g such an action within the
period, may afterwards dismiss it and then begin anew.
The insurer asks the court to act while yet the barrier
is down.
On September 26, 1932, the defendants moved in each
suit to dismiss the bill for want of equity. On October
11, 1932, the beneficiaries began actions at law in the
same court to recover the insurance. On October 29, the
insurer filed its supplemental bills setting forth the pendency of the actions at law, and praying an injunction
against their continued prosecution. On July 28, 1933,
the District Court denied the motions to dismiss, without
passing, however, on motions made by the insurer to
enjoin the actions at law. On August 29, a stipulation
was signed and filed in each case that "the suit in equity
shall be tried" by the court "before said law action is
tried, Provided, however, that the issues in said law
action shall in the meantime be made up in order that
said law issues thus joined shall stand ready for trial,
with the understanding that said law issues, if any remain
for trial, shall be tried as soon after the trial of the suit
in equity as the court shall determine," and this stipulation was approved by the court and an order made accordingly. On October 10, 1933, the defendants in each
of the equity suits filed their answers to the bills, denying
the fraud, admitting the making of the "incontestability
clause" as stated in paragraph 8, and as to the other
allegations of that paragraph denying any knowledge
or information sufficient to form a belief. The answers
did not state that the remedy at law was adequate.
Upon the trial of the suits in equity, the District Court
found the fraudulent representations charged in the complaints, and decreed the cancellation and surrender of the
policies. There was an appeal to the Court of Appeals
for the Tenth Circuit, where the decree was reversed,
one judge dissenting, the court holding that the insurer

had an adequate remedy at law. 80 F. (2d) 600; 85 F.
(2d) 791. We granted certiorari to settle an important
question, and one likely to recur, as to the scope of
equitable remedies.
No doubt it is the rule, and one recently applied in
decisions of this court, that fraud in the procurement of
insurance is provable as a defense in an action at law
upon the policy, resort to equity being unnecessary to
render that defense available. Enelow v. New York Life
Ins. Co., 293 U. S. 379, 385; Adanos v. New York Life
Ins. Co., 293 U. S. 386; Insurance Co. v. Bailey, 13 Wall.
616; Cable v. United States Life Ins. Co., 191 U. S. 288,
306. That being so, an insurer, though the victim of a
fraud, may commonly stand aside and await the hour of
attack. But this attitude of aloofness may at times be
fraught with peril. If the policy is to become incontestable soon after the death of the insured, the insurer becomes helpless if he must wait for a move by some one
else, who may prefer to remain motionless till the time
for contest has gone by. A "contest" within the purview
of such a contract has generally been held to mean a
present contest in a court, not a notice of repudiation or
of a contest to be waged thereafter. See, e. g., Killian
v. MetropolitanLife Ins. Co., 251 N. Y. 44, 48; 166 N. E.
798; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Hurt, 35 F. (2d) 92, 95;
Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Ins. Co., 72
F. (2d) 921, 922. Accordingly an insurer, who might
otherwise be condemned to loss through the mere inaction of an adversary, may assume the offensive by
going into equity and there praying cancellation. This
exception to the general rule has been allowed by the
lower federal courts with impressive uniformity.' It

only recently in an opinion of this court, though the facts
were not such as to call for its allowance. Enelow v.

The argument is made, .however, that the insurer, even
if privileged to sue in equity, should not have gone
there quite so quickly. Six months and ten days had
gone by since the policies were issued. There would be
nearly a year and' a half more before the bar would
become absolute. But how long was the insurer to wait
before assuming the offensive, and how was it to know

"The instant case is not one in which there is resort to equity
for cancellation of the policy during the life of the insured and no
opportunity exists to contest liability at law. Nor is it a case where,
although death may have occurred, action has not been brought to
recover upon the policy, and equitable relief is sought to protect the
insurer against loss of its defense by the expiration of the period after
which the policy by its terms is to become incontestable."

Opinion of the Court.

where the beneficiaries would be if it omitted to strike
swiftly? Often a family breaks up and changes its abode
after the going of its head. The like might happen to
this family. To saythat the insurer shall keep watch
of the coming and going of the survivors is to charge it
with a heavy burden. The task would be hard enough
if beneficiaries were always honest. The possibility of
bad faith, perhaps concealed and hardly provable, accentuates the difficulty. There are statements by judges
of repute which suggest a possibility that the contest
barrier may stand though the holder of the policy has
gone to foreign lands. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Panagiotopoulos, 80 F. (2d) 136, 139. There are statements
that it will stand though an action at law, brought within
the period, had been dismissed or discontinued later.
See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Seymour, 45 F. (2d) 47,
48; Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Itis. Co.,
72 F. (2d) 921, 925; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Truesdale, 79 F. (2d) 481, 485, with which contrast New York

(2d) 864, and Powell v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 313 Ill.
161, 170; 144 N. E. 825. Whether such statements go
too far we are not required to determine, for a slight
variance in the facts, as, e. g., in the rule prevailing in
the jurisdiction where the final suit is brought, may have
a bearing on the conclusion. At least in such warnings
there are possibilities of danger which a cautious insurer
would not put aside as visionary. "Where equity can
give relief plaintiff ought not to be compelled to speculate upon the chance of his obtaining relief at law."
Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U. S. 6S0, 688. To this must be
added the danger that witnesses may disappear and evidence be lost. A remedy at law does not exclude one in
equity unless it is equally prompt and certain and in
other ways efficient. Boyce's Executors v. Grundy, 3

Co. v. Weld County, 247 U. S.282, 287. "It must be a
remedy which may be resorted to without impediment
created otherwise than by the act of the party." Cable
v. United States Life Ins. Co., supra, at p. 303. Here the
insurer had no remedy at law at all except at the pleasure of an adversary. There was neither equality in efficiency nor equality in certainty nor equality in promptness. "The remedy at law cannot be 'adequate if its
adequacy depends upon the will of the opposing party."
Bank of Kentucky v. Stone, 88 Fed. 383, 391; cf. Lincoln
National Life Ins. Co. v. Hammer, 41 F. (2d) 12, 16.
To make a contract incontestable after the lapse of a
brief time is to confer upon its holder extraordinary
privileges. We must be on our guard against turning
them into weapons of oppression.
The argument is made that the suits in equity should
have been dismissed when it appeared upon the trial that
after the filing of the bills, and in October, 1932, the beneficiaries of the policies had sued on them at law. But
the settled rule is that equitable jurisdiction existing at
the filing of a bill is not destroyed because an adequate
legal remedy may have become available thereafter.

Lincoln National Life Ins. Co. v..Hammer, supra; New
York Life Ins. Co. v. Seymour, supra. There is indeed,
a possibility that the bringing of actions at law might
have been used by the respondents to their advantage if
they had not chosen by a stipulation to throw the possibility away. A court has control over its own docket.
Landis v. North American Co,, 299 U. S. 248. In the
exercise of a sound discretion it may hold one lawsuit in
abeyance to abide the outcome of another,. especially
where the parties and the issues are the 'same. Ibid. If
request had been made by the respondents to suspend

the suits in equity till the other causes were disposed of,
the District Court could have considered whether justice
would not be done by pursuing such a course, the remedy
in equity being exceptional and the outcome of necessity.
Cf. Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Ins. Co.,
72 F. (2d) 921, 922, 923. There would be many circumstances to be weighed, as, for instance, the condition of
the court calendar, whether the insurer had been precipitate or its adversaries dilatory, as well as other factors.
In the end, benefit and hardship would have to be set off,
the one against the other, and a balance ascertained.
Landis v. North American Co., supra. But respondents,
as already indicated, gave that possibility away. They
stipulated that the issues in equity should be tried in advance of .those at law, and that only such issues, if any,
as were left should be disposed of later on. The cases
were allowed to stand as if challenge to the suits had been
made by a demurrer only. So challenged, they prevail.
The decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded
to the Court of Appeals for a cohsideration of the merits
and for other proceedings in accord with this opinion.
