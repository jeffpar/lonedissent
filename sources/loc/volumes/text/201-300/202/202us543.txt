McNEILL v. SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY.
SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY v. McNEILL.
APPEAL AND CROSS APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES FOR .THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA.
Nos. 370, 594.

Argued April 2,3, 1906.-Decided May 28, 1906.

Although the dispute which was the origin of the controversy involved
less than $2,000, where the controversy presented by the bill involves
the right of enforcement of statutory penalties against complianant
of over $2,000, and also its right to carry on interstate business within
the State, which is worth more than $2,000, the Circuit Court has jurisdiction so far as the amount in controversy is concerned.
A suit brought by a railway company against the members of a state railway commission to restrain them from interfering with complainant's
property and interstate business under a state statute alleged in the bill
to be unconstitutional as imposing burdens on interstate commerce is
not a suit against the State within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment.
The interstate transportation of cars from another State which have not
been delivered to the consignee, but remain on the track of the railway
company in the condition in which they were originally brought into
the State, is not completed and they are still within the protection of the
commerce clause of the Constitution.
While a State in the exercise of its police power may confer power on an
administrative agency to make reasonable regulations as to. the place,
time and manner of delivery of merchandise moving in channels of interstate commerce, any regulation which directly burdens interstate
commerce is a regulation thereof and repugnant to the Federal Constitution, and so held that an order of the North Carolina Corporation Commission requiring a railway company to deliver cars from another State
to the consignee on a private siding beyond its own right of way was
a burden on interstate commerce and void.
Quwre whether such an order applicable solely to state business would be
repugnant to the due process clause of the Constitution.
An injunction granted by the final decree should not be broader than the
necessities of the case require and if broader than that it will be modified,
as in this case, by this court.

Statement of the Case.

202 U. S.

THE Southern Railway Company, a corporation organized
under the laws of the State of Virginia, operates among others
a line of railway passing through Greensboro, North Carolina.
At that place the Greensboro Ice and Coal Company, during
the times hereafter mentioned, had a coal and wood yard,
located some distance from the main track and right of way
of the railroad. From this main track, however, there was a
piivate siding or spur track extending across the land of private persons to the establishment of the ice and coal company.
In consequence of the views expressed in the opinion it is unnecessary to review the facts as to the construction of this
spur track or to detail the course of dealing between the parties
concerning it prior to the origin of this controversy. Certain
it is that at one time the railroad delivered cars consigned to
the ice and coal company from its main track on to the spur
track in question. A dispute arose between the railway company and the ice and coal company concerning demurrage on
thirteen cars containing coal and wood consigned to the latter
company. In consequence of the refusal of the ice and coal
company topay these charges the railway, on October 12, 1903,
notified the ice and coal company that after October 17, 1903,
it would only deliver cars consigned to the ice and coal company on the public tracks of the railway company at a place
known as the team track, set aside for the delivery to the public generally of merchandise of that character. After receiving this notice the ice and coal company ordeied four cars of
coal from points in the States of Pennsylvania, West Virginia
and Tennessee. These cars reached Greensboro between October 18, 1903, and October 22, 1903, were placed upon the
team track, and delivery was tendered to the ice and coal company. That company, however, declined to receive or unload
the cars elsewhere than on the siding above referred to. An
informal complaint on the subject was made by letter on October 20, 1903, to the North Carolina Corporation Commission,
composed of the appellants, Franklin McNeill, Samuel L. Rogers and Eugene C. Beddingfield. After conversations had with

McNEILL v. SOUTHERN RAILWAY CO.

Statement of the Case.

officers of the railway company, the comnission, on October 31,
1903, made an order requiring the-railway company, upon payment of freight charges, to make delivery of the cars beyond
its right of. way and- on the siding referred to. Hearing was
had, on exceptions filed on behalf of the railway company, and
on December 10,. 1903, the, commission made an order overruling the exceptions.. The railway. company appealed to the
Circuit Court' of Guilford County.
In the meantime, on November 2, 1903, after demurrage or
car, service charges had attached in respect to the four cars of
coal,, and to prevent unnecessary interference with its other
business, the, -railway,, company, removed the cars in question from. the team track and placed. them on a distant
siding.

By.chapter 164 ,of the Public Laws of North Carolina for
1899, 'creating the. corporation commission, and by the acts
amendatory thereof, as, contained in chapter 20, revisal of
1905, as amended in 1905, it .was provided as follows:
"1086. For violating rules.-If, anyrailroad company doing
business in this State by its agents or employds shall be guilty
of a violation of the rules and regulations provided and prescribed by the commission, and if after due notice of such violation given to the principal ;officers thereof, if residing in the
State,..or,, if not; to thefmanager or superintendent or secretary
,or treasurer if residing in the State, or if not, then to any local
agent thereof, ample and full. recompense. or the wrong or injury,.done thereby, to any person or ,cor'poration as may be
directed ,by the commission shall not be nade within thirty
days from the time, of. such nptice, such, company shall incur a
.penalty for each offense of five hundred dollars;. (1899, c. 164,
"1087. -Refusing to obey, orders, of commission.-Any rail.road. or other corporation which ,violates any of the provisions
of this chapter or refuses to. conform to or obey any rule, order
or regulation of the corporation commission shall, in addition

pay the sum of five hundred dollars for each offense, to be recovered in an action to be instituted in the Superior Court of
Wake County, in the name of the State of North Carolina on
the relation of the corporation commission; and each day such
company continues to violate any provision of this chapter, or
continues to refuse to obey or-perform any rule, order or regulation prescribed by the corporation commission shall be a
separate offense. (1899, c. 164, s. 23.)
"1091. Violation of rules, causing injury; damages; limitation.-If any railroad company doing business in this State
shall, in violation of any rule or regulation provided by the
commission, inflict any wrong or injury on any person, such
person shall have a right of action and recovery for such wrong
6r injury in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the damages to be recovered shall be the same as in an action between
individuals, except that in case of willful violation of law such
railroad company shall be liable to exemplary damages: Provided, that all suits under this chapter shall be brought within
one year after the commission of the alleged wrong or injury.
(1899, c. 164;'s. 16.)"
On January 5, 1904, the bill in this case was filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of
North Carolina to perpetually enjoin the bringing of actions
by the ice and coal company and by the commission to recover
penalties or damages under the authority of the aforesaid statutory provisions, because of the noncompliance of the railway
company with the order of the commission. As grounds for
the relief prayed it was averred that the railway company had
a common defense based upon the commerce clause of the
Constitution of the United States, the provisions of the act of

Congress to regulate commerce and the due -process clause of
the Constitution, and also because the corporation commission
was an illegal body, as it was empowered to exercise judicial,
executive and legislative functions contrary to the Constitutions of the State and of the United States. After the filing

of answers the cause was referred to a master to report the
testimony and findings of fact to the court. The court, concluding that the order of the corporation commission was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution, entered
a decree in favor of the railway company and perpetually enjoined the enforcement of the order of the corporation corn-,
mission and the bringing of actions to recover penalties or
damages for a violation of that order. 134 Fed. Rep. 82.
The corporation commission and the ice and coal company
appealed and the railway company prosecuted a cross appeal
upon the ground that the court below erred in not deciding
that the corporation commission was an unconstitutional body
because of the alleged mixed and peculiar character of the
functions conferred upon it by the state statutes.

in No. 370 and appellees in No. 594:
The amount involved was less than $2,000, and the Circuit

The act of the general assembly of North Carolina constituting the corporation commission was not void as being in violation of the constitution of the State.
The act under which the North Carolina Corporation Commission was organized, and is exercising its functions for the
benefit of the people of the State, is, in its essential particulars,
so far as it relates to railway companies, but a rescript of the
laws establishing the North Carolina Railroad Commission and
making it a court of record (Laws of 1891, 'chapter 320 and
chapter 498); and the acts establishing both the railroad commission and the corporation commission have been expressly
declared to be constitutional by the Supreme Court. And like
statutes, under which railroad commissions in other States
have been organized, have been upheld by this court. Railroad

The necessary diversity of citizenship exists, all of defendants being citizens and residents of a different State from that

The amount or matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value
of $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is properly alleged. See Blackburn v. Portland Gold Mining Co., 175 U. S.

case at bar by any special plea to the jurisdiction, it must be
held under the rulings of this court that the facts sufficient to
establish the jurisdiction are admitted when properly averred
in the bill, as in the case here.
Both the master and the Circuit Judge have held that this
suit involves the right of Southern Railway Company to conduct and manage its interstate business at Greensboro, North
Carolina, and to dispose of its rolling stock, and to distribute
it, and to refuse or permit its cars to be placed on private sidings, according to its reasonable rules and regulations, and that
said right is of incalculable value to Southern Railway Corn-

This is not a suit against the State of North Carolina. A

authority of an unconstitutional statute, is not a suit against
the State. Scott v. Donald, 165 U. S. 107 and cases cited;
Belknap v. Schild, 161 U. S.10, 18.
The equities of this bill are to prevent irreparable injury and
a multiplicity of suits to which Southern Railway Company has
a common defense, involving questions of law common to all
said suits.
Where a failure to obey an order made by. a state railroad
commission, which was unauthorized and void, would under
the state statutes, subject the company, in its daily business,
to large numbers of individual actions, and to heavy penalties',
a court of equity has jurisdiction of a suit to enjoin enforcement
of such order, on the ground that its decree will avoid. a inultiplicity of suits and afford a more efficacious remedy than can
be had at law. Dinsmore v. So. Express Co., 92 Fed. Rep. 714,

The Supreme Court of North Carolina has directly held that
the corporation commission of North Carolina is not a "judicial court." State ex rel. Caldwell v. Wilson, 121 N. Car. 425;
State v. Wilmington and Weldon R. R. Co., 122 N. Car. 877.
The four cars of coal in question were and are articles of interstate commerce and beyond control of North Carolina Corporation Commission. Where the articles are still in the cars
and undelivered, they are subjects of interstate commerce, and
tlie transfer of said articles from the car to the depot or station
is a part of the interstate transportation. In the case at bar
it will be noted that even such transfer had not taken place,
and unquestionably the interstate transportation was uncompleted. Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U. S. 412; Wall v. N. & W. R. R.
Co., 52 W.- Va. 485; Connery v. Railroad Co., 92 Minnesota, 20.

Furthermore, the act to regulate commerce, itself, provides
that it shall and does apply to the "transportation of passengers
or property"

.

.

.

"from one State or Territory of the

United States or the District of Columbia, to any other State
or Territory of the United States or the District of Columbia,
or from any place in the United States to an adjacent foreign
country," etc. Congress having legislated no state regulations can apply. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Hefley, 158 U. S.
98; Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Miami S. S. Co., 86 Fed. Rep.
407. Switching and terminal charges are exclusively covered

An article of interstate commerce remains wholly free from
such state control, as long as it is in the original package. Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100. Unquestionably coal

tion to interstate commerce. Act of March 6, 1899, c. 164, § 14.
See also McGwigan v. Railroad Co., 95 N. Car. 428. '
The rules of the North Carolina Corporation Commission as
to placing cars loaded with interstate freight, and its orders to
place the four cars of interstate freight now in question are void
because they interfere with interstate commerce; because they
deal with a subject National in its character, requiring uniform
treatment throughout the United States, and a subject over
which the action of Congress is exclusive, the States being powerless to interfere at all; and because Congress has in fact legislated on this particular subject, and the field is exclusively
occupied by existing acts of the Federal Government.
This court has never separated the cases into those which
aid interstate commerce and those which interfere with interstate commerce, and it has never held that the States may pass
acts in aid of commerce, while they are forbidden to pass acts
interfering with commerce. The only classification -of cases
ever made by this court were the three classes set forth in
Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, 154 U. S.204, 209, where it divides
them as follows:
First, those in which the power of the State is exclusive;
second, those in which the States may act in the absence
of legislation by Congress; third, those in which the action
of Congress is exclusive and the States cannot interfere
at all.
The case of Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, 154 U. S.204, has beei
cited and reaffirmed in the following cases. W. U. Tel. Co. v.

has been cited and reaffirmed in many cases, holding that the
times and modes of delivery of interstate freight are not. the
subject of state regulation.
This court has never disturbed its rulings in the Wabash case,
and while some state statutes indirectly affecting interstate
commerce have been sustained it will be found that they in no
way conflict with or modify the doctrine laid down.. This will
more clearly -appear by reference to some of the cases decided
by this court sustaining certain state statutes.
Animals having contagious diseases may be excluded from
a State: M., K. & T. R. Co. v. Haber, 169 U. S. 613, Reid v.

way at cities containing 3,000 inhabitants, has been upheld:
L. S. & M. S. R. Co. v. Ohio, 173 U. S. 285; requiring'a physical connection of tracks by two different railroads: Wisconsin &c. R. Co. v. Jacobson, 179 U. S. 287.
See the following cases where the regulations are held invalid. I. C. R. R. Co. v. Illlinois, 163 U. S. 142, where a statute of Illinois was declared void because it attempted to require an interstate express train from Chicago to New Orleans
to go three and one half miles out of its way and deviate from
its course so as to stop at Cairo' Ill. Likewise a statute
of Illinois requiring all passenger trains to stop at stations.
C. C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Illinois, 177 U. S. 514.
In Central Stock Yards Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R.
Co., i92 U. S.568, an attempt to compel the cars and freight
received from one State tobe delivered to another at a particular place and in a particular way was held an interference
with interstate commerce and the constitution of Kentucky
was impotent to produce Any such result.
The rules of the corporation commission governing loading
and unloading interstate freight, are in conflict with the Interstate Commerce Law, and must yield. Gul/, C. & S. F. R. R.
v. Hefley, 158 U. S. 98; L. & N. R. R. Co. v. Eubank, 184 U. S.

Rep. 113.
It was also held by the commission that the Commerce Act
covers demurrage, storage, teruinal charges, and the distribution of cars, in so far as interstate freight is concerned, in the
following cases. Riddle et al. v. Pittsburg & L. E. R. R. Co.,

Railroads have the right to make reasonable rules and regulations for the conduct of their traffic in their own interests
and that of the public. Harp v. Choctaw, 0. & G. R. R. Co.,
125 Fed. Rep. 445; Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R., 129
Fed. Rep. 753; Stock Yards Co. v. Keith, 139 U. S. 128; Donovan v. Pennsylvania Co., 199 U. S. 279.
No legislation can supersede the president, general managers,
traffic officials and other officers of railway companies charged
by the owners with the conduct of the company's business, but
the power of the legislature is limited solely to the protection
of the health, safety and convenience of the public, and the
term "convenience" is not to be construed into the right of
the, legislature to usurp the management of the company.
Lake Shore &c. Ry. Co. v. Smith, 173 U. S. 684.
It would -be-intolerable if a railway company should at any
moment be subjected to orders by telegram from railway commissions to take cars out of trains at any points designated by
said commissions and place them upon spur or side-tracks.
Such action would disarrange the entire schedules of the railway
company throughout its system. It-would demoralize the service and endanger the safe conduct and movement of the trains,
and would supersede the authority of the Officers of the company and practically usurp the management of the railway.
A carrier is not obliged to receive or deliver freight at a mere
switch track. The switch of the Greensboro Ice and Coal Company was not built under any order of the corporation commission or any state authority, nor was there any contract re-

quiring such delivery. Charnock v. Texas & Pacific Ry., 194
U. S. 432.
A railway company is not a common carrier as to private
sidings or spur tracks, and the State has no power to force a
railroad company to deliver its cars thereon. Mann v. Pere
MarquetteR. Co., 135 Michigan, 210, 219; S.C., 97 N..W. Rep.
721, 724, and cases cited; Jones v. Newport News &c. R. Co.,
65 Fed. Rep. 136; Mercantile Trust Co. v. Columbus S. & H.
R. Co., 91 Fed. Rep. 148.
The proceedings before the corporation commission were
not clue process of law. The statute creates a body combining
the three functions of government-legislative, executive and
judicial.
The power to make rates is unquestionably a legislative function. Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 144; Peik v. R. R. Co.,
94 U. S. 164, 168; R. R. Co. v. Express Co., 117 U. S. 1; R. R.
Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S.418; Reagan v. Farmers' L. & T.
Co, 154 U. S.362; R. R. Co. v. Gill, 156 U. S. 649; R. R. Co.
v. I. C. C., 162 U. S.184; I. C. C. v. R. R. Co., 167 U. S.479;
I. C. C. v. R. R. Co., 168 U. S. 144.
Assessment of property for taxation is an executive function.
County of Upshur v. Rich, 135 U. S.467.
It is clear that the legislative intent was not to create a body
to exercise alone either the judicial, the executive or the legislative functions conferred upon North Carolina Corporation
Commission, but the object of the entire legislation was to create a body that could exercise all of the functions conferred
upon it, consequently it is impossible to separate one portion
of the act from the other and declare that void, but the entire
act must fall. Trade-mark Cases, 100 U. S.82; United States
v.Reese, 92 U. S.214; Connolly v. Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540, 565.
It necessarily follows that an order of any such unconstitutional body is void for it has been settled beyond question that
an unconstitutional law cannot create even a de facto officer and
that no office at all exists under an unconstitutional statute.
Norton v. Shelby County, 118-U. S 4-25.

after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE,

The legal principle which controls the determination of this
cause renders it unnecessary to state many of the facts contained in this voluminous record or to consider and pass .upon
a. number of the legal propositions urged in the cause. But
three questions are essential to be passed upon. They are,
First. Whether the record discloses that the matter in dispute
exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of
,two thousand dollars. Second. Whether, as to the individual
defendants below, this cause in fact was a suit against the
State of North Carolina. Third. Whether the order and decision of the corporation commission of North Carolina and
the statutes of that State upon which the same was based
were void because in conflict with the commerce clause of
the Constitution and the act of Congress to regulate commerce.
1. It was urged in argument on behalf of the commission
and the ice and coal company that the extra cost or expense,
if any, of placing the four cars of coal on the siding was the
matter in controversy. In the court below it would seem to
have been claimed that the one hundred and forty-six dollars
denurrage was the question at issue. H6wever this may be,
as said by the trial court, although the demurrage dispute may
have been the origin of the litigation, there is involved in the
controversy presented by the bill not only the right to enforce
against the railway company the payment of statutory penalties much in excess of two thousand dollars, but also the
right of that company to carry on interstate commerce in
North Carolina without becoming subject to such orders and
directions of the corporation commission which so directly burdened such commerce as to amount to a regulation thereof.
This latter right is alleged in the bill to be of the necessary
jurisdictional value, the averment was supported by testimony,
and the master and the court below have found such to be the

McNEILL v. SOUTHERN RAILWAY CO.
202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

fact. There is no merit in the contention that there is a want
of jurisdiction to entertain the writ of error.
2. We think the real object of the bill may properly be said
to have been the restraining of illegal interferences with, the
property and interstate business of the railway company, the
asserted right to interfere, 'which it was the object of the bill
to enjoin, being based upon the assumed authority of a state
statute, wlhich the bill alleged to be in violation of rights of the
railway company -protected by the Constitution of the United
States. In this aspect the suit was not in any proper sense
one against the State. Scott V. Donald, 165 U. S. 107, 112;
Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U. S. 516,' 529, 530.
3. The cars of coal not having been delivered to the consignee, but remaining on the tracks of the railway company
in the condition in which they had been originally brought into
North Carolina from points outside of that State, it follows
that the interstate transportation of the property had not been
completed when the corporation commission made the order
complained of. Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U. S. 412.
By section 1066 of the revisal of 1905 the general powers of
the North Carolina Corporation Comnmission were thus defined:
"1066. General powers.-The corporation comfnission shall
have such general control and supervision of all railroad, street
railway, steamboat, canal, express and sleeping car companies or corporations and of all other companies or corporations
engaged in the carrying of freight or passengers, of all telegraph
and telephone companies, of all public and private banks and
all loan and trust companies or corporations, and of all building and loan associations or companies, necessary to carry into
effect the provisions of this chapter, and the laws regulating
such companies. (1899, c. 164; 1901, c. 679.)"
By section 1100 it was provided as follows:
"1100. Demurrage; storage; placing and loading, of cars.The commission shall make rules, regulations and rates governing demurrage and storage charges by railroad companies
and other transportation companies; and shall make rules gov-

erning railroad companies in the placing of cars for loading and
unloading and in fixing time limit for delivery of freights after
the same have been received by the transportation companies
for shipment. '(1903, c. 342.)"
Under these circumstances it is undoubted that by a circular,
numbered 36 and dated July 9, 1903, the corporation comnission promulgated. rules fully regulating the right of railway
companies to exact and the amount of charges which might
be made for storage, demurrage, etc. And the pleadings make
it clear that the order of the corporation commission complained of was not made.upon the assumption of any supposed
contract right which the corporation commission as a judicial
tribunal was enforcing as between the ice and coal company
and the railway company, but was exclusively rested upon the'
general administrative authority which the corporation commission deemed it had power to exercise in virtue of the rights
delegated to it by the statutes of North Carolina as above'
stated. Thus, in paragraph 12 of the answer, the corporation
commission averred as follows:
"These defendants are advised that the orders made by
them, hereinbefore referred to, do not constitute an interference with interstate commerce as alleged in said paragraph 12
(referring to bill of complaint); nor with the right of the,.complainant to conduct its business according to its reasonable
rules and regulations, except so far as the corporation commission has the right and power to control its rules and regulations
by.virtue of said act creating the corporation commission, and
the amendment thereto, contained in chapter 342, Public Laws,
1903, whereby the power is expressly conferred upon the North
Carolina Corporation Commission, by subsection 26, 'to make
rules governing railroad companies in the placing of cars for
loading and unloading, and in fixing time limit for the delivery
of freights after the same have been received by the transportation companies for shipment.' And these defendants further
say that, having full power to provide for placing cars for unloading, and in conformity with the rules of the said North

McNEILL v. SOUTHERN RAILWAY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Carolina Corporation Commission, the orders -complained of in
the bill were in strict conformity to the law, and finally adjudged and made after the complainant company had full opportunity to make defense as to its alleged rights in the premises.
Without at all questioning the right of the State of North
Carolina in the exercise of 'its police authority to confer upon
an administrative agency the power to make many reasonable
regulations concerning the place, manner and time of delivery
of merchandise moving in the channels of interstate commerce,
it is certain that any regulation of such subject made by the
State or under its authority which directly burdens interstate
commerce is a regulation of such commerce and repugnaht to
the Constitution of the United States. Houston & Texas Central Ry. Co. v. Mayes, 201 U. S. 321; American Steel & Wire
Co. v. Speed, 192 U. S. 500.
Not being called upon to do so, we do not pass upon all the
general regulations formulated by the commission on the subject stated, but are clearly of opinion that the court below
rightly held that the particular application of those regulations
with which we are here concerned was a direct burden upon
interstate commerce and void. Viewing the order which is
under consideration in this case as an assertion by the corporation commission of its general power to direct carriers engaged
in interstate commerce to deliver all cars .containing-such commerce beyond their right of way and to a private siding, the.
order manifestly imposed a burden so direct and so onerous as
to leave no room for question that it was a regulation of interstate conmerce. On the other hand, treating the order as but
the assertion of the power of the corporation commission to
so direct in a particular case, in favor of a given person or corporation, the order not only was in its very nature a direct
burden and regulation of interstate commerce, but also asserted
'a power concerning a subject directly covered by the act of
Congress to regulate commerce and the amendments to that
act, which forbid and.provide remedies to prevent unjust disVOL. c in-36

crhninations and the subjecting to undue- disadvantages-by
carriers engaged in interstate commerce.
The direct burden and resulting regulation of interstate commerce operated by an alleged assertion of state authority similar in character to the one here involved was passed upon by
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Central
Stock Yards Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 118 Fed.
Rep. 113. The court in that case was called upon to determine
whether certain laws of Kentucky imposed a direct burden upon
interstate commerce and were a regulation of such commerce,
upon the assumption that those laws compelled a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce transportation to deliver
cars of live stock moving in the channels of interstate commerce
at a particular place beyond its own line different from the
general place of delivery established by the railway company.
In pointing out that if the legislation in question was entitled
to the construction claimed for it, it would amount to a state
regulation of interstate commerce, it was aptly and tersely
said (p. 120):
"It is thoroughly well settled that a State may not regulate
interstate commerce, using the terms in the sense of intercourse
and the interchange of traffic between the States. In the case
at bar we think the relief sought pertains to the transportation
and delivery of interstate freight. It is not the means of making a physical connection with other railroads that is aimed at,
but it is sought to compel the cars and freight received from
one State to be delivered to another at a particular place and
in a particular way. If the Kentucky constitution could be
given any such construction, it would follow it could regulate
interstate commerce. This it cannot do."
As we conclude that the court below rightly decreed that the
order complained of was invalid because amounting to an unlawful interference with interstate commerce, we deem it unnecessary to consider the contentions made on the cross appeal
of the railway company. And because we confine our decision
to the issue which necessarily arises we do not intimate any

opinion upon the question pressed at bar as to whether an order
Which was solely applicable to purely state business, directing
a carrier to deliver property upon a private track beyond the
line of the railway company, Would be repugnant to the due
process clause of the Constitution.
The final decree which the Circuit Court entered and the
writ of perpetual injunction issued thereon were, however,
much broader than the necessities of the case required, and
should be limited so as to adjudge the invalidity of the order
complained of, restrain the institution by the defendant of
suits or actions for the recovery of penalties or damages founded
upon the disobedience of such order, and forbid future interferences under like circumstances and conditions with the interstate commerce business of the railway company. As so
modified, the decree below is

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 269.

Argued April 27, 1906.-Decided May 28, 1906.

Under the treaty between the United States and Cuba of December 11,
1902, and the act of Congress of December 17, 1903, .imports from Cuba
were not entitled to reduction of duties imposed by the tariff act of
July 24, 1897, until December 27, 1903, the date proclaimed by the
President of the United States and the President of Cuba for the commencement .of the operation of the treaty.
After the treaty was amended by the Senate and the amendment accepted
by Cuba the time of its going into effect was to be fixed by act of Congress
and not as originally fixed by the treaty ten days after the exchange of
ratifications.
