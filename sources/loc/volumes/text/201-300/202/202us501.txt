O'CONOR v. TEXAS.*
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.
No. 236.

Argued April 19, 1906.-Decided May 28, 1906.

As subsection 1 of section 639, Rev. Stat., was repealed by the act of March 3,
1875, 18 Stat. 470, and, as the purpose of the act of March 3, 1887, 24
Stat. 556, as corrected by the act of August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433, was
to limit the jurisdiction of the Circuit.Courts, a petition for removal of
an action brought by a State in its own courts against an alien wag properly denied.
In an action to recover real estate, part of a grant from a former sovereign,
defenses based on. adverse possession, estoppel, construction of state
statutes, and the effect of judgments of the state court in other actions,
neither the validity nor the construction of any treaty of the United
States or the validity of the grant being challenged, do not present Federal
questions which give this court jurisdiction to review the judgment on
writ of error.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. H. G. Dickinson.for plaintiff in error:
This court has jurisdiction to review the judgment in this
case on writ of error because the plaintiff in error claimed
the land in controversy under a grant from the government
of Spain to Joaquin Galan, made in 1767, or about that time
and prior to the year 1804, the grant covering such land and
being made at such time as to be within the protection guaranteed by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; and plaintiff in
error connected his title with said grant by a regular chain of
title, and none of the state courts which had this case under
consideration found that plaintiff in error did not connect his
title-with said grant.
There was drawn in question a title claimed by plaintiff
in error under a treaty of the United States and also under
two sfatutes of the United States, one for annexing Texas to

the United States, approved March 1, 1845, and the other for
the admission of the State of Texas into the Union, approved
December 29, 1845.
If this case is one in which there was drawn in question a
title claimed under a treaty or the statutes of the United
States, then the judgment of the Supreme Court of Texas is
reviewable by this court. Owings v. Norwood's Lessee, 5

The act of the legislature under which this suit was brought
shows that this is a suit arising under the laws of the United

a suit the petition of plaintiff in error for removal to the Circuit Court of the United States should have been granted.

By the act of the legislature approved April 4, 1881, the
State recognized the validity of the judgment in Ruggles v.
Texas, and the act ratified and' confirmed the judgment-and
operates as a grant from the State of the land in controversy
to plaintiff in error or to those under whom he dlaims and
further operates to estop the State from now claiming the
land. Turner v..Rogers, 38 Texas, 582; Sanders v. Hart, 57

The judgment in Ruggles v. Texas was introduced in evidence and relied upon by both parties to this suit; the court
in that case having jurisdiction of the parties and the subject
matter, the recital of the judgment of any fact essential to
the rendition of the judgment or without the proof of which
it could not have been rendered, is conclusive evidence against
the parties to the judgment of the existence of such fact.

Tn a suit in a District Court of the State of Texas for land
lying within that State, wherein the State is plaintiff and the
defendant is an alien and a subject of the United Kingdom

Although the defendant, by plea, claimed to be the owner
of the land in controversy, which was embraced in a "grant
emanating, or claimed to have emanated from the Spanish
government, and having its origin at such a time as to be, and
being within the protection guaranteed by the treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo," his case involves no Federal question,
the state courts having found the fact to be that defendant
did not connect his title with such grant, the validity of the
treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was not "drawn in question."
The question as to the effect to be given to the judgment
in Ruggles v. Texas, and as to which of the recitals, and as to
how far such recitals in said judgment are binding upon the

or general questions, and the judgment of the Supreme Court

Whether the District Court of Travis County, or the District
Court of the county in which th land in controversy is situated, alone, had authority to try and determine the question
of title to said land, is a local or state question upon which the
decision of the courts of the State of Texas are final, and not
subject to review in this court, no Federal question being
involved. Bacon v. Texas, 163 U. S. 219; Avery v. Popper,

The state courts having found and held that the judgment
of March 13, 1872, in the case of Ruggles v. State of Texas,
under which defendant claims the land in controversy, was
void, said judgment cannot be held to have vested in him, or
in the plaintiff Ruggles tinder whom he i"daims, any right to
said land, and hence the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Texas in favor of the State of Texas did not divest (lefendant
of any vested right or title, nor deprive him of his property
without due process of law, nor take his private property for
public use without.just compensation, in violation of the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United. States. The
judgment of the state court upon the question having been
a question of local or general law, involving no Federal question, will not be reviewed by this court. White v. Leovy, 174

and as to which of the recitals, and as to how far such recitals

Whether a grant phould be presumed is, primarily, a question of fact for a jury, or, in the absence of a jury, for the trial
court. The trial court having found against the defendant
upon that issue and its judgment having been affirmed by the
Supreme Court of Texas the question is not open for review
by this court. Under the facts and circumstances of the case
no grant should be presumed in favor of defendant. Crespin

MR. JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court.
On July 5, 1901, the State of Texas, under the authority of
an act of its legislature, filed its petition in tl e District Court
of Travis County against Thomas O'Conor, to recover possession of a tract of over nineteen thousand acres, situated in
Webb County.
The defendant appeared and filed a petition for removal to
the Circuit Court of the United States, on the ground that he
was an alien domiciled in the Republic of Mexico. The re-

moval was claimed under subsection 1 of section 639, Revised
Statutes, but, as said by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, delivering
the opinion of the court, in Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Cbmpany v. Bates, 119 U. S. 464, 467: "Subsections 1 and 2 of
section 639 were repealed by the act of 1875; Hyde v. Ruble,
104 U. S. 407; King v. Cornell, 106 U. S. 395, 398; Holland
v. Chambers, 110 U. S. 59; Ayres v. Watson, 113 U. S. 594."
Further, in Fisk v. Henarie, 142 U. S. 459, 466, it was held
that the purpose of the act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, as
corrected by the act of August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433, was to
restrict the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts, and it was said
(p. 468):
"The repealing clause in the act of 1887 does not specifically
refer to these prior acts, but declares that 'all laws and parts
of laws in conflict with the provisions of this act be, and the
same are hereby repealed.' The provisions relating to the
subject matter under consideration are, however, so comprehensive, as well as so variant from those of the former acts,
that we think the intention to substitute the one for the other
is necessarily to be inferred and must prevail."
See also Smith v. Lyon, 133 U. S. .315; Shaw v. Quincy Mining Company, 145 U. S. 444; Martin v. Baltimore & Ohio
Railroad, 151 U. S. 673; Tennessee v. Union &c. Bank, 152
U. S. 454; Hanrick v. Hanrick, 153 U. S. 192; Mexican National Railroad v. Davidson, 157 U. S. 201; Missouri Pacific
Railway v. Fitzgerald, 160 U. S. 556; Wabash Western Railway v. Brow, 164 U. S.271.
It is clear from these authorities that the petition for removal, which, as will appear, presented the only definite
Federal question, was rightfully denied.
Thereupon the defendant filed an answer containing several
defenses; a claim of title under and by virtue of a grant made
in the year 1767, by the government of Spain to Joaquin
Galan; a decree of the District Court of Webb County on
March 13, 1872, in a suit for confirmation of title, wherein
Daniel Ruggles, claiming to be the owner of the grant to

202 U. S.

Galan, was plaintiff and the State of Texas defendant, prosecuted under and by virtue of an act of the legislature of Texas,
approved February 11, 1860; a confirmation of this decree by
an act of the legislature of Texas of April 4, 1881; title by
adverse possession under claim of right and title for a period
of more than ninety-six years; title by estoppel, in that the
State of Texas was estopped by long acquiescence from questioning the decree of the District Court of Webb County of
March 13, 1872; title under and by virtue of a decree of the
District Court of Webb County, Texas, rendered on January 8, 1862; and a claim of outstanding title in the settlers of
the town of Palafox, or their heirs or assigns, as shown by the
recitals in the last-mentioned decree.
The case was tried by the court without a jury, which rendered a judgment in favor of the State. From this judgment
the defendant prosecuted an appeal to the state Court of Civil
Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the trial court and
ordered a judgment for the defendant. This judgment was
taken to the Supreme Court of the State, which reversed the
judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals, and, sustaining the
decision of the trial court, entered a judgment in favor of the
State.
It is obvious that most of the questions raised by the defenses are of a purely local nature, involving no Federal right.
Some explanation may, however, be proper in reference to the
decrees of the Webb County District Court. The 'record is
somewhat obscure, but we take the facts to be as stated in the
opinions of the Court of Civil Appeals and the Supreme Court.
Under the law of 1860 Daniel Ruggles instituted two suits in
the District Court of Webb County for confirmation of title
to separate tracts of land, one designated as the Palafox and
the other as the Balconcitas tract. One suit came to trial on
January 8, 1862, and resulted in a decree in favor of Ruggles
and a confirmation of his title to a large tract of land. In
1869 a motion was filed by him seeking a construction and
modification of this decree of January 8, 1862, but it was

O'CONOR v. TEXAS.
202 U. S.

overruled.

Opinion of the Court.

In 1871 the other suit was dismissed for want of

jurisdiction. The same year he made a motion to redocket
the two cases, which was granted, and at the same time he
filed a petition in which he sought to have the decree of 1862
set aside and a confirmation of title of both the tracts, but on
March 9, 1872, these motions were refused. On March 12,
1872, he filed in the same court another petition seeking to set
aside the decree of January 8, 1862. This motion was sustained. On March 13, 1872, Ruggles filed an amended petition, in which he sought confirmation of title to both tracts,
and upon this a decree was the same day entered in favor of
Ruggles. The land which was covered by the decree of 1862
was patented to Ruggles and the State has not since questioned
the validity of the decree or Ruggles' title. The land in controversy here is located entirely in that portion of the grant
which the court in its decree of 1862, declined to confirm in
favor of Ruggles, but is included in that which purports to have
been confirmed by the decree of March 13, 1872. The suits
originally brought by Ruggles were authorized by special
statute, to wit, the act of the legislature passed February 11,
1860. That act expired by its own limitations in 1865, and,
as the Supreme Court of the State held, the District Court had
thereafter no power to set aside the decree of January 8, 1862,
or to enter the decree of March 13, 1872. The construction
of the state statute and the power which it gave to the District
Court of Webb County, and the length of time for the exercise
of that power, are matters arising under state law, and the
decision of the Supreme Court of the State is conclusive upon
us and presents no question arising under the Federal Constitution. So the alleged confirmation of the decree of March 13,
1872, by an act of the legislature of 1881, is also a question
arising in the construction of a state statute. The Supreme
Court held that it applied only to those decrees which were
rendered while the Webb County District Court had authority
under the special statute, and did not apply to those which
that court assumed to render thereafter.

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Syllabus.

202 U. S.

So far as any defense is based upon the grant made by the
government of Spain in the year 1767, it involves no question of a Federal nature. Neither the validity.nor. construction of any treaty of the United States, nor the validity of the
grant, were challenged. Indeed, it may be observed that
during the progress of the case in the several state courts no
appeal was made to the Federal Constittion, or to any acts
of Congress save the one providing for the removal of cases
from state to Federal courts.
It is apparent that the only Federal question which was
presented, to wit, the right of removal,, was correctly decided,
and, therefore, the judgment of the District Court is
Affirmed.

APPEAL AND CROSS APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
Nos. 220, 530. Argued April 11. 12,' 1906.-Decided May 28. i906.
An officer of 'a national bank owning stock therein knowing that it was
insolvent, although it did not actually fail for two years after the first
transfer, transferred stock at various times to one who merely acted as
his agent and who absolutely transferred a part thereof to various people
of doubtful financial responsibility, all transfers being forthwith made
on the books of the bank; after the failure an assessment was levied by
the comptroller and the receiver sued the original owner for the assessment on all of the shares originally owned by him. Held, that:
The gist.of the shareholders' liability is the fraud implied in selling with
notice of insolvency and with intent to evade the double liability imposed by § 5139, Rev. Stat.
The fact that the sale is made to an insolvent buyer is additional evidence
of fraudulent intent but not sufficient to constitute fraud unless as in
this case.with notice of the bank's insolvency.
While a shareholder selling with notice of the bank's insolvency may defend against a claim of double liability by showing that the vendee is

solvent, and the creditors therefore are not affected by the sale, the
