HULBERT v. CHICAGO.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

202 U. S.

HULBERT v. CITY OF CHICAGO.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 248.

Submitted April 25, 1906.-Decided May 14, 1906.

The mere claim in objections to confirmation of a rule in a proceeding in
the County Court to confirm an assessment for paving a street that the
act under which the assessment was made was unconstitutional as depriving the objector of his process of law, never afterwards brought to
the attention of the trial court or of the Supreme Court of the State, is
not a sufficient compliance with ยง 709, Rev. Stat., in setting up a right
under the Constitution of the United States to give this court jurisdiction to review the judgment on writ of error.
According to the practice of Illinois an error not assigned is not open to
review in the Supreme Court of the State, and if assigned but not noticed
or relied on in the brief or argument of counsel it will be regarded as
waived or abandoned, and this court will recognize that rule of practice.
It is too late to raise the Federal question by a statement in the writ-of error
and petition for citation that constitutional rights and privileges were
involved and decided by the highest court of the State against plaintiff
in error, even if the Chief Justice of that court allowed the writ.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. George W. Wilbur for plaintiff in error:
The act entitled, "An Act Concerning Local Improvements,"
passed June 14, 1897, and amendments thereto, is contrary to
section 2, article 2, and section 9, article 9, of the constitution
of Illinois.
The board of local improvements is not a municipal corporation, and it has no authority to make special assessments.

of interest on assessments and improvement bonds at five
,per cent. Ritchie v. People, 155 Illinois, 98; McChesney v.

Mr. James Hamilton Lewis, Mr. Charles H. Mitchell and
Mr. Frank Johnston, Jr., for defendant in error:
The question of the constitutioiality of the Local improvement Act of Illinois of June 14, 1897, cannot be reviewed by
this court for the reason that this question was not decided
nor even noticed in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois, and the record does not show that it Was, called to the
attention of that court. In order to give this court the power
to rebxamine the judgment of th6 state court, the title, right,
privilege or immunity must be specially set up..or claimed at
the proper. time and in the proper way, and the right on which
the party relies must have been called to the attention of the
court in some proper way, and the decision of the court must
have been against the right claimed. Oxley Stave Co. v. Butler
Co., 166 U. S.648; Sayward v. Denny, 158 U. S. 180; Levy v.
Sup. Ct. of San Francisco, 167 U. S.175, 177; C. & N. W. Ry.

& Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Illinois, 175 U. S. 626. Although
the state court may have decided a Federal question, it must
appear that the particular-Federal question sought to be raised
here was also decided. Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, 183
U. S.238, 248; Chapin v. Fye, 179 U. S.127.
The fact that the opinion of the state court makes no reference to the particular question sought to be presented in this
court, may be considered in determining whether the question
was called to the attention of the state court. Oxley Stave Co.

This court will recognize and be governed by the rule of practice in a state court prescribing the requirements to be ob-,

Erie Railroad Co. v. Purdy, 185 U. S. 148.
According.to the well settled rule of practice inthe Supreme
Court of Illinois, every error must be specifically pointed out
in the assignments of error, and an error not assigned is not
open to review. Berry v. City of Chicago, 192 Illinois, 154;
Skakel v.- People, 188 Illinois, 291; Gibler v. City of Mattoon,
167 Illinois, 18. Errors assigned, but not noticed or relied on
in the brief and argument of counsel, will be regarded as waived
or abandoned. Lewis v. King, 180 Illinois, 259, 266; Dorn v.

109, 114; Harris v. Shebek, 151' Illinois, 287, 294.
Even though it should be held that the unconstitutionality of
the act was sufficiently set up or claimed in the Supreme Court
of Illinois to authorize this court to review it, the proposition
contended for by plaintiff in error does not involve a Federal,
but only a loical question. 'The United States Supreme Court
has no power to review a state statute on the ground solely
that it is repugnant-to the state constitution. Kipley v. Illinois, 170 U. S.182, 186; Miller v. Cornwall R. R. Co., 168 U. S.
131, 134.
A special assessment is levied under the -taxing power of a
State, and is a species of taxation. French v. Barber Asphalt

of Joliet, 153 Illinois, 649; County of Adams v. City of: Quincy,
130 Illinois, 566. It is not the province of this court ordinarily
to interfere with the policy- of the revenue laws of the State
or with statutes providing for making local improvements by
Special assessment. French v. Barber Asphalt Pay. Co., 181

Opinion of the Court.

The statute fixing the rate of interest on special assessment
installments and bonds at five per cent is not unconstitutional,
as precluding the right of property owners to contract, through
the city, for a less rate. Gage et al. v. City of Chicago, 216
Illinois, 107.
MR.JUSTICE MCKENNA

delivered the opinion of the court.

Error to the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of
Illinois affirming a judgment of the County Court of Cook
County, confirming an assessment to defray the cost of paving
a street in the city of Chicago.
The proceeding was commenced by a petition filed by the
city in the County Court of Cook County in accordance with
the law of the State. The petition recited an ordinance of the
city providing for the improvement of the street, and prayed
"that steps be taken to levy a special assessment for said improvements in accordance with the provisions of said ordinance,
and in the manner prescribed by law."
An order was made in accordance with the prayer. An assessment and report thereon were duly made with an assessment
roll attached, which exhibited the property of plaintiff in error
as assessed and the amount for which it was assessed.
In pursuance of notice given to all parties to file objections
to the confirming of the assessment roll, plaintiff in error filed
objections thereto. Among his objections were the following:
"Said act concerning local improvements, passed June 14,
1897, and all amendments thereto, are not only contrary to
the constitution of Illinois, but they are also contrary to the
Constitution of the United States and to the Fourteenth
Amendment thereof.
"Said act concerning local improvements, said ordinance,
which is the basis of the present proceedings, and all documents
and orders relating thereto, are contrary to the Constitution of
the United States, and to the Fourteenth Amendment thereof,
because such -act, ordinance, document and orders seek to deprive objector of property without due process of law.

HULBERT v. CHICAGO.
202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"Said ordinance and proceedings are in other respects illegal,
unconstitutional and void.
"The proceedings herein and said act are contrary to the
Constitution of the United States, and to the Fourteenth
Amendment thereof, because the petitioner herein, under and
by virtue of said act and of said proceedings, seeks to deprive
these objectors of their property without due process of law.
Said proceedings and said act are also contrary to the Constitution of.the United States, and to the Fourteenth Amendment
thereof, for the reasons set forth in the several foregoing objections."
The case came on for hearing before the court, the right of a
jury on the question of benefits having been expressly waived.
Petitioner (defendaht in error) introduced the petition, assessment roll and notice. They were received in evidence,
though objected to as not complying with or meeting the requirements of the statute.
Plaintiff in error to sustain the issues "on the question of the
legal objections" offered in evidence the various resolutions
and proceedings before the board of local improvements. They
are set out in the record, but it is not necessary to quote them.
No other evidence was offered. The court overruled the objections.
On the question of benefits the same evidence was offered by
the respective parties. Plaintiff in error objected to the documents offered by the city on the ground that the ordinance
was illegal and void, because the first resolution of the board
of local improvements in regard to assessments did not contain
an itemized estimate of the cost of the improvements made by
the engineer, in the manner and form required by the statute.
The objection was overruled and the assessment confirmed
with some modification not necessary to notice. The judgment
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.
The bill of exceptions shows that plaintiff in error did not
bring to the attention of the trial court that the act of the State
under which the assessment was made, or any of the proceed-

ings, were contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the. United States, nor did he assign as error on
appeal to the Supreme Court that the rulings of the trial court
or its judgments .infringed that Amendment.
All the questions submitted to the Supreme Court and all the
questions passed on by it depended upon the construction of
the statute or the compliance of the proceedings with the statute, except that it was contended that the sectiohs of the act
which provided for the division of the assessment into installments and the issue of bonds to anticipate the payment of
the installments to bear five per cent interest was unconstitutional, in that the legislature had no power to fix the rate of
interest, and that by so doing a lower rate of interest was prevented, and plaintiff in error thereby deprived of his property
without due process of law. The court decided against both
contentions, holding that "the legislature had the right to fix
the rate of interest which said installments and bonds when
issued should bear," and sections 42 and 86 of the local improvement act "are not in conflict with the constitution."
That is, the constitution of the State.
We do not think that the plaintiff in error complied with
section 709 of the Revised Statutes in setting up a right under
the Constitution of the United States. The mere claim in the
objections to the confirming of the assessment, never afterwards
brought to the attention of the trial court or of the Supreme
Court, was not sufficient. There is no evidence in the record
to show that the decision of either of the courts was invoked by
plaintiff in error upon a right claimed under the Constitution
of the United States.
It is urged that in the writ of error and petition for citation
it is stated that certain rights and privileges were claimed under the Constitution of the United States, and that the Supreme
Court of the State of Illinois decided against such rights and
privileges, and, it is further urged, that the chief justice of the
court allowed the writ.of error. This is not sufficient. Marvin
v. Trout, 199 U. S. 212, 223.

Nor was a right under the Constitution of the United States
necessarily involved in the determination of the cause. And
the Supreme Court was justified by its rulings in omitting the
consideration of rights under the 'Constitution of the United
States. According to the practice of the court an' error not
assigned is not open to review. Berry v. City of Chicago, 192
Illinois, 154, 155. Errors assigned but not noticed or relied on
in the brief or argument of counsel will be regarded as waived
or abandoned. Keyes v. Kimmel, 186 Illinois, 109, 114. And
such rule of practice will be recognized by this court. Erie
Railroad Co. v. Purdy, 185 U. S. 148, 153. It follows that this
court has not jurisdiction of this writ of error. Oxley Stave
Co. v. Butler Co., 166 U. S. 648; Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio,
183 U. S. 238; Chapin v. Fye, 179 U. S. 127.

of his landing before the same persons, and upon the same questions, and
he had been allowed to land
The board of inquiry tinder ยง 25 of the act of 1903 is neb~a court, but an
