HAZELTON v. SHECKELLS. 1
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 225. Argued April 12, 1906.-Decided April 23, 1906.
Every part of the consideration for a contract goes equally to the whole
promise, and if any part of it is contrary to public policy the whole promise
*falls.
A contract to deliver property at an agreed price, within the duration of a
specified session of Congress, it being understood that a part of the consideration isthat' the person to whom the property is to be conveyed
is to endeavor to sell it to the United States and to procure legislation
to that end--he hot being under obligation to take and pay for the prop'erty-is void as against;public policy and"specific performance will not
be enforced.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Heber J. May for appellant:
The appellant is entitled to a decree of specific performance
in equity. It is n'ot enough. that there is a remedy at law; it
must be plain and adequate, or in other words, as practical
and as efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration, as the remedy in equity. Tyler v. Savage, 143 U. S.
79, 95; Lewis v. Cocks, 23 Wall. 466, 470; Buzard v. Houston,
119 U. S. 347, 352; Insurance Co. v. Bailey, 13Wall. 616, 621;
Drexel v. Berney, 142 U. S. 241, 252; Cathcart v. Robinson,
5 Pet. 264; Bayse's Executors v. Grundy, 3 Pet. 210.
The, conttoversy here is solely between the appellant and
appellee, and no third person can be affected by its settlement
'in equity, and equity will look through the form of the- transaction and adjust the equities of the parties. Drexel v. Berney,
122 U. S. 241, 254; Smith v. Felton, 43 N. Y. 419; Willard v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Argument for Appellant.

202 U. S.

The attempt of the appellee to arbitrarily avoid the performance of his agreement comes clearly within the doctrine
of this court laid down in Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Chicago &c.
Ry. Co., 163 U. S. 564, 600. The exercise of jurisdiction by
courts of equity prevents the intolerable travesty of justice
involved in permitting parties to refuse performance of their
contracts at pleasure by electing to pay damages for the breach.
The rule laid down in the text-books upon the subject is
in consonance with the decisions, and both justify a court of
equity in exercising jurisdiction. Story's Equity Jur. § 746.
Compensation for damages would not be adequate relief.
Snell's Equity, p. 461; Willard's Eq. p. 279.
The contract was not against public policy.

The case pre-

sented is different from that in Tool Co. v. Norris, 2 Wall. 45,
and that in Marshallv. B. & 0. R. R. Co., 16 How. 314. There
was nothing in the nature of contingent compensation or for
the performance of any services before Congress, and the case
falls within the class of those held valid in Taylor v. Bemiss,
110 U. S. 42; Stanton v. Embrey, 93 U. S. 546, and Nutt v.
Knut, 200 U. S. 12.
The allegations of the bill, which are admitted by the demurrer, show that neither the committees of Congress nor Congress itself, was misled by anything the appellant did in the
transaction with them, nor was there any attempt on the part
of appellant to mislead them. His labors, performed partially
at their request, undoubtedly served to furnish reliable information in fixing the location and purchase of the site for a hall
of records, and aided in the passage of statutes upon the subject which are well guarded in their provisions, and the very
provisions of which repel the suggestion of fraud or misguidance
in their enactment. 32 Stat. 1039, 1212, § 16. The statutes,
as the result of the transaction, are beneficial to the interest
of the United States and not injurious to it. There was no design to prejudice. the public interest, and such design must
clearly" appear to warrant a court in denouncing a contract
void. Richardson V. Mellish, 2 Bing. 229, 243; Nichols v. Cabe,

Dubuque and Sioux City R. Co., 26 Iowa, 191,202; Kellogg v.
Larkin, 2 Pinney (Wis.), 123; Swarm v. Swann, 21 Fed. Rep.

The objection that a contract is void by reason of public
policy is not entertained out of regard for the party making it,
but to promote the public interest. Greenh. Pub. Pol. 126;
Kelton v. Milliken, 2 Cold. (Tenn.) 410, 415; Stillman v. Looney,
3 Cold. 20, 22; Kimbrough v. Lane, 11 Bush (Ky.), 556, 564;
Summerlin v. Livingston, 15 L. & Am. 519.
. It must be found that the agreement here, or the allegations
of the'bill, make out such a case as will avoid the transaction
for the sake of public policy; or to avoid injury to the public,
without reference to the conduct of individuals. Shrewsbury
& Birmingham R. Co. v. London &c. R. Co., 4 Delg. M. & G.
115, 135; Simpson v. Lord Howden, 1 R. Cases, 326,App. 335.
But, even if this contract can be construed to be one for the
performance' of service before a legislative body or its committees for a contingent compensation1, it is not against public
policy and it is valid and binding upon the appellee.
In Lyons v. Mitchell, 36 N. Y. 235, it is said that it is allowable to employ counsel to appear before the legislature itself,
to advocate or oppose a measure in which the individual has
an interest, for an honest purpose, avowed to the body before
which the appearance is made, and by the use of just argument
and sound reasoning.. See also Trist v. Child,21 Wall. 441,450;
Howland V. Coffin, 47 Barb. 653, where it is said that where an
agent is employed to negotiate with the Government, it would
be presumed that it was the contemplation of the parties that
he should use only proper methods in transacting the business.
Interested claimants, whose interests are to be affected by
legislation, may, both morally and legally, for the protection
and advancement of their own interests, use all means of persuasion which do not come too near bribery or corruption; but
the promise of any personal advantage to a legislator would be

This court has uniformly held contracts with attorneys for
contingent fees to prosecute claims against the Government,
either in courts, before the departments,, or before Congress,
valid where the contracts provided for and the services rendered were only legitimate professional services, and has consistently drawn the distinction between that class of contracts
and contracts that contemplate the use and exercise of personal
influence or lobby services, or where such influences or services
have beer rendered. Wylie v. Cox, 15 How. 416; Marshall v.

The agreement is not objectionable on the ground of want
of mutuality. if it were, it was cured by the election of the
appellant to purchase under the contract within the time specified therein, and having notified the appellee of such election
and tendered him the purchase money, a contract of sale between the parties was thereby perfected, and a court of equity
will decree the specific execution thereof. Young v. Paul, 10

202 U. S.

Argument for Appellee.

The wife was not a necessary party. There is nothing in the
record to show that the defendant has a wife, much less that she
has refused to sign a deed. It is a simple case of repudiation.
Barbour v. Hickey, 2 App. D. C. 207, has no application here.
At that time the wife was compelled to separately acknowledge
the deed. This has been abolished. Section 493, Code D. C.
See Young v. Paul, 10 N. J. Eq. 401.
No relief is or could be sought against her. She is not a party
to the contract. Fry on Spec. Perf. § 299; Wood v. Griffith, 1
Swanst. 55; 2 Story, Eq. Jur § 779; Clark et al. v. Reins, 12
Gratt. 98; Cady v. Gale, 5 W. Va. 547, 565. It is true that the
deed prepared for the klefendant to sign contains the surname
of his supposed wife, but it was not necessary to make and
tender any such deed. Willard v. Tayloe, 8 Wall. 572.
Mr. J. J. Darlingtonfor appellee:
The agreement sued upon, not being mutually enforcible, was
not one to be specifically enforced in equity. Marble Company
v. Ripley, 10 Wall. 359. No attempt is made to sustain the
burden which the law casts upon an attorney,, dealing with his
client, to show that the contract was in all respects a fair one,
and that the latter's interests were fully protec'ted. Gibson v.
Jeyes, 6 Ves. 268; Savery v. King, 5 H. L. C. 655; Hunter v.
Atkins, 3 Myl. & K. 113, 135; Dunn V. Record, 63 Maine, 17;
Burmham v. Hezelton, .82 Maine, 495.
The jurisdiction for specific performance extends only to
cases in which "the specific thing or act contracted for,.
and not mere pecuniary compensation," is the remedy or
redress necessary to the complainant's relief. Adams Eq.
*83.
A contract, not to prosecute before Congress, acting iri-a
quasi judicial capacity, a claim of right, but to seek to obtain
from it, in its purely legislative capacity, and for a contingent
compensation, a contract of purchase or other advantage or
benefit to 'which the other party to the contract has no 'legal
claim, is against public policy and void.

,OCTOBE. TERM, 1905.
Opinion: of the Court.

202 U. S.

Of the many instances in 'which this court, and other courts,
have sustained agreements for contingent fees for services before Congress and before the departments, the.cases, without
exception, involved contracts for the prosecution of claims for
the collection of debts. They. are, without exception,, cases for
the prosecution of legal causes of action, tried before courts
wherever there were courts possessing the jurisdiction to try
them, and before Congress and the departments; where, because of the absence of such jurisdiction in the courts, those
bodies were appealed to in a quasi judicial capacity, not to
make laws, 'but to pass upon the merits of money demands,
and to award execution or provide for their payment to the
extent that they were found just and legal. :See Ball v. Halsell, 161 U. S.80. A claim is "a demand of some matter as
of right, made by one person upon another, to do or to forbear
to do some act or thing as a matter of duty." Priggs v.
Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 615, and a contingent fee contract with
relation to it is legal.
Any agreement for a contingent fee, to be paid on the passage.
of a legislative act, would be illegal and void, because it would
be a strong incentive to the exercise of personal and sinister
influences to effect the object. It matters not that nothing
improper was done, or was expected to be done, by the plaintiff. It is enough that such is'the tendency of the.contract,
that it is contrary to sound morality and public policy,, leading
.necessarily, in the hands of designing and corrupt meni to improper tampering with meribers, and the use of an bxtraneous,
secret influence over an important branch of the Government.

MR. JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

T,4is is a bill for the specific performance; of a contract dated

HAZELTON v. SHECKELLS.
202 U. S.

Olinion of the Court.

December 11, 1902, to sell for nine thousand dollars, at any
time during the then present session of Congress, "and such
additional time as may be necessary for settlement under appropriation by that Congress," part of a lot in a square which
Congress now has voted to acquire for the erection of a hall of
records. The bill was brought against one Miller. Recently
Miller's death was suggested and his heirs and devisees were
substituted, but for convenience Miller will be referred to as
the defendant.:
The contract provided that if Hazelton should "fail to take
advantage of and accept, this offer as above within the time
mentioned, then this agreement shall be null and void." The
bill alleges that a part of the consideration for the contract
"was services rendered both befor'C"and after the making
of said contract, by the plaintiff in bringing the property to
the attention of the committees of Congress as a suitable and
appropriate site for a hail of records." It sets forth that the
plaintiff, before and after the same date, expended much time,
labor and money in rendering those services, and what they
were, viz., collecting and printing facts for the information of
the committees and members of Congress, making briefs and
arguments, and drawing a bill for the purchase or condeination of the square:- The bill passed at the session namied in
the contract. After its passage the plaintiff negotiated, and
finally, in August, 1903, concluded a-sale of the property in
question for $14,395.50, subject to examination of the title
and arrangements for payment. It is alleged that the tinie for
settlement under the approoriation has not expired.. The bill
further alleges that the defendant has notified the -plaintiff that
he does not intend to keep his contract, but Ineans, to Conavey
directly to the United States, and to. demand the: full price.
agreed upon by the Government. - The defendant has tendered
a deed to the United States, which has not been accepted.
The plaintiff has offered to the defendant a deed to be executed
by the latter and his wife, and tendered $9,000, but the defendant has refused to execute the same. There was a general

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Opinion of the Court.

202 U. S.

demurrer to the bill, and this was sustained by the Supreme
Court of the District and the Court of Appeals, and the bill was
dismissed. The plaintiff appealed to this court.
We assume that the bill sufficiently shows an acceptance of
the defendant's offer within the time, although it does not allege it in terms. We assume also that the consideration is
alleged sufficiently, subject to the question whether it is one
upon which a contract lawfully may be based. But the court
is of opinion that that question must be answered in the negative. Every part of the consideration goes equally to the
whole promise and therefore, if any part of it is contrary to
public policy, the whole promise falls. Pickering v. Ilfracombe
Ry. Co., L. R. 3 C. P. 235, 250; Harringtonv. Victoria Graving
Dock Co., 3 Q. B. D. 549, Woodruff v. Hinman, 11 Vermont,
592; Clark v. Ricker, 14 N. H. 44; MilcMullen v. Hoffman, 174
U. S. 639; Bishop v. Palmer, 146 Massachusetts, 469, 474.
According to the bill, and no doubt according to the fact, a
part of. the consideration was services, as we have quoted, and
therefore it is not true, as argued, that the plaintiff could have
demanded a conveyance on tendering the nine thousand dollars
alone. But the services contemplated as a partial consideration of the promise to convey were services in procuring legislation upon a matter of public interest, in respect of which
neither of the parties had any claim against the United States.
An agreement upon such a consideration was held bad in Tool
Co. v. Norri8, .2 Wall. 45. Of course we are not speaking
of the prosecution of a lawful claim.
It will be noticed further that the conveyance was in substance a contingent fee. The plaintiff was not bound to accept
it and naturally would not do so unless lie could agree as he
did'with the Government for a larger price.

The real induce-

ment offered to him was that he would receive all that he could
persuade the Government to pay above the sum named. It
is true that if we take the inartificial statements of the bill literally the part of the consideration which we are discussing was
the services, not a promise to render them. The promise to

HAZELTON v. SHECRELLS.
202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

convey did not bccome binding until the services were rendered, and, when rendered, according to the allegations of the
bill they were legitimate. We assulne that they were legitimate, but the validity of the contract depend8 on the nature
of the original offer, and whatever their form the tendency of
such offers is the same. The objection to them rests in their
tendency, not in what was done in the particular case. Therefore a court will not be governed by the technical argument
that when the offer became binding it was cut down to what
was done and was harmless. The court will not inquire what
was done. If that should be improper it probably would be
hidden and would not appear. In its inception the offer, however intended, necessarily invited and tended to induce improper solicitations, and it intensified the inducement by the
contingency of the reward. Marshallv. B. & 0. R. R., 16 How.
314, 335, 336.
The general principle was laid down broadly in Tool Co. v.
Norris, 2 Wall. 45, 54, that an agreeimcnt for compensation to
procure a contract from the Government to furnish its supplies
could not be enfor'ced irrespective of the quesr.on whether im.)roper means were contemplated or used for procuring it.
Mcifullen v. Hoffman, 174 U. S. 63). 64S. And it was said
that.there is no real difference in principle between agreements
to procure favors from legislative bodies, ird agreements to
procure fayors in the shape of contracts from the heads of departments. 2 Wall. 55. In Mlarshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R.,
16 How. 314, 336, it was said that all contracts for a contingent
coml)ensatioll for obtaining legislation were voi(d, citing, among
other cases, Clippinger v. Helpba(tqh , 5 W. & S.-315, and Wood
v. McCann, 6 Dana (Ky.), 366. See also Mills v. Mills, '40
N. Y. 543. There are other objections which would have to
be answered before the bill could be sustained, but that which
we have stated goes to the root of the co t ract and is enough to
dispose of the case under the decisions heretofore made.

Decree affirmed.
