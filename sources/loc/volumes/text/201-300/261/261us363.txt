APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 510. Argued February 23, 1923.-Decided March 19, 1923.
1. The Act of June 15, 1917,. c. 29, 40 Stat. 188, in making a
deficiency appropriation for "pay at $100 per month for enlisted
men in training for officers of the Reserve Corps," intended merely
to abolish the discrimination existing between the phy then allowed
enlisted men and that allowed civilians training in like circumstances; it was not a fixing of base pay. P. 367.

Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps, who, before this act received $33
per month as base pay and 50% additional for flight duty, under
the Act of July 18, 1914, c. 186, 38 Stat. 516, was not entitled to
any allowance for such duty in addition to the monthly pay of
$100. Id.
3. This provision for $100 pay was not continued beyond June 30,

OCTOBER TERM, 1922..
Opinion of the Court.

261 U. S.

MR. CHIEF JUsTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Nelson W. Rider, the plaintiff below, was a first class
private in the Aviation Section of the Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps from the date of his enlistmeint, November 22,
1917, until September 13, 1918, when he accepted a commission as a Second Lieutenant in Air Service Aeronautics.
His suit is for pay additional to that received by him
while he was a first class private. He asked in his petition for a judgment for $381.42. The Court of Claims
gave him judgment for $326.22. He, was paid from February 9, 1913, until June 30, 1918, at the rate of $100 a
month, from July 1 to September 13, 1918, at the rate of
$49.50 a month, i. e., $33.00 as base pay and $16.50 as
additionpl pay for flight duty. He began flight duty on
May 12, 1918. Rider claims first $100 a month down to
September 13, 1918, when he became an officer, second,
fifty per cent. -of thatsum in addition while on flight duty
from May 12, 1918, until Septeviber 13, and, third, $6.00
additional pay per month from February 9 to September 13, and fifty per cent. of that. in' addition on flight
duty from May 12 to September 13. This third claim was
disallowed by the Court of Claims and ag'Rider has taken
no appeal from this ruling, we need not consider it.
On the peace establishment first class privates of the
Signal Corps received $18.00 a month. Act of May 11,
1908, 35 Stat. 109. This was increased when we entered
the war so as to make the pay $33.00. Act of May 18,
1917, 40 Stat. 82. The Aviation Section of the Army was
established as a branch of the Signal Corps by the Act of
July 18, 1914, 38 Stat. 514, 516, and by its terms the officer
in command could instruct twelve enlisted men in the art
of flying but no enlisted man could be assigned to duty as
a flyer against his will except in time of war, and while on
flight duty he was to receive an increase of fifty per

centum in his pay. This increased the pay of enlisted
men on flight duty at that time from $18.00 to $27.00
monthly, and when we entered, the war, in 1917 from
$33.00 to $49.50. By the National Defense Act of June
3, 1916, 39 Stat. 166, 174, 175, the Secretary of War under
the provisions for the Signal Corps was authorized to
caise as many enlisted men to be instructed in the art of
flying as he deemed necessary.
To understand how the pay of the plaintiff herein became $100 a month as an enlisted man, we must revert
to the history of the training camps. In 1915, the War
Department, responding to a popular agitation for preparedness, on its own initiative and without legislative
authority organized training camps. where civilians were
given military instruction. Those who attended were
required to pay transportation and subsistence, to buy
their uniforms and to serve without pay. Legislative
authority was given for these camps in ยง 54 of the National Defense Act of June 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 194. This
provided transportation, uniforms and subsistence but no
pay. The Army Appropriation Act of August 29, 1916,
39 Stat. 648, gave funds for future camps for the fiscal
year 1917 and authorized reimbursement for transportation and subsistence to persons who had attended camps
prior to the Act of June 3,- 1916. (See 23 Comp. Dec.
217.) Such was the state of legislation when the war
began, April 6, 1917. At 'this time, civilians and enlisted
men of the Regular Army and of the National Guard in
federal service were being sent to training camps to become officers. The civilians received no pay. The enlisted men received the pay of their respective grades.
By the Appropriation Act of May 12, 1917, 40 Stat. 69,
70, an appropriation of more than three millions of dollars
was made to enable the Secretary of War to pay to civilians designated by him for training as officers not exceeding $100 a month as pay, provided they would agree. to

accept appointment in the Officers Reserve Corps in such
grade as might be tendered.
In the Act of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 188, there was,
under the heading of "enlisted men of the line" the
following:
"For pay of enlisted men of all grades, including recruits, and pay at $100 per month for enlisted men in
training for officers of the Reserve Corps, $226,882,560."
This, as said, was a deficiency appropriation and therefore did not authorize pay at the rate. of $100 beyond
June 30,. 1918. It was obviously passed to put enlisted
men on a level with civilians going through the same
training for commissions in the Reserve Corps.
The training camps for officers to which this appropriation then applied had been established by War Department Special Regulations No. 49, and included only
training for commissions in the Infantry, Cavalry and
Artillery. Training schools for the Aviation Section were
not included within those regulations. In such schools,
satisfactory students were recommended for commissions
by the Chief Signal Officer but they were not embraced
under No. 49 and were likely not to be paid the $100 a
month provided by the Act of June 15, 1917. The Chief
Signal Officer and the Adjutant General brought this discrimination to the attention of the Secretary of War (26
Comp. Dec. 117) who then directed by order of July 13,
1917, that enlisted men of the Signal Enlisted Reserve
Corps admitted to the Signal Corps Aviation Schools,
should be considered as designated for training as officers
of the Army and put on the same footing as to pay and
allowances as enlisted men detailed to training camps for
commissions in the Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery.
After we had been a year in the war, and a draft act
had been passed, no further necessity existed for inducement to civilians to train as officers, and no further provision after June 30, 1918, was made for pay to them.

UNITED STATES v. RIDER.
363

"367

Opinion of the Court.

Training camps were continued until November 11, 1918,
but the appropriations for them were only for arms and
ordnance equipment. Army Appropriation Act, July 9,
1918, 40 Stat. 876.
This recital has been necessary to show the surrounding
circumstances in view of which this provision for the $100
monthly pay for enlisted men training for commissions
'should be construed. It makes clear that this legislation
of June 15, 1917, was enacted merely to abolish the discriminating difference between civilians and enlisted men
who were all training for the same commissions in the
same camps, the former receiving three times the pay of
the latter. It was a-temporary leveling up. It was not
the fixing of base pay. It was nt 'a pay to which the fifty
per cent. addition for flight duty could reasonably attach.
Enlisted men Under the Act of 1914 training in flight duty
to become officers, before this Act of June 15, 1917, received $49.50, i. er, $33.00 plus $16.50. This increased the
pay to $100 on a level with that of civilians engaged in
the same duty and training. Such civilians, if any, were
not entitled to fifty pei cent. increase- for flight duty.
Why should it be assumed, therefore, that it was intended
to pay these enlisted men fifty dollars more a month than
civilians in a. statute plainly. designed to secure uniformity? But' it is said that this is to repeal the Act of 1914
giving additional pay for flight duty to enlisted men, and'
repeals by implication are not favored. This. is not to
repeal the act. It is merely to .hold that it is not applicable to a temporary provision or bonus for a particular
purpose. In reaching this conclusion, we are confirmed
by the departmental construction of these acts and by
that of the accounting officers of the Treasury. We can
not agree with the Court of Claims, therefore, that the
-fifty per. centum addition to the regular pay of the enlisted aviation student applies to.'the $100 monthly pay
allowed by the Deficiency Act of June 15, 1917.

368

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.
Opinion of the Court.

261 U. S.

But the Court of Claims went further and held that the
$100 a month pay for such enlisted men continued beyond
June 30, 1918, to which the Act of June 15, 1917, carried
it. This conclusion is based on certain general provisions
of two statutes. The first is the Act approved July 24,
1917, 40 Stat 243, to authorize temporary increase of the
Signal Corps, to purchase and make airships and to appropriate for the same. That .act put the temporarily
enlisted men in the Signal and Aviation Corps on the same
footing as to pay, allowances and pensions as enlisted men
of the same grade in the Regular Army, made an appropriation of $640,000,000 for the purposes of the act and
provided that enlisted men of the aviation section of the
Signal Corps should be paid from funds transferred to
their credit from Signal Corps appropriations. The
second act relied on is that of July 9, 1918, 40 Stat. 850,
in which it was provided that the $640,000,000 appropriated in the foregoing act, and the funds appropriated
-in the Act of May 12, 1917, 40 Stat. 69, 70, entitled "An
Act making appropriations for the support of the Army
for the fiscal year" 1918, should be made available until
June. 30, 1919. These statutes do not sustain the conclusion of the Court of Claims because the $100 pay for enlisted men in training was not provided for in either of
these acts but in the Deficiency Act of June 15, 1917, which
is not continued in effect until Jane 30, 1919. It is true
that the Act of May 12, 1917, gives the Secretary of War
the authority to pay civilians in training for reserve commissions $100 a ffionth, but by the Act of July 9, 1918, no
funds are appropriated to enable him to order such pay,
and, as a matter of fact, after June 30, 1918, no such pay
was allowed to civilians training for commissions. We are
unable to see, therefore, in the acts relied on any legislative authority for paying $100 a month to enlisted men
iV training for commissions after that date. The situation
reverted to that preceding the Act of June 15, 1917, and

the enlisted men in the-Aviation Section became entitled
