Coast Guard.

Mr. Assistant to the Attorney General Seymour, with

MR. JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Action for $600.00. Judgment for $260.50. The case
was submitted with United States v. Allen; just decided,
ante, 317, depends upon the same statute and presents the
question of the claim of a master at arms in 'the Coast
Guard to receive pay at the rate allowed by the statute to
a chief master at arms in the Navy, less all pay previously
received in the lower grade.
Moran enlisted in the United States Revenue Cutter
Service, the name of which has since been changed to the
United States Coast Guard, as an ordinary seaman and
attained the rank of master at arms, the duties of which
corresponded in all respects to the duties of chief master
at arms in the Navy.

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.
Statement of the Case.

261 U.S.

Moran, therefore, since April 6, 1917, has been, and is,
entitled to receive a rate of pay corresponding to that of
a chief master at arms in the Navy. Had he been so paid,
and as required by the Act of May 22, 1917, c. 20, 40
Stat. 84, he would have received during the entire period
from August 1, 1917, when he was placed on active-duty,
to December 31, 1918, the sum of $1,790.50. The pay
received by him, however, was $1,530.00, leaving a balance
due of $260.50. For this sum the Court of Claims gave
judgment.
The findings of the court sustain its action, and on the
authority of the Allen Case we affirm the judgment.
Affirmed.
