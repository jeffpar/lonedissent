CRAMER ET AL. v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM -THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 207. Argued January 15, 16, 1923.-Decided February 19, 1923.
1. Lands definitely occupied by individual -Indians were excepted
from the Central Pacific grant of July'25, 1866, c. 242, 14 Stat. 239,
as lands "reserved
. .
or otherwise disposed of." P. 226.
2. Such possessory rights, though not recognized by any statute or
other formal governmental action 'of the time, were protected by
the settled policy of the Government towards the Indians. P. 229.
3. The Act of March 3, 1851, which required that claims of rights
in lands in California derived from Spain and Mexico be presented
for settlement within a specified time, and directed the Commission thereby created to inquire into the tenures of certain Indians,
has no application to claims of individual Indians, not of those
classes, and based on an occupancy not shown to have been
initiated when the act was passed. P. 230.
4. The United States, as guardian of individual Indians who have
occupied public land in accordance with its policy, may maintain
a bill to cancel a patent illegally issued to another for the land
so occupied. P. 232.
5. The six year limitation on suits by the United States to annul
land patents is inapplicable when the suit is to protect.the rights
of Indians. P.233.:
6. The acceptance by government agents of leases from a patentee
on behalf of Indian occupants, cannot estop the Government from
maintaining the Indian's independent right to the land occupied
by a suit against the patentee. P. 234.
7. The rights of one who occupies part of a subdivision of public
land without 'laying claim to or exercising dominion over the
remainder, are confined to the part occupied. P. 234.

A1P,
from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals
reversing a decree of the District Court and directing cancelation of a patent as to 360 acres of land, in a suit
brought by the United States for that purpose on behalf
of several Indians.
Mr. C. F. R. Ogilby and Mr. Frank Thunenr for appellants.
The decree claims support in the policy of the Department of the Interior, but there is no precedent in the
Department of the Interior; nor could such policy override the contrary intent declared by Congress and heretofore concretely applied by this Court.
The grant to appellants' predecessor does not except
lands occupied by Indians. Buttz v. Northern Pacific
R. R., 119 U. S. 55;' United States v. Fitzgerald, 15 Pet.
405.
There was never any tribal occupancy of this land, and
the law never gave recognition to right of individual
Indian occupancy until the Act of March 3, 1875. Gritts
v. Fisher, 224 U. S. 640; Sizemore v. Brady, 235 U. S.
441; United States v. Fitzgerald, 15 Pet. 405.
The Court of Appeals has overlooked the distinction
between Indian rights guaranteed by treaty. and mere
squatter privileges; it has given scant consideration to
the Buttz Case, and has wholly ignored Barker v. Harvey,
181 U. S. 481.
We have direct and convincing evidence, not only in
the earlier acts of Congress, but also in the congressional
debates, where are reflected the history and spirit of the
times, that Indian titles and possessory claims in California were, from the beginning of our state history,
designed by Congress to be foreclosed and. extinguished,
except in so far aa specific reservations might have been
made for Indian accommodation. Barker v. Harvey, 181

The evidence does not support the finding that the
Indians occupied the land before the fee became- vested
in appellants' predecessor.
Upon failure of the Government's allegation that the
land was within an Indian reservation, the cause abated
for: (1) change of cause and parties; (2) incapacity of
plaintiff to sue for want of iilterest ;' (3) lack of jurisdiction; akd (4) because of prior action pending in the state

These Indians entered, as squatters. Their claim is not
based on occupancy initiated under any law of the United
States; it is simply such adverse claim as any citizen
might make to land patented to another. The United
States was neither legally nor morally bound to maintain them in possession of lands to which they made no
claim prior to that of the Government; and since the

United States has conveyed its title, -what circumstance
has arisen to impose upon it any obligation to the Indians
with reference to these lands? True, the Government
may owe the Indians the duty of protection, helter and
sustenance; but even that may be questioned where the
Indians have adopted the civilized mode of life and have
not availed themselves of the protection and care afforded
them by the Government reservations. The failure of
this attion by virtue of the Government's lack of interest
is well supported by precedent. United States-v. San

The Government is estopped by its patent and by the
leases. Peyton v. Smith, 5 Pet. 483.
The appellants purchased while the leases from the
Company to the United States were in effect, and their
purchases were made'expressly subject t6 the Government's leasehold interest. Neither they nor the Railway
.Company .hadany intimation of any-right asserted by the
Indians or by the United States in its own behalf or in
behalf of the Indians. The appellants paid value and
are, in every sense, innocent purchasers. The land is
not in terms excepted from the grant, and there is no act
of Congi-ess conferring any right upon the Indians.
The Court of Appeals concludes its opinion with the
statement that for these lands the Railroad Company
"was authorized to take lieu lands ". In this, however,
the court has o'4rlooked the fact that no lieu lands are
shownto exist, even though we assume the abstract right.

We do not concede that there was never tribal occupancy of the land in controversy. We think that everything in the record indicates that there was tribal occupancy.
But it is immaterial whether the land was occupied by
a band of Indians, because the occupancy of the two
families was sufficient to except the lands from the grant
to the railroad company.' We submit that the Indian

right of occupancy, of which so much is said in the
various acts of Congress and court decisions, is the mere
right to occupy as for the purpose of hunting and fishing,
and that it is not the same as actual residence upon the
land where the. Indians live and make their home. This
latter means more. Such lands are not public lands not
reserved or otherwise appropriated.
The Act of March 3, 1851, is clearly inapplicable; so
is the Act of April.8, 1864, 13 Stat. 39; no provision was

This appeal brings up for review a decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, directing the cancellation of a land
patent issued in 1904 by the United States to the defendant, the Central Pacific Railway Company, in so far as
itzpurports to convey certain legal subdivisions of land in
Sections 13 and 23, Township 43 North, Range 8 West,
M. D. M., Siskiyou County, California. 276 Fed. 78.

CRAMER v. UNITED, STATES.

225

Opinion of the Court.

The suit was brought in the federal District Court for
the Northern District of California by the United States,
acting in behalf- of three Indians, who, it 'was claimed, had
occupied the lands continuously since before -1859. The
Act of July 25, 1866, c. 242, 14 Stat. 239, granted to the
predecessor of the defendant company a series of odd
numbered sections of land, including those 'named, but
excepted from the grant such lands as "shall be found to
have been granted, sold, reserved, occupied by homestead
settlers, pre-empted, or otherwise disposed of."
The obligations of the grant were complied with and pateit conveying the sections mentioned above, with 'others, was
issued to the 'defendant company, as successor in interest
of the-legislative grantee.
The original cQmplaint alleged an actual occupancy by
the individual Indians, but sought cancellation of the
patent primarily on the -ground that the lands formed
part of an Indian reservation provided 'for in a treaty
which was pending' for ratification when the Act of 1866
was passed; but this last contention was abandoned on
the trial, it appearing that the treaty had been rejected
by the Senate prior to that date.
But the District Court found for the plaintiff upon the
issue of actual occupancy and entered a decree confirming
the right of possession in the Indians; which, however,
was confined to the land actually enclosed, being an
irregular body of about 175 acres and which did not in
terms cancel the patent.
"See. 2. . . . and when any of said alternate sections or parts
of sections' shall be found to have been granted, sold, reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, pre-empted, or otherwise disposed of,
other lands, designated as aforesaid, shall be selected by said companies in lieu thereof, under the direction of the Secretary of the
Interior, in alternate sections designated by odd numbers as aforesaid, nearest to and not more than ten miles beyond the limits of
said first-named alternate sections. . . .i

Opinion of the Court.

261 U. S.

After the submission of the case plaintiff was allowed,
over defendants' objection, to amend its bill by reciting
that in bringing the suit the Government proceeded in its
own right and as guardian of its Indian wards, thereafter
named in the bill, by omitting all reference to the treaty,
and by making the allegations respecting the Indian occupancy somewhat more specific..
The District Court refused to reopen the case on the
defendants' application to allow further proof on the
issue last stated, holding that, as. the occupation by the
Indians was alleged in the original bill, defendants should
have offered their evidence on that issue at the trial. The
"court found that as early as 1859 the Indians named lived
with their parents upon the lands described and had
resided there continuously ever since; that they had
under fence between 150 and 175 acres in an irregularly
shaped tract, running diagonally through the two sections, portions of which they had irrigated and cultivated; that they had constructed and maintained dwelling houses and divers outbuildings, and had actually resided upon the lands and improved them for the purpose
f making for themselves homes. These findings have
support in the evidence and will be accepted here.
Adamson v. Gilliland, 242 U. S. 350, 353.
The decree of the Circuit Court' of Appeals agreed with
that of the District Court generally but extended the right
of possession to the whole of each of"the legal subdivisions
which was fenced and cultivated in part, and reversed the
decree, with instructions toenter one cancelling the patent in respect of the entire 360 acres.
A reversal of this decree is now sought upon several
grounds.
1. It is urged that the occupancy of land by individual
Indians does not come within the exceptive provision of
the grant.
Until the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 131, 18 Stat. 402, 420,
extending the homestead privilege to Indians, the right

of an individual Indian to acquiretitle to public lands
-.
,by entrf was not. reeognized. It cannot,: therefore, be
-said that these lands were occupied by homestead set

tiers nor were they. granted; sold orpreempted, but the
question remains, were they" reserved . . . or otherwvise
disposed of?." Unquestionably it has been the policy of
-the-Federal .Government from the beginning to respect
the Indian right of occupancy, .which could olly-be in-terfered with or -determined by the United States..
Beecher v. Wetherb.y, 95 -U. S. .517, 525; Minnesota vยข.
Hitchcock, 185 V. S.373, 385. It is true that this policy
has had in view the original nomadic tribal occupancy,
but it is likewlse.true that in its essential spirit it applies
to individual Indian occupancy as well; and the reasons
for maintaining it in the latter case would seem to be no
less cogent, since such occupancy being of a fixed character
lends support to another well understod policy, namely,that of inducing the Indian to forsake his wandering
habits and adopt those of civilized life. Thit such individual occupancy is entitled to protection finds strong
support in various rulings of the Interior Department, to
which in land matters this Court has always given much
weight. Midway Co. v. Eaton, 183 U. S.602, 609; JHast"ings * Dakoba R. R. Co.v. Whitney, 132 U. S. 357, 366.
That department has, exercised its authority by issuing
instructions from time to time to its local officers to protect the holdings of non-reservation Indians against the
efforts of white men to dispossess them.- See 3,L. D. 371;
6 L. D. 341; 32 L. D. 382. In Poisal v. Fitzgerald, 15
L. D. 19, .the right of-occupancy of an individual Indian
was upheld as against an attempted homestead entry by
a white man. In Stateqf Wisconsin, 19 L. D..518, there
had been granted to the State certain swamp lands within
an Indian reservation, but the right of Indian occupancy
was upheld, althoug4 the grant in terms was not subject

261 U. S.

thereto. In Ma-Gee-See v. Johnson, 30 L. D. 125, Johnson had made an entry under ยง 2289, Rev. Stats., which
applied to "unappropriated public lands." It appeared
that at the time of the entry and for some time thereafter
the land had been in the possessiomand use of the plaintiff, an Indian. It was held that under the circumstances
the land was not unappropriated within the meaning of
the statute, and therefore not open to entry. In Schumacher v. State of Washington, 33 L. D. 454, 456, certain
lands claimed by the State under a school grant, were occupied and had been improved by an Indian living apart
from his tribe, but application for allotment had not been
made until after the State had sold the land. It was held
that the grant to the State did not attach under the provision excepting lands" otherwise disposed of by or under
authority of an act of Congress." Secretary Hitchcock,
in deciding the case, said:
"It is true that the Indian did not give notice of his
intention to apply for an allotment of this land until after
the State had made disposal thereof, but the purchaser at
such sale was bound to take notice of the actual possession
of the land by the Indian if, as alleged, he was openly and
notoriously in possession thereof at and prior to the alleged sale, and that the act did not limit the time within
which application for allotment should be made."
Congress itself, in apparent recognition of possible mdividual Indian possession, has in several of the state
enabling acts required the incoming State to disclaim all
right and title to lands "owned or held by. any Indian or
Indian tribes." See 25 Stat. 676, c. 180, ยง 4, par. 2; 28
Stat. 107, c. 138, ยง 3, par. 2.
The action of these individual Indians in abandoning
their nomadic habits and attaching themselves to a definite locality, reclaiming, cultivating and improving the
soil and establishing fixed homes thereon was in harmony
with the well understood desire of the Government which

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
219

Qpinion of the Court.

wehave" mentioned: To hold that by so doing they acquired no possessory rights to which the Government
would accord irotection, would b6 'contrary 'to the whole
spirit of the traditional American policy- toward these dependent wards of the-nation.'.
The fact-that such right of occupancy finds no reeogniition in any: statute or other formal 'goveninental actifn
'is not conclusive: The, right, under the circumstances
here disclosed, flows from'a settled governmental policy.
Broder v' Water Co., 101 U. S. 274, 276, furnishes an
analogy. - There this Court, holding that the Act of July
26, 1866, c. 262, ยง 9 14 Stat. 251, acknowledging and confirming'rights of way for the construction of.ditches and
canals, was in effect declaratory of a preexisting right,.
said: "It is the, established doctrine of this court that
rights of . . . persons who had constructed canals and
ditches "...
are rights which the government had, by
its conduct, recognized and encouraged and was bound to
protect, before the passage of the act of 1866. We are of
opinion that the section of the act which we have quoted
was rather a voluntary recognition of a prexisting right'
of possession, constituting a valid claim to its -continued
use, than the establishment of a new one" . Then; referring to the land grant to the Pacific Railroad Companies,
which was'made expressly subject to " pre-emption, homestead, swamp land, or other lawful claim," and which
antedated the Act of 1866, the Court held that defendant's right of way for its canal, independent of that act,
was within the excepting provision of the grant and said:
"We have had occasion to construe a very common clause
of reservation in grants to other railroad companies, and
in aid of other works of internal improvements, and in all
of them we have done .so in the light of the general principle that Congress, in the act of making these donations,
could not be supposed to exercise its liberality at the expense of pre-existing rights, which, though imperfect, were

230

261 U.S.

still meritorious, and had just claims to legislative protection."

We are referred to Buttz v. Northern Pacific R. R., 119
U. S. 55, but that case affords no aid to the defendant.
There the railroad ran through a section of the country
where the original right of Indian occupancy had not
been extinguished and this Court held (p. 66): "The
grant conveyed the fee subject to this right of occupancy.
The Railroad Company took the property with this incumbrance." The United States, however, undertook to
extinguish the Indian title as rapidly as might be consistent, etc., and when this was done the right of the company, it was held, immediately attached free from the
Indian title.
In our opinion the possession of -the property .inquestion by these Indians was within the policy and with the
implied consent of the Government. That possession
was definite and substantial in character and open to
observation when the railroad grant was made, and we
have no doubt falls within the clause of the grant excepting from its operation lands "reserved . . or otherwise disposed of."
2. It is insisted that any rights these Indians might
otherwise have had are barred by the provisions of the
Act of March 3, 1851, c. 41, 9 Stat. 631. This statute
required every person claiming lands in California by
virtue of any right or title derived from-the Spanish or
Mexican governments to present the same for settlement
to a commission created by the act. There was a provision directing the commission to ascertain and report
the tenure by which the mission lands were held and those
held by civilized Indians, and other Indians described.'

231

Opinion of the Court.

219

The act plainly has no application. The Indians here
concerned do not belong to any of the classes described
therein and their claims were in no way derived from the
Spanish or Mexican governments. Moreover, it does not
appear that theseindians were occupying the lands in
question when the act was passed.
Barker v. Harvey, 181 U. S. 481, does not support the
defendants' contention. There the Indians whose claims
were in dispute were Mission Indians claiming a right of
occupalicy derived from the Mexican Government. They
had failed to present their claims to the Commission, and
this, it was held, constituted an abandonment. The
Indians here concerned have no such claim and are not
shown to be within the terms.6f the Act of 1851 in any
respect. It further appeared in that case that prior
to the cession to. the United States the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had abanevidence and testimony of witnesses as the said claimant relies, upon
in support of such claims; and. it shall be the duty of the commissioners, when the case is ready for hearing, to proceed promptly to
examine the same upon such evidence, and upon the evidence produced in behalf of the United States, and to decide upon the validity
of the said claim, and, within thirty days after such decision is rendered, to certify the same, with the reasons on which it is founded, to
the district attorney of the United States in and for the district in
which such decision shall be rendered."'

doned the lands and thereupon made an absolute grant to
the plaintiff's predecessors, and, this grant having been

confirmed by the Commission, a patent for the lands bad
issued.
3. The contention that the United States was without
authority to maintain the suit in the capacity of guardian
for these Indians is without merit. In United States v.
Kagama, 118 U. S. 375, 383, 384, the general doctrine was
laid down by this Court that the Indian tribes are wards
of the nation, communities dependent on the United
States. "From their very weakness and helplessness, so
largely due to the course of dealing of the Federal Government with them and the treaties in which it has been
promised, there arises the duty of protection, and with it
the power." This duty of protection and power extend
to individual Indians, even though they may have become
citizens. United States v. Nice, 241 U. S. 591, 598, and
cases cited; Hqckman v. United States, 224 U. S. 413,
436; United States v. Gray, 201 Fed. 291; United States
v. Fitzgerald, 201 Fed. 295. In United States v. Gray,
supra, the capacity of the United States to sue for the
breach of a lease made by an Indian allottee was asserted
and upheld. After pointing out the fact that it was the
policy of the Government to protect all Indians and their
property and to teach and persuade them to abandon
their nomadic habits the court said: "The civil and
political status of the Indians does not condition the
power of the government to protect their property or to
instruct them. Their admission to citizenship does not
deprive the United States of its power, nor relieve it of its
duty. . . ." In United States v. Fitzgerald,supra, it
was held that the United States had capacity to sue for
the taking of personal property from an Indian held by
him subject to the management of an Indian agent, on
the ground, among others, that such taking obstructs the
execution of its governmental policy., At page 296 the

court said: "The United States may lawfully maintain
suits in its own courts to prevent interference with the,
means it adopts to exercise its powers of government and
to carry into effect its policies. It may maintain such
suits, altiough it has no pecuniary interest in the subjectmatter thereof, for the purpose of protecting and enforcing its governmental rights and to aid in the execution of
its governmental policies." Congress may, if it thinks
fit, emancipate the Indians from their wardship wholly or
partially, United States v. Wailer, 243 U. S. 452, 459, but
in respect of the Indians here concerned that has not been
done. It results, from the conclusion we have reached to
the effect that these Indians had occupied the lands in
dispute with the implied consent of the United States
and in accordance with its policy, that the United States
sustains such a relation to the subject matter and persons
that its authority to maintain the suit cannot be 4uestioned.
4. The suit is not barred by the Act of March 3, 1891,
c. 561, ยง 8, 26 Stat. 1095, 1099, limiting the time within
which suits may be brought by the United States to annul
patents.
The object of'that statute is to extinguish any right the
Government may have in the land which is-the subject of
the patent, not to foreclose claims of third parties. Here
the purpose of the annulment was not to establish the
right of the United States to the lands, but-to remove a
cloud upon the possessory rights of its wards. As stated
by this Court in United States v. Winona & St. Peter
R. R. Co., 165 U. S. 463, 475, the statute was passed in
recognition of "the fact that when there are no adverse
individual rights, and only the claims of the Government
and of the present holder of the title to be considered, it
is fitting that a time should come when no mere errors
or irregularities on the part of the officers of the land
department should be open for consideration." After the

lapse of the statutory period, the patent becomes conclusive against the Government but not as against claims
and rights of others, merely because the relation of the
Government to them is such as to justify or require its
affirmative intervention. See Northern PacificRy. Co. v.
United States, 227 U. S. 355, 367; La Roque v. United
States, 239 U. S. 62, 68.
5. Neither is the Government estopped from maintaining this suit by reason of any tef 'or declaration of its officers or agents. Since these Indians with the implied consent of the Government had acquired such rights of occupancy as entitled them to retain possession as against the
defendants, no officer or agent of the Government had
authority to deal with the land upon any other theory.
The acceptance of leases for the land from the defendant
company by agents of the Government was, under the
circumstances, unauthorized and could not bind the Government; much less could it deprive the Indians of their
rights. See and compare Lee v. Munroe & Thornton,
7 Cranch, 366; Whiteside v. United States, 93 U. S. 247,
257; Dubuque & Sioux City R. R. Co. v. Des Moines
Valley R. R. Co., 109 U. S. 329, 336; Pine River Logging
Co. v. Uiited States, 186 U. S. 279, 291.
6. We think, however, the Circuit Court of Appeals
erred in holding that the right of the Indians extended to
the entire area of each legal subdivision, irrespective of
the inclosure, and we agree with the District Court in
confining the right to the lands actually inclosed, including the whole of the northeast quarter of the southwest
quarter of Section 13, the small portion thereof which had
not been enclosed having been improved. The Court of
Appeals, in support of its conclusion, relied upon Quinby
v. Conlan, 104 U. S. 420. In that case Conlan had entered
upon a quarter section of land, occupied a portion thereof,
and declared his purpose to acquire a preemption right to
tle whole, -and soon thereaffer had filed his declaratory

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.

statement in legal form, claiming the whole as a preemptor. This Court sustained Conlan's claim as against.
Quinby, a subsequent settler. Here the claim for the Indians is based on occupancy alone, and the extent of it
is clearly fixed by the inclosure, cultivation and improvements. The evidence does not disclose any act of dominion on their part over, or any claim or assertion of
right to, any lands beyond the limits of their actual possessions as thus defined. Under the circumstances, their
rights are confined to the limits of actual occupancy and
cannot be extended constructively to other lands never
possessed or claimed, simply because they form part of
the same legal subdivisions. See Garrisonv. Sampson, 15
Cal. 93, 95, where the Supreme Court of California said:
"A fatal objection to the judgment consists in the finding of the Judge in favor of the plaintiff for the whole
tract of land sued fdr. The plaintiff claims by force of
prior possession and a contract or consent on the part of
the defendant, whom he mediately or immediately let into
possession, to hold the premises for him or subject to his
order. The land is public land. It was not taken up by
the plaintiff under the Possessory Act of this State, nor
was it inclosed. There were a house and corral on the
land. Of these he may be said to have been in the actual
occupancy. But we cannot see from the proofs any right
of possession to the whole of the quarter section, or even
any claim to it. We do not understand that the mere fact
that a man enters upon a portion of the public land, and
builds or occupies a house or corral on a small part of it,
gives him any claim to the whole subdivision, even as
against one entering upon it without title. The case
would be different if he claimed under the Possessory Act,
and pursued the necessary steps prescribed by it; or if he
had made his entry under the preemption laws of the
United States. But merely going oni waste and uninclosed
land, and building a house and corral, and even subse-

quently cutting hay on a part, did not extend his possession to the whole of the one hundred and sixty acres."
This is in accordance with the general rule that possession alone, without title or color of title confers no right
beyond the limits of actual possession. Sie Green v.
Liter, 8 Cranch, 229, 250; Watkins v. Holman, 16 Pet. 25,
55; Marine Ry. & Coal Co. v. United States, 257 U. S. 47,
65; Humphries v. Huffman, 33 Ohio St. 395, 401; Langdon v. Templeton, 66 Vt. 173, 179; Ryan v. Kilpatrick,
66 Ala, 332, 337.
Certain other contentions of defendants we deem it unnecessary to review, although they have been carefully
considered. Aside from that stated in the last paragraph
we find no error, but for the reasons there given, 'the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the
cause remanded to the District Court, with instructions
to amend its decree so as to cancel the patent in respect
of the lands possessed by the Indidns and, as so amended,
that decree is affirmed.
