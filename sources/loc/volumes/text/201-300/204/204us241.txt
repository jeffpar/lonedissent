BALLARD v. HUNTER.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.
No. 123.

Argued December 7, 1906.-Decided January 14,1907.

A State may make reasonable discriminations in regard to service' of process for enforcement of liens for taxes and assessments on real estate
between resident and non-resident owners, providing for personal service on the former and constructive service by publication on the' latter.
Land stands accountable to the demands of the State, and owners are
'charged with knowledge of laws affecting it, and the manner in which
those demands may be enforced.
Whether provisions as to notice and service in a state statute have been
complied with is wholly for the state court to determine.
Due process of law has never been precisely defined; while its fundamental
requirement is opportunity for hearing and defense, the procedure 'may
be adapted to the case, and proceedings in court are not always essential.
I For abstract of argument see ante, p. 234.
