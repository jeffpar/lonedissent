Syllabus.

Compare In re Jensen, 59 N.Y.Supp. 653, 655; Bray v.
JWallingford, 20 Conn. 416, 418; County of Lancaster v.

In the South Carolina case this court disposed of the
question by holding that since the state was not exempt
from the tax, the statute reached the individual sellers
who acted as dispensers for the state. While not rejecting that view, we prefer, in the light of the foregoing
examples, to place our ruling upon the broader ground
that the state itself, when it becomes a dealer in
intoxicating liquors, falls within the reach of the tax
either as a "person" under the statutory extension of
that word to include a corporation, or as a "person"
without regard to such extension.

The motion for leave

to file the bill of complaint, accordingly, is
Denied.
MR. JUSTICE STONE concurs in the result.

REVENUE, v. INDEPENDENT LIFE INSURANCE
CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 689.

Argued April 4, 1934.-Decided May 21, 1934.

1. A federal tax upon part of a building occupied by the owner, or
upon the rental value of the space, is a direct tax and invalid unless
apportioned. P. 378.
2. The rental value of a building used by the owner does not constitute income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment.
P. 379.
3. In computing the net income of life insurance companies under the
Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924, deductions for taxes, expenses, and
depreciation, in respect of real estate owned and occupied in whole
or in part by the taxpayer, are not permitted unless there be

included in gross income the rental value of the space so occupied,
which amount must be not less than a sum which in addition to
any rents received from other tenants shall provide a net income
at the rate of 4 per centum of the book value of the real estate.
Held, not inconsistent with the constitutional prohibition of unapportioned direct taxes. Art. I, § 9, cl. 4. Pp. 378, 381.
4. Congress has power to condition, limit, or deny deductions from
gross income in order to arrive at the net that it chooses to tax.

CERTIORARI, 291 U.S. 655, to review a judgment affirming a judgment of the District Court, which sustained a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 17 B.T.A. 757, adjudging an overpayment of income tax. A certificate in
this case was dismissed, 288 U.S. 592.

Solicitor General Biggs, with whom Assistant Attorney
General Wideman and Messrs. Sewall Key, J. Louis Monarch, and H. Brian Holland were on the brief, for petitioner.
The statute involved, in effect, limits the allowance for
expenses of operating a building which is occupied in part
by an insurance company to those expenses which are
attributable to the portion of the building devoted to the
production of investment income. Since no other income
is taxed, it was the purpose of Congress to prevent the
investment income from being reduced by expenses of
producing non-taxable income.
There can be no doubt of the power of Congress to
deny or limit deductions, and the legislative history of
the statute shows that Congress adopted the present
method after careful consideration, as the most workable
method of achieving the desired result. Apparently the.
way chosen was approved by the insurance companies.
As a consequence the statute allows the deduction of the

HELVERING v. IND. LIFE INS. CO.
371

Argument for Petitioner.

expenses of operating the entire building and accomplishes the, limitation by requiring the taxpayer who
claims such deductions to report the rental value of the
space occupied by it as gross income.
The attack upon the constitutionality of the statute
amounts to no more than a criticism of the method by
which Congress has exercised an admitted power. The
result does not destroy guaranteed exemptions or put the
burden upon one entitled to the exemption which he
would not otherwise bear, as in National Life Ins. Co. v.
United States, 277 U.S. 508. No direct tax is laid upon
rental value of the property. Taxing the rental value is
not the object at which the statute is aimed, and the fact
that the rental value of space occupied is incidentally and
casually affected is immaterial.
The tax upon life insurance companies is not the ordinary tax upon all income but a special tax upon a limited
class of income. Despite its inclusion in an income tax
statute it is in the nature of a special excise tax upon life
insurance companies. Were it expressly called an excise
it would not be invalid because measured in part by something not directly taxable, and no necessity for apportionment would exist. In determining the validity of a
statute its form should not control.
The respondent did not except to the action of the Coin.missioner on the ground that the statute violates the
Fifth Amendment, and no sufficient basis for consideration of that question appears in the record.
The taxpayer claimed and has received the benefit of
deductions which are conditioned upon the inclusion of
the rental value in gross income. It is well settled that
one who has received a benefit under a statute will not be
heard to assail it. Constitutional questions may be
waived as well as others. The application of that rule to
this case would result in limiting the deductions in the

374

Argument for Respondent.

292 U.S.

way Congress intended. On the other hand, if the rule is
not applied and the statute is held invalid, the investment
income which Congress intended to tax will be reduced by
some expenses which contributed to the production of
nontaxable income.
If the provision under attack is held invalid, then the
provision allowing deductions for real estate expenses
must fall, insofar as it applies to home office property, for
the provisions are inseparable. Then a life insurance company would be entitled to no deductions for expenses
connected with its office building.
Mr. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, with whom Mr. James A.
Newman was on the brief, for respondent.
Taxation of the "rental value" of such buildings to
the extent that they were occupied by their owners, was
a direct tax on 'the land itself, levied solely because of
ownership; and such a tax is void unless apportioned.
If an insura ce company rents a building to use as its
Home Office, but does not occupy all the space, the Revenue Act does not tax the company on the "rental value"
of (a) the space it occupies; or (b), the vacant space
which it does not occupy; and this is solely because the
company does not own the building.
But, on the other hand, if an insurance company owns
its Home Office Building, and occupies any portion
thereof (whether one room or several floors) the Revenue Act taxes it on the "rental value" of all the space
it so occupies, and this tax is imposed solely because the
company owns the building.
The Government may argue that the tax is not levied
solely because, of ownership, but because of (1) ownership, plus (2) occupancy of the thing owned. That is
simply an argument that the owner of land or of personal
property. may be taxed (without apportionment) for the
privilege of occupying or possessing that which he owns;
and that such a tax is not a "direct" tax on the thing

HELVERING v. IND. LIFE INS. CO.
371

375

Argument for Respondent.

owned, but is an " excise" tax for the privilege of occupying or possessing the thing owned.
The very essence of ownership is the right to the possession (i.e., the occupancy) of the thing owned. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries, 255 U.S. 288.
This Court has always held that a tax on land is a direct
tax. If, then, this Court shall now decide that it is an
excise tax, for Congress to tax a landowner a percentage
of (a). the market value of the real estate or (b) an annual
rental value, simply for the privilege of the landowner
occupying his own land, then the constitutional guaranty
against direct taxation disappears, and nothing whatever
is left of that fundamental guaranty.
A tax on rents from real estate is still a direct tax on
the land itself,-although the Sixteenth Amendment has
removed the necessity of apportionment in levying a tax
on such rents.
The rental value of land when occupied by its owner,
does not constitute income to the owner within the meaning of the term income as used in the Sixteenth Amendment. Commissioner v. Independent Life Ins. Co., 67 F.
(2d) 470, 472.
The particular rental value which the Revenue Acts
compelled the insurance companies to include as income
(and to pay income taxes thereon) was an arbitrary sum
having no reasonable relation to income in any constitutional sense.
After deducting taxes, expenses and depreciation from
the actual rents collected from all other tenants in the
building, the company must also include in its income (as
the rental value of the space it occupies) such further sum,
as when added to the net rent received. from the other
tenants, will produce a net taxable rental income for the
entire building of 4% upon its book value.
One insurance company's book value of its building
may bear iid relation whatsoever, to cost, rental return or

market value, or to the book value, of any other company's building.
The Revenue Acts, in thus defining what income the
company shall return, do not use any definition of income
which falls within the definitions prescribed by this Court
in many cases, but prescribe as income a purely arbitrary
and capricious sum, bearing no relation to reality or to
any authoritative definition of income.
The tax imposed by §§ 242-245 is an income tax; and
it is not in any sense a special excise tax for the privilege
of engaging in the life insurance business. National Life
Ins. Co. v. United States, 277 U.S. 508; Massachusetts
Mutual v. United States, 288 U.S. 269.
Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U.S. 107, and Stratton's
Independence.v..Howbert, 231 U.S. 399, arose under the
1909 Corporation Tax Act before any income tax had
even been adopted. Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240
U.S. 103, which arose under the 1913 Income Tax Act,
was disposed of on the same grounds as Brushaber v.
Union Pacific, 240 U.S. 1; and its reference to Stratton's
Independence was dictum and illustrative only.
Congress can not impose an unconstitutional condition,
to-wit, that a person shall surrender or waive a constitutional right as the price of receiving some benefit allowed
to others. National Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 277
U.S. 508.
The power to impose conditions can not be used to accomplish a prohibited result. Miller v. Milwaukee, 272
U.S. 713, 715; Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U.S. 531, 541-2;
Frost Trucking Co. v. RailroadComm'n, 271 U.S. 583, 593.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case involves the validity of deficiency assessments
of income taxes made by the Commissioner against the
life insurance company for 1923 and 1924. The 1921
Revenue Act (42 Stat. 261), § 244 (a) defines gross in-

HELVERING v. IND. LIFE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

come of such companies as that received from interest,
dividends and rents. Premiums and capital gains are
excluded. Section 245 (a) directs that net income be
ascertained by making specified deductions from gross income. These include four per cent. of the company's
reserve, "(6) Taxes and other expenses paid during the
taxable year exclusively upon or with respect to the real
estate owned by the company . . ." and "(7) A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence."
But it is provided, § 245 (b), that no deduction shall be
made under paragraphs (6) and (7) "on account of any
real estate owned and occupied in whole or in part by a
life insurance company unless there is included in the
return of gross income the rental value of the space so
occupied. Such rental value shall be not less than a sum
which in addition to any rents received from other tenants shall provide a net income (after deducting taxes,
depreciation, and all other expenses) at the rate of 4 per
centum per annum of the book value at the end of the
taxable year of the real estate so owned or occupied."
Provisions similarly worded and having the same meaning are contained in the Revenue Act of 1924, §§ 244, 245,
43 Stat. 289.
During 1923 and 1924 respondent owned a building of
which it occupied part and rented part. Its tax return for
each year included in gross income the rents received for
the space let and deducted the taxes, expenses and depreciation chargeable to the whole building. The result for
1923 was a net of $3,615.30 whereas four per cent. of book
value amounted to $18,400. The result for 1924 was
minus $14,629.76, four per cent. of the then book value
being $19,770.32. The Commissioner, following § 245 (b)
added to the rents received from lessees in each year a
sum sufficient to make the net equal to the required four
per cent. On that basis the amount of the deficiency for

1923 was $298.97, and for 1924, $1,115.65.1 The board of
Tax Appeals held them direct taxes and therefore invalid.
17 B.T.A. 757. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,
one of the judges dissenting. 67 F. (2d) 470. Its decision conflicts with Commissionerv. Lafayette Life Ins. Co.
(C.C.A.-7), 67 F. (2d) 209, and Commissioner v. Rockford Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.-7), 67 F. (2d) 213.
The question for decision is whether the statutory provisions relied on violate the rule that no direct tax shall
be laid unless in proportion to the census. Constitution,
Art. I, § 9, cl. 4. In support of the decision below, respondent maintains that the "rental value" of the space
occupied by it was included in net income and taxed and
that the exaction is a direct tax on the land itself and void
for lack of apportionment.
If the statute lays taxes on the part of the building
occupied by the owner or upon the rental value of that
space, it cannot be sustained, for that-would be to lay a
direct tax requiring apportionment. Pollock v. Farmers'
Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429, 580, 581; 158 U.S. 601,

were $70,005.18.

Taxes, expenses and depreciation
Book value was stipulated to be $460,000. The

commissioner called the difference between $18,400 (4% of $460,000)
and $3,615.30 ($73,620.48-$70,005.18) or $14,784.70 the "value of
space owned and occupied by company." That, added to rents received, amounted to $88,405.18. He then subtracted from gross
income so increased the sum of permissible deductions, including the
$70,005.18.
In 1924, rents were $71,289.21. Taxes, expenses and depreciation
were $85,918.97. Book value was $494,257.97. The commissioner
added $19,770.32 (4% of $494,257.97) and $14,629.76 ($71,289.21$85,918.97) and called the sum, $34,400.08, the "value of space owned
and occupied by company." That, added to rents received, amounted
to $105,689.29; and from gross income so increased were subtracted
the deductions, including the $85,918.97.

Cf. Burk-Waggoner Assn. v. Hopkins, 269 U.S. 110, 114.
Earlier Acts taxed life insurance companies' incomes
substantially the same as those of other corporations.
Because of the character of the business, that method
proved unsatisfactory to the Government and to the companies.. The provisions under consideration were enacted
upon the recommendation of representatives of the latter. As rents received for- buildings were required to be
included in gross-and expenses chargeable to them were
allowed to be deducted, it is to be inferred that Congress
found-as concededly the fact was-that the annual net
yields from investments in such buildings ordinarily
amounted to at least four per cent. of book value. Where
an insurance company owns and occupies the whole of a
building, it receives no rents therefor and is not allowed
to deduct the expenses chargeable to the building. Where
part is used by the company and part let, the rents are
required to be included in the gross, but expenses may not
be deducted unless, if it be necessary, there is added to
the rents received an amount to make the total sufficient,
after deduction of expenses, to leave four per cent. of book
value. All calculations contemplated by § 245 (b) are
made subject to that limitation. Congress intended that
the rule should apply only where rents exceed such four
per cent. Where they are less than that, addition of the

prescribed rental value and deduction of expenses operate
to increase taxable income. - The classification is not
without foundation.
The company is not required to include in gross any
amount to cover rental value of space used by it, but in
order that, subject to the specified limitation, it may
have the advantage of deducting a part of the expenses
chargeable to the building, it is permitted to make calculations by means of such an addition. The statute
does not prescribe any basis for the apportionment of
expenses between space used by the company and that
for which it receives rents. The calculation indicated
operates as such an apportionment where the rents received are more than four per cent. of book value, but
less than that amount plus expenses.' In such cases
the addition, called rental value of space occupied by the
company, is employed to permit a deduction on account
of expenses. That, as is clearly shown in the dissenting
opinion, 67 F. (2d) 473, is the arithmetical equivalent
'Take for example: book value of building, $1,000,000; 4% of
book value, $40,000; rents received, $30,000; expenses, $60,000.

If the calculation prescribed by § 245 (b) is not made, taxable
income is $30,000.
The calculation prescribed by § 245 (b) follows: rents, $30,000,
plus "rental value," $70,000 (expenses, $60,000, minus rents, $30,000,
plus the 4%-$40,000) amounts to $100,000, less expenses, $60,000,
leaves taxable income, $40,000. Cf. Art. 6S6, Treasury Regulations
62 and 65.
'Take for example: book value of building, $1,000,000; 4% of
book value, $40,000; rents received, $50,000; expenses, $60,000.
On that basis the calculation is: rents, $50,000 plus rental value,"
$50,000 (expenses, $60,000 minus rents $50,000 plus 4%, $40,000)
amounts to $100,000 less expenses $60,000 leaves taxable income
$40,000. Deduction of expenses operates to reduce taxable income
by $10,000.
Assume rents received were $100,000. No rental value need be
added. Deducting expenses, $60,000, leaves taxable income $40,000.

of lessening the deduction by the amount of the so-called
rental value.
Respondent cites National Life Ins. Co. v. United
States, 27.7 U.S. 508, but the distinction between that
case and this one is fundamental and obvious. There
the effect of the statutory deduction was to impose a
direct tax on the income of exempt securities, amounting
to taxation of the securities themselves. We held that
the tax imposed, so far as it affected state and municipal
bonds, was unconstitutional and that, in so far as it affected United States bonds, it was contrary to the statute. In Denman v. Slayton, 282 U.S. 514, we held the
taxpayer not entitled to deduct the interest on debts
incurred to purchase securities the interest on which was
exempt. The opinion points out the distinction between
that exclusion from deductions and the taxation of exempt securities condemned in National Life Ins. Co. v.
United States. As shown above, the prescribed calculation, § 245 (b), is in substance a diminution or apportionment of expenses to be deducted from gross income
under the circumstances specified. See Anderson v.
Forty-Two Broadway Co., 239 U.S. 69.
Unquestionably Congress has power to condition, limit
or deny deductions from gross income in order to arrive
at the net that it chooses to tax. Burnet v. Thompson
Oil & Gas Co., 283 U.S. 301, 304. Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103. Brushaber v. Union Pac. R. Co.,
supra, 23-24. It is clear that the provisions under consideration do not lay a tax upon respondent's building
or the rental value of the space occupied by it or upon
any part of either.
