LEWIS v. FIDELITY CO.
535

Syllabus.

For many years the fire insurance companies in Illinois
were without power to write a policy unless the hazards
were those of fire or of inland navigation. When the
power was conferred upon them to cover risks of other
kinds, a statute gave them notice that they must pay
taxes to the county upon the net earnings of their business
from whatever source derived. They were free to use the
new privilege or to reject it as they pleased. They
accepted it cum onere if they accepted it at all.

LEWIS, RECEIVER, v. FIDELITY & DEPOSIT CO.
OF MARYLAND.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 802. Argued May 4, 1934.-Decided June 4, 1934.
1. Under the Act of June 25, 1930, which authorizes any national
bank, upon the deposit with it of public money of a State or any
political subdivision thereof, to "give security for the safekeeping
and prompt payment of the money so deposited of the same kind
as is authorized by the law of the State in which such association
is located in the case of other banking institutions in the State,"
the authority is not limited to the pledging of specific assets to
secure the public deposits, but is broad enough to authorize a general lien on present and future assets of the national bank wherever banks organized under the laws of the State have that
power. - P. 564.
2. The main purpose of the Act of June 25, 1930, was to equalize
the positions of national and state banks; and, without the power
granted, national banks would be at a disadvantage in competing
for deposits with state banks possessing it. P. 564.
3. A national bank is subject to state law unless that law interferes
with the purposes of its creation, or destroys its efficiency, or is
in conflict with some paramount federal law. P. 566.

4. Under statutes of Georgia, a bank, state or national, may be appointed depository of state funds upon giving a bond for the faithful performance of all such duties as shall be required of it by the
General Assembly or the laws of the State; and the bond, with
sureties, creates a lien on all the bank's assets, existing and subsequently acquired, for the security of the bond. Held:
(1) That the execution of such a bond by a national bank was
not objectionable upon the ground that the state legislature might
in the future impose duties which the bank would be without
authority to undertake. P. 566.
, (2) That acceptance of the appointment as state depository is
not objectionable because of a power in the Georgia governor to
issue a fieri facias which, if exercised against a national bank, might
conflict with R.S. § 5242. P. 566.
(3) Accepting conclusions of the court below as to the application of the lien under the state law and its results in long practice,
it is not to be anticipated that it will interfere with performance
by national banks of their duties to the public or produce conflict
between their duties to the State and to the United States. P. 567.
(4) Though limited in its operation upon commercial assets to
such moneys, stocks, bonds, notes, etc., as shall be captured by a
receivership, the lien, in the event of insolvency, is not legally a
-preference, and to give it effect would not conflict with the policy
expressed by § 50 of the National Bank Act. P. 568.
(5) A provision of the state law requiring that the bond of a
national bank shall be double the deposit secured and that of a
ptate bank only equal to it, does not appear to conflict with or
cloud the clear provision attaching the lien to, depository bonds
as such and without qualifications. P. 569.
5. A natinnal bank became a depository of state funds and gave a
bond which under the state law created a general lien on its assets
in favor of the State to secure the bond. The contract was for a
term of years extending before and after the passage of the Act
of June 25, 1930, which first empowered such banks to give such
security under state laws; but during the entire period both parties
believed the lien valid and deposits were made, withdrawn and renewed on the faith of that assumption until some time after the
date of that Act, when the bank became insolvent. Held that the
lien became operative as to deposits made after the date of the Act,
and that execution of a new bond was not necessary. P. 570.
6. A statute is not retroactive merely because it draws on antecedent
facts for ts operation.. P, 571.

CERTIORARI, 291 U.S. 658, to review the reversal of a

insolvent national bank to the surety on a bond which
it had furnished for the security of deposits of state
funds.

Messrs. Samuel H. Wiley, John F. Anderson, and F. G.
Awalt were on the brief, for petitioner.

Powell was on the brief, for respondent.
By leave of Court, Messrs. F. G. Awalt and George P.
Barse filed a brief on behalf of the Comptroller of the
Currency, as amicus curiae.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Under statutes of Georgia, in force since 1879, a bank,
state or national, may be appointed depository of state
funds. To qualify it must give a bond for' the faithful
performance of its duty. A bond with surety creates a
lien on all the bank's assets, both those held at the time of
the execution of the bond and those subsequently
acquired.1
"The bond to be made by the State depositories may be a personal bond or may be made by a deposit with the State treasurer
of United States bonds or Georgia State bonds, or either one or both
of said methods." § 1256, Code of Georgia (1910). Section 1252
provides that the depository bond shall have "the same binding
force and effect as the bond required by law to be given by State
treasurers, and, in case of default shall be enforced in like manner."
Section 218 of the Code relating to thetreasurdr's bond provides that
"a lien is hereby created in favor of the State upon the property
of the treasurer to the amount of said bond, and upon the property
of the. securities upon his said bond to the amount for which they
may be severally liable, from the date of the execution thereof." The

Opinion of the Court.

292 U.S.

In July, 1928, the Governor of Georgia appointed The
Hancock National Bank of Sparta, Georgia, a state de-/,
pository f.r the term of four years. It gave a bond with
the Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland as surety
in the sum of $10,000 for the faithful discharge of its
duties. From time to time thereafter, until May 23,
1932, the tax collector of Hancock County deposited in
the bank moneys collected on account of state taxes. On
that day the Comptroller of the Currency declared the
bank insolvent and appointed a receiver for whom the
petitioner, John C. Lewis, was later substituted. The
amount of state funds then on deposit was $6,157.41.
This sum, and the accrued interest, the company paid to
the State and received an assignment of its rights arising
out of the deposit. Then, the company brought in the
federal court for the Middle District of Georgia this suit
in equity against the receiver to enforce a lien for the
amount upon all the assets in his hands, claiming priority
a cording to the date of the bond.
The District Court, after denying a motion to dismiss,
heard the cause substantially upon agreed facts. It ruled
that the company was entitled to the rights of the State
by subrogation and by transfer; held that neither the
State nor the company was entitled to a lien or to preferential treatment; and allowed the claim as one entitled
merely to a pro rata dividend. The Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment and
remanded the cause for further proceedings, holding that
Supreme Court of Georgia held, in cases involving state banks, that
under these statutes -the State acquires a lien on all the assets of a
depository bank, both those at the time of the execution of the
bond and those subsequently acquired. See Seay v. Bank of Rome,
66 Ga. 609; Colquitt v. Simpson, 72 Ga. 501; Simpson v. Mathis,
79 Ga. 159; 3 S.E. 646. Compare State v. Br.bston, 94 Ga. 95; 21

Opinion of the Court.

the asserted lien was valid, subsisting in favor of the
company, and entitled to the priority claimed. 67 F.
(2d) 961. This Court granted certiorari.
That court, following Pottorf] v. El Paso-Hudspeth
Road District, 62 F. (2d) 498, ruled, as matter of federal
law, that national banks had under National Bank Act
as enacted in 1864 power to pledge assets-to secure public
deposits. It ruled as matter of state law that the lien
is a contractual one arising, not proprio vigore by reason
of the statutes, but by contract of the bank as an incideiit of giving a personal bond; that these statutes apply
to both state and national banks, and 'the scope of the
lien is the same in respect to both; declared, in describing
its character, that from the date of the bond the lien
attaches to all property real and personal then owned or
thereafter acquired; that a grantee of real estate having
constructive notice would take subject to the lien; that
as to money, bonds, stocks, notes, drafts and other choses
in action, the lien of the State is inferior to the rights
of third persons who receive the property bona fide in
the ordinary coursc of business prior to insolvency or
sequestration; and that the lien is inferior even to the
right of depositors to set-off against their own indebtedness that of the bank to them.
The court took judicial notice of the fact that throughout the fifty-three years since the enactment of the law
both national and state banks had acted as state depositories; that the lien had been enforced against money and
choses in action when captured by a receivership, but
had never been asserted as to commercial assets transferred in due course of business; that the existence of
the lien had presented no obstacle to the ordinary operations of the banking business or interfered in any way
with the performance by national banks of their federal
functions; and that a bank's appointment as state depository is customarily advertised and accepted as evi-

dence of soundness and credit. Compare In re Blalock,
31 F. (2d) 612.
In Texas & PacificRy. Co. v. Pottorif,291 U.S. 245, and
Marion v. Sneeden, 291 U.S. 262, decided after the entry

of the judgment below, we held that a national bank had,
prior to the Act of June 25, 1930, no power to make any
pledge to secure deposits except the federal deposits specifically provided for by Acts of Congress. It follows
that, in 1928, no lien arose when the bank was appointed
depository; and that the judgment of the Circuit Court
of Appeals must be reversed unless the Act of June 25,
1930, c. 604, 46 Stat.. 809, authorizes a national bank to
give as security a general lien of the character prescribed
by the Georgia statutes.
That Act provides:
"Any association may, upon the deposit with it of public money of a State or any political subdivision thereof,
give security for the safe-keeping and prompt payment
of the money so deposited, of the same kind as is authorized by the law of the State in which such association is
lbcated in the"case of other banking inqtitutions in the
State.'
First. The receiver contends that the Act of 1930 should
be construed as authorizing merely a pledge of specific
assets to secure public deposits; and that the giving of a
general lien upon the bank's assets is still ultra vires.
The language of the Act is broad enough'to authorize giving a general lien on present and future assets, wherever
banks organized under the laws of the State have such
power; and it should be given that construction. For
the main purpose of the 1930 Act was to equalize the position of national and state banks; and without such power
national banks would not in Georgia. be upon an equality
with state banks in competing for deposits. The policy
of equalization was adopted in the National Bank Act

of 1864, and has ever since been applied, in the provision
concerning taxation.' In amendments to that Act and
in the Federal Reserve Act and amendments thereto the
policy is expressed in provisions conferring power to establish branches;' in those conferring power to act as
fiduciary;' in those concerning iriterest on deposits; 5 and
in those concerning capitalization.' It appears also to
have been of some influence in securing the grant in 1913
of the power to loan on mortgage.' Compare Fidelity &
Deposit Co. v. Kokrda, 66 F. (2d) 641, 642.
Second. The receiver insists that, even if the Act of
1930 authorizes the giving of a general lien, the lien here
asserted must fail because there are provisions in the
Georgia law inconsistent with the National Bank Act

and because obligations are imposed upon state depositories with which no national bank may comply.
1. Attention is called specifically to the terms of the
statutory bond which is conditioned "for the faithful
performance of all such duties as shall be required" of
the depository "by the General Assembly or the laws
of this State." The argument is that a national bank is
an instrumentality of the United States and cannot subject itself by contract to the laws of a State. But a
national bank is subject. to state law unless that law
interferes with the purposes of its creation, or destroys its
efficiency, or is in conflict with some paramount federal
law. National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall. 353, 362;
McClellan v. Chipman, 164 U.S. 347, 356; First National
Bank v. Missouri, 263 U.S. 640, 656. "What obligations
to the State the bank assumes may be defined by the
law of that State. It is quite possible that the legislature might attempt to impose, under the conditions of
the bond, a duty which the bank would be without authority to undertake; and to that extent the contract
would be unenforceable. But it is not shown that the
obligations as now defined by the courts of Georgia are
contrary to anything in the National Bank Act. Moreover, the state court, which would be the controlling authority on the question, might decide that the failure of
part of the consideration to be given would not invalidate
the appointment.
2. It is urged that acceptance of the appointment as
state depository is incompatible with the functions of a
national bank, because under § 224 of the Georgia Code
it has been held that the Governor may issue a fieri facias
against the depository bank for the amount due to the
State, whereas, Revised Statutes, § 5242, provides that
"no attachment, injunction or execution, shall be issued
against such association or its property before final judg-

ment in any suit, action or proceeding, in any state;
county or municipal court." ' Assuming, without deciding, that there is such conflict, it is not material here.
Section 224 of the Code provides merely a method of
enforcing the bond which has not been used here, and
hence against which there is at present no occasion for
complaint.
3. It is contended that the lower court erred in its
rulings on the Georgia law; that under the state statutes,
properly construed, the lien attaches to all kinds of property from the date of the bond; that it applies to real
estate and other tangible property, to money, bonds,
stocks, notes, drafts and other choses in action then owned
or thereafter acquired by the bank, and that. it is not
defeated even by a bona fide sale or other disposition of
such 1roperty in the ordinary course of business; that,
consequently, the general lien would present an insuperable obstacle to the bank's serving the public in its ordinary business operations; that the bank could not sell
the property it was authorized to acquire, for no one
would take it subject to the lien; that the general lien
would prevent the pledge of specific bonds or Qther securities required in order to secure the deposits of the United
States and federal agencies pursuant to provisions of the
National Bank Act as amended;9 and that it would prevent the pledge of specific security required to authorize
the issue of circulating notes.1" 'The lower court took
judicial notice of the fact that for more than half a century the general lien described has been in force, and has
not interfered with the performance by banks of their
duties to the public; and that national banks while serv-,
ing as depositories have not, so far as appears, ever been

confronted with a conflict between their duties to the
State and to the United States. The reasons given by
that court for its conclusions as to the operation and effect

of the lien under the law of Georgia are set forth fully and
persuasively in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals. We cannot say that it erred in the conclusions

reached either as to the state law, or as to the facts. Compare Marion v. Sneeden, 291 U.S. 262, 270-271.
4. The receiver contends that the lien, if limited in its
operation upon commercial assets to such moneys, stocks,

bonds, notes, drafts and other choses in action as are
captured by a receivership, is not a true security at all;
that if so limited the alleged lien would, in the event of
insolvency, be legally a preference; that to give it effect
would conflict with the policy expressed in § 50 of the
National Bank Act" which forbids preferences made in
view of insolvency; and that Congress cannot be assumed
to have sanctioned a transaction which though in form a
security is in essence a preference.
Sections 50 and 52 do not prohibit liens given prior to
insolvency and not in 'contemplation thereof, whether
they arise from express agreements, or are implied from
the nature of the dealings between parties, or arise by
operation of law. Scott v. Armstrong, 146 U.S. 499, 510;
Earle v. Pennsylvania, 178 U.S. 449, 454. The lien here
asserted arises out of an agreement executed at a time
when there was no question of insolvency; nor is it restricted in its operation to the event of insolvency. It
may be exercised by execution or otherwise whenever the
bank ref'uses to pay. It resembles the lien which is enforced when seizure is made by the creditor within four
months of bankruptcy, of property claimed under an
after-acquired property clause of a mortgage; Thompson
v. Fairbanks, 196 U.S. 516; THumphrey v. Tatman, 198
'Act of June 3, 1864, c. 106, § 50, 13 Stat. 99, 114; R.S. § 5236:

LEWIS v. FIDELITY CO.
559

569

Opinion of the Court.

U.S. 91.12 It resembles also those cases where, under the
common law of distress or under a statutory lien, described by the courts as "inchoate" or "dormant," a
landlord, within four months of bankruptcy, seizing or
levying upon whatever property was on the tenant's premises, was held to have a valid lien. Henderson v. Mayer,
225 U.S. 631; Richmond v. Bird, 249 U.S. 174. Compare
Minnich v. Gardner,ante, p. 48. The case at bar is unlike Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, 161 U.S. 275, relied
upon by the receiver, where a New York statute dealing
with the administration of insolvent banks provided that
in the event of insolvency the deposits of a savings bank
would be entitled to a preference.
5. The receiver contends that, under a proper interpretation of the state depository statute, no lien whatever
is intended or arises when a national bank gives a bond to
secure state deposits, because the bond required of a
national bank is more onerous than that required of a
state bank.
The bond of the national bank must be double the
amount of the deposit; of the state bank only equal to it.
The lien is security for the bond, not the deposit; thus
in the case of a national bank, if the provision were applicable, the lien would be twice the amount of' the deposit.
As the court below noted, the double bond may have been
thought necessary because the State has not the power
to examine national banks. But whatever the occasion
for the difference, it does not appear to conflict with or
cloud the clear statement of the statute attaching the
lien to depository bonds as such and without qualifications. The ultimate decision of this question is for the
Supreme Court of Georgia but until it decides otherwise

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

we see no reason for not accepting the holding of the
court below as correct.
Third. The receiver contends that even if national
banks are authorized under the 1930 Act to give a general
lien upon their assets of the character described by the
Circuit Court of Appeals, the judgment should be reversed
because the bond antedated the Act. It appears that
the balance on hand June 25, 1930, was withdrawn soon
thereafter; that between June 25, 1930 and the appointment of the receiver, May 23, 1932, deposits were regularly
made aggregating a large sum; that from time to time
checks were drawn against these deposits; and that all of
the balance in bank when the receiver was appointed represented deposits made after the passage of the Act."3
The appointment of the bank as depository in 1928 andthe bond were to cover a period of four years. Though
the lien was in form security for the bond, the extent of
liability was to be measured by the unpaid balance. Thus,
the transaction was not completed in 1928; it was contemplated that there would be continuous dealings between
the parties for four years. In fact, the relation continued
until the appointment of the receiver. Throughout the
whole period the parties intended that the lien should
be operative and supposed that it was. The appointment was within the power of the State to confer and of
the bank to accept' but by reason of the paramount federal law one of the anticipated incidents of the relation,
the lien, could not arise. When that obstacle was removed by the Act of June 25, 1930, the original agreement could as to the future be given the effect intended
by the parties; and the lien became operative as to deposits thereafter made and is entitled to priority from

the date of the Act. A statute is not retroactive merely
because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.

consider whether the Act of June 25, 1930, would have
validated the lien also in respect to deposits made before
that date. Compare Gross v. United States Mortgage
Co., 108 U.S. 477, 488; West Side Belt R. Co. v. Pittsburgh
