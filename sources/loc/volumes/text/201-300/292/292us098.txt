POKORA v. WABASH RAILWAY CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 585.

Argued March 8, 9, 1934.-Decided April 2, 1934.

1. The burden of establishing the defense of contributory negligence
in a personal injuries case is on the defendant.
P. 100.
2. Upon a mction by the defendant for a directed verdict, made at
the close of the plaintiff's case in chief, and based upon the ground
of contributory negligence, the evidence must be viewed in the
light most favorable to the plaintiff and all inferences from it
which the jury might reasonably draw in his favor are to be
a ssumed. P. 100.
3. The prcposition that a driver of an automobile, before crossing a
railroad of which his view is obstructed, must get out of his
vehicle and inspect the track if he can not otherwise be sure that
a train is not dangerous!y near, can not be accepted as a general
rule of law. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Goodman, 275 U.S. 66,
limited. Pp, 102, 106.
4. The driver of an automobile truck, pursuing his way in a line of
auto traffic along a busy city thoroughfare in the day time, attempted to cross another street traversed by a railroad switch
track and, beyond that and close to it, by a main line for passenger trains. Before entering the street intersection, he had
stopped his vehicle, and, before proceeding, he looked for trains,
but a string of box cars on the switch cut off his view. He listened, but heard neither bell nor whistle. Still listening, he drove
across the switch and, reaching the main line, was struck by a
train coming at the unlawful speed of 25 or 30 miles per hour. The
evidence would support a finding that, owing to the presence of
the box cars and the preximity of the two tracks, the train was
not visible from his seat while there was still time to stop. In an
action for resultiug injuries, held:
(1) That the question whether, in the circumstances, it was
negligence to go forward in reliance on the sense of hearing unaided
by sight, was a question for the jury. P. 101.
(2) The driver was not bound as a matter of law to leave his
truck either on the switch track or at the curb, in order to make
visual observations which might turn out worthless by the time
lie had returned to the vehicle and driven it forward. Pp. 104 et seq.

Opinion of the Court.

5. A standard of prudent conduct declared by courts as a rule of
law must be taken over from the facts of life and must be such
that a failure to conform to it is negligence so obvious and certain
that rational and candid minds could not deem it otherwise. P. 104.

CERTIORARI, 290 U.S. 624, to review the affirmance of a
judgment for the Railway Company, entered on a directed verdict in Pokora's action for personal injuries.

Mr. W. St. John Wines for petitioner.
Mr. Homer Hall, with whom Mr. Walter M. Allen was
on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JusTICE CARDozo delivered the opinion of the
Court.
John Pokora, driving his truck across a railway grade
crossing in the city of Springfield, Illinois, was struck by
a train and injured. Upon the trial of his suit for damages, the District Court held that he had been guilty of
contributory negligence, and directed a verdict for the
defendant. The Circuit Court of Appeals (one judge
dissenting) affirmed; 66 F. (2d) 166, resting its judgment
on the opinion of this court in B. & 0. R. Co. v. Goodman,
275 U.S. 66. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.
Pokora was an ice dealer, and had come to the crossing
to load his truck with ice. The tracks of the Wabash
Railway are laid along Tenth Street, which runs north and
south. There is a crossing at Edwards Street running east
and west. T wo ice depots are on opposite corners of
Tenth and Edward Streets, one at the northeast coiner,
the other at the southwest. Pokora, driving west along
Edwards Street, stopped at the first of these corners to
get his load of ice, but found so many trucks ahead of
him that he decided to try the. depot on the other side of
the way. In this crossing of the railway, the accident
occurred.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Ccurt.

292 U.S.

The defendant has four tracks on Tenth Street, a switch
track on the east, then the main track, and then two
switches. Pokora, as he left the northeast corner where
his truck had been stopped, looked to the north for approaching trains. He did this at a point about ten or
fifteen feet east of the switch ahead of him. A string of
box cars standing on the switch, about five to ten feet from
the north line of Edwards Street, cut off his view of the
tracks beyond him to the north. At the same time he
listened. There was neither bell nor whistle. Still listening, he crossed the switch, and reaching the main track
was struck by a passenger train coming from the north at
a speed of twenty-five to thirty miles an hour.
The burden of proof was on the defendant to make out
the defense of contributory negligence. Miller v. Union
Pacific R. Co., 290 U.S. 227, 232. The record does not
show in any conclusive way that the train was visible to
Pokora while there was still time to stop. A space of
eight feet lay between the west rail of the switch and the
east rail of the main track, but there was an overhang of
the locomotive (perhaps two and a half or three feet), as
well as an overhang of the box cars, which brought the
zone of danger even nearer. When the front of the truck
had come within this zone, Pokora was on his seat, and so
was farther back (perhaps five feet or even more), just
how far we do not know, for the defendant has omitted to
make proof of the dimensions. Nice calculations are submitted in an effort to make out that there was a glimpse
of the main track before the switch was fully cleared.
Two feet farther back the track was visible, it is said, for
about 130 or 140 feet. But the view from that position
does .not tell us anything of significance unless we know
also the position of the train. Pokora was not protected
by his glimpse of 130 feet if the train at the same moment was 150 feet away or farther. For all that appears
he had no view of the main track northward, or none for

a substantial distance; till the train was so near that escape
had been cut off. Cf. Dobson v. St. Louis S. F. Ry. Co.,
223 Mo. App. 812, 822; 10 S.W. (2d) 528; Turner v.
Minneapolis, St. P. & S. S. M. R. Co., 164 Minn. 335, 341:
205 N.W. 213.
In such circumstances the question, we think, was for
the jury whether reasonable caution forbade his going
forward in reliance on the sense of hearing, unaided by
that of sight. No doubt it was his duty to look along
the track from his seat, if looking would avail to warn him
of the danger. This does not mean, however, that if vision was cut off by obstacles, there was negligence in going
on, any more than there would have been in trusting to
his ears if vision had been cut off by the darkness of the
night. Cf. Norfolk & W. Ry. v. Holbrook, 27 F. (2d)
326. Pokora made his crossing in the day time, but like
the traveler by night he used the faculties available to one
in his position. Johnson v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co.,
163 N.C. 431; 79 S.E. 690; Parsons v. Syracuse, B. &
N. Y. R. Co., 205 N.Y. 226, 228; 98 N.E. 331. A jury,
but not the court, might say that with faculties thus limited, he should have found some other means of assuring
himself of safety before venturing to cross The crossing
was a frequented highway in a populous city. Behind
him was a line of other cars, making ready to follow him.
To some extent, at least, there was assurance in the
thought that the defendant would not run its train at
such a time and place without sounding bell or whistle.
L. & N. R. Co. v. Summers, 125 Fed. 719, 721; Illinois
Revised Statutes, (1933 ed.), c. 114, 1184.1 I'ndeed, the
'The Illinois Act provides: "Every railroad corporation shall
cause a bell of at least thirty pounds weight, and a steam whistle
placed and kept on each locomotive engine, and shall cause the same
to be rung or whistled by the engineer or fireman, at the distance of
at least eighty rods from the place where the railroad crosses or
intersects any public highway, and shall be kept ringing or whistling
until such highway is reached."

statutory signals did not exhaust the defendant's duty
when to its knowledge there was special danger to the
traveler through obstructions on the roadbed narrowing
the field of vision. Wright v. St. Louis S. F. Ry. Co.,
327 Mo. 557, 566; 37 S.W. (2d) 591; Hires v. Atlantic
City R. Co., 66 N.J.L. 30; 48 Atl. 1002; Cordell v. N. Y. C.
& H. R. R. Co., 70 N.Y. 119. All this the plaintiff, like
any other reasonable traveler, might fairly take into
account. All this must be taken into account by us in
comparing what he did with the conduct reasonably to be
expected of reasonable men. Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Ives,
144 U.S. 408, 417; Flannelly v. Delaware & Hudson Co.,
225 U.S. 597.
The argument is made, however, that our decision in
B. & 0. R. Co. v. Goodman, supra,is a barrier in the plaintiff's path, irrespective of the conclusion that might commend itself if the question were at large. There is no
doubt that the opinion in that case is correct in its result.
Goodman, the driver, traveling only five or six miles an
hour, had, before reaching the track, a clear space of eighteen feet within which the train was plainly visible.! With
that opportunity, he fell short of the legal standard of
duty established for a traveler when he failed to look and
see. This was decisive of the case. But the court did not
stop there. It added a remark, unnecessary upon the
facts before it, which has been a fertile source of controversy. "In such circumstances it seems to us that
if a driver cannot be sure otherwise whether a train is
dangerously near he must stop and get out of his vehicle,
although obviously he will not often be required to do
more than to stop and look."
There is need at this stage to clear the ground of
brushwood that may obscure the point at issue. We do

not now inquire into the existence of a duty to stop, disconnected from a duty to get out and reconnoitre. The
inquiry, if pursued, would lead us into the thickets of conflicting judgments.' Some courts apply what is often
spoken of as the Pennsylvania rule, and impose an unyielding duty to stop, as well as- to look and listen, no
matter how clear the crossing or the tracks on either side.
See, e.g., Benner v. Philadelphia& Reading R. Co., 262
Pa. 307; 105 Atl. 283; Thompson v. Pennsylvania R.
Co., 215 Pa. 113; 64 Atl. 323; Hines v. Cooper, 205 Ala.
70; 88 So. 133; cf. PennsylvaniaR. Co. v. Yingling, 148
Md. 169; 129 Atl. 36. Other courts, the majority, adopt
the rule that the traveler must look and listen, but that
the existence of a duty to stop depends upon the circum-.
stances, and hence generally, even if not invariably, upon
the judgment of the jury. See, e.g., Judson v. Central
Vermont R. Co., 158 N.Y. 597, 605, 606;, 53 N.E. 514,
and cases cited; Love v. Fort Dodge R. Co., 207 Iowa
1278, 1286; 224 N.W. 815; Turner v. Minneapolis R. Co.,
supra; Wisconsin & Arkansas Lumber Co. v. Brady, 157
Ark. 449, 454; 248 S.W. 278; cf. Metcalf v. Central Vermont R. Co., 78 Conn. 614; 63 Atl. 633; Gills v. N. Y.
C. & St. L. R. Co., 342 Ill. 455; 174 N.E. 523. The subject has been less considered in this court, but in none
of its opinions is there a suggestion that at any and every
crossing the. duty to stop is absolute, irrespective of the
danger. Not even in B. & 0. R. Co. v. Goodman, supra,
which goes farther than the earlier cases, is there support
for such a rule. To the contrary, the opinion makes it
clear that the duty is conditioned upon the presence of
impediments whereby sight and hearing become inadequate for the traveler's protection. Cf. Murray v. So.
Pacific Co., 177 Cal. 1, 10; 169 Pac. 675 Williams v. Iola
Electric R. Co., 102 Kan. 268, 271; 170 Pac. 397.

OCTOBER TERM., 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

292 U.S.

Choice between these diversities of doctrine is unnecessary for the decision of the case at hand. Here the fact
is not disputed that the plaintiff did stop before he started
to cross the tracks. If. we assume that by reason of the
box cars, there was a duty to stop again when the obstructions had been cleared, that duty did not arise unless a
stop could be made safely after the point of clearance
had been reached. See, e.g., Dobson v. St. Louis S. F. Ry.
Co., supra. For reasons already stated, the testimony perinits the inference that the truck was in the zone of
danger by the time the field of vision was enlarged. No
stop would then have helped the plaintiff if he remained
seated on his truck, or so the triers of the facts might
find. His case was-for the jury unless as a matter of law
he was subject to a duty to get out of the vehicle before
it crossed the switch, walk forward to the front, and then,
afoot, survey the scene. We must say whether his failure
to do this was negligence so obvious and certain that one
conclusion and one only is permissible for rational and
candid minds. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Ives, supra.
Standards of prudent conduct are declared at times by
courts, but they are taken over from the facts of life. To
get out of a vehicle and reconnoitre is an uncommon precaution, as everyday experience informs us. Besides
being uncommon, it is very likely to be futile, and sometimes even dangerous. If the driver leaves his vehicle
when he nears a cut or curve, he will learn nothing by
getting out about the perils that lurk beyond. By the
time he regains his seat and sets his car in motion, the
hidden train may be upon him. See, e.g., Torgeson v.
Missouri-K.-T. R. Co., 124 Kan. 798, 800, 801; 262 Pac.
564; Dobson v. St. Louis S. F. R. Co., supra; Key v.
Carolina& N. W. R. Co., 150 S.C. 29, 35; 147 S.E. 625;
Georgia Railroad& Banking Co. v. Stanley, 38 Ga. App.
773, 778; 145 S.E. 530. Often the added safeguard will
be dubious though ihe track happens to be straight, as

POKORA v. WABASH RY. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

it seems that this one was,, at all events as far as the
station, about five blocks to the north. A train traveling
at a speed of thirty miles an hour will cover a quarter of
a mile in the space of thirty seconds. It may thus emerge
out of obscurity as the driver turns his back to regain the
waiting car, and may then descend upon him suddenly
when his car is on the track. Instead of helping himself
by getting out, he might do better to press forward with
all his faculties alert. So a train at, a neighboring station,
apparently at rest and harmless, may be transformed in a
few seconds into an instrument of destruction. At tines
the course of safety may be different. One can figure to
oneself a roadbed so level and unbroken that getting out
will be a gain. Even then the balance of advantage depends on many- circumstances and can be easily disturbed.
Where was Pokora to leave his truck after getting out to
reconnoitre? If he was to leave it on the switch, there
was the possibility that the box cars would be shunted
down upon him before he could regain his sea . The
defendant did not show whether there was a locomotive at
the forward end, or whether the cars were so few that a
locomotive could be seen. If he was to leave his vehicle
near the curb, there was even stronger reason to believe
that the space to be covered in going back and forth would
make his observations worthless. One must remember
that while the traveler turns his eyes in one direction,
a train or a loose engine may be approaching from the
other.
Illustrations such as these bear witness to the need for
caution in framing standards oif behavior that amount to
rules of law.. The need is the more urgent when there is
no background of experience out of which the standards
have emerged. They are then, not the natural flowerings of behavior in its customary forms, but rules artificially developed, and imposed from without. Extraordinary situations may not wisely or fairly be subjected to

tests or regulations that are fitting for the common-place
or normal. In default of the guide of customary conduct,
what is suitable for the traveler caught in a mesh where
the ordinary safeguards fail him is for the -judgment of
a jury. Dolan v. D. & H. C. Co., 71 N.Y. 285, 288, 289;
Davis v. N. Y. C. & H. R. R. Co., 47 N.Y. 400, 402. The
opinion in Goodman's case has been a source of confusion
in the federal courts to the extent that it imposes a standard for application by the judge, and has had only' wavering support in the courts of the states." We limit it
accordingly.
The judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.
