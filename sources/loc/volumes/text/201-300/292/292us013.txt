MISSOURI v. MISSOURI PAC. RY. CO.

13

Statement of the Case.

We agree with the conclusion of the District Court that
there was no lack of substantial evidence to support the
Commission's findings.
The Commission's determinations were "without
prejudice to the right of the authorities of the State of
Florida or of any other interested party to apply in the
proper manner for a modification of its (our) findings and
order as to any specified intrastate rate on the ground
that it is not related to interstate rates in such a way as
to contravene the provisions of the Interstate Commerce
Act." 190 I.C.C. p. 600.
Decree affirmed.
MISSOURI v. MISSOURI PACIFIC RAILWAY CO.
ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.

No. 824. Jurisdictional statement submitted February 28, 1934.Decided April 2, 1934.
1. Under the Act of February 13, 1925, this-Court can not entertain
a direct appeal from a decree of the District Court denying preference to a money claim of a State against a railway company in a
receivership proceeding. P. 15.
2. The provision of the Judiciary Act of 1891; § 5, for direct appeal
to this Court from the Circuit (later District) Court in cases
involving the Constitution was deleted by the Act of 1925; and
direct appeal in the cases of that class covered by Jud. Code, § 266,
as amended, lies only. where. hearing in the District Court was
before three judges, as provided in that section. P. 15.
Appeal dismissed.

The State in this case sought to support the appeal
upon the ground that enforcement of its claim was supplementary to a decree in an earlier case, directed by
this Court in the exercise of the jurisdiction by direct
appea1 then allowed by the Act of 1891.

Messrs. C. B. Allen and Lee B. Ewing filed the jurisdictional statement for appellant.
No appearance for appellees.
PER CURIAM.
This is a direct appeal to this Court from a decree of
the District Court of the United States for the Eastern
District of Missouri, entered May 6, 1933, in receivership
proceedings, and allowing a claim of the State of Missouri
for $7,000, as an unsecured obligation. The preference
sought by the State was denied. 'The claim is founded
upon alleged overcharges in railway passenger fares, exacted of the State of Missouri by the Missouri Pacific
Railway Company during the years 1907 to 1913 inclusive,
contrary to the provisions of the Missouri statute of 1907.
In a suit to enjoin the enforcement of that statute, an
interlocutory injunction was granted by the Circuit Court
of the United States for the. Western District of Missouri,
and later a final decree made the injunction permanent.
168 Fed. 317. In 1913, on a direct appeal to this Court
under authority of § 5 of the Judiciary Act of March 3,
1891 (c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, 827, 828; Jud. Code, 1911,
§ 238), the constitutional validity of the Missouri statute
was sustained and the parties to the suit which embraced
the Missouri Pacific Railway Company were directed to
apply to the court below for the entry of an appropriate
decree. MissouriRate Cases, 230 U.S. 474; Knott v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co., 230 U.S; 509, 511. Thereafter, the
District Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri entered a decree dissolving the injunction and-dismissing the bill, and appointing a master to
hear claims for ad interim overcharges. No such claim
appears to have been filed in that court'by this appellant.
In 1915, in a suit in the District Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of. Missouri, a receiver was

appointed for the Missouri Pacific Railway Company,
and, in 1916, the State of Missouri intervened in that suit
and presented the claim which resulted in the decree from
which the present appeal is taken.
Appellant contends that the decree should be treated as
supplementary to that directed by this Court in Knott v.
kissouri Pacific Ry. Co., supra, and as appealable directly
to this Court because the decree in the Knott case was so
appealable. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis S. W.
Ry. Co., 249 U.S. 134, 142.
The Court is of the opinion that it lacks statutory authority to entertain the appeal. The appeals in the Missouri Rate Cases and Knott v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co.,
supra, were taken from decrees of the United States Circuit Court entered in 1909 and were authiorized by those
provisions of § 5 of the Judiciary Act of 1891, supra, providing for a direct appeal to this Court from the circuit
(later, district) courts "in any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United
States . . . and in any case in which the constitution. or
law of a State is claimed to be in contravention of the
Constitution of the United States." By the Act of February 13, 1925 (c. 229, § 1, 43 Stat. 938), the provision for
a direct appeal to this Court from the decree of a District
Court in cases involving the construction or application of
the Constitution of the United States, was deleted. While
provision was retained for a direct review in this Court in
cases involving an application for interlocutory injunction
to prevent state officers from enforcing a state statute in
violation of the Federal Constitution, this provision obtained only where the hearing in the District Court was
before three judges, as provided by § 266 of the Judicial
Code.
The appeal is dismissed for the want of jurisdiction.

v. INTER-

STATE NATURAL GAS CO.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI.

No. 651.

Argued March 15, 1934.-Decided April 2, 1934.

1. A contract of tax exemption is not impaired by a later statute
authorizing assessments of back taxes on taxable property and not
specifying the property in question. P. 18.
2. A mere assessment for taxation is not a statute or an order of an
administrative board or commission within the meaning of § 266,
Judicial Code. P. 18.
3. A decree rendered by a District Court erroneously constituted of
three judges in a case not covered by § 266, Jud. Code, is not
reviewable on the merits by direct appeal to this Court; but such
appeal having been taken, this Court has jurisdiction to enforce
the limitations of that section; and, the time for appeal to the
Circuit Court of Appeals having expired,' this Court will reverse
the decree and remand to the District Court for. further proceedings to be taken independently of § 266. P. 19.
4 F.Supp. 697, reversed.
