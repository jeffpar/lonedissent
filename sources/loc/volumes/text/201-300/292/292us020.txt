thority of the State Commission which directed the
change of grade was conferred by the state statute of
July 9, 1919, P.L. 814. The state court held that the
damage in question was merely consequential, that the
allowance of recovery therefor was a matter of legislative grace and not of right, and that the statute as invoked by appellant was invalid as it did not conform to
the requirements of the state constitution. 311 Pa. 436;
166 Atl. 895. No federal question was raised prior to
a petition for rehearing in the Supreme Court of the
State, which was denied without more. Appellant insists that questions under the Fourteenth Amendment
were thus raised at the first opportunity. The petition
for rehearing does not appear in the record. Nor does
the record contain the pleadings, the evidence, or any findings by the state court upon the questions of fact involved. Appellant relies upon statements in the opinion
of the state court but these fail to support appellant's
contentions.
The appeal is dismissed for the want of a properly presented substantial federal question. Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 360, 362, 363; Dewey v: Des Moines,

CERTIORARI, 290 U.S. 624, to review the reversal of a
decree dismissing a petition to limit liability.

Air. Samuel B. Bassett for petitioner.
Mr. Edward G. Dobrin, with whom Messrs. Cassius E.
Gates and Claude E. Wakefield were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
For personal injuries, negligently inflicted, petitioner
Larsen sought judgment in the Superior Court, King
County, Washington, against respondent Transportation
Company, alleged owner and operator of motor ship
Norco. The complaint contained no reference to other
claimants co creditors. The company made general
denial; also Set up contributory negligence and assumption of risk. . It said nothing concerning any other creditor or claimant or desire to limit liability.
After verdict, September 22, 1932, judgment for $12,500
against the Company followed, October 1. It then petitioned the United States District Court for limitation of
liability. The petition recited the circumstances leading
to the judgment, prayed for an appraisement of the Company's interest as charterer and the pending freight, monition against all persons claiming damages, and appropriate
decree.
Larsen moved to dismiss this petition because :-The
facts alleged are not sufficient. " There is only one possible claimant and one charterer of the motor vessel Norco
and, therefore, the petitioner might have claimed and ob-

tained the advantage and benefit of the limitation of
liability statute by proper pleading in the action which
has been determined in the Superior Court of the State
of Washington for King County." "The petitioner failed
and refused to claim the advantage and benefit of the
limitation of liability statute, in said Superior Court of
the State of Washington, and thereby waived its right to
claim and obtain the advantage and benefit of said
statute."
The trial court sustained this motion and dismissed the
petition; the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. The
cause is here by certiorari graited upon Larsen's application, which set out the following specifications of error:Langnes v. Green, 282 U.S. 531, aid Ex parte Green,
286 U.S. 437, were misconstrued; it was 'wrongly held
that the District Court sitting in admiralty has exclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions involved in
a proceeding for the limitation of liability where there is
only one claimant and only one owner, and where the
owner's right to limit liability is-not disputed. It was
wrongly held that the state court had no jurisdiction
to entertain the claim of the shipowner for 'limitation of
liability where there is only one claimant and only one
owner, and where the owner's right to limit liability was
not isputed. Also, that in such cases, the shipowner
was under no obligation to submit his claim to limited
liability to -the state court, and the judgment of the state
court was not res judicata as to all issues which might
have been submitted for its decision.
In substance the argument here presented for petitioner
is this: 'Prior to Langnes v. Green and Ex parte Green,
decisions by inferior federal courts undoubtedly sustained
the view that, while the state court might have determined the value of respondent's interest in vessel and
pending freight and limited liability thereto, it was not

Opinion of the Court.

obligatory upon it to claim such limitation there, and
after judgment for damages the right remained to institute limitation proceedings in the federal court. But,.
those opinions have affirmed another view, and clearly
establish that the state court had jurisdiction and was
competent finally to consider all necessary facts and limit
the liability. Consequently, after the adverse judgment
respondent could not seek limitation elsewhere-it was
bound to present the whole matter to the state court.
We think it true to say that before Langnes v. Green
and Ex parte Green the commonly approved doctrine permitted a shipowner, even when there was only one claimant, to seek limitation of liability in a federal court after
judgment against him for damages by a state court. And,
unless those cases are to the contrary, that rule must apply here. White v. Island Transp. Co., 233 U.S. 346; In
re East River Co., 266 U.S. 355; The S. A. McCaulley, 99
Fed. 302; Re Old Dominion S.S. Co., 115 Fed. 845; Gleason v. Duffy, 116 Fed. 298; The Ocean Spray, 117 Fed.

v. Hurst, 200 Fed. 711; Hughes on Admiralty, ยง 172;
Benedict on Admiralty (4th ed.) ยง 520.
In Langnes v. Green the injured employe brought an
action for damages in the state court. Pending that, the
employer instituted proceedings in the federal court to
limit liability. The injured man was the only claimant
and cause existed for regarding the -limitation proceeding
as intended to defeat trial by jury. This Court held, in
the circumstances, the federal court should not. have enjoined the state court proceeding; but that it should have
retained jurisdiction. When thereafter it appeared-Ex.
parte Green-that in the state court the injured party insisted on denying the owner's right to limitation, we said

292 U.S.

the federal court properly enjoined further proceedings.
Neither of these causes supports the suggestion that when
sued for damages in a state court a shipowner must at his
peril claim limitation of liability in that suit.
Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, 259 U.S. 255, replying to alleged error because the trial court refused to
charge as requested, said"Petitioner asked an instruction that ยง 4283 of the
Revised Statutes applied, and that under it the verdict
could not exceed the value of the vessel. In a state court,
when there is only one possible claimant and one owner,
the advantage of this section may be obtained by proper
pleading. The Lotta, 150 Fed. 219, 222; Delaware River
Ferry Co. v. Amos, 179 Fed. 756. Here the privilege was
not set up or claimed in the answer, and it could not be
first presented upon request for a charge to the jury."
[p. 260.]
This lends no support to the view that, sued in a state
court for damages, the shipowner must set up his claim
for limitation; otherwise, it is waived.
. Statutory provisions for limitation of liability should
be construed liberally in order to effectuate their beneficent purposes. Providence & N. Y. S.S. Co. v. Hill lfg.
Co., 109 U.S. 578, 588; Butler v. Boston & Savannah S.S.
Co., 130 U.S. 527, 549, 550; LaBourgogne, 210 U.S. 95,
121; Capitol Transportation Co. v. Cainbria Steel Co.,
249 U.S. 334; Evansville & B. G. Packet Co. v.Chero
Cola Bottling Co., 271 U.S. 19, 21; Hartford Accident &
Ind. Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 273 U.S. 207, 214; Flink
v. Paladini, 279 U.S. 59. This view does not harmonize
with the suggestion that to obtain limitation a shipowner
must initiate steps to that end before any liability has
been made to appear. The Benefactor, 103 U.S. 239.
While in certain circumstances the shipowner may ask
limitation in the state court, he is not compelled so
to do.

Here the shipowner recognized the judgment; said
nothing against its validity. The proceedings in the two
courts looked towards entirely different ends.
The established rule in this Court is that if, in a second
action between the same parties, a claim or demand different from the one sued upon in the prior action is
presented, then the judgment in the former cause is an
estoppel "only as to those matters in issue or points
controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered." Bates v. Bodie, 245 U.S.
520, 526; United States v. Moser, 266 U.S. 236, 241;
United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, 258 U.S.
451, 458. "While a defendant must bring forward all
purely defensive matter, he is not barred by a former
judgment against him as to any matter which he was not
bound to present and which was not in fact litigated.
A judgment is not conclusive of those matters as to which
a party had the option to but did not in fact put in litigation in the action." Freeman on Judgments. 5th ed.,
