v. ILLINOIS BELL TELE-

PHONE CO.*
APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 440.

Argued January 15, 16, 1934.-Decided April 30, 1934.

1. Findings of a District Court, purporting to show the value of the
property of a telephone company in its intrastate business, its net
income therefrom and the fair rate of return, for each of a long
series of years during which the State sought to impose a decrease
of rates, can not be accepted as a basis for deciding whether the
decrease would result in confiscation, when, tested by the same
findings, the existing rates, clearly adequate and under which
the company operated with outstanding success throughout the
same period and before, were themselves grossly inadequate.
P. 160.
2. Elaborate calculations which are at war with realities revealed by
the financial history of the business are of no avail in determining
the adequacy of rates prescribed for a public- utility corporation.
P. 164.
3. To su-tain its attack on a decrease of its rates as contrary to due
process, a public utility must establish clearly and definitely that
the decrease will bring about confiscation. P. 164.
4. Charges to operating expenses may be as important as valuations
of its property in determining the adequacy of a public utility's
rate. P. 164.
5. In determining °reasonable rates for supplying public service, it is
proper to include in the operating expenses, that is, in the cost of
producing the service, an allowance for consumption of capital, in
order to. maintain the integrity of the investment in the service
rendered. P. 167.
6. Broadly 8peaking, the term depreciation, as apphea to the property of a public utility company, means the loss, not restored by
current maintenance, which is due to all the factors causing the
- ultimate retirement of the property; these factors include wear and
tear, decay, inadequacy and obsolescence. Annual depreciation is
the loss which takes place in a year. P. 167.

7. While depreciation is defined as -the expense occasioned by the
using up of physical property employed as fixed capital, and
current maintenance as the expense occasioned in keeping the
physical property in the condition required for continued use
during its service life, it isevident that the distinction is a difficult
one to observe in practice with scientific precision, and that outlays
charged to current expenses may involve many substitutions of new
for old parts which tend to keep down the accrued depreciation.
P. 173.
8. Where the amounts which a telephone company annually charges
to operating expenses for depreciation and invests in plant and
equipment are excessive, the 'telephone subscribers are, to the
extent of such excess, required to provide capital contributions,
not to make good losses incurred by the company in the service
rendered and thus keep its investment unimpaired, but to secure
additional plant and equipment upon which the company expects
a return. P. 169.
9. Confiscation being the issue in this case, the telephone company
has the burden of making a convincing showing that the amounts
it has charged for depreciation to operating expenses have not
been excessive; and that burden is not sustained by proof that its
general accounting system has been correct, since, though the
calculations are mathematical, the underlying predictions of life
of plant and salvage are essentially matters of opinion, involving
many perplexing problems and the examination of many variable
elements, in which opportunities for excessive allowances for
depreciation, even under a. correct system of accounting, are
always present; the predictions must be checked by and meet the
test of experience. P. 169.
10. Giving full weight to the proposition that a reserve for depreciation built up by a telephone company according to the " straight
line" method does not represent in any given year the amount of
actual depreciation at that time, especially in a rapidly growing
plant, such ,considerations fail to explain the great excess of
depreciation reserve over actual depreciation in each of the many
years involved in this case. P. 171.
11. The evidence showed the amounts by which the reduction of
rate in question would have diminished the company's income in
each of a long series of years; also, for each year, the amounts
charged -to operation for depreciation and for expenses of maintenance, and the amount of actual depreciation. The company
had maintained its plant at a very hig'h arid constant level of

efficiency by strict, standards, replacements in anticipation of
inadequacy or obsolescence, and expenditures for maintenance,
including substitutions of parts, and yet in each year the depreciation reserve was greatly in excess of the depreciation actually
accrued. Held:
That the company has not -established that the reserve merely
represents consumption of capital in the service rendered; rather,
it appears that the depreciation reserve to a large extent represents
provision for capital additions, over and above the amount required
to cover capital consumption; and the questionable amounts so
annually charged to operating expenses for depreciation are large
enough to destrov any basis for holding that it has been convincinglv shown that the reduction in income through the rates in suit
would produce confiscation. P. 174.
12. Where a public utility has had abundant opportunity to prove
that a rahe is confiscatory but adduces only elaborate estimates
and computations which fail of their intended effect, and do not
justify the decree of the court below in its favor, it is not the
function of this Court to construct independent calculations out of
a voluminous record to invalidate the rate, but the decree should
be reversed with directions to dissolve the interlocutor, injunction,
provide for refunding under the injunction bonds of amounts
charged pendcnte lite in excess of the rate in question, and to
dismiss the bill. P. 175.

the Court.
This case comes here for the second time. It presents
the question of the validity under the Fourteenth Amendment of rates prescribed by the Illinois Commerce Commission for telephone service in the City of Chicago. The
Commission's order, made on August 16, 1923, to be
effective October 1, 1923, reduced rates applicable to a
large part ofihe intrastate service of the appellee, Illinois
Bell Telephone Company.' In this suit, brought by that
Company in September, 1923, an interlocutory injunction
was granted upon the condition that if the injunction were
dissolved the Company should refund the amounts
charged in excess of the challenged rates. We affirmed
that order. 269 U.S. 531. The final hearing was not
had until April, 1929,-a delay found to be attributable to
the City of Chicago. On that hearing, the District Court,
composed of three judges, entered a final decree making
the injunction permanent. 38 F. (2d) 77. We reversed
that decree and remanded the case for further proceedings.

No. 440.-The appeal of the state officers and the City
of Chicago. On the former appeal, it appeared that no
distinction had been made by the Commission or by the
d
District Court between the intrastate and the interstate
property and business of the Company. We found that
separation was essential to the appropriate recognition of
the competent governmental authority in each field of
regulation. Accordingly, we directed that as to the value
of the property employed in the intrastate business in Chicago and as to the amounts of revenue and expenses incident to that business, separately considered, there should
be specific findings. And as a rate order which is confiscatory when made may cease to be confiscatory, and
one which is valid when made may become confiscatory
at a later period, we held that there should be appropriate findings for each of the years since the date of the
Commission's order. 282 U.S. pp. 149, 162. On the
further hearing, that difficult task was so well performed
that no question is now raised as to the allocation of property to the intrastate and interstate services, respectively,
in the Chicago area, the allocation being made on the
basis of use.' Nor is there dispute with respect to the

separation of expenses. Appellants object to the separation of revenues, insisting that certain revenues were inproperly assigned to the interstate, instead of the intrastate, business.'
Considering the fact that ninety-nine per cent. of the
stock of appellee is owned by the American Telephone &
Telegraph Company, which also owns substantially the
same proportion of the stock of the Western Electric Company, we directed that there should bc further examination of the purchases made by appellee from the Western
Electric Company and of the payments made by appellee
to the American Company.

As it appeared

that the

Western Electric Company, through the organization and
control of the American Company, was virtually the
manufacturing department for the Bell system, we
directed specific findings to be made as to the net earnings
of the Western Electric Company in that department and
as to the extent to which, if at all, such profit figured in
the estimates upon which the charge of confiscation was
predicated. We also held that there should be specific
findings with regard to the cost to the American Company
of the services which it rendered to appellee and the
reasonable amount which should be allocated in that.
respect to the operating expenses of appellce's intrastate
business. Id., pp. 153, 157. The District Court entered
into an exhaustive examination of these questions and
made detailed findings. The court found that the equipment and supplies furnished by the Western Electric Company had been sold to appellee at, fair and reasonable
prices, and that the earnings of the Western Electric
Company on its investment allocated to the business clone
'The amounts of net revenue thus involved, which appellants contend should not have been allocated (under the rates in suit.) to the
interstate service for the respective years, are as follows: 1923,
$245,042; 1924, $262,398; 1925, $309,505; 1926, S317,915; 1927,

Opinion of the Court.

with appellee, and its profits on sales, had been fair and
reasonable, with the exception of an advance in prices of
10.2 per cent. effective on November 1, 1930. That advance the court disapproved, and, in determining the
reasonable outlays to be allowed to appellee after that
date, the court made a reduction of 10 per cent. from the
prices charged by the Western Electric Company.'
Appellee contests this reduction, and appellants object
to the amounts allowed..
The District Court made specific findings as to the character of the services rendered by the American Company
under its license contracts with appellee and the amounts
of the cost of these services which should be allocated to
the operating expenses of the latter's intrastate business.
In the years 1923 to 1928, inclusive, when the court found
that the payments under the license contracts charged on
appellee's books exceeded the cost as thus determined and
allocated, only the cost was held to be chargeable to operating expenses, but in the years 1929 to 1931, inclusive,
when the license payments as so charged were less than
the cost, only the amount of the license payments was allowed as an operating expense.' Appellants raise many
questions in opposition to these determinations of costs
and allocations, while appellee contends that the costs as
found were less than the true costs and that the full
amounts paid under the license contracts should have
been allowed.
' Appellee states that this effected a reduction in the operating
expenses of appellee of $67,167 for the last two months of 1930,
$332,470 for 1931, and an equal amount for 1932.
The amounts of the license payments thus disallowed by the
Court, as being in excess of the cost of the service, for the years
1923 to 1928, inclusive, are as follows: 1923, $573,819; 1924,
$631,549; 1925, $531,233; 1926, $432,704; 1927, $558,011; 1928,
$31,553. The amounts by which the cost to the American Company
exceeded the license payments, for the years 1929 to 1931, are as
follows: 1929, $206,253; 1930, $327,751; 1931, $234,104.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

292 U.S.

The evidence with respect to the value of appellee's
property employed in its intrastate business at Chicago
is voluminous. The evidence shows the original or book
cost of this property, the market value of land, and estimates of the cost of reproduction new of the other physical property constituting appellee's telephone plant.
There was also evidence of the condition of the property,
together with estimates of accrued depreciation. Appellants submitted no valuations since one made by the Commission in 1923,6 but presented detailed criticisms of appellee's estimates. The District Court found that the
method adopted by appellee's witness in ascertaining the
cost of reproduction new was reliable and that appellee's
estimates were substantially correct. The court encountered difficulties in making its valuations for the years
1931 and 1932. It took notice of the general fall in values which had accompanied the depression in business.
And for that reason, the court fixed values for 1931 and
1932 which in its opinion " gave due consideration to the
element of the present decline." The court found that
the fair rate of depreciation to be applied to reproduction
cost new was 16 per cent. for the years 1923 to 192S, inclusive, and 13 per cent. for the succeeding years; and that
the amount to be added to reproduction cost new on account of going valuc was S per cent. of that cost. The
court also made findings as to the appellee's working cash
capital. the amounts invested in materials and supplies

and in property in course of construction, and as to these
three items there is no controversy.
The court's findings, for each year, of the fair value of

appellee's property, used and useful in its intrastate business in the Chicago area, including working cash capital,
materials and supplies, construction work in progress and
going value, taking the average amount for the year, and

Appellants contend that the findings gs to fair value
are excessive. Appellee insists that they are too low. In
particular, appellee says that the property was undervalued through excessive deductions for existing depreciation. Appellee maintains that the evidence shows a maximum depreciation of 9 per cent. for the years 1923 to
1928, and of 8 per cent. thereafter, instead of the 16 per
cent. and 15 per cent. deducted by the court.
In computing the net revenue from the intrastate business in Chicago, the court made adjustments in operating
expenses with respect to the payments to the Western
Electric Company and the American Company, as above
stated, and also reduced to some extent the annual
charges for depreciation. By these adjustments, the
amount of the net revenue as found by the court largely
exceeded that shown by appellee's books. For example,
the amount available for return in the year 1923 under
the existing rates appears to have been $5,347,533 according to appellee's books, while the amount found by the
court to have been available for return in that year is
$6,646,183. We shall presently refer to the comparison
for the other years.
The court found that, if the rates in suit had been effective, appellee's net earnings on its intrastate business

292 U.S.

would have thereby been reduced to the extent of $1,541,668 for 1923, and by somewhat greater amounts in later
years except in 1931 and 1932. As thus estimated, the
net revenue available for return from the intrastate business in Chicago under the rates in suit would have been as
follows: 1923, $5,104,515; 1924, $5,932,959; 1925, $6,297,890; 1926, $6,402,128; 1927, $6,686,503; 1928, $6,914,459;
1929, $8,939,602; 1930, $8,492,385; 1931, $8,392,555; 1932,
$6,750,000.
The court found that the fair rate of return on the
average fair value of the intrastate property was 71/2 per
cent. for each of the years 1923 to 1927, inclusive, 7 per
cent. for each of the years 1928, 1929 and 1930, 61/.
per cent. for 1931, and 51/2 per cent. for 1932. On the
basis of these findings of fact, the court concluded that
the rates in suit were confiscatory at all times from the
date of the Commission's order.
1. The experience of the Company under the existing
rates. The effect of the decision below, and of the findings upon which it is based, strikingly appears if we put
aside for the moment the rates in suit and consider that
effect in relation to the existing rates under which the
Illinois Company has conducted its business since 1920.
That is, if we compare the amounts available for returnthe net intrastate income in Chicago under existing ratesas shown (1) by appellee's statement from its books and
(2) by the court's adjustments, with (3) the amount of
the net income which, under the findings of fair value, income, expenses, and rate of return, would be necessary to
avoid confiscation. The following table-with columns
correspondingly designated-gives the comparison:7
Column (1) gives the net intrastate income in Chicago as shown
by the Company from its books; column (2) the amount as

adjusted by the District Court; and column (3) the amount required by the court's findings.

On this showing, the findings if accepted would compel
the conclusion that when the Commission's order was
made in 1923, not only the new rates, but the existing
rates as well were grossly confiscatory.; that appellee was
receiving under the existing rates, according to its books,
a net return of $5,347,533 when it was entitled to nearly
$4,000,000 more, or $9,315,000, to prevent its property
from being confiscated. The table shows a similar situation in the succeeding years. Again, the inference would
be irresistible that the existing rates were confiscatory
when they were prescribed by the Public Utilities Commission of Illinois (the predecessor of the present Commission) in December, 1920, to be effective January 1,
1921. In the comprehensive disclosure of appellee's
financial condition there is nothing to permit an inference
of any radical change which would have made rates, compensatory in 1921, confiscatory in 1923.
But, instead of challenging the existing rates as constituting an invasion of constitutional right, appellee when
summoned by the Commission, in September, 1921, in the
proceeding which led to the order now under review, asserted that the existiiig rates were just and reasonable.
In its answer to the Commission, appellee alleged " that

of Illinois, entered on the 20th day of December, 1020,
and now in full force and effect, are just and reasonable,
and that the burden of proof is upon whomsoever avers, or
seeks to show, that said rates and charges are unjust or
unreasonable." And when this suit was brought in September, 1923, to prevent the enforcement of the new
rates, appellee did not seek to enjoin the existing rates.
The financial history of the Illinois Company repels the
suggestion that during all these years it was suffering from
confiscatory rates. Its capital stock rose from $9,000,000
in 1901, to $70,000,000 in 1923, $80,000,000 in 1925,
$110,000,000 in 1927, $130,000,000 in 1929, and $150,000,000 in 1930. Its funded debt, which was somewhat
less than $50,000,0C0 in 1923, continued at about the
same amount until 1930. During this period appellee
paid the interest on its debt and 8 per cent. dividends on
its stock. Its "fixed capital reserves," 8 which embraced
the depreciation reserve presently to be mentioned, rose
from $37,575,004 in 1923, to $63,966,748 in 1930, and to
$69,242,667 in 1931. The Company's surplus and undivided profits over and above these capital reserves increased from $5,600,326 in 1923, to $22,907,654 in 1930,
and to $23,767,381 in 1931. Its "fixed capital," that is,
the book cost of "total plant and general equipment,"
which was $145,984,084 at the end of 1923, increased to
$288,381,090 at the end of 1930, and to $291,259,580 at
the end of 1931.1 We do not lose sight of the fat that
this showing embraces the entire business of the Illinois
Company, both interstate and intrastate. But it appears
that the intrastate investment in the Chicago area ap@
The "fixed capital reserves" are the depreciation reserve and the
rescrve for amortization of intangible capital. The latter reserve
ranged from $182,041.50, in the year 1923, to $274,086.36 in 1930,
and to $289,018.77 in 1931.

proximated 60 per cent. of the entire investment of appellee in the State. The book cost of the plant in service
and general equipment in intrastate business in Chicago
increased from $95,582,266 at the end of 1923 to $174,160,314 at the end of 1930, and to $177,384,652 at the end
of 1931." ° "The gross additions" to the Company's
property in the Chicago area, the Company states, "were
spread fairly evenly over the period."--" The business
expanded with great rapidity. The number of telephones
in Chicago increased from 690,000 at the end of 1923 to
940,000 at the end of 1931, and was 987,000 at the peak
in 1929." During the nine years "a greater amount of
plant was added new to the property than was in service at
the beginning of the term." The Company informs us
that the property was kept "at a high and even standard
of maintenance throughout the years involved " and "was
at all times capable of giving adequate telephone service
abreast of the art." The property has been efficiently and
economically operated and the Company has enjoyed
excellent credit.
This actual experience of the Company is more convincing than tabulations of estimates. In the face of
that experience, we are unable to conclude that the Company has been operating under confiscatory intrastate
rates. Yet, as we have said, the conclusion that the existing rates have been confiscatory--and grossly confiscatory-would be inescapable if the findings below were
accepted. In that event, the Company would not only
be entitled to resist reduction through the rates in suit,
but to demand, as a constitutional right, a large increase

standing success. Elaborate calculations which are at war
with realities are of no avail. The glaring incongruity
between the effect of the findings below, as to the amounts
of return that nust be available in order to avoid confiscation, and the actual results of the Company's business,
makes it impossible to accept those findings as a basis
of decision.
2. The effect of the reduction through the rates in suit.
The foregoing considerations limit our inquiry. It is not
necessary to traverse the wide field of controversy to which
we are invited and to review the host of contested points
presented by counsel. In the view that the existing rates
cannot be regarded as inadequate, the question-is simply
as to the effect of the reduction in net income by the
rates in suit. The question is whether the Company has
established, with the clarity and definiteness befitting the
cause, that this reduction would bring about confiscation.

Operating expenses. In determining the effect of these
reductions, and what amounts would still be available to
the Company for net return, we come to the questions
raised by the Company's charges to operating expenses.
Charges to operating expenses may be as important as
valuations of property. Thus, excessive charges of
$1,500,000 to operating expenses would be the equivalent
of 6 per cent. on $25,000,000 in a rate base. In this in" The amounts of the reduction in intrastate income in Chicago,

stance, against the reductions which the rates in suit would
have effected, are the considerable sums which would be
added to the amounts available for return by the adjustments in operating expenses made by the District Court."2
These adjustments embraced overpayments found to have
been made by the Illinois Company in its transactions with
the American Telegraph and Telephone Company and the
Western Electric Company. In 1923, the overpayment to
the former Company, treating its outlay, or the cost of
its service to its subsidiary, as the measure of the operating expense, .was found to be $573,819; the average of
the annual overpayments, as found for the years 1923 to
1927, inclusive, amounted to $545,443.". It should be
noted that on the same basis of adjustment- there would
have been an increase (averaging $256,036) in operating
expenses for the years 1929 to 1931, when the cost of the
service exceeded the license payments." The court below found overpayments to the Western Electric Company
of $332,470 in 1931 and 1932, respectively." There are
numerous contentions presented by each of the parties in
relation to these aajustments--by appellants, to decrease,
and by appellee, to increase, the amounts of expense allowed-but we shall not undertake to pass upon them in
view of the determinative nature, for the present purpose,
of the remaining question as to the sums which the Company has annually charged to operating expenses for
depreciation.

in the order under review, concluded that the depreciation reserve (amounting, at the end of 1922, for the Chi12 See

cago property, interstate and intrastate, to about $26,000,000) had been built up by annual additions that were
in excess of the amounts required. The Commission provided for "a combined maintenance and replacement
allowance" which it considered sufficient to protect the
investment in the property and to permit the Company
"to accrue a reserve in the anticipation of property retirements." On the first hearing, the District Court considered that the effect of that ruling was to reduce the
amount charged for depreciation to the operating expenses
in 1923 to the extent of about $1,800,000."; The Company did not comply with the Commission's requirement
but continued its own method of computing the annual
allowances. We adverted to this question on the former
appeal. We said that the recognition of the ownership of
the property represented by the depreciation reserve did
not justify the continuance of excessive charges to operating expenses. We thought that the experience of the
Illinois Company, together with a careful analysis of
the results shown under comparable conditions, by other
companies which are part of the Bell system, should afford a sound basis for judgment as to the amount which
in fairness both to public and private interest should be
allowed as an annual charge. 282 U.S. pp. 157-159. The
District Court in making its findings stated that it had
considered the data to which we referred, but we are not
advised as to the precise method of its calculations."

its books to operating expenses,8 are as follows16 38 F. (2d) pp. 86, 87.

Broadly speaking, depreciation is the loss, not restored
by current maintenance, which is due to all the factors
causing the ultimate retirement of the property. These
factors embrace wear and tear, decay, inadequacy, and
obsolescence.1" Annual depreciation is the loss which
takes place in a year. In determining reasonable rates
for supplying public service, it is proper to include in the
operating. expenses, that is, in the cost of producing the
service, an 'allowance for consumption of capital in order
to maintain the integrity of the investment in the service
rendered." The amount necessary to be provided annually for this purpose is the subject of estimate and computation. In this instance, the Company has used the
"straight line" -method of computation, a method ap'oDepreciation,

as defined by the Interstate Commerce Com-

mission, "is the loss in service value not restored by current maintenance and incurred in connection with the consumption or prospective retirement of prcperty in the course of service from causes

against which the carrier is not protected by insurance, which are
known to be in current operation, and whose effect can be forecast
with a reasonable approach to accuracy." 177 I.C.C. p. 422.

proved by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 177
I.C.C. pp.' 408, 413. 'By this method the annual depreciation charge is obtained by dividing the estimated service value by the number of years of estimated service life.
The method is designed to spread evenly 6ver the service
life of the property the loss which is realized when the
property is ultimately retired from service. According
to the principle of this accounting practice, the loss is
computed upon the actual cost of the property as entered
upon the books, less the expected salvage, and the amount
charged each year is one year's pro rata share of the total
amount. " Because of the many different classes of
plant, some with long and some with short lives, some
having large salvage and others-little salvage or no salvage, and because of the large number of units of a class,
the Company employs averages, that is, average service
life, average salvage of poles, of telephones, etc.
While property remains in the plant, the estimated depreciation rate is applied to the book cost and the resulting
amounts are charged currently as expenses of operation.
The same amounts are credited to the account for depreciation reserve, the "Reserve for Accrued Depreciation."
When property, is retired, its cost is taken out of the capital
accounts, and its cost, less salvage, is taken out of the
depreciation reserve account. According to the practice of
the Company, the depreciation reserve is not held as a
separate fund but is invested in plant and equipment. As
the allowances for depreciation, credited to the depreciation reserve account, are charged to operating expenses,
the depreciation reserve invested in the property thus
represents, at a given time, the amount of the investment
which has been made out of the proceeds of telephone rates
for -the ostensible purpose of replacing capital consumed.
If the predictions of service life were entirely accurate and
retirements were made when and as these predictions were

precisely fulfilled, the depreciation reserve would represent the consumption of capital,. on a cost basis, according
to the method which spreads that loss over the respective
service periods. But if the amounts charged to operating
expenses and credited to the account for depreciation
reserve are excessive, to that extent subscribers for the
telephone service are required to provide, in effect, capital
contributions, not to make good losses incurred by the
utility in the service rendered and thus to keep its investment unimpaired, but to secure additional plant and
equipment upon which the utility expects a-return.
Confiscation being the issue, the Company has the burden of making a convincing showing that the amounts it
has charged to operating expenses for depreciation have
not been excessive. That burden is not, sustained by
proof that its general accounting system has been correct.
The calculations are mathematical but the predictions
underlying them are essentially matters of opinion."
They proceed from studies of the "behavior of large
groups" of items. These studies are beset with a host
of perplexing problems. Their determination involves
the examination of many variable elements., and oppor22 In the exposition in evidence, to which the Company's counsel
refer in their argument, of the "Straight Line Depreciation Practice" of the companies in the Bell system, it is said: " The proper
interpretation of the data. regarding plant life and salvage obtainable
from accounts,. records and statistics is of equal importance with the
integrity of the data themselves. It would seem that we should
have first: investigations of past service life and salvage through
sound accounting and statistical methods; second: investigations
of the conditions surrounding the employment of such plant in the
past and of the extent to which such conditions still prevail;
third: the best possible forecast of conditions looming in the future
which should exert a modifying influence upon either life or salvage. And then, the active judgment which fuses the experience

the future, so far as it is presently pertinent, into a just and reasonable determination of the current rate of depreciation for the time

tunities for excessive allowances, even under a correct
system of accounting, are always present. The necessity
of checking the results is not questioned. The predictions must meet the controlling test of experience.
In this instance, the evidence of expert computations
of the amounts required for annual allowances does not
stand alone. In striking contrast is the proof of the
actual condition of the plant as maintained-proof which
the Company strongly emphasizes as complete and indisputable in its sharp criticism of the amount of accrued
depreciation found by the District Court in valuing the
property. The Company insists that "the existing depreciation in the property, physical and functional, does
not exceed 9 per cent. in the years 1923 to 1928 and 8
per cent. thereafter." The existing depreciation as thus
asserted by the Company, and the amounts it shows as
the depreciation reserve allocated to the intrastate business in Chicago (taking in each case the average amounts
per year) are as follows:

The Company obtains these average amounts from the total

to obtain the average. The balance in the depreciation reserve for
the entire Chicago property, interstate and intrastate, increased
from $4,384,828 at the end of 1911 to $29,306,122 at the end of 1923.

not purport to measure the actual, depreciation at that
time; that there is no regularity in the development of
depreciation; that it does not proceed in accordance with
any fixed rule; that as to a very large part of the property there is no way of predicting the extent to which
there will be impairment in a particular year. Many
different causes operating differently at different times
with respect to different sorts of property produce the
ultimate loss against which protection is sought. As the
accruals to the depreciation reserve are the result of
calculations which are designed evenly to distribute the
loss over estimated service life, the accounting reserve will
ordinarily be in excess of the actual depreciation. Further, there are the special conditions of a growing plant,"there are new plant groups in operation on which
depreciation is accruing but which are not yet represented, or are but slightly represented, in the retirement
losses." Where, as in this instance, there has been a rapid'
growth, retirements at one point of time will relate for
the most part to the smaller preceding plant, while the
depreciation reserve account is currently building up to
meet the "increased eventual retirement liability" of
the enlarged plant.
Giving full weight to these considerations, we are not
persuaded that they are adequate to explain the great disparity which the evidence reveals. As the Company's
counsel say: "The reserve balance and the actual depreciation at any time can be compared only after examining
the property to ascertain its condition; the depreciation,
physical and functional, thus found can be measured in
dollars and the amount compared with the reserve."
Here, we are dealing not simply with a particular year
but with a period of many years-a fairly long range of
experience-and with careful and detailed examinations
made both at the beginning and near the end of that period. The showing of the condition of the property, and

of the way in which it has been maintained, puts the
matter in a strong light. In substance, the Company
tells us: The property in Chicago is a modern Bell system
plant. Through the process of current maintenance,
worn, damaged or otherwise defective parts were being
constantly removed before th'eir impairment affected the
telephone service. The factors of "inadequacy" and
"obsolescence" were continuously anticipated by the
Company, so that the telephone service might not be impaired, "and no depreciation of that character was ever
present in the plant, except to the slight extent that obsolete items of plant were found" as stated by the Company's witnesses. One of these witnesses testified that,
in his examination of the plant to determine existing depreciation, he understood "that anything that was obsolete or inadequate was to be depreciated accordingly."
We are told by the Company that in that investigation"Condition new was assumed to be free from defects or
impairment of any kind, that is, perfect or 100.% condition, and the thing as it stood in actual use in the plant
was compared with the same thing new." . "All existing
depreciation, both physical and functional, was reduced to
a percentage, and subtracted from 100 per cent." The
service measured up to the standards of the telephone art
at all times. The plant capable of giving such service
"was not functionally deficient, in any practical sense.
This is not to say that parts of the plant did not from
time to time become inadequate or obsolete, but that the Company continuously anticipates and forestalls inade-'
quacy and obsolescence. Before a thing becomes inadequate or obsolete it is removed from the plant." But
little variation was found in the percentage of existing
depreciation during the years 1923 to 1931.4 The Com'Referring to the period 1923 to 1931, and to the Company's
exhibit, the Company's counsel state-that "the percentage of
depreciation in the various classes of plant did not vary materially

pany points out that the Commission found, in its order
of 1923, that the property was then "in at least 90 per
cent. condition." "The weighted total or overall condition," the Company shows, "is 91 per cent. for the years
1923-1928 and 92 per cent. for subsequent years."
This condition, kept at a nearly constant level, directs
attention to the amounts expended for current maintenance. In the process of current maintenance, "new
parts" are "installed to replace old parts" in units of
property not retired. Such "substitutions or 'repairs'."
are separate from the amounts which figure in the depreciation reserve. The distinction between expenses for
current maintenance and depreciation is theoretically
clear. Depreciation is defined as the expense occasioned
by the using up of physical property'employed as fixed
capital; current maintenance, as the expense occasioned in
keeping the physical property in the condition required for
continued use during its service life. But it is evident
that the distinction is a difficult one to observe in practice
with scientific precision, and that outlays for maintenance.
charged to current expenses may involve many substitutions of new for old parts which tend to keep down the
during the period, with -the exception of thiree classes, namely,
central office equipment, private branch exchanges and booths and

special fittings. In the case of central office equipment, there were
large installations of new equipment in 1929 which had the effect of
raising the per cent. condition for the entire class from 92 per cent.
for prior years to 93 per .cent. for 1929 and subsequent years. In
the case of private branch exchanges, the percentage condition improved gradually from 88 per cent. in 1923 to 94 per cent. in 19310
due to the large proportion of new installations and correspondingly
large retirements of the old. In the case of booths and special fittings, the percentage co. dition gradually improved from 78 per cent.
in 1923 to 85 per cent. at the end of the period, in this case also
because of abnormaly large changes of booths at pay stations.
These are the changes which in.
the main account for the fact that
the overall condition of tle plant rose from 91 per cent. for the
years 1923-1928 to 92 per cent. thereafter."

annual allowances for depreciation charged to operating
expenses.
In answer to appellants' criticism, the Company suggests that an adjustment might be made by giving credit
in favor of the telephone users "in an amount equal to
3 per cent. upon the difference between the depreciation
reserve and the amount deducted from the valuation for
existing depreciation." The suggestion is beside the point.
The point is as to the necessity for the annual charges for
depreciation, as made or claimed by the Company, in
order to avoid confiscation through the rates in suit. *On
that point the Company has the burden of proof. We
find that this burden has not been sustained. Nor is the
result changed by figuring the allowances at the somewhat reduced amounts fixed by the court below.28
We find this point to be a critical one. The questionable amounts annually charged to operating expenses for
depreciation are large enough to destroy any basis for
holding that it has been convincingly shown that the
reduction in income through the rates in suit would
produce confiscation.
The case has long been pending and should be brought
to an end. The Company has had abundant opportunity
to establish its contentions. In seeking to do so, the
Company has submitted elaborate estimates and computations, but these have overshot the mark. Proving
too much, they fail of the intended effect. It is not the
function of the court to attempt to construct out of this
voluminous record independent calculations to invalidate
the challenged rates. It is enough that the rates have
been established by competent authority and that their
invalidity has not been satisfactorily proved.

the company faithfully followed the prescribed system.
The state commission continuously watched over the
'The following is § 23, Uniform System of Accounts for Telephone
Companies, promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission,
effective January 1, 1913. It will serve to disclose the underlying
principle on which the reserve charges are made.
"Depreciation of Plant and Equipment.-Telephone companies
should include in operating expenses depreciation charges for the
purpose of creating proper and adequate reserves to cover the
expenses of depreciation currently accruing in the tangible fixed
capital. By expense of depreciation is meant(a) The losses suffered through the current lessening in value of
tangible property from wear and tear (not covered by current
repairs).
(b) Obsolescence or inadequacy, resulting from age, physical
change, or supersession by reason of new inventions and discoveries,
changes in popular demand, or public requirements, and
(c) Losses suffered through destruction of -property by extraordinary casualties.
The amount charged as expense of depreciation should be based
upon rules determined by the accounting company. Such rules
may be derived from a consideration of the company's history and
experience. Companies should be prepared to furnish the Commission, upon demand, the rules and a sworn statement of the facts,
expert opinions, and estimates upon which they are based.

The cost of the property includes from $2,000,000 to
$3,000,000 paid for land which is not depreciable, and
$13,000,000 to $18,000,000 paid for buildings having a
long service life. There are other important and relatively permanent plant elements. These facts suggest
that the percentages shown in the table are considerably
lower than the actual relation of reserve balances to cost
of depreciable parts of the property. While much of the
plant is new, the reserve was piled up at about the rate
that the cost of plant increased. The balances held in
respect of all property, interstate and intrastate, increased from about $4,000,000 in 1911 to about $26,000,later years of the life in service of such property, and when made
may, therefore, be classed as extraordinary repairs.
The rate of depreciation should be fixed so as to distribute, as
nearly as may be, evenly throughout the life of the depreciating
property the burden of repairs and the cost of capital consumed in
operations during a given month or year, and should be based upon
the average life of the units comprised in the respective classes of
property. ..

property alone show an average annual increase of more
than $2,300,000. That amount is greatly in excess of
the reduction of revenue that would have resulted if the
rate order had been enforced.
The table below shows by years in column (1) the
amounts actually expended for current maintenance, in
column (2) the amounts charged to depreciation reserve,
in column (3) the total of both.

included in current maintenance and those taken from the
depreciation reserve. The table next below is illustrative and is intended to show by years in column (1) that

The purpose of this table is to compare the percentage
in each year with the percentage in each of the other
years. It is to be observed that 'the lowest is 20.1%
(1924) and the highest 30.5% (1930). This comparison

LINDHEIMER .. ILLINOIS TEL. CO.

serves to test the claim that the depreciation reserve is
needed in order to equalize annual cost of upkeep in relation to revenue. If the period covered is typical, the last
statement strongly suggests that no reserve account is
necessary for that purpose. And that impression is confirmed by a similar comparison of the percentages in
Table IV. It shows the relation of current maintenance
plus depreciation reserve charges to revenue. Comparing
the percentage in each year (during the period covered
by Table V) with the percentage in each of the other
years, the lowest is 31.5% (1924), the highest is 39.5
(1931).
From the foregoing it justly may be inferred that
charges made according to the principle followed by the
company create reserves much in excess of what is needed
for maintenance. The balances carried by the company
include large amounts that never can be used for the
purposes for which the reserve was created. In the long
run the amounts thus unnecessarily taken from revenue
will reach about one-half the total cost of all depreciable
parts of the plant. The only legitimate purpose of the
reserve is to equalize expenditures for maintenance so as
to take from the revenue earned in each year its fair
share of the burden. To the extent that the annual
charges include amounts that will not be required for that
purpose, the account misrepresents the cost of the service.
The company's properties constitute a complex and
highly developed instrumentality containing many classes
of items that require renewal from' time to time. But,
taken as a whole, the plant must be deemed to be permanent'. It never was intended to be new in all its parts. It
would be impossible to make it so. Expenditures in an
attempt to accomplish that would be wasteful. Amounts
sufficient to create a reserve balance that is the same percentage of total cost of depreciable items as their age is
of their total service life cannot be accepted as legitimate

additions to operating expenses. In the absence of proof
definitely establishing what annual deductions from revenues were necessary for adequate maintenance of the
property, the company is not entitled to have the rate

Nos. 727 and 728. Argued April 3, 1934.-Decided April 30, 1934.
1. Where accounts and income tax returns are on the accrual basis,
a debt owing the taxpayer for goods sold in the tax year is returnable as gross income of that year even though ascertained in that
year to be partly worthless. Art. 35 of Regs. 45, under Revenue
Act of 1918, construed. P. 184.
2. Section 234 (a) (5) of the Revenue Act of 1918 authorized the
deduction of a debt ascertained to be worthless and charged off
within the taxable year; it did not authorize the deduction of the
whole or a part of a debt ivhich was not then ascertained to be
worthless but was recoverable in part, the amount that was
recoverable being still uncertain. P. 185.
3. Section 234 (a)(4) of the Revenue Act of 1918, providing for
deduction of "losses sustained during the taxable year," and subdivision (5) of the same section providing for deduction of debts
ascertained to be worthless within the taxable year, are mutually
exclusive; and a debt excluded from deduction under (5) can not
be deducted as a loss under (4). P. 189.
