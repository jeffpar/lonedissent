LOCAL LOAN CO. v. HUNT.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 783.

Argued April 4, 5, 1934.-Decided April 30, 1934.

1. A court of bankruptcy has jurisdiction by ancillary proceedings
to enforce an order of discharge by enjoining the prosecution of
suits brought against the debtor. P. 239.
2. Such a proceeding being ancillary and dependent, the jurisdiction
of the court follows that of the original cause, and may be maintained without regard to the citizenship of the parties or the
amount involved, and nothwithstanding the provisions of § 265 of
the Judicial Code; R.S., § 720; 28 U.S.C., § 379. P. 239.
3. Where the legal remedy of setting up a discharge as a defense in
an action involving the rights of the bankrupt under it, would
entail not only his intervention in a state court of first instiance,
but also, because of previous decisions of .the State Supreme Court,
a succession of appeals, causing dispimportionate trouble, embarrassment, expense and possible loss to the bankrupt, held that the
remedy was inadequate, and that the equitable jurisdiction of the
court of bankruptcy by way of an ancillary suit for injunction was
properly engaged. P. 241.
4. An assignment of future-earned wages to secure a loan, held not
a lien within the meaning of § 67 (d) of the Bankruptcy Act.
P. 242.
5. That such an assignment, even if a lien under the state law,
should survive the discharge of the debt in bankruptcy, would be
contrary to the policy of the Bankruptcy Act to free the debtor;
and so it must be held, where the suit is ancillary in the bankruptcy court to enforce the discharge, though the decisions of the
state court be to the contrary. P. 244.
67 F. (2d) 998, affirmed.

Argument for Petitioner.

CERTIORARI, 291 U.S. 657, to review the affirmance of a
decree by a court of bankruptcy enjoining prosecution of
a suit in a state court.

Mr. Frederic Burnham, with whom Messrs. David F.
Rosenthal, Orville W. Lee, and Richard Mayer were on
the brief, for petitioner.
It is not within the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court,
after granting a discharge in bankruptcy, to adjudicate
the effect of such discharge upon a claim or demand made
against the bankrupt by a person not a party to the bankruptcy proceedings. In re Marshall Paper Co., 102 Fed.
872; Hellman v. Goldstone, 161 Fed. 913; In re Havens,
272 Fed. 975; In re DeLauro, 1 F.Supp. 678; In re Madden, 257 Fed. 581; In re Weisberg, 253 Fed. 833; In re
Lockwood, 240 Fed. 161; In re Levitan, 224 Fed. 241; In
re McCarty, 111 Fed. 151; In re Rosenthal, 108 Fed. 368;
In re Mussey, 99 Fed. 71; In re Black, 97 Fed. 493. Contra: Sims v. Jamison, 67 F. (2d) 409.
A bankruptcy court has no right to oust, by.permanent
injunction, the prior possession by a court b6general jurisdiction of a suit brought against a bankrupt after discharge upon an obligation from which the bankrupt
claims to have been freed by his discharge. Jud. Code,
§ 265; Peck v. Jeness, 7 How. 612; Metcalf v. Barker,
187 U.S. 165; Hull v. Burr, 234 U.S. 712; Phelps v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Assn., 112 Fed. 453, aff'd, 190
U.-. 147.
The injunction in this case does not come within the
scope of the express exception to Jud. Code, § 265, by
reason of being authorized by any provision of the Bankruptcy Act. §§ 2 (15), 11 (a); Hull v. Burr, 234 U.S.
712.
By the above section courts of bankruptcy are not invested with general equitable jurisdiction, but only such
bquitable powers as are necessary to carry out their stat-

utory jurisdiction in bankruptcy matters. Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, 178 U.S. 524; In re Judith Gap Commercial
Co., 5 F. (2d) 307.
Bankruptcy courts haye no jurisdiction to adjudicate
the rights of one who claims, adversely to the bankrupt,
property not in the court's possession, even though it is
part of the bankrupt's estate. Such an adverse claim
must be litigated in a plenary proceeding in a court of
general jurisdiction. Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, 178 U.S.
524; Louisville Trust Co. v. ComingQr, 184 U.S. 18; Harris
v. FirstNat. Bank, 216 U.S. 382; Galbraithv. Valley, 256
U.S. 46; Harrison,v. Chamberlin,271 U.S. 191.
An assignee claiming wages earned subsequent to adjudication is an adverse claimant within the foregoing
rule. ProgressiveBldg. & Loan Co. v. Hall, 220 Fed. 45;
Copeland v. Martin, 182 Fed. 805.
The wages in this case were earned after adjudication
and therefore were not even part of Hunt's estate in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy courts have no power to entertain
or enjoin litigation between a bankrupt and a third party
with respect to property not a part of the bankrupt's
estate. Duffy v. Tegeler, 19 F. (2d) 305; Roden Grocery
Co. v. Bacon, 133 Fed. 51 ; In re Amy, 263 Fed. 8; In re
Rashbaum, 4 F.Supp. 724.
A stay under § 11 (a) can not delay the prosecution of
a suit longer than the determination of the application
for a discharge. In re ftme, 296 Fed. 98; In re Federal
Biscuit Co., 214 Fed. 221. The protection extended to
bankrupts under that section expires with the granting
or refusal of a discharge. In re DeLauro, 1 F.Supp. 678;
In re Lockwood, 240 Fed. 161.
Since no power in the District Court to issue the injunction in this case is expressed in or can be implied from
any provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, the injunction must
be one which comes directly within the prohibitive language of § 265 of the Judicial Code. Such conclusion is

LOCAL LOAN CO. v. HUNT.
234

Argument for Petitioner.

the only one compatible with the fundamental principles
of comity upon which § 265 is based. Phelps v. Mutual
Reserve Fund Life Assn., 112 Fed. 453, aff'd, 190 U.S.- 147.
A bankruptcy court may not disregard the decisions of
the highest court of a State in determining whether in
that State an assignment of future wages creates such a
lien as is preserved from discharge in bankruptcy by
§ 67 (d) of the Bankruptcy Act. Peck v. Jeness, 7 How.
612; Dooley v. Pease, 180 U.S.. 126; Thompson v. Fairbanks, 196 U.S. 516; Humphrey v. Tatum, 198 U.S. 91;
Hiscock v. Varick Bank, 206 U.S. 28; Benedict v. Ratner,
268 U.S. 353; In re Robert Jenkins C~rp., 17 F. (2d) 555;
In re Simpson, 35 F. (2d) 840; Sims v. Jamison, 67 F.
(2d) 409.
In view'of the cases cited above, it can not be supposed
that this Court has ever considered that the doctrine of
Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, applies in a bankruptcy case
where the nature and extent of a lien are in question.
The Supreme Court of Illinois holds that in Illinois an
assignment of future wages creates such a lien as gives
the assignee a vestedproperty right from the date of the
assignment, and that such a lien is within the terms of
§ 67 (d) of the Bankruptcy Act, and is therefore not invalidated by the assignor's discharge in bankruptcy.
Mallin v. Wenham, 209 Ill. 252; Monarch Discount Co. v.
C. & 0. Ry. Co., 285 Ill. 233.
The most representative statement of the supposed impossibility of a lien upon unearned wages is found in
SeaboardSmall Loan Corp. v. Ottinger, 50 F. (2d) 856.
The notion that there can be no lien upon something
which does not exist is demonstrably fallacious. Even at
common law a lien upon live stock attached to the increase thereof. In many States mortgages of after-acquired chattels are. perfectly valid. In some States mortgages of unplanted crops are valid. Butt v. Ellett, 19
Wall. 544; Sims v. Jamison, 67 F. (2d) 409.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

292 U.S..

Unearned wages in an existing employment are not distinguishable in nature from other types of property having no actual existence, but having a potential existence
sufficient to enable them to be ear-marked and subjected
to rights of ownership which will attach to them as soon
as they come into existence.
Mr. Lloyd A. Faxon for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
On September 17, .1930, respondent borrowed from petitioner the sum of $300, and as security for its payment
executed an assignment of: a portion of his wages thereafter to be earned. On March 3, 1931, respondent filed
a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in a federal district
court in Illinois, including in his schedule of liabilities the
foregoing loan, which constituted a provable claim against
the estate. Respondent was adjudicated a bankrupt; and,
on October 10, 1932, an order was entered discharging
him from all provable debts and claims. On October 18,
1932, petitioner brought an action in the municipal court
of Chicago against respondent's employer to enforce the
assignrMient in respect of wages earned after, the adjudication. Thereupon, respondent commenced this proceeding
in the court which had adjudicated his bankruptcy and
ordered his discharge, praying that petitioner be enjoined
from further prosecuting said action or attempting to enforce its claim therein made against respondent under
the wage assignment. The bankruptcy court, upon consideration, entered a decree in accordance with the prayer.;
and this decree on appeal was affirmed by the court below,
67 F. (2) 998, following its decision in In re Skorcz, 67
F. (2d) 187.
Challenging this decree, petitioner contends: That the
bankruptcy court was without jurisdiction to entertain

LOCAL LOAN CO. v. HUNT.
234

Opinion of the Court.

a proceeding to enjoin the prosecution of the action in
the municipal court; that, assuming such jurisdiction,
the rule is that an assignment of future wages constitutes
an enforceable lien; but that, in any event, the highest
court of the State of Illinois has so decided, and by that
decision this court is bound.
First. The pleading by which respondent invoked the
jurisdiction of th6 bankruptcy court in the present case
is in substance and effect a supplemental and antillary
bill in equity, in aid of and to effectuate the adjudication
and order made by the same court. That a federal court
of equity has jurisdiction of a bill ancillary tb an priginal
case or proceeding in the same court, whether at law or
in equity, to secure or preserve the fruits and advantages
of a judgment or decree rendered therein, is well settled.
Root v. Woolworth, 150 U.S. 401, 410-412; Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U.S. 93, 112-114; Riverdale Mills v.
Manufacturing Co., 198 U.S. 188, 194 et seq.; Freemanv.
Howe, 24 How. 450, 460. And this, irrespective of
whether the court would have jurisdiction if the proceeding were an original one. The proceeding being ancillary
and dependent, the jurisdiction of the court follows that
of the original cause, and may be maintained without regard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount involved, and notwithstanding the provisions of § 265 of
the Judicial Code (R.S., § 720), U.S.C., Title 28, § 379.'

The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the

cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating
to proceedings in bankruptcy."

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

292 U.S.

These principles apply to proceedings in bankruptcy.
In re Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co., 180 Fed. 549, 554;
Sims v. Jamison, 67 F. (2d) 409, 410; Pell v. M'Cabe, 256
Fed. 512, 515-516; Seaboard Small Loan Corp.v. Ottinger,
50 F. (2d) 856, 859. Petitioner relies upon a number of
decisions where other federal courts sitting in bankruptcy
have declined to entertain suits similar in character to the
present one, on the ground that the effect of a discharge
in bankruptcy is a matter to be determined by any court
in which the discharge may be pleaded. See, for example, Hellman v. Goldstone, 161 Fed. 913; In re Marshall Paper Co., 102 Fed. 872, 874; In re Weisberg,
253 Fed. 833, 835; In re Havens, 272 Fed. 975. To
the extent that these cases conflict with the view just
expressed they are clearly not in harmony with the
general rule in equity announced by this court. And we
find nothing, either in the nature of the bankruptcy court
or-in the terms of the bankruptcy act, which necessitates
the application of what would amount to a special rule on
this subject in respect of bankruptcy proceedings. Courts
of bankruptcy are constituted by §§ 1 and 2 of the bankruptcy act (U.S.(., Title 11, §§ 1 and 11), and are invested
"with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable
them to exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings," etc. The words "at law" were probably in,serted to meet clause (4) of § 2, which empowers
such
courts to arraign, try and punish certain designated persons for violations of the act. Bardes v. Hawarden Bank,
178 U.S. 524, 534-536. But otherwise courts of bankruptcy are essentially courts of equity, and their proceedings inherently proceedings in equity. Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, supra, 535; In re Rochford, 124 Fed. 182, 187;
In re Siegel-Hillman Dry Goods Co., Ill Fed. 980, 983;
Swartsv. Siegel, 117 Fed. 13, 16; Dodge v. Norlin, 133 Fed.
363, 368-369; In re Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co., supra,

LOCAL LOAN CO. v. HUNT.
234

Opinion of the Court.

Long, 42 F. (2d) 45, 47. And, generally, proceedings in
bankruptcy are in the nature of proceedings in rem, adjudications of bankruptcy and orders of discharge being, as
this court clearly has treated them, in every essential particular decrees in equity determining a status. Hanover
National Bank v. Moyses, 186 U.S. 181, 192; Commercial
Bank of Manchester v. Buckner, 20 How. 108, 118, 119.
Whai has now been said establishes the authority
of the
bankruptcy court to entertain, the present proceeding,
determine the effect of the adjudication and order, and
enjoin petitioner from its threatened interference therewith. It does not follow; however, that the court was
bound to exercise its authority. And it probably would
not and should not have done so except under unusual
circumstances such as here exist. So far as appears, the
municipal court was competent to deal with the case. It
is true that respondent was not a party to that litigation;
but undoubtedly it was open to him to intervene and submit to that court the question as to the effect upon the
subject matter of the action of the bankruptcy decrees.
And it may be conceded that the municipal court was
authorized in the law action to afford relief the equivalent
of that which respondent now seeks in equity. Nevertheless, other considerations aside, it is clear that the legal
remedy thus afforded would be inadequate to meet the
-requirements of justice. As will be shown in a moment,
the sole question at issue is one which the highest court
of the State of Illinois had already resolved against respondent's contention. The alternative of invoking the
equitable jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court was for
respondent to pursue an obviously long and expensive
course of litigation, beginning with an intervention in a
municipal court and followed by successive appeals
through the state intermediate and ultimate courts of
appeal, before reaching a court whose judgment upon the
merits of the question had not been predetermined. The

amount in suit is small, and, as pointed out by Judge
Parker in Seaboard Small Loan Corp. v. Ottinger, supra,
at p. 859, such a remedy is entirely inadequate because of
the wholly disproportionate trouble, embarrassment,
expense, and possible loss of employment which it
involves.
Second. Whether an assignment of future earned wages
constitutes a lien within the meaning of § 67 (d) of the
bankruptcy act,' is a matter upon which the decisions of
the state and federal courts are not in complete accord;
although by far the larger number of cases and the greater
weight of authority-are in the negative. We do not stop
to review the state decisions. Among those which deny
the existence of the lien are Leitch v. Northern Pacific Ry.
Co., 95 Minn. 35; 38; 103 N.W. 704; Levi v. Loevenhart &
Co., 138 Ky. 133, 136; 127 S.W. 748; Public Finance Co.
v. Rowe, 123 Ohio St. 206; 174 N.E. 738; Hupp v. Union
Pac. R. Co., 99 Neb. 654; 157 N.W. 343. The only state
cases definitely to the contrary which have been called to
oii attention are certain Illinois cases, mentioned later,
and Citizen8 Loan Assn. v. Boston & Maine R. Co., 196
Mass. 528; 82 N.E. 696. The lower federal courts which
have had occasion to consider the question concur in the
view that the lien has no existence or is ineffective as
against an adjudication and discharge in bankruptcy.
Judge Bellinger, in In re West, 128 Fed. 205, succinctly
stated the ground of his ruling in accordance with that
view as follows:
"The discharge in bankruptcy operated to discharge
these obligations as of the date of the adjudication, so that
the obligations were discharged before the wages intended
'" Liens given or accepted in good faith and not in -contemplation
of or in fraud upon this Act, and for a present consideration, which

have been recorded according to law, if record'ihereof was necessary
in order to impart notice, shall, to the extent of such present consideration only, not be affected by this' Act." U.S.C. Title 11, § 107 (d).

LOCAL LOAN CO. v. HUNT.
234

Opinion of the Court.

as security were in existence. The law does not continue
an obligation in order that there may be a lien, but only
does so because there is one. The effect of the discharge
upon the prospective liens was the same as though the
debts had been paid before the assigned wages were earned.
The wages earned after the adjudication became the property of the bankrupt clear of the claims of all creditors."
This conclusion finds ample support in the following
decisions among others. In re Home Discount Co., 147
Fed. 538, 547 et seq.; In re Lineberry, 183 Fed. 338; In re
Voorhees 41 F. (2d) 81; In re Fellows, 43 F. (2d) 122; In
re Potts, 54 F. (2d) 144; and especially Seaboard Small
Loan Corp. v. Ottinger,supra.
The earning power of an individual is the power to create property; but it is not translated into property within
the meaning of the bankruptcy act until it has brought
earnings into existence. An adjudication of bankruptcy,
followed by a discharge, releases a. debtor from all previously incurred debts, with certain exceptions not pertinent here; and it logically cannot be supposed that the
act nevertheless intended to keep such debts alive for the
purpose of permitting the creation of an enforceable lien
upon a subject not existent when the bankruptcy became
effective or even arising from, or connected with, pre6xisting property, but brought into being solely as the
fruit of the subsequent labor of the bankrupt.
Third. To the foregoing array of authority petitioner
opposes the decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois in
Mallin v. Wenham, 209 Ill. 252; 70. N.E. 564, and Monarch Discount Co. v. C. & 0. Ry. Co., 285 Ill. 233; 120
N.E. 743. Undoubtedly, these cases hold, as petitioner
asserts, that in Illinois an assignment of future wages
creates a lien effective from the date of the assignment
which is not invalidated by the assignor's discharge in
bankruptcy.. The contention is that even if the general
rule be otherwise, this court is bound to follow the Illinois

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

292 U.S.

decisions, since the question of the existence of a lien
depends upon Illinois law.
We find it unnecessary to consider whether this contention would in a different case find support in § 34 of the
Judiciary Act of 1789, now § 725, Title 28, U.S.C.," since
we are of opinion that it is precluded here by the clear
and unmistakable policy of the bankruptcy act. It is important to bear in mind that the present case is one not
within the jurisdiction of a state court, but is a dependent
suit brought to vindicate decrees of a federal court of
bankruptcy entered in the exercise of a jurisdiction essentially federal and exclusive in character. And it is that
situation to which we address ourselves, and to which our
decision is confined.
One of the primary purposes of the bankruptcy act is
to "relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness and permit him to start afresh free from
the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes." Williams v. U.S. Fidelity & G. Co.,
236 U.S. 549, 554-555. This purpose of the act has been
again and again emphasized by the courts as being of
public as well as private interest, in that it gives to the
honest but unfortunate debtor who surrenders for distribution the property which he owns at the time of bankruptcy, .anew opportunity in life and a clear field for
future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt. Stellwagen v. Clum, 245 U.S.
605, 617; Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, supra;
Swarts v. Fourth National Bank, 117 Fed. 1, 3; United
States v. Hammond, 104 Fed. 862, 863; Barton Bros. v.
Texas Produce Co., 136 Fed. 355, 357; Hardie v. Swafford Bros. Dry Goods Co., 165 Fed. 588, 591; Gilbert v.
" The laws of the several States, except where the Constitution,
treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide,
shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the
courts of the United States, in cases where they apply."

LOCAL LOAN CO. v. HUNT.
234.

Opinion of the Court.

Shouse, 61 F. (2d) 398. The various provisions of the
bankruptcy act were adopted in the light of that view
and are to be construed when reasonably possible in harmony with it so as to effectuate the general purpose and
policy of the act. Local rules subversive of that result
cannot be accepted as controlling the action of a federal
court.
When a person assigns future wages, he, in effect,
pledges his future earning power. The power of the individual to earn a living for himself and those dependent
upon him is in the nature of a personal liberty quite as
much as, if not more than, it is a property right. To preserve its free exercise is of the utmost importance, not
only because it is a fundamental private necessity, but
because it is a matter of great public concern. From the
viewpoint of the wage earner there is little difference between not earning at all and earning wholly for a creditor.
Pauperism may be the necessary result of either. The
amount of the indebtedness, or the proportion of wages
assigned, may here be small, but the principle, once established, will equally apply where both are very great. The
new opportunity in life and the clear field for future
effort, which it is the purpose of the bankruptcy. act to
afford the emancipated debtor, would be of little value to
the wage earner if he were obliged to face the necessity of
devoting the whole or a considerable portion of his earnings for an indefinite time in the future to the payment
of indebtedness incurred prior to his bankruptcy. Confining our determination to the case in hand, and leaving
prospective liens upon other forms of acquisitions to be
dealt with as they may arise, we reject the Illinois decisions as to the effect of an assignment of wages irned
after bankruptcy as being destructive of the purpose and
spirit of the bankruptcy act.
Decree affirmed.
