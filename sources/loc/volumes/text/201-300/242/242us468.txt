the defendant in error, in pursuance of an Iowa statute
approved April 19, 1913. 35 G. A., c. 187, ยง 1. Supplement to Code 1913, c. 19-B, ยง 2600-p. This act among
other things directed the operation to be performed upon
convicts in the penitentiary who had been twice convicted
of felony, and on February .14, 1914, the Board had
ordered it, upon the ground that the plaintiff had been
twice so convicted. The bill was filed on March 11, 1914.
On April 15, 1914, following an opinion of the Attorney
General that both felonies must have been committed
after the passage of the act, the order was laid on the
table, and the warden and physician made affidavits, filed
on April 22, that the operation would not be performed by
them. Nevertheless, three judges, disregarding the foreSupplement to Iowa Code, 1915, p. 238). In view of this fact permission
is given the State through its Attorney General on or before January 1,
1917, by printed brief to point out the reasons, if any, which exist why
the appeal in this case should not be dismissed."

Act of 1913 was repealed, and the substituted act does not
apply to the plaintiff. Supplemental Supplement to the
Code of Iowa, 1915, c. 19-B, ยง 2600-sl. All possibility or
threat of the operation has disappeared now, if not before,
by the act of the State. Therefore upon the precedents we
are not called upon to consider the propriety of the action
of the District Court, but the proper course is to reverse
the decree and remand the cause with directions that the
bill be dismissed without costs to either party. United
