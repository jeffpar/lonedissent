HILL, A MINOR, ET AL. v. REYNOLDS, A MINOR.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.

No. 01., Argued November 2, 1916.-Decided January 8, 1917.
A decision of the Secretary of the Interior adjudicating a contest over
certain Choctaw and Chickasaw lands, and awarding a patent, under
the agreement in the Act of June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat. 505, and
the supplemental agreement in the Act of July 1, 1902, c. 1362, 32
Stat. 641, held, free from misconstruction or misapplication of law.
The provisions of §§ 17 and 18 of the Act of June 28, 1898, supra,
inhibiting enclosures and holdings of lands in excess of allottable
quantities, were left in force as to the Choctaws- and Chickasaws
by the agreement in the 29th section which became effective through
tribal.ratification on August 24, 1898.
Choctaw and Chickasaw lands held by a widow and her minor children
in excess of allottable quantities, and bearing certain meager and
non-severable improvements, were surrendered by her in January,
1899, for an adequate consideration, to one who took possession,
made valuable and lasting improvements and, in December, 1902,
sold, maintaining possession meanwhile.
Held, (1) That in virtue of these transactions, and by force of §§ 17
and 18 of the Act of June 28, 1898, supra,the interests of the clildren
were so devested that an applicant for allotment relying for priority
on quitclaims of their rights in the land and improvements, executed
in November and December, 1902, could not prevail over a prior
applicant who had succeeded to the rights of the widow's surrenderee
under his sale.
(2) That the failure of the children's guardiAn to join in the surrender
was immaterial.
Sections 19 to 21 of the Act of July 1, 1902, supra, allowing until
September 25, 1902, within which to reduce excessive enclosures and'
-holdings, were not intended to permit of the revival and reassertion
of long-dormant claims to the prejudice of persons entitl4 to allotments who had entered into possession and made valuable improvements.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Alger Melton and Mr. Joseph W. Bailey, with whom
Mr. Reford Bond and Mr. C. B. Stuart were on the brief,
for plaintiffs in error.
Mr. F. E. Riddle, with whom Mr. Harry Hammerly
was on the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This is a controversy arising out of conflicting applications for the allotment of four hundred and twenty acres
of Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. The lands were subject
to allotment and all the. applicants possessed the requisite
qualificatgons, so. it was merely a question as to who had
the better right to select the particular lands. The applicants were minors and are designated in the record as
the Reynolds children and the Hill children. The former
were the first to apply and the latter instituted a contest
which ultimately reached the Secretary of the Interior.
That officer sustained the claims of the Reynolds children
and patents were issued to them. The Hill children then
brought this suit to charge the others as trustees and to
compel, a conveyance. In the trial court the plaintiffs
prevailed, but in the Supreme Court there was a judgment
for the defendants. 43 Oklahoma, 749.
The chief contention of the plaintiffs is that the Secretary of the Interior misconstrued the law applicable to the
facts conceded and proved and that this resulted in the
issue of patents to one set of claimants when the other
set was entitled to them. Under a familiar rule, if this
were true, the plaintiffs would be entitled to the relief
sought. Ross v. Stewart, 227 U. S. 530, 535. But was
there any material misconstruction of the law by the
Secretary? We say material misconstruction, because, 'if

his decision was otherwise right, its force was not lessened
by anything he may have said concerning what was not
material at the time.
The lands of the two tribes were being allotted in
severalty among their members under the agreement set
forth in § 29 of the Act of June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat.
505, and the supplemental agreement embodied in the
Act of July 1, 1902, c. 1362, 32 Stat. 641. These agreements defined what should be a standard allotment, entitled each member to such an allotment to be selected
by or for him, and permitted the selection to be so made
as to include his improvements, if any, but without exceeding 'a standard allotment. When the conflicting applications therefor were made the lands in controversy
were not wild or vacant but improved and occupied, and
the issues in the contest all centered about the ownership
of the improvements. Both sides claimed to own them
and to have in consequence a preferred right of selection.
The facts found by the Secretary of the Interior-and
his findings were not without evidence to sustain themare as follows: These lands were part of a much larger
body, containing twelve or fifteen thousand acres, which
had been enclosed and occupied by one Campbell in his
lifetime. He was a white man who had married into the
Chickasaw tribe. Of the lands so enclosed he reduced
twelve or fifteen hundred acres -to cultivation and used
the remainder for pasturing live stock. His dwelling and
the improvements connected therewith were upon part of
the enclosed lands but not upon those in controversy. He
died in 1896 leaving a widow, two married daughters and
five minor sons. A guardian for the minors was appointed
but permitted matters to drift without any particular
control by him. The widow and minor sons continued
to occupy the home place, and she, with the guardian's
assent, looked after the cultivation and renting of the
tillable fields and made some use of the pasture-land. In

January, 1899, for a consideration not challenged, she
surrendered six hundred and forty acres of the enclosed
land, with the improvements thereon, to one Blassingame.
This tract embraced the lands in controversy. At that
time the improvements on the latter consisted of a surrounding four-wire fence and two or three fields reduced
to cultivation-the tillable ground being regarded as an
improvement. Blassingame took possession of all the
lands now in dispute, ditched a large part of them, brought
practically all under cultivation and erected substantial
buildings thereon, the estimated cost of this work being
$2,500. He remained in possession until December, 1902,
and then sold to one' Brimmage.. Two or three months
later Brimmage sold to one Reynolds, who went into possession of all but about eighty acres, presently to be noticed, and afterwards made application for the allotment
of the lands to his minor children, the contestees.
At no time during Blassingame's occupancy was there
any serious effort by any of the Campbells or by the guardian to dispossess him. By a court decree he and his family
had been adjudged to be members of the Chickasaw tribe
and were accordingly entitled to share in the occupancy
and use of the tribal lands. By a later decree they lost
this status, but not until after the sale to Brimmage.
The status of the latter, as also that of Reynolds, was such
that either could hold whatever passed by Blassingame's
sale.
In November and December, 1902, Campbell's widow,
three of his sons who then had attained their majority,
and the guardian of two of his sons who were still minors,
sold and quit-claimed to one Hill all of their rights in the
lands -in controversy and the improvements thereon.
Afterwards Hill made application to have the lands allotted to his minor children, the contestants. His status
was such that he could hold whatever he received from
the Campbells.

HILL v. REYNOLDS.
242 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

No improvements were added by Hill, save a short and
unsubstantial fence, and when the contest was begun he
had not been in possession of any part of the lands, save
a tract of eighty acres or less. He had been in possession
of it less than a year, and had entered without leave and
in disregard of such rights as had arisen out of Blassingame's occupancy and improvement for nearly four
years. In this way Reynolds was prevented from taking
possession of this tract.
The members of the Campbell family all selected and
received other lands for their allotments, so none of those
in dispute were needed for that purpose.
Upon these facts the Secretary of the Interior concluded
that the contestees, the Reynolds children, had the better
claim to the improvements and therefore the better right
to select the lands for their allotments. In this we perceive neither any misconstruction nor any misapplication
of the law. We assume, of course, that upon Campbell's
death in 1896 his family succeeded to his rights in these
lands, that is, to his possessory claim and his improvements. But at best the improvements were meager, and
continued occupancy was essential to sustain the possessory claim. This was the situation when the Act of
June 28, 1898, supra, came into operation. It not only
made provision for the allotment in severalty of the tribal
lands, but directed the correction in the meantime of various practices respecting those lands that were deemed
particularly objectionable. One of these was the practice
of enclosing or holding possession of tribal lands greatly
in excess of what would be the approximate or allottable
share of the occupant and his family. By its 17th and
'18th sections the act provided that after the expiration of
nine months from its passage all such enclosures or holdings
should be deemed unlawful and that proceedings should
be taken to terminate them and to punish the offenders.
The agreement set forth in the 29th section became ef-

fective through tribal ratification on August 24, 1898,
(238 U. S. 308) and superseded many provisions of the
act, so far as the Choctaws and Chickasaws were concerned, but it left the 17th and 18th sections in force as to
them and made new and more elaborate provision for
allotting their lands in severalty. The enclosure or holding of the Campbell family, embracing as it did twelve of
fifteen thousand acres, came within the letter and spirit of
the 17th and 18th sections; for, as was pointed out by the
Secretary of the Interior, that acreage was several times
greater than the approximate or allottable share of all
the members of the family including the two married
daughters. Thus it was essential that a considerable portion of the holding be surrendered, and the time for doing
this was limited. The widow was the head of the family
and apparently its only active agent. The guardian was
inactive, and, besides, under the statute, 30 Stat. 507, the
widow was to have precedence over him in selecting the
lands to be allotted to the minor children. She therefore
was in a position to exercise a real voice in determining
which lands should be surrendered and which retained.
It was in these circumstances that she surrendered to
Blassingame the lands in controversy with the meager
improvements thereon. Presumably the consideration
was adequate, for no objection on that score was made.
He went into possession in evident good faith and there
was no real effort to disturb him. He made 'extensive,
lasting and valuable improvements, the ownership of
which plainly was in him. Upon no permissible theory
did the Campbells have any right to them, legal or equitable, for they were made after the Campbell occupancy
ended and at a time when its continuance would have
been unlawful. By comparison the original improvements
made by Campbell were inconsiderable, if not entirely
negligible, and were such that they could not well be
retained after the lands were surrendered. It follows

that Reynolds succeeded to the rights of Blassingame and
that Hill took nothing by his purchase from the Campbells, made after Blassingame had been in possession almost four years, because they were then without any
interest in the lands or the improvements.
But it is urged that §§ 19 to 21 of the supplemental
agreement set forth in the Act of July 1, 1902, supra, permitted excessive enclosures or holdings to be reduced or
corrected at any time within ninety days after its final
ratification, which was on September 25, 1902, when
Blassingame had been in undisturbed possession for considerably more than three years. Upon this point the
Secretary of the Interior was of opinion that the agreement of 1902 "was certainly not intended to permit Indian
citizens to revive and reassert claims long dormant, after
others had entered into possession of and highly improved
the lands." We concur in that view.
What we have said sufficiently covers the rulings of the
Secretary of the Interior upon the questions of law which
were material to the contest in hand. Criticism is made
of some observations in his opinion upon other questions,
but they need not be noticed here.
Judgment affirmed.
