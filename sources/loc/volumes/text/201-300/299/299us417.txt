2. The time within which application may be made to this Court
for review by certiorari does not commence to run until after
disposition of motion for a new trial seasonably filed and entertained. P. 421.

P. 421.
4. A judgment of the Court of Claims may not be sustained as to

the findings or otherwise, put upon a ground not alleged in a
petition so filed. P. 422.
5. A judgment of the Court of Claims may not be upheld as to

6. Under Acts of Congress authorizing suit in the Court of Claims,
to be commenced before a day prescribed, the Seminole Nation

amount was properly included in the judgment in this case. P. 431.
7. Jn the process of liquidating the affairs of the Seminole Nation,
Congress, by § 18 of the Indian Appropriation Act of May 25,
1918, authorized the Secretary of the Interior to make per capita
payments to enrolled Seminoles, or their lawful heirs, out of the
Seminole school fund; and the authority was not confined to the
particular fiscal year. P. 428.
8. The Indian Appropriation Acts for the years 1922-1930, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to continue Seminole schools.
with tribal funds, were passed by Congress with knowledge that
the fund in pursuance of its authority had been so depleted that

lessened requirements; and are to be construed as contemplating
the use of not merely the interest on the diminished, school fund
but of the principal also. P. 431.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court.

An Act of Congress approved May 20, 1924, 43 Stat.
133, authorized the above named court to adjudicate
claims of the Seminole Nation against the United States,
declared all forever barred unless suit be brought within
five years, directed adjudication of claims of the United
States against that nation and gave right of review in
this court. A Joint Resolution of May 19, 1926, 44 Stat.
568, permitted plaintiff to bring separate suits on one or
more causes of action. Joint Resolution of February 19,
1929, 45 Stat. 1229, extended time for commencing, suits
to June 30, 1930. February 24, 1930, plaintiff filed its
petition praying judgment in respect of causes of action
alleged to have arisen after July 1, 1898. Plaintiff obtained leave and, September 19, 1934, filed an amended
complaint containing allegations in respect of the claims
alluded to in the original petition and attempted to set
up other causes of action. But the period within which
defendant, permitted suit had long since expired. On
December 2, 1935, the court filed its special findings of
fact, conclusions of law and opinion and entered judgment in favor of plaintiff for $1,317,087.27
1. Plaintiff contends that the petition for the writ of,
certiorari came too late and that therefore this court is
without jurisdiction. The petition was filed under 28
U. S. C., § 288 (b). Section 350 limits the time to three
months after entry of judgment. Defendant filed timely
motion for new trial which was overruled March. 2, 1936.
May 13 it applied for leave to file a second mction for new
trial. The application stated that it was madQ pursuant
to 28.U. S. C., § 282,1 and that the motion was attached to
the application. The court granted leave and defendant,
May 18, filed its second motion for a new trial. The record
does not include the motion. After hearing argument the

Opinion of the Court.

299 U. S.

court, June 8, overruled the motion. Jiily 8, defendant
fileFpetition for certiorari.
Plaintiff assumes that defendant's second motion for a
new trial was made under § 282 and argues that the running of time allowed for filing petition for certiorari was
not postponed until the court disposed of that motion.
But it does not appear that the motion was in fact one authorized by § 282. Aside from mere recital in the application for leave, there is nothing to indicate that it was
not one made under Rule 91 of the Court of Claims.
That rule declares: "Whenever either party desires to
question the correctness or the sufficiency of the court's
conclusions on its findings of fact'or to amend the same,
the complaining party shall file a motion which shall be
known as a motion for a new trial. All grounds relied
upon for any or all of said objections shall be included in
ene motion. After the court has announced its decision
upon such motion no other motion for a new trial, except
that provided by United States Code, title 28, section 282,
shall be filed by the same party unless by leave of court.
'Motions for new trial, except as provided by section 175 of
the Judicial Code (U. S. Code, title 28, sec. 282), shall be
filed within 60 days from the time the judgment nf the
court is announced."
Section. 282 provides: "The Court of Claims, at any
time while any claim is pending before it, or on appeal
from it, or within two years next ifter the final disposition of such. claim, may, on motion, on behalf of the
United States, grant a new trial and stay the payment
of any.judgment therein, upon such evidence, cumulative
or otherwise, as shall .satisfy the court that any fraud,
wrong, or injustice in the premises has been done to the
•United 'States;

. . .

The rule expressly excepts motions under § 282 from
those for the filing of which leave of court must be obtained. Thb statute plainly implies that in accordance

Opinion of the Court.

with its terms defendant may as of right apply for a new
trial. The record does not contain anything to indicate
that it was one made upon evidence or ,otherwise in accordance with statute. Cf. In re District of Colimbia,
180 U. S. 250, 253. In the absence of definite showing
to that effect, it will not be held that the United States
applied for or that the court entertainedand granted an
application for leave so expressly shown to be unnecessary. On this record, it is reasonably to be inferred, and
we find, that the second motion was one filed in accordance with the rule under which application for leave was
necessary and not one authorized by the statute for the
filing of which permission of the court was not needed.
It is clear that the three months' period, § 350, did not
commence to run until the court disposed of that motion
and did not expire until long after the defendant had
filed its petition for this writ. It is well settled that the
time within which application may be made for review
in this court does not commence to run until after disposition of motion for a new trial seasonably filed and entertained., Brockett v. Brockett, 2 How. 238, 240. Texas

claims sued on before the expiration of the period
within which the United States consented to be sued. It
did not extend to any cause of action which was 'hot. Ileged in plaintiff's original petition. As the United Stales
may not be sued without its consent, causes of actioh
not alleged within the period allowed may not be enforced." Finn v. United States, 123 U. S. 227, 232. The

The judgment may not be sustained as to any item that
is not included in a cause of action set up in the original
petition or that was by the findings of the lower court or
otherwise put upon a ground not there alleged. Harrison

upheld as to any item that is not supported by definite
findings of fact extending to all essential issues and
which, unaided by statements in the court's conclusions
of law or its opinion, are clearly sufficient to entitle plaintiff to recover. United States v. Esnault-Pelterie, 299
U. S. 201, 205.
The original petition is in paragraphs designated by
roman numerals; the substance of each may be briefly
shown:
I. Reference is made to the Act conferring jurisdiction.
II. Plaintiff for many years was the owner of funds held
in trust by defendant; there existed various treaties and
agreements between plaintiff and defendant whereby the
trust funds were to be managed and invested by defendant and the interest thereon paid! over to the national
treasurer of plaintiff. III. From and aifter passage of the
act of June 28, 1898, 30 Stat. 495 (called the Curtis Act)
defendant impounded all funds of plaintiff, refused to
further pay them to plaintiff's national treasurer and proceeded to disburse them for various purposes. IV. The
only authority.given by that Act for the disbursement of
plaintiff's funds is § 19.2 After that Act, Congress passed
others giving authority for the expeiditure of plaintiff's
funds, but no subsequent act gave authority for the ex"'That no payment of any moneys on any account whatever shall
hereafter be made by the United States to any of the tribal governments or to any-officer thereof for disbursement, but payments of
all sums to members of-said tribes shall be made under direction of

U. S. v. SEMINOLE NATION.
417

Opinion of the Court.

penditure of the funds hereinafter mentioned. VI. From
"July 1st, 1.898, until the present time, defendant, in violation of its duty as trustee of the funds of plaintiff, in
violation, of the rights of plaintiff under its various trea-.
ties and agreements with defendant, and without authority of Congress, has spent large sums of the trust funds
of plaintiff." VII. At all times mentioned in the petition
R. S., § 2097; was in force.' VIII. "Defendant has thus
spent, in violation of law, a large amount of the trust
funds of plaintiff." The exact amount -will be shown by
the books and records of defendant.
. The prayer of the petition is that defendant
be required to fle in this cause a statement showing its
expenditures of plaintiff's funds "during said period,". the
purposes for which, and dates when, such expenditures
were made, and the authority of law, if any, which authorized defendant to make such expenditures; "that, if
necessary thereafter, plaintiff be permitted to amend this
petition" and that plaintiff have judgment against the
defendant in such sum or sums as shall appear to the
court to have been expended without authority of law,
with interest at six per cent.
This petition does not include any cause of action that,
accrued prior to July 1, 1898. Nor is recovery sought on
mere failure of defendant to pay plaintiff's funds to its
national treasurer or to the Seminoles per capita. The
gist of the petition is that defendant disbursed funds of
plaintiff for "various purposes" (par. III); and in violathe Secretary of the Interior by an officer appointed by him; arid
per capita payments shall be made direct to each individual in lawful money of the United States, and the same shall not be liable to
the payment of any previously contra.cted obligation." 30 Stat. 502.
"No funds belonging to any Indian tribe with which treaty relations exist shall be applied in any manner not authorized by such
treaty, or by express provisions of law; nor shall money appropriated to execute a treaty be transferred or applied to.any other purpose, unless expressly authorized by law." 25 U. S. C., § 122.

Opinion of the Court.

"tion of its duty as trustee and of plaintiff's rights under
"treaties and agreements" and "without authority of Congress, has spent large sums of the trust funds of plaintiff" (par. VI). The petition extends.to no amount not
"thus spent" (par. VIII). It prays statement by defendant only -as to "expenditures" of plaintiff's funds
"during said period," and seeks judgment only for such
sums as appear to the court to have been "expended."
While the amended petition came too late to bring in
any additional cause of action or to change grounds on
which plaintiff rested its suit, it will be taken into account
to the extent that it usefully gives plaintiff's statement of
details of causes of action alleged in the original petition
and for comparison with the court's special findings of
fact. It describes 13 claims; ten of these are in whole or
in part included in the judgmertt. The following statement shows: (1) Paragraphs of the amended petition;

tNot dealt with in the opinion. This amount apparently was not claimed
in proposed findings of fact, although claimed in amended petition, 1. .e., Included in claim for $66,247.37.

The lower court disallowed all of items 2, 6 and 10 and
parts of 5, 7 and 13. Plaintiff has not asked-review. Defendant's prayer for reversal does not extend to any part
of items 11, 12 or 13.
Items 1, 4 and 7 are by the amended petition indicated
to be outside the period alleged in the original petitionfrom July 1, 1898, to the time of the commencement of the
suit. The findings fail to Iow that any part of these
amounts is included in any dause of action alleged in the
original petition to have accrued in that period. All of
these items must be deducted from the judgment.
Item 3, $154,551.28, is a part of $304,551.28 first described in the amended petition. Of that amount $150,000
(item 2) was disallowed. The amount included in the
judgment rests on special finding VI which is to the effect
that commencing with the Act of July 26, 1866 (14 Stat.
263-264) up to and including the Act of April 30, 1908
(35 Stat. 91) Congress annually appropriated $25,000
being the interest at 5% on the $500,000 fund provided in
the eighth article of the Treaty of 1856 for the,. Durpose of
making per capita payments, and that the United States
disbursed the sums thus appropriated for the years involved, either by direct payment per capita to members

of the tribe, or by cash payment to the treasurer of the
Seminole Nation, except interest in years between 1867
and 1879 inclusive, the total of which is $92,051.28, and
interest in the years 1907 to 1909 inclusive, amounting
to $62.500; and that these items of interest were neither

disbursed to members of the tribe nor paid to the treasurer.
But defendant's retention or other disposition of the
amounts of interest in years between 1867 and 1879 is not
shown by the findings to have been within the period
covered by the original petition. For that reason $92,051.28 must be deducted. And for another reason all of
item 3 must be eliminated from the judgment. The finding merely shows that defendant did not pay or disburse
the amount included in that item to the national treasurer
or to members of the tribe. That is not enough. The suit
is not to recover money withheld but only for that illegally
disbursed or spent by defendant.
Item 5-$90,597.20--as described in the amended petition is interest on the permanent school fund provided
for in the third article of the Treaty of 1866. The judgment includes $3,097.20 of that item on account .of interest
for the years 1867-1874. But it is not shown that any
cause of action accrued in respect of that sum after July 1,
1898. The item also includes $750, a part of the interest
for 1907 found not to have been paid by defendant to the
tribal treasurer. But, as shown above, mere failure so
to pay is not sufficient to constitute any cause of action
alleged in the original petition. The balance of item 5
includes $57,500, payments to the tribal treasurer before
the passage of the Curtis Act and before commencement
of the period covered by the original petition. They must
bd excluded. The remainder of this item is also a part
of item 8 about to be considered, See opinion below, p. 154.
Item 8--864,702.58--is based on a claim which is described in the amended petition, in substance as follows:

U. S. v. SEMINOLE NATION.
417

Opinion of the Court.

After the passage of the Curtis Act, defendant impounded
all the funds of plaintiff, and assumed full administrative
control over the disbursement of same. Notwithstanding
"the plain inhibition in said Section 19 that no payments
thereafter should be made to 'the tribal governments or to
any officer thereof for disbursement,' yet in violation of
said section the defendant illegally disbursed the amounts
hereinafter set forth, derived from" stated sources.'
"Therefore, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in the
amount of $864,702.58 for the violation of said Section 19
of said Act of June 28, 1898."
This claim is not included in the original petition. It
states defendant refused to make payments to the tribal
treasurer. Finding XII shows that defendant did pay
to the treasurer all the amounts included in the item. The
original petition not only failed to lay foundation for the
claim but in effect excluded every part of it. The item is
included in the judgment on a basis of fact directly opposed to the allegations of the original petition relied on
by plaintiff until long after the expiration of the period
within which the United States permitted suit in respect
of it. The plaintiff is not entitled to recover any part of
the item.
3. Item 9 is $154,455.30. Unlike the items considered
above, it may be held sufficiently alleged in the original
petition. The amended petitioh, par. IX, gives details
as follows: The Original Seminole Agreement ratified by
Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567, provides that $500,000
"Treaty of August 7, 1856, Funds ................. $212,500.00

of the funds belonging to the Seminoles shall be set apart
as a permanent school fund and be held by the United
States at five per cent interest. The school fund was
established March 6, 1906. Defendant, in violation of
the agreement and without authority of law "disbursed
from the principal thereof the amount of $154,455.30."
Therefore that amount "is due the Seminole Nation from
the defendant." As to it the court found that the Secretary of the Interior did disburse from the principal of the
permanent school fund in 1920 and 1921 "per capita payments" amounting to $32,445.56; in 1921 "equalization of
allotments," $490.22; in each of the years 1922 to 1930
payments for "Education" amounting in all to $121,519.52. In its opinion the court said: "That Congress
had the power to change the terms of the agreement and
authorize these payments, is well, established,5 but we
find no act of Congress that either in express terms or by
necessary implication authorizes any pf them. It must,
therefore, be held that they were illegally made and that
the Seminole 'permanent school fund'-a trust fundwas unlawfully depleted thereby. The'plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum claimed."
Congress contemplated, at least as early as 1898 at the
time of the passage of the Curtis Act and the ratification
of the Seminole Agreement, that the tribal government
was soon to be terminated. The Act of March 3, 1903,
§ 8, 32 Stat. 1008, declared that it should not continue
after March 4, 1906. Congress, by Joint Resolution
March 2, 1906, 34 Stat. 822, continued tribal existence
and tribal government until all tribal property and its
proceeds should be distributed among individual members. TheAct of April 26, 1906, § 28, 34 Stat. 148, continued tribal existence and government for all a~dthorized

purposes until otherwise provided by law. By Acts
passed in 1906 and 1908 Congress directed the Secretary
of the Interior to take possession of all buildings used
for governmental, school or other tribal purposes, together with the furniture and land pertaining thereto and
to sell the same and deposit the proceeds to the credit of
the Seminoles.' Liquidation of Seminole property and
distribution of its proceeds per capita went forward under
direction of Congress.! And, by May 25, 1918, when the
Congress passed the Act making appropriations for the.
,.Bureau of Indian Affairs for, the fiscal year ending June
Q0,1919, under which defendant claims that the per capita payments here in question were made, the need of a
permanent school fund had almost ended. At the hearing upon that measure before the House Committee on
Indian Affairs, 8 the Bureau, through the Assistant Commissioner, reported that one of the two Seminole Academies had already ceased to exist, that the other -was still
used but that public school privileges were within the
reach of almost' every-pupil and that the fund was not
needed for the support of any other school. Ii was on
the recommendation of the Bureau that Congress in*cluded in § 18 of this Act a clause specifically authorizing
the Secretary of the Interior to pay to the enrolled members of the Semihole Tribe entitled to share in its funds,
or fo their lawful heirs, out of the Seminole school fund
not to exceed $100 per capita and directed payment to be
made under rules aed regulations prescribed by the. SecAct of April 26, 1906, §§ 15-17,34 Stat. 143.. Act- of April ,

retary.9 The Act, like earlier ones"0 and those njaking
appropriations for fiscal years ending, respectively, 1ne
30, 1920, and 1921," contained a proviso directing that
in the specified fiscal year no money iall be expended
from tribal funds without specific appropriation by Congress, except "Equalization of allotments, per capita and
other payments authorized by law . . ." By regulations
promulgated June 17, 1918, par. 14, the Secretary required disbursements to continue "until all claims are
paid or until further orders of the Department."
Plaintiff does not claim that § 18 of the appropriation
Act of 1918 did not specifically authorize the use of the
principal to make the per capita payments here in ques-.
tion. But it contends authority so to use that fund
ceased with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919. The
payments authorized constituted a distribution looking
to the ultimate disposition of all tribal property. The
provision exnressed no limitation in respect of the time
91 .
That the Secretary of the Interior be, and he is
hereby, authorized to pay to the enrolled members of the Seminole
Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma entitled under existing law to share
in the funds of said tribe, or to their lawful heirs, out of the Seminole school fund, or any moneys belonging to said tribe in the United
States Treasury or deposited in any bank or held by an official under
the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior, not to exceed $100
per capita: Provided, That said payment shall be made under such
rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe:
Provided further, That in cases where such enrolled members, or
their heirs, are Indians who belong to the restricted class, the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, withhold such payments and use the same for the benefit of such restricted Indians.

within which they were to be made. The occasion/and
purpose of the enactment tend strongly to negative any
implication that Seminoles entitled to participate in the
distribution would be barred if the Secretary failed to
cause payments to be made them within the fiscal year.
The provisos contained in the appropriation Acts for the
fiscal years 1920 and 1921 during which the per capita
payments in controversy were made reasonably may be
deemed sbfficient to authorize them. Weight is to be
given to.the Secretary's regulations, par. 13, which declared that all suspended or withheld payments were "to
be disbursed at such times and in such amounts as the
best interest of the persons, to whom such suspended or
withheld payments are due, may demand." Plaintiff's
contention that it is entitled to recover upon the ground
that the per capita payments were not made within time
allowed therefor is without merit. The amount of the
per capita payments must be eliminated from the
judgment.
As to the amount of $490.20 paid out of the school fund
for "equalization of allotments," 'the defendant relies
upon a provision in the appropriation Act of February
14, 1920, 41 Stat. 427, declaring: "That hereafter no
money shall be expended from tribal funds . . . without
specific appropriation .,. . except as follows: Equalization of allotments . . . and other payments authorized
by law to individual members of the respective
tribes . . ." But defendant fails to show that the excepted payments were "authorized by law." This
amount was properly included in the judgment.
As to the sum of $121,519.52 made up of payments
from 1922 through 1930 for "Education," the sole question is wh-ther Congress authorized the use of the principal of the permanent school fund for that purpose.
The appropriation Acts applicable to these years authorized the Secretary of the Interior to continue Seminole

schools from the tribal funds. 2 It must be assumed that
when enacting these measures Congress took into account
the fact that the Seminole school fund in pursuance of
its authority had been so depleted that interest on the
amount remaining in it would not meet even the lessened
requirements. Its failure to limit expenditure for education to interest on the permanent fund and adherence to
substantially the same form of words yearly throughout
the entire period sufficiently indicate the intention of
Congress that disbursements for that purpose were not
limited to the interest and that principal was to be used.
The inclusion of that amount in the judgment cannot be
sustained.
The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded
to the lower court with directions for further proceedings
in accordance with this opinion.
