PUFAIL, RECEIVER, v. ESTATE OF ELVIRA J.
PARKS, DECEASED.
CERTIORARI

TO THE APPELLATE COURT, FIRST DISTRICTY OF
ILLINOIS.

No. 18.

Argued October 15, 1936.-Dccidcd December 7, 1936.

1. Section 66, Title 12, U. S. C., declaqres that a person holding stock
in a national banking association as executor shall not be personally subject to any liability as stockholder, but that the estate
and funds in his hands shall be liable in like manner and to the
same extent as the testator would be if living and. competent to
act and hold the stock in his own name. Held that the purpose
of the latter clause is to make plain that, although the executor
is exonerated personally, the estate is not; but the statute evinces
no intent to prefer the assessments of stockholders' liability over
other claims against the estate, or to exempt the receiver of the
bank, in the collection of assessments, from pursuing the remedy
prescribed by the local law for the collection of like claims. P. 222.
2. Section 64, Title 12, U. S. C., imposes no lien for the amount of
an assessment against a living stockholder, and § 66 imposes none
against the estate of a deceased stockholder. P..224.
3. The statute creates an unsecured and unpreferred claim against a
decedent's estate. Where the assessment has been made in the
decedent's lifetime, an accrued and provable debt exists against
his estate; if made after his .death, a claim against the funds and
assets of the estate accrues as of the date of assessment. P. 224.
4. The receiver of the bank may enforce his claim based on the
assessment only in conformity to the law of the forum governing
recovery of debts of like nature. If he elect to proceed in a
federal court, the judgment or decree will determine the validity
and amount of the claim; but if payment is desired from assets
under the control of a state probate court, the marshalling of the
claim with others, its priority, if any, in distibution, and all similar
questions, are for the probate court upon presentation to it of the
judgment or decree of the federal court. P. 225.
5. If the receiver prosecute his claim in a state court, the litigation
will be governed (at least in the absence of federal legislation to
the contrary) by the common and statutory law of the State.
P. 226.

6. If the State does not discriminate against the receiver's claim, in
favor of others of equal dignity and like character, there is no
warrant for exempting the claim from the effect of local statutes
governing procedure or limiting the time for prosecution of action.
P. 227.
7. By the law of ,Illinois, claims against a decedent's estate, not
exhibited to the court within one year from the granting of letters,
are barred as to property and estate of the deceased which has been
inventoried or accounted for by the executor or administrator, and
claims may not be p.rved while they remain contingent; but opportunity is allowed to collect claims not presented within the year
from assets subsequently discovered, whether the failure to present
them earlier was due to negligence or to their contingent character;
and if the claim is contingent, and the liability of the estate does
not become absolute until after the expiration of the year, the
creditor may recover from the distributees to the extent of the
assets received by them respectively.
Held that a claim of a national bank's receiver against a decedent's estate, based upon an assessment of shares, was not entitled to satisfaction out of assets 'inventoried within one year after
the granting of letters testamentary, where the insolvency of the
bank, the levying of the assessment and the presentation of the
claim to the Illinois probate court, all occurred after that year had
expired. P. 227.
283 Ill. ApLe. 95, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 298 U. S. 649, to review a judgment affirming the rejection, by the Probate Court and by the Circuit
Court of Cook County, Illinois; of a claim by the receiver
of a national bank. The judgment here under review was
not reviewable by the Supreme Court of Illinois, for want
of a "certificate of importance."

Mr. George P. Barse, with whom Mr. Otis F. Glenn

was on the brief, for petitioner.
The estate remained liable after the stockholder's death.
The contingent assessment liability became absolute
when the assessment was levied. The estate was then
still in process of administration and undistributed, inventoried assets of value far in excess of the assessment
claim were and are in the hands of the executors. R.*S.,

PUFAHL v. ESTATE OF PARKS.

Argument for Petitioner.

§ 5152, 12 U. S. C. 66, expressly provides that the estates
and funds in the hands of persons holding stock as executors shall be liable for stock assessment in like manner
and to the same extent as the testator would be, if living
and competent to act and hold the stock in his own name.
This provision shows a clear intent on the part of Congress that the liability, as limited and defined by § 66,
shall extend to the estate of a deceased shareholder for
the benefit of the creditors of an insolvent national bank.
The fiduciaries are exempt, but the property belonging
to the estate in their hands is liable, as would be the
deceased, if living.
This obligation of the estate continues unimpaired until valid assignment of the shares by final distribution of
the estate. Farrest v. Jack, 294 U. 'S. 158, 162; Seabury
v. Green, 294 U. S.165, 169. See also Matteson v. Dent,
176 U. S.521, 524; Richmond v. Irons, 121 U. S.27, 55,
56; Zimmerman v. Carpenter,84 Fed. 747, 751; Drain v.
Stough, 61 F. (2d) 668, 669.
The non-claim statute of Illinois, providing that claims
of any class not exhibited to the court within one year
from the granting of letters of administration shall be
forever barred from sharing in the distribution of the
inventoried assets, does not relieve the estate and the
undistributed inventoried assets in the hands of the executors from the obligation and liability for stock assessment
imposed by the federal law.
The estate being still open and in process of administration, with an excess of undistributed, inventoried
assets in the hands of the executors, Forrestv. Jack, supra,
is distinguishable. The federal act specifically ana directly imposes the liability on the undistributed assets.
See Zimmerman v. Carpenter, 84 Fed. 747 (cited with
approval by this Court in Forrest v. Jack, supra, and

The contingent assessment liability was an equitable
lien upon the estate.
The laws of the States will not be permitted to discriminate against or interfere with the operative effect
of the national banking laws. Mortimer v. Potter, 213
Ill. 178; Kingston v. Old National Bank, 359 Ill. 192.
A claim which is not only contingent, but which, from
its very nature, is incapable of being presented earlier in
pending probate proceedings, cannot reasonably be considered to be within the scope and purpose of a non-claim
statute. See Hantzch v. Massolt, 62 Minn. 361; M1cter
& Lux v. Katz, 10 Cal. App. 576; Springhorn v. Dirks, 72
Mont. 121; Zimmerman v., Carpenter, 84 Fed. 747, 750751; Allen v. Hanover Trust Co., 247 Mass. 347; Tierney
v. Shakespeare, 34 N. Mex. 501; Baird v. McMillan, 53
N. D. 257; Johnson v. Libby, 111 Me. 204.
From the standpoint of enforcing the assessment liability imposed by the federal statute, it is obvious that
the problem created by the expiration of the period for
filing claims under the non-claim statute is not adequately
or reasonably met by the fact that, under the state law,
the .receiver may possibly be able to satisfy the assessment out of property subsequently discovered and inventoried or, in the alternative, may proceed against the
heirs, devisees, legatees, or distributees receiving the inventoried property from the estate.
As far back as Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, this
Court has recognized the plain purpose of the National
Bank Act to wind up insolvent national banks speedily.

217

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Franz W. Catle, with whom Messrs. Emmctt J.
McCarthy and Robert F. Carey were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR.

JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In this case we are concerned with the bearing of state
law upon the enforcement of an assessment against the
estate of a stockholder of a national bank.
Elvira J. Parks died March 20, 1928, owning twelve
shares of the capital stock of the Austin National Bank
of Chicago. May 17, 1928, the Probate Court of Cook
County, Illinois, granted letters testamentary to the executors named in her will, who filed an inventory and
supplemental inventory in the probate court within one
year of the date of the letters. March 30, 1931, the
Comptroller of the Currency declared the bank insolvent,
closed it, and appointed the petitioner receiver, and May
21, 1931, assessed all stockholders, including the executors
of Elvira J. Parks, one hundred per cent. of the par value
of their stock. The executors refused to honor the
receiver's demand for payment, and on September 1, 1933,
he filed his claim in the Probate Court for $1,327.17, the
amount of the assessment with interest to the date of
filing. January 13, 1934, the court disallowed the claim.
The receiver appealed to the Circuit Court, where the
case was tried de novo. That court, applying a state
statute, disallowed the claim as against undistributed
assets in the hands of executors inventoried within one
year from the date of the grant of letters, because the
claim did not accrue and was not presented to the Probate
Court within that period, but allowed it as to assets not
inventoried within the year. (From a stipulation filed
in this court it appears that there are in the executors'
possession inventoried assets in excess of the amount of
petitioner's claim; that the estate is solvent; and that

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.

there are no assets not inventoried within one year from
the granting of the letters, or discovered after the expi
ration of that period.) The Appellate Court of the First
District of Illinois affirmed the judgment. A certificate
of importance, requisite for a review by the Supreme
Court of the State, was refused. Certiorari was granted
to resolve a conflict respecting the construction of relevant federal statutes.
U. S. C. Tit. 12, § 64 is in part:
"The stockholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, each to
the amount of his stock therein, at the par value thereof,
in addition to the amount invested in such stock ..
Section 66 is:
"Persons holding stock as executors, administrators,
guardians, or trustees, shall not be personally subject to
any liabilities as stockholders; but the estates and funds
in their hands shall be liable in like manner and to the
same extent as the testator, intestate, ward, or person
interested in such trust funds would be, if living and
competent to act and hold the stock in his own name."
The petitioner asserts these sections give his claim a
quality so superior to that of other contingent claims
against a decedent's estate that it must be recognized by
state tribunals without regard to limitations upon allowance imposed by state laws.
The liability is imposed by the statute.' The original
subscriber and likewise an immediate or remote vendee of
the shares assumes a status,-that of stockholder. The
assumption of this status involves whatever conditions or
burdens the federal statutes have imposed as incident to
the holding of national bank shares. The contingent

Opinion of the Court.

obligation to pay an assessment is rendered absolute by
the Comptroller's action in ordering one; whether that
action be taken during the stockholder's life or after his
death. From the moment of the Comptroller's order
for assessment the bank's receiver has a claim which
would support an action of debt at common law against
a living stockholder, or the executor of a deceased stockholder. And if assessment be made after the estate of a
deceased stockholder has been distributed the receiver
may proceed to recover the amount from distributees or
heirs, if, and to the exteht, they areliable for debts of the
estate under the law of the domicile
The first clause of § 66 obviously was intended to exempt
from personal liability the executor, administrator, guardian or trustee who holds stock as such fiduciary whether
standing of record in his name or in that of the decedent,
ward, or settlor. The second declares that the estate and
funds in the hands of an executor shall be liable as the
testator would have been if living, competent, and a stockholder of record. The question is whether this clause adds
anything to the obligation of the decedent which is cast
upon his estate by operation of law irrespective of § 66.1
Does it impose upon the estate a liability differing from
that which the law fastens upon the personal representative to discharge out of the estate, debts accruing before
or after the decedent's death? We think that, as the first
clause exonerates the fiduciary from personal liability,
the second negatives the inference that the exoneration is
to-extend to the decedent's estate. -This was the view
taken by Judge Shipman in Davis y. Weed, 7 Fed. Cas.
186 (44 Conn. 569):
"I do not think that section 5152 [§ 66] was intended to
affect the liability for assessments of estates in process

of settlement. The principal object of the section was
to prevent a personal liability from running against executors, administrators, trustees or guardians, who had
purchased as trustees, or to whom had been transferred
in their names as trustees national bank stocks for the
benefit of the trust estates. Having by such purchase
voluntarily entered into a contingent liability for assessinents, it might be claimed that a judgment de bonis propriis could be rendered against them. The main object
of the section was to prevent personal judgments being
rendered against such persons in whom the stock stood
on the books of the bank as trustees."
The statute evidences no intent to prefer the assessment over other claims against the estate, or to exempt
the receiver from the pursuit of the remedy prescribed by
the local law for collection of claims of the same sort.
Section 64 gives the receiver 'no lien for the amount of
the assessment against the property of a living stockholder. The claim may only be recovered by suit or
action. The judgment obtained is collectible like any
other; it has no preference in distribution if the debtor's
property be in the hands of a receiver, if he has made
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or become
bankrupt. Section 66 makes a deceased stockholder's
estate liable in like manner, and to the same extent, as
he would have been if living. As no lien is created
against the property of a living stockholder by § 64,
§ 66 imposes none against his estate.4
The statute creates an unsecured and unpreferred claim
against a decedent's estate. Where the assessment has
'In Witters v. Sowles, 32 Fed. 130, 140, and in Drain v. Stough,
61 F. (2d) 668 there are statements that the statute imposes a lien
on estate assets. In Rankin v. Miller, 207 Fed. 602, 611 one ground
of decision was that such a lien existed. So in Drake v. Dilatush,
16 F. Supp. 120, the District. Court for Eastern Illinois by decree
imposed a lien upon the assets of a decedent's estate held by the
executor, under circumstances like those presented in the instant case.

Opinion of the Court.

been made in the decedent's lifetime an accrued and
provable debt exists against his estate; if made after his
death a claim against the funds and assets of the estate
accrues as of the date of assessment.
Although the petitioner's demand is based upon a federal statute, he may enforce it only in conformity to the
law of the forum governing the recovery of debts of like
nature. He might have sued in a federal court. Notwithstanding the statute providing that the citizenship
of a national bank, for purposes of federal jurisdiction,
shall be as if it were a corporation of the state where it
has its place of business, the receiver is an officer of the
United States and, as such, entitled to sue for assessments
in a federal court, irrespective of the citizenship of the
parties or the amount in controversy.' If he elect so
to do, R. S.721 (28 U. S. C. § 725) governs the trial:
"The laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United
States, in cases where they apply."
In such a proceeding the state statute of limitations
will be applied; ' and it seems that the local substantive
law governing property rights in stock will be observed.7
Nor does the principle that the jurisdiction of courts of
the United States cannot be defeated by a state's laws
limiting redress of its own citizens to certain 'tribunals 8

create such inconsistency or conflict as to require the overriding of the law of the state with respect to distribution
of the estate of a decedent. Where, as here, a res has
come into the possession and under the control of a state
court, one having a right to go into the federal court,
either by reason of diversity of citizenship, or because he
is a federal officer, cannot obtain a judgment or decree
entitling him to interfere with the administration of the
res by the court having its possession. While he may
not be denied his right to prosecute an action to judgment or a suit to final decree in the federal court, such
judgment or decree can do no more than adjudicate th3
validity and amount of his claim. The marshalling of
that claim with others, its priority, if any, in distribution,
and all similar questions, are for the probate court upon
presentation to it of the judgment or decree of the federal
court.' Thus, though a receiver should resort to the
United States District Court, he would need to present,
in a probate court, any judgment obtained, if he desired
payment from the assets under the control of the latter.
The receiver may, as petitioner elected to do, prosecute
his claim in a state court. If he does, at least in the absence of Congressional declaration to the contrary, the
litigation will be governed by the common and statutory
law of the state. Thus the local statute of limitations applies; 10 and the local law as to the extinguishment of
the estate and the liability vel non of distributees controls. 1
If the state law requires a claim for an assessment to be
prosecuted in an action of debt, the receiver cannot elect
to bring some other form of action or to sue in equity;
'Yonley v. Lavender, 21 Wall. 276; Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

conversely, if the law prescribes a suit in equity, the receiver cannot bring an action at law. And if under the
state statutes demands against a decedent's estate must
be proved in a probate court, the receiver cannot pursue
some other form of action. This is not to say that a state
may deny all remedy for the substantive right arising out
of the federal statute (see Seabury v. Green, supra); it
is merely to say that if the state does not discriminate
against the receiver's claim in favor of others of equal dignity and like character, there is no warrant for exempting
the claim from the effect of local statutes governing procedure or limiting the time for prosecution of action.'
The petitioner, having elected to prove his claim in the
appropriate state court, is bound by the laws of Illinois as
to the enforcement of such claims, provided those laws are
nondiscriminatory and operate equally upon all claims of

relevant statute is § 70 of the Illinois Administration Act 12 which provides that five classes of claims
against decedents' estates shall be preferred in the order
named, e. g., funeral expenses, costs of administration,
widow's share, etc. The sixth class is:
"Sixth. All other debts and demands of whatever kind
without regard to quality or dignity, which shall be exhibited to the court within one year from granting of letters
as aforesaid.
"All claims and demands of whatever class not exhibited
to the court within one year 1 from the granting of letters
as aforesaid shall be forever barred as to property and
estate of the deceased which has been inventoried or accounted for by the executor or administrator; and if the
executor or administrator shall thereafter file any inventory listing other estate not previously inventoried or

accounted for, and shall cause notice to be published in
the manner provided by Section 60 of this Act, or give
such other notice as the court may direct, of a day fixed
upon, which shall be not less than three months after the
date of such first publication, for the filing and exhibiting
of further claims against said decedent, all claims not exhibited to the court prior to the date so fixed shall be
forever barred as to the property and estate listed in such
inventory, and the amount remaining due on all claims
exhibited to the court on or prior to the day so fixed upon
as aforesaid, including those filed within one year from
the granting of letters, shall be paid pro rata out of such
subsequently inventoried estate, saving, however, to infants, persons of unsound mind and persons in the employment of the United States or of this State and
residing outside of the United States, the term of one year
after their respective disabilities are removed to exhibit
their claims."
In Illinois a creditor whose claim against a decedent's
estate is not due may present it for allowance and settlement provided the liability of the decedent was absolute. 4
Contingent claims may not be proved. 5 Section 70 is
not a general statute of limitations but a specific provision intended to facilitate the early settlement of estates. 6
It results that a claim not presented within the year,
though not entitled to be paid from assets inventoried
within the year, is not barred, but may be collected out

of assets subsequently discovered; and this is so whether
the failure timely to present the claim was due to the
creditor's negligence, or to the fact that the claim was
contingent in character and did not become absolute by
the happening of the contingency during the year. 7 If
the claim is contingent, and the liability of the estate does
not become-absolute until after the expiration of the year,
the creditor may recover from the distributees to the extent of the assets received by them respectively. 8
The claimant has only to present and prosecute his demand in the probate court, which has jurisdiction both
of legal demands and those cognizable in equity." While,
therefore, the creditor need not resort to a court of law
or equity to establish his claim, he may do so, since the
jurisdiction of those courts over such claims has not been
abolished." He may present his claim to the probate
court and, at the same time, proceed in equity in the circuit court for specific performance of the contract out of

for any deficiency in his security."' But whatever the
forum- in which he prosecutes his demand, no execution
is issued upon the judgment or decree obtained.
Whether the claim is presented to the probate court or
litigated in some other, within the year, the judgment is
that the claim be paid "in due course of administration,"-that is, by an order of distribution out of the
proceeds of inventoried assets." If judgment is recovered
upon a demand, presented to the probate court or prosecuted at law or in equity after the expiration of the year,
the judgment is special, that the claim be paid out of
assets inventoried or discovered after the lapse of the year,
like the common law judgment quando acciderint; 4 or
that it be enforced against distributees.2 5 The only bar
to the recovery of such a judgment is the general statute
of limitations. 8
A creditor cannot subject inventoried assets, undistributed and held by the administrator, to the payment
of-his claim by instituting, after the expiration of the year,
and prosecuting to judgment, an action of debt against
the administrator. 7 Nor can one who has failed to present his claim to the probate court, or to institute suit
or action on it, within the year, resort to a court of equity

Opinion of the Court

to have his demands paid out of undistributed inventoried
assets.2"
It is apparent that the decision under review enforces
the policy of the state evidenced by § 70 of the Administration Act as it has been uniformly applied to claims
of like character.
The petitioner relies on Mortimer v. Potter, 213 Ill.
178; 72 N. E. 817, but it is not in point. The claim of
the receiver for an assessment in that case accrued after
the estate had been fully administered and while the
stock with respect to which assessment was levied was
in the hands of trustee to whom it was devised by the
testator. Under the principles of Illinois law, as has
been shown, such a devisee who received assets from the
decedent's estate is liable for the assessment to the extent
of those assets.
The petitioner also cites Zimmerman v. Carpenter, 84
Fed. 747, as authority in his favor. In that case a circuit court of the United States entered a decree charging
the assets in the hands of an executor with the amount
of an assessment levied after the decedent's death. It is
not clear from the opinion whether the court thought that
§ 66 creates a lien on estate assets from the date of the
bank's failure or construed the section as creating a claim
sui generis enforceable directly against assets in the possession of the executor and under the control of a state
court of competent jurisdiction. As we have shown
above, either theory is wrong.
Strauss v. Phillips, 189 Ill. 9, 23; 59 N. E. 560; compare Blanchard v. Williamson, 70 Ill. 647. The petitioner cites cases to the effect that probate courts in Illinois act upon equitable principles.

Some of these are collected in Note 13, supra, but they go only to
the point that in probating claims against an estate those courts recognize equitable doctrines, and do not remit a creditor to a court of
equity if his claim is equitable rather than legal. No statute or case
has been found indicating that these tribunals have independent
equity jurisdiction.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Syllabus.

299 U. S.

In the absence of federal legislation giving priority
to a claim for an assessment of stockholders' liability
over other debts, or a lien upon the assets of a deceased
stockholder's estate, or a special remedy, the claim is
not entitled to distribution otherwise than as specified in a nondiscriminatory statute of the domicile. The
judgment is

Affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE STONE took no part in the consideration or

decision of this case.

v. UNITED STATES ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 74. Argued November 16, 17, 1936.-Decided December 7, 1936.
1. A court cannot substitute its own discretion for that of administrative officers acting within their powers. Mere error or unwisdoam is not equivalent to abuse of discretion. P. 236.
2. Statements made in argument by counsel for the Government in
behalf of the Federal Communications Commission, which were
reduced to writing and filed in the case at the suggestion of the
Court, and which declared the meaning of certain of the regulations
prescribed by the Commission as part of a uniform system of accounts for telephone companies, under the Communications Act of
1934,--held an administrative construction binding upon the Commission in its future dealings with the companies. P. 241.
3. Rules in a uniform system of accounts for telephone companies
subject to the Communications Act of 1934, require that the property investments of an accounting company shall be entered in
balance sheet accounts, under the general title of "Investments,"
at "original cbst," a term which, as applied to plant, franchise, patent rights, etc., is defined to mean the cost, actual or estimated,
of the property at the time when it was first dedicated to the public
use, whether by the accounting company or a predecessor public
utility; the differences between the amounts actually paid by the
accounting company in acquiring property from predecessor utili-
