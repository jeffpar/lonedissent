the manufacturers that they will not sell, offer for sale, or use in
the repair of the vehicles, second hand or used parts or parts not

of the Clayton Act if its effect has not been in any way substantially to lessen competition or to create a monopoly in any line of
commerce. P. 4.

Appeals are accepted by this Court unless clear error is shown.

Mr. Carl B. Rix.for petitioner.
Mr. John M. Zane, with whom Messrs. Franklin D.
Trueblood, Thomas Francis Howe, and Henry S. Rademacher were on the brief, for respondents.
PER CURIAM.

By this suit petitioner challenged the validity under
ยง 3 of the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730, 731, 15 U. S. C. 14)
of a provision of the contracts made with dealers by
selling organizations of the General Motors Corporation.
The provision in the contract between the Chevrolet
Motor Company and dealers is as follows:
"Dealer agrees that he will not sell, offer for sale, or
use in the repair of Chevrolet motor vehicles and chassis
second-hand or used parts or any part or parts not manufactured by or authorized by the Chevrolet Motor Company. It is agreed that Dealer is not granted any

exclusive selling rights in genuine new Chevrolet parts
or accessories."
There is a similar provision in contracts made by the
Buick company.
The District Court dismissed the bill of complaint for
want of equity and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals. 80 F. (2d) 641. Upon the evidence
adduced at the trial the District Court found that the
effect of the clause had not been in any way substantially
to lessen competition or to create a monopoly in any line
of commerce. This finding was sustained by the Circuit
Court of Appeals. Id., p. 644.
Under the established rule, this Court accepts the findings in which two courts concur unless clear error is shown.
