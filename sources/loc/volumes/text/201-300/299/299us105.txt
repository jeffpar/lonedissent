FOX v. CAPITAL CO.
Statement of the Case.

99

Dwight v. Merritt, (1880) 4 Fed. 614. In so far as these
decisions and others following them (United States v.
Mitchell, 223 Fed. 805) extend the rule of the statute
to notices or forms of process not issuing from a court,
they do not have our approval.
Petitioners suggest that the use of a notice of motion
as a substitute for a summons is forbidden by Rule 14
adopted by the District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia. The same objection was adequately answered in Eley v. Gamble, supra, pp. 173, 174. If the
rule has such a meaning it is inconsistent with the Conformity Act which governs practice in the district courts,
"any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding."
The judgment is
Affirmed.

MR.

JUSTICE

CARDOZO

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question in this case is whether there is jurisdiction in the Circuit Court of Appeals to review upon appeal an order fining a judgment debtor for contempt in
refusing to submit to an examination in proceedings
supplementary to judgment.
Respondent had a judgment against petitioner for
$297,412.91 in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. Upon default in payment, the creditor began a proceeding, supplementary
to the judgment, for the examination of the debtor. By
the Civil Practice Act of New York (§ 774 as amended by
L. 1935, c. 630) such a proceeding may be instituted
by order of the Court, by subpoena, or by warrant. Respondent resorted to the second of these methods. The
judgment debtor having failed to respond to the subpoena, an application was made to punish him for contempt. The Court made an order adjudging the contempt with leave to the debtor to purge himself thereof.
Thereafter, upon evidence that the contempt continued,
the court made a second order fining the debtor for his
contempt in the amount of $235,082.03, then unpaid
upon the judgment, and an additional amount of $10,000 to be paid to the attorneys of the judgment creditors
for the costs of the proceeding. A warrant was to issue
to the Marshal whereby the debtor was to be confined
in jail until payment of the fine, with the proviso, in
substance, that except for the costs of the proceeding,
$10,000, the fine would, be remitted upon submission to

Opinion of the Court.

the subpoena. From the two orders so made the debtor
appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, where the appeal was dismissed. To settle the
practice in a situation likely to recur, this Court granted
certiorari, the review to be "limited to the question of
the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals."
A proceeding for the examination of a debtor as a supplement to judgment or execution is a summary substitute for a suit in equity by a creditor for the discovery of
assets. Ex parte Boyd, 105 U. S. 647, 651-653; Le Roy
v. Rogers, 3 Paige Ch. (N. Y.) 234; Hadden v. Spader, 20
Johns. (N. Y.) 554, 565; Scoville v. Shed, 36 Hun (N. Y.)
165, 167. It continues "until closed or discontinued by
consent or discontinued, dismissed or closed by order of
the court." New York Civil Practice Act, § 802 (1);
Steinman v. Conlon, 208 N. Y. 198; 101 N. E. 863; Hand
v. OrtschreibBuilding Corp., 254 N. Y. 15; 171 N. E. 889.
It "shall be deemed closed two years from the service of
the order, subpoena or warrant" initiating it, unless extended by order for a definite period. § 802 (1). It may
be closed within that time upon a showing by the debtor
of. unreasonable delay. § 802 (3). The relief appropriate to the proceeding includes the appointment of- a receiver, or a decree for the payment of money or the delivery of property. Steinman V. Conlon, supra, p. 202.
The imposition of a fine for the refusal of the debtor to
appear or answer is not a substitute for such relief or for
adequate discovery. Despite the contempt or the penalties therefor, the proceeding may continue until its aim
has been achieved.
The rule is settled in this Court that except in connection with an appeal from a final judgment or decree, a
party to a suit may not review upon appeal an order fining or imprisoning him for the commission of a civil contempt. Doyle v. London Guarantee & Accidenit Co.. 204

Opinion of the Court.

299 U.S.

'458; Hayes v. Fischer, 102 U. S. 121; Worden v. Searls,
121 U. S. 14, 25. The appellant in the court below, the
petitioner before us here, was a party to a suit or proceeding for the discovery of assets. There is no occasion to
consider how far his rights and remedies would be different if he had been a stranger to the record, a witness or an
adverse claimant. Nelson v. United States, 201 U. S.
92, 115; Alexander v. United States, 201 U. S. 117, 122.
Not only was he a party; he was a party to a proceeding
then in its initial stages. Discovery was in abeyance, and
what the final relief would be was still a subject for conjecture. This sufficiently appears from the statement already made as to the function and duration of a proceeding supplementary to judgment. 'Finally, the contempt
charged and adjudicated was not criminal, but civil; reparation to an obstructed creditor, not vindication of the
public justice, was the puppose of the fine, and of the fine,
in all its parts. Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co.,
221 U. S. 418, 441; Doyle v. London Guarantee & Accident Co., supra, p. 606; Lamb v. Cramer, 285 U. S. 217,
220; In re Guzzardi, 74 F. (2d) 671, 672. If this codld
otherwise be doubtful, it ,ismade clear beyond' cavil by
the recitals of the order.
Petitioner does not question the compensatdry or civil
quality of so much of the fine as may be avoided at any
time bv obeying the subpoena. He takes the ground,
however, that the fine of $10,000 which was imposed unconditionally, is in excess of any damage suffered by
force of the contempt (Cf. 28 U. S. C.. § 387), and from
this he moves to the conclusion that the penalty was
inflicted as retribution for a crime. But the conclusion
does not follow though the premise be accepted. The
court may have erred in its assessment of the costs required for reparation. As to that we do not intirpate an
opinion either one way or the other. What is very plain
is the fact that the assessment was made in a genuine

endeavor to reimburse a harassed creditor for the damages occasioned by -obstruction and delay. Errors, if
there were any, did not split the controversy into parts,
one civil and one criminal. Cf. Collins v. Miller, 252
U. S. 364, 370. It retained from first to last its unitary
quality. In levying the fine, the court was not acting
sua sponte, or at the instance of the government through
a prosecuting officer. Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range
Co., supra; Lamb v. Cramer, supra; Union Tool Co. v.
Wilson, 259 U. S. 107, 112; Michaelson v. United States,
266 U. S. 42, 64; Leman v. Krentler-Arnold Hinge Last
Co., 284 U. S.448, 452. It lent a helping hand to a suppliant for aid.
The order is not final, and there is no error in the ruling that it is not subject to appeal.
Affirmed,
MR. JUSTICE STONE took no part' in the consideration
or decision of this case.
