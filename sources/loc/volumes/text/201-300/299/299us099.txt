v. GILMER, RECEIVER.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 11.

Argued October 13, 1936.-Decided November 9, 1936.

1, The Virginia practice, whereby a notice of motion for judgment
is accepted as a substitute for a writ or other process issued from
court, is valid in law actions in federal courts in Virginia. P. 101.
2. How a suit shall be begun, whether by writ or by informal notice,
is a question of "practice" or of "forms- and modes of proceeding,"
within 'he meaning of the Conformity Act, R. S., § 914; 28 U. S. C.
724. P. 102.
3. The Constitution does not prescribe the method of beginning
civil causes t law, beyond requiring reasonable notice and a fair
opportunity to be heard before issues are determined. Id.
4. A federal court, adhering to the Constitution, is bound in such
causes by the Conformity Act to follow the local practice, except
where some other Act of Congress has declared a special rule.
* Id.
5. Revised Statutes, § 911 (28 U. S. C. 721), which provides that "All
writs and processes issuing from the courts of the United btates
shall be under the seal of the court from which they issue, and
shall be signed by the clerk thereof," does not apply to a notice
of motion for judgment in Virginia, which, if process at all, is not
process issuing from a court, and assuredly is not a writ. P. 103.
6. A rule of the District Court inconsistent with the Conformity Act
would be invalid. P. 105.

Opinion of the Court.

299 U. S.

Mr. George Gilmer, with whom Messrs. John S.
Eggleston and George P. Barse were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered' the opinion of the
Court.
The controversy is one as to the jurisdiction of a
United States District Court in Virginia to apply the
Virginia practice whereby a notice of motion for judgment is accepted as a substitute for a writ or other
process issued from a court.
Petitioners,. shareholders in a national bank, have
been charged by the Comptroller of the Currency with
an assessment in the amount of the par value of their
shares. To enforce that assessment, respondent, the
receiver of the bank, gave notice of motion that he
would apply for judgment at a given time, incorporating in the notice a statement of the facts making up
the claim. Thete is no question that the practice was
in conformity with the statutes of Virginia. The notice, which was signed by the receiver, was served upon
the shareholders by the marshal, though it would have
been equally efficacious if served by someone else. It
did not issue out of the court, did not bear the court
seal, and was not signed by the clerk. Upon the return
clay of the motion the objection was made in behalf of
the petitioners that the "process" was unavailing to
bring them into court. The objection wai overriled
and later, after trial, a judgment on the merits weijt in
favor of the receiver. Upon appeil to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the judgment was affirmed.
81 F. (2d) 120. To set at rest a controversy as to an
important question of procedure, this Court granted certiorari "limited to the question of the jurisdiction of the
District Court."

Opinion of the Court.

The remedy by notice of motion in. Virginia is governed
by § 6046 of the Virginia Code. "Any person entitled to
maintain an action at law may, in lieu of such action at
law, proceed by motion." The remedy is an ancient one.
It goes back to 1732, though at first it was limited tog
claim6 for public moneys payable by sheriffs. Acts of'
May, 1732, c. 10, § 8, 4 Va. Stat. (Hening) 352. Gradually it was extended to 6ther situations. As early as
1849 it was made applicable to claims on contract generally. Virginia Code (1849), c. 167, § 5. From contracts
it spread to torts (Virginia Acts [1912] 15), and to statutory penalties. Ibid. 651. A revision of the Code in
1919 made the remedy even broader. Virginia Code,
1919, § 6046. The history of the development has been
traced with painstaking precision by students of procedure.1
There is trustworthy evidence that in the practice of
the Virginia courts the remedy by motion has almost
superseded the common law forms of action.2, Even in
the federal courts held in the same territory the new procedure has succeeded to a large extent in crowding out the
old. An opinion of a federal District Judge (McDowell,
J.), announced in 1904, shows the remedy by motion then;
accepted by the bar.-. Leas & McVitty v. Merriman, 132
Fed. 510. About thirty years later (January, 1935), the
Court of Appeals for the fourth circuit with supervisory
powers over courts in the same area made a study of the

intermediate growth. By that time it appeared that the
procedure by notice of motion was followed in ninety-five
per cent. of the common law actions begun in a federal
court at Richmond, thirty-three-and-a-third per cent. of
those begun at Norfolk, and fourteen per cent. of those
begun at Alexandria. Eley v. Gamble, 75 F. (2d) 171,
173.
Under the Conformity Act (R. S. § 914; 28 U. S. C.
§ 724), "The practice, pleadings, and forms and modes
of proceeding in civil causes, other than equity and
admiralty causes, in the district courts, shall conform, as
near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and
modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes
in the courts of record. of the State within which such
district courts are held, any rule of court to the contrary
notwithstanding." How a suit shall be begun, whether
by writ or by informal notice, is a question of the practice of the state or of its forms and modes of proceeding.
Amy v. Watertoum, No. 1, 130 U. S. 301, 304. The Constitution of the United States does not attempt to make
a choice between one method and another, provided only
that the method employed "gives reasonable notice and
affords fair. opportunity -to be heard before. the issues are
determined." Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Iowa, 160 U. S.
389, 393. The remedy by notice of motion has had repeated approval by the highest court of Virginia. Virginia Hot Springs Co. v. Schreck, 131 Va. 581; 109 S. E.
595; Security Loan & Trust Co. v. Fields, 110 Va. 827;
67 S. E. 342; Drew v. Anderson, (1797) 1 Call 51, 53.
It is here sought to be applied, not in equity or admiralty
(Coffey v. United States, 117 U. S. 233), but in a common law cause, a quasi-contractual obligation being the
source of liability. Shriver v. Woodbine Bank, 285 U. S.

eral court, adhering to-the Conformity Act, must follow
the local practice, unless some other act of Congress, creating an exception to the general duty of conformity,
has declared a special rule. Ex parte Fisk, 113 U. S.713;
Whitford v. Clark County, 119 U. S. 522; Southern
Pacific Co. v. Denton, 146 U. S. 202, 209.
Petitioners profess to find the necessary exception in
§ 911 of the Revised Statutes (28 U. S. C. § 721),
which provides: "All writs and processes issuing from
the courts of the United States shall be under the seal
of the court from which they issue, and shall be signed
by the clerk thereof. Those issuing from the Supreme
Court shall bear teste of the Chief Justice of the United
States, or, when that office is vacant, of the associate
justice next in precedence, and those issuing from a district court shall bear teste of the judge, or, when that
office is vacant, of the clerk thereof." We do not essay
a definition of the word process in every context. It
may take on varying shades of meaning in varying surroundings. For present purposes it is enough to say that
a notice of motion,. if process at all, is not process issuing
from a court, and assuredly is not a writ.' Only writs or
processes so issuing are governed by the statute. This
is the view expressed more than thirty years ago by
Judge McDowell in two cases (Leas & McVitty v. Merriman, supra, and Schofield v. Palmer, 134 Fed. 753),
which did much, we may be confident, to guide the conduct of the federal bar in adhering to the Virginia practice. It is the view expressed by Judge (later Mr. Justice) Sanford in the District Court of Tennessee. "In
any proceeding which may be properly instituted and
proceeded with upon mere notice to the parties in inter'Pollock & Maitland, History of English Law, 2nd ed., -vol. I,

est, without process from the court itself, the requirements of section 911 have no application." In re Condemnation Suits by United States, 234 Fed. 443, 445.
It is the view accepted by the Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit in Eley v. Gamble, supra, and again in
the case at hand. Cf. Wile v. Cohn, 63 Fed. 759.
There is instruction also in many state decisions dealing with cognate questions. The Constitution of Virginia prescribes (§ 106) that "writs shall run in the name
of the 'Commonwealth of Virginia,' and be attested by
the clerks of the several courts." The Virginia courts
have perceived nothing in that mandate at war with the
validity of a summary notice of motion signed and issued
by the parties. Whitley v. Booker Brick Co., 113 Va.
434, 436; 74 S. E. 160; Kain v. Ashworth, 119 Va. 605;
89 S.E. 857; Mankin v. Aldridge, 127 Va. 761, 767; 105
S. E. 459; Wood v. Kane, 143 Va. 281; 129 S. E. 327.
In many other states constitutional or statutory provisions as to the form of writs and other "process" have
received a like construction. People v. Lee, 72 Colo. 598;
213 Pac. 583; Gilmer v. Bird, 15 Fla. 410; Curry v. Hinman, 11 Ill. 420, 424; McKenna v. Cooper, 79 Kan. 847;
101 Pac. 662; Herndon v. Wakefield-Moore Realty Co.,
143 La. 724; 79 So. 318; Hanna v. Russell, 12 Minn. 80;
Dunlap v. Bull Head Oil Co., 167 Okla. 277; 29 P. (2d)
108; Bailey v. Williams, 6 Ore. 71; Whitney v. Blackburn, 17 -Ore. 564, 571; 21 Pac. 874; State v. Superior
Court, 142 Wash. 270; 253 Pac. 115; Porter v. Vandercook, 11 Wis. 70. The analogy is apt and the reasoning
persuasive.
Petitioners lean heavily upon early decisions in the
District and Circuit Courts for New York wherein-the
requirements of R. S. § 911 were held to be applicable
to the New York form of summons. Peaslee v. Haberstro, (1879) Fed. Cas. No. 10,884, 15 Blatchf. 472;

FOX v. CAPITAL CO.
Statement of the Case.

Dwight v. Merritt, (1880) 4 Fed. 614. In so far as these
decisions and others following them (United States v.
Mitchell, 223 Fed. 805) extend the rule of the statute
to notices or forms of process not issuing from a court,
they do not have our approval.
Petitioners suggest that the use of a notice of motion
as a substitute for a summons is forbidden by Rule 14
adopted by the District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia. The same objection was adequately answered in Eley v. Gamble, supra, pp. 173, 174. If the
rule has such a meaning it is inconsistent with the Conformity Act which governs practice in the district courts,
"any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding."
The judgment is
Affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 23. Argued October 16, 1936.-Decided November 9, 1936.
An order of the District Court, in New York, fining a judgment
debtor for contempt in failing to respond to a subpoena in sup-

plementary proceedings (Civ. Pr. Act, N. Y., § 774, as amended
by L. 1935, c. 630), the fine being imposed not by way of criminal
punishment but in aid of the judgment creditor, is not a final
order and is not appealable to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
P. 107.

85 F. (2d) 97, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 298 U. S. 649, to review a judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals dismissing an appeal for want of
jurisdiction.
