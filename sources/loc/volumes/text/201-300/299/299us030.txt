v. BEASLEY

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 30. Argued October 19, 1936.-Decided November 9, 1936.
By. a construction of the Seminole Agreement (Act of June 2, 1900)

descefit, without regard to whether heirs were Seminole citizens.

to the admission of Oklahoma to statehood. Surviving
him were his mother, brothers and sisters, enrolled as
Seminoles, and his wife and three children enrolled as
Creeks. In an action to quiet title the Supreme Court
of Oklahoma affirmed a judgment sustaining demurrers
to the petition. 175 Okl. 494; 53 P. (2d) 549. The Court
said [pp. 494-495]:
"For 25 years it has been the settled rule of law in this
State, in reliance upon which the stability and dependability of titles has depended, that the allotted land of a
Seminole Indian, who died (1) after selecting his allotment, and (2) before statehood, descended to his heirs,
in accordance with the Arkansas laws of descent and distribution, without regard to the above limitation to tribal
citizens. . . . There is some merit in the assertion of
plaintiffs in error that the first pronouncement of that
rule, in Bruner v. Sanders, 26 Old. 673, 110 P. 730, decided
in the year 1910, is dictum. Nevertheless, if it was dictum, it was repeatedly followed by subsequent decisions
of this court wherein it emerged from the realm of dictum
into the point actually decided. Those cases are HelikerJarvis Seminole Co. v. Lincoln, 33 Okl. 425, 126 P. 723,
Thorn v. Cone, 47 Old. 781, 150 P. 701, Rentie v. Rentie,
70 Old. 103, 172 P. 1083, Dickinson v. Abb, 73 Old. 322,
176 P. 523, Lasiter v. Ferguson, 79 Okl. 200, 192 P. 197,
and Stewart v. Billington, 122 Okl. 9, 250 P. 84."
In view of the long established rule in Oklahoma as to
the descent of the allotted land of a Seminole Indian who
died after selecting his allotment and before statehood,
the judgment is affirmed.
This decision is not to be construed as impairing the
authority of our earlier decisions under the agreements
made with other Indian tribes or under the Seminole
Agreement with respect to a Seminole who died before
selecting his allotment. See Washington v. Miller, 235
U. S. 422; McDougal v. McKay, 237 U. S. 372; Camp-
