MR. JUSTICE BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellees were indicted for violations of the Act of
May 21, 1928, 45 Stat. 685, 15 U. S. C. §§ 257-257i. In
No. 62, the indictment is in four counts, each of which
charges that defendants sold for fruits and vegetables twoquart metal hampers which did not comply with the
Act in that they were not of any standard size authorized
by the Act and did not come within any tolerance established by the Secretary of Agriculture. In No. 63,
the indictment is in two counts. The first charges that
defendant manufactured two-quart metal hampers that
were not of any authorized size or within prescribed
tolerances, without having submitted dimension specifications to the Secretary. The second charges sale of them.
In each case, the aecused demurred upon the ground that
the facts alleged are not sufficient to constitute a violation of the Act. The court sustained the demurrers and
discharged the defendants. The United States appealed.
1$ U. S. C., § 682.
Section 1 of the Act declares: "That the standard
hampers . . . for fruits and vegetables shall be of the
following capacities," and specifies nine sizes based upon
a bushel of 2150.42 cubic inches. The sizes so defined are
one-eighth, one-fourth, one-half, five-eighths, threefourths, one bushel, one and one-fourth, one and oe-half,
and two bushels. Computed according to the standard

Opinion of the Court.

fixed, the capacity of a two-quart hamper is 134.4 cubic
inches. Section 3 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to
prescribe such tolerances as he may find necessary to allow in the capacities set forth in § 1. Section 4 commands: "That no manufacturer shall manufacture hampers . . . unless the dimension specifications . . . shall

have been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of
Agriculture, who is hereby directed to approve such specifications if he finds that hampers . . . made in accordance therewith would not be deceptive in appearance and
would comply with" section 1. Section 5 makes it "unlawful to manufacture for sale . . . [or] to sell...
hampers . . .for fruits or vegetables . . . that do not
comply with this Act . . ." Anyone "that violates this
section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500."
The question is whether the provisions of the Act are
effective to make the manufacture or sale of two-quart
hampers punishable as a crime. The nine sizes standardized in § 1 are the only ones within § 4. The Secretary
was not authorized by § 3 to prescribe tolerances in respect of two-quart hampers, and has not attempted to
do so. The indictments must be construed to charge
merely manufacture and sale of hampers each of capacity
of two quarts, one-sixteenth of a bushel, 134.4 cubic
inches. They do not charge that any such hamper purported to be of any size defined by § 1, or was in any respect likely to deceive. It follows that, unless the clause
of § 5 which forbids manufacture or sale of containers
"that do not comply with this Act" makes criminal the
manufacture or sale of two-quart hampers, the facts alleged do not constitute any offense.
Statutes creating crimes are to be strictly construed in
favor of the accused; they may not be held to extend to
cases not covered by the words used. United States v.

Opinion of the Court.

299 U. S.

Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95. Fasulo V. United States, 272
U. S. 620, 628. The clause just quoted is crucial; its
words are plain and, having regard to the connection in
which they are used, must be given the meaning naturally
attributable to them. It is obvious that they do not extend to hampers other than the nine classes defined in
§ 1. The Act applies to none of capacity less than four
quarts. Pacific States Box Co. v. White, 296 U. S. 176,
183. It expresses no condemnation of two-quart hampers. Before one may be punished, it must appear that
his case is plainly within the statute; there are no constructive offenses. Unitdd States v. Lacher, 134 U. S.
624, 628. United States v. Chase, 135 U. S. 255, 261.
Fasulo v. United States, supra, 629. As in absence of
governmental regulation the making and selling of containers is untrammeled, failure expressly to permit is not
to prohibit. Mere standardization of a bushel container
at 2150.42 cubic inches would not make criminal the
manufacture or sale of a half-bushel container having
capacity of 1075.21 cubic inches. The prescribing of
capacities of containers described in § 1 does not prohibit
manufacture or sale of the two-quart hampers described
in these indictments.
The judgments sustaining the demurrers and discharging the accused must be
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE took no part in the consideration or
decision of these cases.
