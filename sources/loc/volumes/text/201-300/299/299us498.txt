UNITED STATES v. HUDSON.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 97.

Argued November 17, 18, 1936.-Decided January 11, 1937.

The Silver Purchase Act of June 19, 1934, imposed on transfers of
any interest in silver bullion a tax of 50%7o of the profits over cost
and allowed expenses, payable as to future transfers by attaching
stamps to the memoranda of sale. Transfers made on or after
May 15, 1934, and prior to the date of the Act were also subjected
to the tax, payable, however, in a different way. Held:
1. That the tax is a special income tax. P. 500.
2. Congress had power to impose this tax in addition to the tax
imposed on the same profits, with other gains, under the general
income tax law. Id.
3. Making the tax provision retroactive for a pcriod of 35 days,
to include profits from transactions consummated while the statute
was in course of enactment, was consistent with due process.

below.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
Respondent bought on May 3 and sold on May 23 and
29, all in '1934, certain futures contracts for the delivery
of 500,000 ounces of silver, and realized therefrom, after
deducting allowed expenses, a profit of $8,621.96. He paid
a tax of 50% of this profit in obedience to the taxing
provision of the Silver Purchase Act of June 19, 1934,'
duly but unsuccessfully sought to have the amount of the
tax refunded, and then brought suit in the Court of
Claims to recover the same. The court held the tax invalid, as retroactively applied to respondent's sales, andgave judgment accordingly." 12.F. Supp. 620; 13 F. Supp.
640. The case is here on certiorari.
The Silver Purchase Act, in ยง 8, imposes on all transfers of any interest in silver bullion, where the price for
which such interest is transferred exceeds the total cost
and allowed expenses, a tax of 50 per centum of such
excess, and requires that the tax be paid by affixing to a
memorandum of the sale lawful stamps in the amount
of the tax. The section further provides that the tax,
besides reaching transfers thereafter made, shall be ap
plicable to transfers made on or after May 15, 1934, and
prior to the date of the act, with*the qualification that

as to such prior transfers the tax shall be paid in such
manner and at such time as the Commissioner, with the
approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may by regulation prescribe.
The question presented for decision is whether, ii? view
of the restraints of the due process of law clause of the
Constitution,2 the retroactive provision under which the
tax was exacted from the respondent is an admissible
exertion of the power to tax.
Examination of the taxing provision and of pertinent
decisions shows, as we think, that the answer must be in
the affirmative.
The taxing provision does not impose a tax in respect
of all transfers, but only in respect of such as yield a profit
over cost and allowed expenses. If there be no profit
there is to be no tax. If there be a profit the tax is to be
50% of it. Thus a profit is made the occasion for the tax
and also the measure of it. Because of this, counsel for
the Government contend that the tax is a special incomc
tax; and we think the contention is sound.
It is not material that such profit is taxed, along with
other gains, under the general income tax law, for Congress has power to impose an increased or additional tax
if satisfied there is need therefor. Patton v. Brady, 1S4
U. S. 608, 620-622.
As respects income tax statutes it long has been the
practice of Congress to make them retroactive for relatively short periods so as to include profits from transactions consummated while the statute was in process of
enactment, or within so much of the calendar year as
preceded the enactment; and repeated decisions of this
Court have recognized this practice and sustained it as
consistent with the due process of law clause of the Constitution. Stockdale v. Insurance Cos., 20 Wall. 323, 331,
'The Fifth Amendment contains the due process of law clause
auDlicable to the United States.

Opinion of the Court.

332, 341; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R: Co., 240 U. S. 1,
20; Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S. 339, 343; Cooper v.
United States, 280 U. S. 409, 411. And see Milliken v.
United States, 283 U. S. 15, 21. The cases on which the
Court of Claims partly rested its decision were both examined and distinguished in Cooper v. United States and
Milliken v. United States.
The period of retroactivity prescribed for this taxing
provision reaches backward from June 19, 1934, the date of
the act, to and including May 15, 1934,-35 days. For
some months prior to this period there was strong pressure
for legislation requiring increased acquisition and use of
silver by the Government, and several bills providing
therefor were presented in the Senate and House of Representatives. On .May 22 the President sent to Congress
a message' recommending legislation for increasing the
amount of silver in our monetary stocks and further recommending the imposition of a tax of at least 50% on profits
accruing from private dealing in silver. The bill which
became the Silver Purchase Act was introduced May 23 in
response to this message. In these circumstances we think
the period of retroactivity fixed in the act is not unreasonable, but consistent with the practice sustained by this
Court in the cases already cited.
It results that the Court of Claims erred in holding the
retroactive provision invalid as applied to respondent's
sales.
Judgment reversed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
