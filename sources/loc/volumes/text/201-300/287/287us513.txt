Syllabus.

Si ce the court below" construed the act of 1923, with-.
out regard to the act of 1929, as embracing the event
sought to be taxed, and since in that view the question of
contract impairment does not arise, we are bound by the
decision of that court as though the meaning as fixed by
the c6urt had been expressed in the statute itself in 'specific words. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Ol &
Refining Co., dnte, p. 358; Knights of Pythias v. Meyer,
265 U. S. 30, 32.
In that view the tax was imposed upon an event generated by the death .of the decedent. That such a tax
.does not conflict with any provision of the federal Constitution-is clearly stated by this court in Coolidge v. Long,
282 U .-S. 582, 596. There a similar tax was held bad
because the state statute imposing it was passed after
the creation of the trusts; but the court said: "Undoubtedly the State has power to lay such an excise upon property so passing after the taking effect of*the taxing Act."
While, strictly, that statement was not necessary to the
decision, we follow it as expressing the settled conviction
of this court, and, "so far as the- federal Constitutibn is
concerhed, sustain the validity of the act o* 1923 as construed by the state court.
Judgment affirmed.

July 16, 1930, petitioner claiming to be a creditor of
respondent in an amount exceeding $7,000 filed a petition
in bankruptcy against her in the United States district
court for Massachusetts. It is alleged that on March
18, 1930, she conveyed her property with intent to hinder,
delay and defraud her creditors including the petitioner
and that she was Insolvent. Respondent's answer denied that she committed the alleged act of bankruptcy
or was insolvent or that petitioner was a creditor or had
a provable claim against her. The court heard the case
on evidence taken by, and the report of, a special master,
made findings of fact and adjudged respondent a bank'See'Table of Cases Reported in this volume.

Opinion of the Court.

rupt. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 57 F. (2dy
829.
The substance of the findihgs, so far as 'material to our
decision, may be briefly stated:
Un'Ier date of April 18, 1927, one Mogliani as principal
and petitioner as surety executed 'a bond for $15,000 to'
the tieasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
to secure, among other things, the payment of any judgment that might be obtained in an action against the
princibal for injury resulting to any person by reason
of thd discharge of fireworks by him at a public exhibition. The bond was made and delivered pursuant to
Massachusetts G. L., 1921, c. 148, § 57 C, D. Acts, 1921,
c. 500. Petitioner became surety in accordance with. an
application executed by respondent and in reliance upon
her agreement, to indemnify it against every claim or
liability arising on the bond. The application and agreement were accompanied by a financial statement made
by her showing that in addition to considerable cash she
owned several pieces of real estate worth much more
than the amount of the bond. 'September 26, 1927, one
Beatrice Ricci was injured by fireworks discharged at
a public exhibition under the direction of Mlogliani. She
sued him for damages and, March 4, 1930, got a verdict
for $10,000. March 18 respondent conveyed all her
real estate to one Muollo, and. on the same day he mort-•
gaged a part of it and quit-claimed all to her husband
to be held by the latter in trust for the benefit of their
chfldren. These conveyances covered -all respondent's
property and were made without consideration and with
specific intent on her part to hinder, delay anid defraud
the petitioner, her only creditor. The verdict having
been reduced, judgment was entered April 10, 1930, in
favor of' Ricci and against Mogliani for $6,650.48. Unable to collect from him, she demanded payment from

petitioner. And April 18, 1930, conformably to the statiite a,-suit. on the bond was brought against petitioner
to recover for her the amount of the judgment. Some.
time before it filed the petition in bankruptcy petitioner
paid to her attorney the sum claimed and judgment was
entered against it for that amount.
The Circuit Cotirt of Appeals sustained respondent's
contention that, to constitute an act of bankruptcy,- a
fraudUlent transfer must hinder, delay or defraud a creditor holding a claim provable at the time of such' conveyance, and held that petitioner's claim against respondent was contingent and not provable until the entry of
the judgment "igainst Mogliani, and that theirefore respondent committed no act of bankruptcy. And it directed the district court to dismiss the petition.'
Unless required by the Act, the meaning of the word
creditors" as.used in § 3a (1) is not to be restricted to
those-whose claims are provable at the time of the fraudulent
conveyance.
. Section
1 declares; "The words and phrasesused in
this Act and in proceedings pursuant hereto shall, unless
the same be inconsistent with the context, be construed
as follows: ....
(9) 'creditor,' shall include anyone who
owns a demand or claim provable in bankruptcy, and may
include his duly authorized agent, attorney, oi proxy."
. 11 U. S. C., § 1. And .§ 3a contains the following: "Acts
of bankruptcy by a person shall consist of his having (1)
conveyed, transferred, concealed, or removed, or permitted
'to be concealed or removed, any part of his property with
intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, or any of
them.". 11 U. S. C., § 21a. TIhe decision below shows
that at common law the word "creditors" has. a broader
meaning. But-the court construed the defiriition of credit6r, § 1 (9), to be comprehensive and the word "include".
to be one of limitation, the equivalent of "include only,"
and to exclude every person not having a. demand pres-

Opinion of the Court.

ently provable. Its ruling that respondent's transfer of
her property to defraud petitioner was not an act of bankruptcy rests upon that construction.
In definitive provisions of statutes and other writings,
"include ' is frequently, if not generally, used as a word
of extension or enlargement rather than as one of limitation or enumeration. Fraserv. Bentel, 161 Cal. 390, 394;
119 Pac. 509. People ez rel. Estate of Woolworth v. State
Tax Commn., 200 App. Div. 287, 289; 192 N. Y. S. 772.

Calhoun v. Memphis & P..R. Co., Fed. Cas. No. 2,309.
Cooper v. Stinson, 5 Minn. 522. Subject to the effect
properly to be given to context, § 1 prescribes the constructions to be put upon various words and phrases used
in the Act. Some of the definitive clauses commence with
"shall include," others with "shall mean." The former
is used in eighteen instances and the latter in nine instances, and in two both areused. When the section as a
whole is regarded, it is evident that these verbs are not
used synonymously or loosely but with discrimination and
a purpose to give to each a meaning not attributable to
the other. It is obvious that, in some instances at least,
"shall include" is used without implication that any exclusion is intended. Subsections (6) and (7), in each of
which both verbs are employed, illustrate the use of " shall
meaii" to enumerate and restrict and of "shall include"
to enlarge and extend. Subsection (17) declares "oath"
shall include affirmation. Subsection (19) declares "persons" shall include corporations,, officers, partnerships,
and women. Men are not mentioned. In these instances
the verb is used to expand, not to restrict. It is plain
that "shall include" as used in subsection (9) when taken
in connection with other parts of the section cannot reasonably be read to be the equivalent of "shall mean " or
"shall include only."

There being nothing to indicate any other purpose,
Congress must be deemed to have intended that in § 3a
(1) "creditors" should be given the meaning usually
attributed to it when used in the common law definition of
fraudulent conveyances. See Coder v. Arts, 213 U. S. 223,
242. Lansing Boiler & Engine Works v. Ryerson, 128
Fed. 701, 703. Githens v. Shiffler, 112 Fed. 505. Under
the common law rule a creditor having only a contingent
claim, such as was that of the petitioner at the time respondent made the transfer in question, is protected
against fraudulent conveyance. And petitioner, from the
time that it became surety on Mogliani's bond, was entitled as a creditor under the agreement to invoke that
rule. Yeend v. Weeks, 104 Ala. 331, 341; 16 So. 165.

As the Circuit Court of Appeals, upon constructions of
§§ 1 (9) and 3a (1) which we hold erroneous, disposed of
the case without deciding other questions there raised, the
decree will be reversed and the case will be remanded to
that court for further consideration and proceedings in
harmony with this opinion.
