late to facts. which tend to show an unlawful situation
actually or probably existing at the moment. Section .11,
Espionage Act, declares that after ten days a warrant not
fully executed shall be void. That is the prescribed period during which the circumstances existing when it
issued can be supposed to continue.
Considering the whole statute, and especially the evident purpose of C6figress to protect against unnecessary
delays and uncertainties, I think no search warrant should
issue upon an affidavit more than ten days old. After
attaining that age statements therein cannot properly
indicate presently existing conditions. In practice the
contrary-view would permit results which the prescribed
ten days' limitation was intended to prevent. The disclosed unlawful situation is not presumed to continue
more than ten days after a wairant issues and it seems
entirely reasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend to sanction a less rigid limitation upon the supporting affidavit.
It follows that the Commissioner's warrant of July
twenty-seventh was invalid, even if it be assumed that
he then actually relied upon the original supporting affidavit dated three weeks earlier.

No. 378.

Argued November 15, 1932.-Decided December 5, 1932.

Defendant, while serving a prison sentence under one count of an
indictment and while at the same time on probation as to an
independent sentence imposed under another count, was guilty of
repeated abuses of a liberty to leave the jail, granted to him for
a particular purpose. Upon a summary hearing before the District Judge, the facts of these abuses were proved by witnesses

and admitted by the defendant. The order of probation bore the
express condition that the probationer should refrain from violations of law "and in all respects conduct himself as a law-abiding
citizen." Held, construing the Federal Probation Act:
1. Revocation of'the probation need not be preceded by specific
charges and a formal hearing thereon. P. 219.
2. A condition of the probation necessarily implied was that the
probationer should not be guilty of conduct inconsistent with
obedience to his prison sentence. P. 222,
3. Whether there should be a revocation was a matter within the
discretion of the District Judge. P. 223.
4. Revocation of the probation was not an abuse of discretion.

MRii. CBIEF JuSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of
the Court.
The Court granted certiorari to review the decision of
the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming an order revoking
probation. 59 F. (2d) 721. On a plea of guilty to three
counts of an indictment, petitioner was sentenced, on
May 4, 1931, on the first count to imprisonment for one
year, on the second count to pay a fine of $2,000, and on
the third count to imprisonment for five years. Execution
of the last-mentioned sentence was suspended and the
court granted probation upon the following terms,-"during such time as the defendant reports regularly

every three months in writing, beginning with this date,
to the federal probation officer of this court; during which
time he entirely'refrains from any violation of any law
with the possible exception of parking and traffic ordinances, and in all respects conducts himself as a lawabiding citizen. In case of the violation of the terms of
probation, the defendant will be brought before the court
and sentenced. Probation is granted for a period of five
years."
On January 21, 1932, while petitioner was serving his
sentence on the first count, he was brought before the
court, by its direction, for the purpose of investigating a
report that he had violated the terms of probation. After
a brief recess to permit the attendance of counsel for petitioner, the court held a summary hearing. A special agent
of the Department of Justice testified that the jail records,
a copy of which was produced, showed that on fifteen days
between May 10th and August 18th, 1931, petitioner had
been absent from the jail for long periods ranging from
nearly four hours to over twelve hours; that an order had
been made permitting him to visit a dentist for necessary
dental work, but that on August 18th the agent had found
petitioner at his home. Petitioner was examined on his
own behalf and from his cross-examination it appeared
that on one occasion, when the record showed that he had
been away from the jail from 10 a. m. until 9.06 p. m., he
had been at his home in the evening "listening to the
radio, something like that." H,-. was unable to say how
often he had gone to his horn when he was supposed to
be visiting the dentist; it -,as "quite a few times. Q.
Most of the time? A. Pretty near." He further testified: "Q. When you left the jail and didn't go to the
dentist's office, were you and Lessner [a deputy marshal]
riding around or were you at your house and would Lessner
ride around? Is that right? A. Yes." On redirect examination, petitioner added that when he was out he

asked to be taken home to get a change of clothes; that
usually each time he went to the house he went for a
change of linen.
After petitioner had testified, the court, denying the request of petitioner's counsel for an opportunity to present
further evidence, especially as to matters upon which the
court did not base its conclusion, revoked the probation
order. The court said that "there is enough obviously
before this court to show that the spirit of the probation
was not in any sense complied with." The Circuit Court
of Appeals, reviewing petitioner's testimony at length,
sustained the order as based not upon "a technical escape,
but upon the fact that the appellant had not acted in.good
faith in carrying out the order of the trial judge, but, on
the contrary, had taken advantage of a general permit to
carry out his own purposes quite independently of the
basis and theory upon which the order was given." 59 F.

First. Petitioner objects to the summary character of
the proceeding. He urges that he was entitled to previous
notice of specific charges of violation of the terms of probation and to a hearing upon such charges according to the
established rules of judicial procedure. As opposed to
the action sanctioned below he invokes principles announced in Hollandsworthv. United States (C. C. A. 4th),

dealing with procedure under state probation laws. See

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

The Federal Probation Act (March 4, 1925, c. 521, 43
Stat. 1259; U. S. C., Tit. 18, §§ 724-727), confers an
authority commensurate with its object. It was designed
to provide a period of grace in order to aid the rehabilitation of a penitent offender; to take advantage of an opportunity for reformation which actual service of the suspended sentence might make less probable. United
States v. Murray, 275 U. S. 347, 357, 358; I. R. Rep. No.
423, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. Probation is thus conferred
as a privilege and cannot be demanded as a right. It is
a, matter of favor, not of contract. There is no requirement that it must be granted on a specified showing. The
defendant stands convicted; he faces punishment and
cannot insist on terms or strike a bargain. To accomplish
the purpose of the statute, an exceptional degree of flexibility in administration is essenitial. It is necessary to
individualize each case, to give that careful, humane and
comprehensive consideration to the particular situation
of each offender which would be possible only in the exercise of a broad discretion. The provisions of the Act are
adapted to this end. It authorizes courts of original
jurisdiction, when.satisfied "that the ends of justice and
the best interests of the public, as well as the defendant,
will be subserved," to suspend the imposition or execution
of sentence and "to place the defendant upon probation

Opinion of the Court.

for such period and upon such terms and conditions as
they may deem best."
There is no suggestion in the statute that the scope of'
the discretion conferred for the purpose of making the
grant is narrowed in providing for its modification or revocation. The authority for the latter purpose immediately
follows that given for the former, and is in terms equally
broad. "The court may revoke or modify any condition
of probation, or may change the period of probation."
There are no limiting requirements as to the formulation
of charges, notice of charges, or manner of hearing or
determination. No criteria for modification or-revocation
are suggested which are in addition to, or different from,
*those which pertain to the original grant. The question
in both cases is whether the court is satisfied that its
action will subserve the ends of justice and the best
interests of both the public and the defendant. The only
limitation, and this applies to both the grant and any
modification of it, is that the total period of probation
shall not exceed five years. Act of March 4, 1925, § 1.
Such procedural provisions as the Act contains harmonize with the view that the continpance of the probation,
as well as the grant of it, rests in the court's discretion.
The probation officer, when directed by the court, must
report to the court with a statement of the conduct of the
probationer. "The court may thereupon discharge the
probationer from further supervision and may terminate
the proceedings against him, or may extend the probation, as shall seem advisable." Id., § 2. The broad authority of the court remains unimpaired. At any time
within the probation period, the probationer may be arrested, either with or without warrant, and thereupon he
"shall forthwith be taken before the court." Also, after
the probation period has expired, but within the maximum
period for which the defendant might originally have been
sentenced, the court may issue a warrant and cause the

defendant to be arrested and brought before it. "Thereupon the court may revoke the probation or the suspension of sentence, and may impose any sentence which
might originally have been imposed." Id.
The duty placed upon the probation officer to furnish
to each probationer under his supervision "a written
statement of the conditions of probation" and to "instruct him regarding the same" (id., § 4) cannot be
deemed to restrict the court's discretion in modifying the
terms of probation or in revoking it. The evident purpose is to give appropriate admonition to the probationer,
not to change his position from the possession of a privilege to the enjoyment of a right. He is still a person convicted of an offense, and the suspension of his sentence
remains within the control of the court. The continuance
of that control, apparent from the terms of the statute, is
essential to the accomplishment of its beneficent purpose,
as otherwise probation might be more reluctantly granted
or, when granted, might be made the occasion of delays
and obstruction which would bring reproach upon the administration of justice. See Campbell v. Aderhold, 36 F.
(2d) 366, 367; United States v. Mulligan, 48 F. (2d) 93,
94; Jianolb v. United States, 58 F. (2d) 115, 117; Commonwealth v. McGobern, 183 Mass. 238; 66 N. E. 805;
People ex rel. Pasco v. Trombly, 173 App. Div. (N. Y.)
497, 499; 160 N. Y. S. 67;- Richardson v. Commonwealth,
131 Va. 802, 810, 811; 109 S. E. 460; People v. Dudley,
173 Mich. 389, 392, 395; 138 N. W. 1044; People v.
Sanders, 64 Cal. App. 1; 220 Pac. 24.
The "question, then, in the case of, the revocation of
probation, is not one of formal procedure either with respect to notice or specification of charges or a trial upon
charges. The question is simply whether there has been
an abuse of discretion, and is to be determined in accordance with familiar principles governing the exercise of
judicial discretion. That exercise implies conscientious

judgment, not arbitrary action. The Styria, 186 U. S.
1, 9. It takes account of the law and the particular circumstances of the case and "is directed by the reason and
conscience of the judge to a just result." Langnes v.
Green, 282 U. S. 531, 541. While probation is a matter
of grace, the probationer is entitled -to fair treatment, and
is not to be made the victim'of whim or caprice.
Second. Applying these principles, it is apparent that
the instant case has the peculiar feature that the probationer was actually serving a jail sentence while on probation with respect to another sentence.. But, even in
jail, he was subj'ect to the conditions of the probation.
By its terms, he was to refrain from violation of law and
"in all respects conduct himself as a law-abiding citizen."
As, at the same time that the sentence in question was
suspended and probation was granted, he was committed
to jail upon a distinct sentence, there was also a condition
necessarily implied that he should not be guilty of conduct
inconsistent with obedience to that sentence. Abuse of
the liberty granted him to leave the jail for a particular
purpose, and absenting himself in the circumstances described in his testimony,-apart from the question of violation of law (see Act of May 14, 1930, c. 274, § 9, 46 Stat.
325, 327; U. S. C., Tit. 18, § 753h)-was clearly a breach
of that condition and the court was entitled to take note
of it.
There is, properly speaking, no question here of notice.
Defendant was brought before the court and questioned.
Defendant was not only heard but gave his testimony.
The inquiry related to his own conduct in connection with
his leaving the jail, ani the court could properly restrict
the examination to what was pertinent to that conduct
and could refuse to extend the inquiry to embrace ot- 3r
matters. The hearing was summary but it cannot be said
that it was improper or inadequate, in view of the nature
of the proceeding and of the particular point upon which

the court rested its decision. The court revoked the probation upon defendant's admissions of his dereliction and
it does not appear that there was an abuse of discretion.

1. The provision of the Revenue Act of 1924 for- including the
interest of a joint .tenant of property in computing transfer
taxes on his estate, is applicable to tenancies created before September 8, 1916, when .the first of the recent federal statutes providing for such taxation became effective. P. 226.
2. A state rule that the accrual of property resulting to one of
two joint tenants from the death of the other is not to be taxed
if not taxable under statutes in force when the tenancy was crez.
ated, could not limit the power of Congress in respect of federal
taxation. P. 227.
3.. Where by the state law (as in California) the rights of the
future survivor .of two joint tenants are not irrevocably fixed
at the creation. of the tenancy, but the joint estate may be
terminated ^by the voluntary conveyance of either tenant, or by
partition, or involuntary alienation under execution, a co-tenant's
death, by ending the right to effect such. changes, presents a
proper 'occasion for imposing a federal transfer tax under the
Act of 1924, p ssed before -the death, though after the creation
