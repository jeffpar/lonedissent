UNITED STATES v. GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 96.

Argued October 11, 1932.-Decided November 7, 1932.

1. A payment made by the Government to a Railroad Company
under the guaranty provision (§ 209) of the Transportation Act,
not in excess of the amount due as then found and certified by
the Interstate Commerce Commission, but an overpayment if
tested by the Commission's final computation of the guaranty,
five years later,7-hdd not recoverable by the United States as a
payment made by mistake of fact or in violation of law, the
discrepancy being attributable merely to the use of different
formulae for adjusting maintenance expense to fluctuations in cost
of labor and material, and the superiority of one method over
the other being a matter of opinion and not of mathematical
precision. Pp. 151, 152.
2. A certificate issued by the Commission under § 212 (a) of the
Transportation Act (added by amendment of Feb. 26, 1921,)
for an amount "definitely ascertained by it to be due" to
carrier under the guaranty of § 209, is not provisional and tentative; and the fact that the amount paid under such certificate
exceeds the Commission's subsequent and final certificate of the
amount guaranteed to the carrier does not entitle the United
States to a repayment of the excess. P. 153.
3. If the meaning of a statute be uncertain, recourse may be had
to its legislative history and to the statements by those in charge
of it during its consideration by Congress. P. 154.

Section 209 (g) was to. provide an ultimate determination of the amount of the guaranty, which would involve
much time and labor and would fix property rights of
carriers. Section 212 was an emergency measure, designed
to afford partial and speedy relief to the carriers, many
of which needed funds immediately in order to continue
operations. Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. Interstate Com,

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

MR. JusTIcE CARDOZo delivered the opinion of the Court.
The petitioner, the United States of America, has sued
to recover a payment made to the respondent, the Great
Northern Railway Company, by force of a certificate of
the Interstate Commerce Commission, the government asserting that the payment was excessive and that the certificate permitting it was the product of mistake. A
judgment of the District Court in favor of the respondent
was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. 57 F. (2d) 385. The case is here on
certiorari.
The respondent was a railroad under federal control
when control was relinquished by the government on
March 1, 1920. By the Transportation Act of that year
(41 Stat. 464, § 209; 49 U. S. C., § 77), it had the protection of a guaranty as to its railway operating income for
six months thereafter. The United States guaranteed
that during this guaranty period the income should be not
less than one-half of the annual compensation to which
the carrier was entitled during the period of federal control. United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., 280 U. S. 478;
Texas & Pacific.Ry. Co. v. United States, 286 U. S. 285;
ContinentalTie & Lumber Co. v. United States, 286 U. S.
290. Upon the Interstate Commerce Commission was
laid the duty of ascertaining the amounts necessary to
make good this guaranty and of certifying to the Secretary of the Treasury the results of the inquiry. Something more was required for this purpose than the mere
comparison of receipts and expenses during the period of
control with receipts and expenses during the six months
following. In the ascertainment of railway operating income, or any deficit therein, the amount to be included in
operating expenses for maintenance of way and structures,
or for maintenance of equipment, was to be fixed by the
Commission, and was not dependent solely on the action

Opinion of the Court.

of the carrier. For that purpose reference was to be had
to the tests prescribed by the standard form of contract
for federal control. Transportation Act, 1920, § 209f (3) ;
Federal Control Contract, § 5a. The Commission was to
take as its base the average six months' maintenance expenses of the carrier during the years characterized as
"the test period," i. e., the three years ending June 30,
1917. This amount -was to be readjusted, however, so as
to make allowance for changes in the extent of property
maintained, for. changes in the nature or intensity of the
use, and, most important, for changes in the cost of labor
and material. The end in view was-the arrival at a figure
that would permit the property to be kept'up in the same
state of reparation as at the time when the carrier's possession had been yielded to the government. The task
of the Commission was not exhausted, however, when it
ascertained the allowance to be made for the cost of maintenance. It was to require the restatement of other operating expenses in addition to -those for maintenance "to
the extent necessary to correct and exclude any disproportionate or unreasonable charge to such expenses" for the
guaranty period, or any charge "which under a proper
system of accounting is attributable to another period."
Transportation Act, § 209f (5).
A task so vast and intricate exacted time and study.
Many of the carriers, however, including this respondent,
were in urgent need of cash for pressing obligations.
The statute contained provisions that were intended to
relieve the pressure. By § 209 (h) the Commission was
empowered, upon application during the guaranty period,
to issue certificates for advance payments, such advances
to be not in excess of the "estimated amount" necessary
to make good the guaranty. The Secretary of the
Treasury was directed to make the advances in the
amounts specified in the certificate upon the execution
by the carrier of a contract., "secured in such manner as

the Secretary may determine," that upon final determination of the amount of the guaranty it would repay the
excess payment with interest, if excess there should be
found to be. Under the authority of that section, certificates in the amount of $6,500,000 were issued by the
Commission and collected by the carrier. The payments thus received were well within the limit of the
guaranty as finally determined and as to these no claim
for reimbursement is put forward by the government.
The relief permissible under § 209 (h) turned out to be
inadequate. It was limited to applications made before
the guaranty period had expired, to applications, that
is to say, before September 1, 1920. . In the case of the
respondent, as in that of other carriers, the guaranty
period expired with the Commission still unready to announce its. ultimate award, and with the pressure of the
need for intermediate relief as urgent as before. Accordingly, 'the Transportation Act, 1920, was amended
on .February 26, 1921, by authorizing the Commission,
if not at the time able finally to determine the whole
amount due, to make its certificate for any amount definitely ascertained by it to be due, and thereafter in the
same manner to make further certificates, until the whole
amount due had been certified. Act of February 26,
1921,'c. 72, 41 Stat. 1145, § 212; 49 U. S. C., § 79. The
text of the statute is .quoted in the margin.*
* "Sec. 212. (a) In making certifications under section 204 or section 209, the Commission, if not at the time able finally to determine
the whole amount due under such section to a carrier or the American
Raiway Express Company, may make its certificate for any amount
definitely ascertained by it to be due, and may thereafter in the ssae
manner make further certificates, until the whole amount due has
been certified. The authority of and direction to the Secretary of the
Treasury under such sections to draw warrants is hereby made applicable to each such certificate. Warrants drawn pursuant to this section, whether in partial payment or in final payment, shall be paid:

Opinion of the Court.

At the time of the enactment.of that section, the respondent had already filed with the Commission a
guaranty claim in the sum of $18,498,391.67, of which
$6,500,000 had already been paid through certificates
issued under § 209 (h), leaving a balance of $11,998,391.67
still claimed to be due. The respondent, in submitting
this claim, gave notice that it required a $6,000,000 advance to meet a pressing obligation, and asked for a certificate to that extent to be used as a basis for credit upon
an application for a bank loan. Such a certificate was
issued on February 23, 1921, though the Commission and
the carrier understood that under the statute then in
force it could not be made the basis for a payment by
the Secretary of the Treasury. Three days later § 212
was added to the Transportation Act, and the legal
aspect of the situation was at once transformed. At the
respondent's request, the Commission cancelled its advisory certificate of February 23, 1921, and on March
1, 1921, issued a new certificate under the authority of
the statute. "The Commission has ascertained and
hereby certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury that the
amount of six million dollars ($6,000,000) in addition to
deficit during the period of federal control, out of the appropriation
made by section 204; (2) if for a payment in respect to the guaranty
to a carrier other than the American Railway Express Company, out
of the appropriation made by subdivision (g) of section 209; and (3)'

if for a paynient in respect to the guaranty to the American Railway
Express Company, out of the appropriation made by the fifth para-

graph of subdivision (i) of section 209.

(b) In ap'ertaining the several amounts payable under either of
such sectiops, the Commission is authorized, in the case of deferred
debits and credits which can not at the time be definitely determined,
to make, whenever in its judgment practicable, a reasonable estimate
of the net effect of any such items, and, when agreed to by the carrier
or express company, to use such estimate as a definitely ascertained
amovnt in certifying amounts payable under either of such seciions,
and such estimates so agreed to shall be prima facie but not concfsive
evidence of their correctness in amount in final settlement."

150

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

any sum or sums heretofore certified in favor of the carrier under § 209 of the Transportation Act, 1920,
is necessary to make good to said carrier the guaranty
provided by the said section. The Commission hereby
certifies that such amount of six million dollars
($6,000,000) cannot be reduced-by further accounting or
otherwise," with which was coupled a statement that
additional amounts might be found to be owing on further investigation.
The respondent, armed with this certificate, procured
from the Treasury the $6,000,000 required for its present
needs. This amount added to the earlier payments of
$6,500,000, makes up a total of $12,500,000 collected on
account of its claim against the government. The total
was nearly $6,000,000 less than the amount claimed by
the respondent to be ultimately due. It was about
$3,200,000 less than the estimate of the final payment
submitted as a basis for the certificate in a report to the
Commission by the Bureau of Finance. Whatever the
final payment might afterwards be found to be, the sum
certified to be due left or seemed to leave a margin of
error ample enough for any change within the zone of
reasonable expectation.
The Commission, after satisfying thus the instant needs
of the respondent, continued the investigations necessary
to ascertain the final balance. Not till five years had
passed was it ready to announce its findings. In the
meantime it had filed a series of reports or decisions
defining or revising the principles and formulae that were
to govern it thereafter in the allowance or disallowance
of expenditures for maintenance. See, e. g., Maintenance
Expenses under § 209, 70 I. C. C. 115; In the matter of
Final Settlement under § 209 of the Transportation Act,
1920, 70 I. C. C. 711. By its final certificate issued on
June 8, 1926, under § 209 (g), it certified that the total
amount necessary to make good the guaranty was

U. S. v. GREAT NORTHERN RY.
144

Opinion of the Court.

$11,170,214.02, which was less by $1,320,786.98 than the
payments already made. Cf. Great Northern Ry. Co. v.
United States, 277 U. S. 172. For the recovery of the
difference with interest this action was brought.
We may assume in favor of the petitioner that a certificate issued by the Commission under § 212 of the
statute is open to impeachment for fraud or mistake, and
that payments burdened with those infirmities are subject
to be reclaimed. If this be assumed, it does not avail
without more to lay a duty of restitution upon the carrier
before us. Fraud in the making of the certificate is neither
proved nor even intimated. Mistake also there was none,
but merely a revision of judgment in respect of matters of
opinion. The respondent reported that it had paid out
for maintenance during the guaranty period $28,982,000.
There is no claim that this report was false even to a
penny. Readjustments were needed, however, as we have
already pointed out, whereby allowance might be made
for fluctuations in the cost of labor and material, as well
as for other economic changes, between the period of test
and the period of guaranty. The formulae for the readjustment of maintenance expenditures in use by the Commission on March 1, 1921, reduced the maintenance
allowance to $27,233,000, which was more than one and a
half million dollars less than the expenditures actually
made. The formulae in use on June 8, 1926, reduced the
allowance for maintenance to $23,815,000. In this last
reduction lies the explanation of the discrepancy between
the partial certificate and the final one. Neither set of
formulae is an expression of mathematical truth in such a
sense that accuracy may be affirmed of one and error of
the other. Each makes it necessary to multiply the expenses of the test period by a factor derived from an
imperfect and approximate estimate of a composite change
of prices. To- what extent the factor is an expression of
mere opinion is perceived when the process back of it is

considered. At the date of the partial certificate various
items of expense during the years of the test period-the
cost of locomotives, of cars, of tracks, and many others-were separat6ly considered, and the proper percentages of
increase during the period of the guaranty applied separately to each of them. At the date of the final certificate, the Commission determined to abandon these
refinements. It joined together all the property of all the
carriers in regional or territorial groups, and ascertained
the factor of increase for the members of a group collectively. By the use of this method, the test period expense
was to be "multiplied by a factor representing the increase
in the general level of cost of labor and material for the
territories in which the lines of railroad of the carrier
are situated." A general equation factor was substituted
for a series of factors separately computed and separately
applied. The result, as the Commission concedes in its
report, is at best an approximation representing an exercise of judgment as to the effect of a composite increase.
What is thus conceded in the report as to the source of the
discrepancy between the two certificates was confirmed
upon the trial by the testimony of a witness for the government. The difference, he tells us, " grew out of a
difference of opinion as to the method of calculation rather
than out of errors in the figures submitted." The Commission has not said that in any particular case the general
equation factor will yield results more accurate than those
attained by the method theretofore in use. It has claimed
no more for the new method than an enhancement of simplicity along with an approach to accuracy not inferior
to that of the method displaced.
In these circumtances we find no basis for a holding
that the payment made to the respondent under the partial certificate of March 1, 1921, was due to any mistake
of fact, either unilateral or mutual. .United States v.

Opinion of the Court.

105 U. S. 553, 557, 558. The officials of the government
knew precisely what they were doing, and kept well
within the statute defining their authority. 'They did not
act illegally like the officials whose acts were challenged

in the cases cited by the petitioner.

Wisconsin Central

R. Co. v. United States, 164 U. S. 190; Grand Trunk
Western Ry. Co. v. United States, 252 U. S. 112; Burnet v.
Porter, 283 U. S. 230. Charged with a difficult task
exacting judgment and discretion, they came to , decision in good faith with knowledge of the relevant facts
and without departure from the law. If the payment
under their certificate is to be reclaimed, some other
ground than mistake or illegality must be found to sustain
the reclamation.
Mistake and illegality being thus excluded from the
reckoning, we are brought to a second ground for reclamation put forward by the government. The argument
is made that by the true construction of the statute, a
certificate issued by the Commission under § 212 is provisional and tentative; that upon the issuing of a final
certificate of inconsistent tenor, it is superseded and nullified as to the past as well as to the future; and that payments made under its authority, though legal in the making, become illegal by retroaction. We do not so interpret the meaning of the statute. If all that the lawmakers had in view was to authorize mere advances on the
basis of an estimate, the carrier remaining bound to refund the excess in the event that the estimate was thereafter found to be too high, a suitable form vas at hand
in § 209 (h) for the expression of their purpose. All that
was necessary was to strike out the requirement that application must be made during the guaranty period, and
to provide that the promise of the carrier to refund might
be accepted without security. Section 209 (h), thus reframed, would have given expression with nicety to the
obligation which the respondent is said to have assumed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

But § 212,. as enacted, was drafted upon different lines.
By subdivision a of the section, the Commission, if unable
finally to determine the whole amount due, may make its
certificate for any amount definitely ascertained by it to
be due, with supplemental certificates from time to time
thereafter. No longer does the statute speak, as it had
spoken in § 209 (h), of "estimated amounts," and of contracts to refund any excess in the "advances." The
newly authorized certificates are to represent what has
been "definitely ascertained "; and moneys procured
thereby are characterized no longer as "advances," but as
partial or final payments. If, however, the meaning of
subdivision a could conceivably be doubtful when considered by itself, the doubt is removed'by subdivision b.
The lawmakers foresaw that there might be "deferred
debits and credits," such as uhsettled damage claims,
which could not be fully ascertained till a long time had
gone by. Accordingly, subdivision b provides that the
Commission shall be "authorized, in the case of deferred
debits and credits which cannot at the time be definitely
determined, to make, whenever in its judgment practicable, a reasonable estimate of the net effect of any such
items," the estimates so made to be "prima facie but not
conclusive evidence of their correctness in the event of
final settlement." The petitioners would have us hold
that subdivisions a and b, parts of a single section, mean
one and the same thing with all their differences of form.
The contrast between them is too pointed to permit us to
find identity of. thought lurking dormant and concealed
beneath this diversity of phrase.
Thus far we have not traveled, in our search for the
meaning of the lawmakers, beyond the borders of the
statute. In aid of the process of construction we are at
liberty, ff the meaning be uncertain, to have recourse to
the legislative history of the measure and the statements
by those in charge of it during its consideration by the

U. S. v. GREAT NORTHERN RY.
144

Opinion of the Court.

Congress. United States v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 278
U. S. 269, 278. If such recourse be had, there is confirmation of the view that the certificates were more than
estimates of provisional advances. Subdivisions a and b,
as originally introduced, drew no distinction as to the
effect of payments made thereunder, the certificates being
as conclusive under the one as under the other. A proposed amendment to modify subdivision b by making the
effect of such certificates prima facie, but not conclusive,
was carried. 60 Cong. Rec., pt. 3, pp. 2815, 2816. A
separate proposed amendment to modify subdivision a
in substantially the same way was rejected. 60 Cong.
Rec., pt. 3, pp. 2812, 2815. In the discussion of these
amendments, the inquiry was pressed whether the government would be helpless if the certificates were too
high. The answer was emphatic that the certificates were
final. 60 Cong. Rec., pt. 3, pp. 2739, 2802, 2803, 2809,
2812, 2813.
A word of answer is still due to the argument of the
government that the certificate is void because the work
of the commission was so hasty and imperfect as to involve an abdication of its statutory duty. Without probinj at this time the legal implications of this argument,
we find it without adequate basis in the -facts. Whatever basis it has is in the testimony of an accountant
in the service of the Commission. His conclusions are
contradicted by evidence, direct and circumstantial,
offered by the carrier, and contradicted also by the recitals of his superior's certificate. The record may permit
an inference that the whole amount owing in .order to
discharge the guaranty had not been so definitely determined as to make the Commission willing to recommend
a settlement in full, though even this may be uncertain.
It does not command a holding that the margin of error
was so inscrutable as to preclude the definitive approval
of a payment on account.
Affirmed.
