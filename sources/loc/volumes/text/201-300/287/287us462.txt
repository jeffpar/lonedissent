did not depend upon the determination of the liability of
the Government to contribute in general average. The
question of that liability could not be regarded as free
from doubt. The cargo underwriters had made claim for
contribution and the Judge Advocate General of the Army
had advised that the claim was valid. On receiving this
information, it was the duty of the officer responsible for
the operation of the vessel to prepare the general average
statement in order that the basis for adjustment might
be available. Ralli v. Troop, 157 U. S. 386, 400. That
duty, in this instance, apart from the question of the liability of the Government for general average as to which
it is not now necessary to express an opinion, lay with
the general superintendent and administrative officer of
the Army Transport Service, and in order that he might
properly perform it, he was entitled to avail himself of
the assistance of general average adjusters.

and Messrs. Sewall Key, J. Louis Monarch, and Erwin N.

MR. JUSTICE MOREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Petitioner, a Florida corporation, made and sold ice at
St. Petersburg. Substantially the same stockholders
owned the Citizens Ice and Cold Storage Company, engaged in like business at the same place. In February,
1926, Lewis, general manager of both companies, began
negotiations for the sale of their properties to the National
Public Service Corporation. Their directors and stockholders were anxious to sell, distribute the assets and dissolve the corporations. The prospective vendee desired
to acquire the properties of both companies, but not of
one without the other.
In October, 1926, agreement was reached and the vendor's directors again approved the plan for distribution and
dissolution. In November, 1926, petitioner and the National Corporation entered into a formal written contract
conditioned upon a like one by the Citizens Company.
This referred to petitioner as "vendor" and the National
Corporation as "purchaser." The former agreed to sell,

the latter to purchase the physical property, plants etc.,
"together with the goodwill of the business, free and clear
of all defects, liens, encumbrances, taxes and assessments
for the sum of $1,400,000, payable as hereinafter provided." The specified date and place for consummation
were eleven A. M., December 15, 1926, and 165 Broadway, New York City, when "the vendor shall deliver to
the purchaser instruments of conveyance and transfer by
general warranty in form satisfactory to the purchaser of

the vendor the sum of $400,000.00 in cash." The balance
of the purchase price ($1,000,000.00) shall be paid $500,000.00 on or before January 31, 1927; $250,000.00 on or
before March 1, 1927; $250,000.00 on or before April 1st,
1927. Also, the deferred installments of the purchase
price shall be evidenced by the purchaser's 6% notes,
secured either by notes or bonds of the Florida West Coast
Ice Company, thereafter to be organized to take title, or
other satisfactory collateral; or by 6% notes of such Florida company secured by first lien on the property conveyed, or other satisfactory collateral.
The vendor agreed to procure undertakings by E. T.
Lewis and Leon D. Lewis not to engage in manufacturing
or selling ice in Pinellas County, Florida, for ten years.
The $400,000 cash payment was necessary for discharge
of debts, liens, encumbrances, etc. The Florida Company,
incorporated December 6, 1926, took title to the property
and executed the purchase notes secured as agreed. These
were paid at or before maturity except the one for 8100,000, held until November, 1927, because of flaw in a title.
As the notes were paid petitioner immediately distributed
the proceeds to its stockholders according to the plan.
The property conveyed to the Florida Company included all of petitioner's assets except a few vacant lots
worth not more than $10,000, some accounts-3,000 face
value-also a small amount of cash. Assets, not exceed-

ing 1% of the whole, were transferred to the Citizens
Holding Corporation as trustee for petitioner's stockholders-99% of all vendor's property went to the Florida
Company. The plan of the whole arrangement as carried
out was accepted by petitioner's officers and stockholders
prior to November 4, 1926.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined
that the petitioner derived taxable gain exceeding $500,000
and assessed it accordingly under the Act of 1926. The
Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals
approved this action.
The facts are not in controversy. The gain is admitted;
but it is said this was definitely exempted from taxation
by ยง 203, Revenue Act of 1926.

The Florida West Coast Ice Company acquired substantially all of petitioner's property in exchange for cash and
securities which were promptly distributed to the latter's
stockholders. Consequently, under ยง 203, the admitted
gain was not taxable.
The Board of Tax Appeals held that the transaction in
question amounted to a sale of petitioner's property for
money and not an exchange for securities within the true
meaning of the statute. It, accordingly and as we think
properly, upheld the Commissioner's action.
The "vendor" agreed "to sell" and "the purchaser"
agreed "to purchase" certain described property for a
definite sum of money. Part of this sum was paid in
cash; for the balance the purchaser executed three promissory notes, secured by the deposit of mortgage bonds,
payable, with interest, in about forty-five, seventy-five,
and one hundred and five days, respectively. These
notes-mere evidence of obligation to pay the purchase
price--were not securities within the intendment of the
or 'securities in such corporation, and immediately after the exchange
such person or persons are in control of- the corporation; but in the
case of an exchange by two or more persons this paragraph shall
apply only if the amount of the stock and securities received by each
is substantially in proportion to his interest in the property prior
to the exchange.
(5) If property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in part,
theft or seizure, or an exercise of the power of requisition or condemnation, or the threat or imminence thereof) is. compuls6rily or
involuntarily converted into property similar or related in service
or use to the property so converted, or into money which is forthwith
in good faith, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with
the approval of the Secretary, expended in the acquisition of other
property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning such
other property, or in the establishment of a replacement fund, no
gain or loss shall be recognized. If any part of the money is not so
expended, the gain, if any, shall be recognized, but in an amount not
in excess of the money which is not so expended.

act and were properly regarded as the equivalent of cash.
It would require clear language to lead us to conclude
that Congress intended to grant exemption to one who
sells property and for the purchase price accepts wellsecured, short-term notes, (all payable within four
months), when another who makes a like sale and receives
cash certainly would be taxed. We can discover no good
basis in reason for the contrary view and its acceptance
would make evasion of taxation very easy. In substance
the petitioner sold for the equivalent of cash; the gain
must be recognized.
The court below held that the facts disclosed failed to
show a "reorganization"
within the statutory -definition. And, in the circumstances, we approve that conclusion. 'But the construction which the court seems to
have placed upon clause A, paragraph (h) (1), ยง 203, we
think is too narrow. It conflicts with established practise
of the tax officers and if passed without comment may
produce perplexity.
The court said--" It must be assumed that in adopting
paragraph (h) Congress intended to use the words
'merger' and 'consolidation' in their ordinary and
accepted meanings. Giving the matter in parenthesis the
most liberal construction, it is only when there is an
acquisition of substantially all the property of anothb.'.
corporation in connection with a. merger or consolidation
that a reorganization takes place. Clause (B) of the
paragraph removes any doubt as to the intention of Congress on this point."
The paragraph in question directs--"The term 'reorganization' means (A) a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total
number of shares of all other classes of stock of another
corporation, or substantially all the properties of another
corporation)." The words within the parenthesis may

not be disregarded. They expand the meaning of
"merger " or "consolidation" so as to include some
things which partake of the nature of a merger or consolidation but are beyond the ordinary and commonly
accepted meaning of those words--so as to embrace circumstances difficult to delimit but which in strictness
cannot be designated as either merger or consolidation.
But the mere purchase for money of the assets of one
Company by another is beyond the evident purpose of
the provision, and has no real semblance to a merger or
consolidation. Certainly, we think that to be within the
exemption the seller must acquire an interest in the
affairs of the purchasing company more definite than that
incident to ownership of its short-term purchase-money
notes. This general view is adopted and well sustained
in Cortland Specialty Co. v. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 60 F. (2d) 937, 939, 940. It harmonizes with
the underlying purpose of the provisions in respect of
exemptions and gives some effect to all the words
employed.
