BURNET v. COMMONWEALTH IMP. CO.

Syllabus.

The respondent was employed as an officer of the cor-"
poration; the business which he conducted for it was not
his own. There were other stockholders. And in no
sense can the corporation be regarded as his alter ego, or
agent, He treated it as a separate entity for taxation;
made his own personal return and claimed losses through
dealings with it. He was not regularly engaged in endorsing notes, or buying dnd selling corporate securities.
The unfortunate endorsements were no part of his ordinary business, but occasional transactions intended to
preserve the value of his investment in capital shares.
A corporation and its stockholders are generally to be
treated as separate entities. Only under exceptional circumstances-not present here-can the difference be disregarded.
Reversed.

considered below.

P. 418.

2. The taxpayer, a corporation wholly owned by the estate of a dece-

dent who had set it up and transferred securities to it as a medium
for avoiding multiljle death duties'and insuring the safety of a

charitable endowment, was assessed a deficiency in its return for
1920 on account of a gain arising out of an exchange of securities
between it and the estate. It contended that there could be no
true gain or loss in transactions between-it and the estate because

they were the same entity. Held: The record-fails to disclose circumstances sufficient to require disregard of the corporate form.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

CERTIORARI, 286 U. S. 541, to review a judgment reversing a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 20 B. T. A.
1189, determining a deficiency in income taxes. Cf. the
two cases next preceding.
Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Solicitor general Thacher, and Messrs. Whitney North
Seymour, Sewall Key, and John H. McEvers were on the
brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Schofield Andrews, with whom Mr. Ellis Ames
Ballard was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Respondent-Commonwealth Improvement Companyall of whose shares are owned by the Estate of P. A. B.
Widener (he died in 1915), made return concerning income and excess profits taxes for 1920 wherein it claimed
deduction for loss occasioned by transfer of BritishAmerican Tobacco Company stock to the Estate. The
Commissioner refused to allow the deduction and found
that rightly regarded the transaction had yielded gain to
tfie taxpayer. A deficiency assessment followed.
The Board of Tax Appeals approved the Commissioner's action; but the Circuit Court of Appeals, Third
Circuit, held otherwise. [57 F. (2d) 47.]
Haying acquired control of the Commonwealth improvement Company, incorporated under an old Pennsylvania charter, Mr. Widener caused an increase of its.
capital stock and authorization of $20,000,000 script and
debentures. He then-May 1, 1912-conveyed to the
corporation sundry stocks valued at $25,000,000 taking
in payment all its shares and $20,000,000 in debentures
and script. He was old and the double purpose was to
avoid multifold death duties or transfer taxes and to
insure the safety of an endowment which he wished to

Opinion of the Court.

donate to a. favorite charity--School for Crippled Children. $4,000,000 of the debentures so received were
promptly deposited in trust for the benefit of that School.
Among the securities transferred by Widener to respondent were 225,000 shares British-American Tobacco
Company. Their market value March 1, 1913, was
$5,315,625-$23.625 per share.
In 1919 the Improvement Company, under privilege
extended to stockholders, subscribed, for and received
75,000 new shares then issued by the British-American
Company. Paying therefor $326,437.50-$4.3525 per
share-much less than market value.
In 1920 the trustees of the Estate acquired the 4,000,000 of respondent's debentures theretofore deposited for
benefit of the School. These were transferred to respondent and in part payment it transferred to the
Estate the original block (the identical certificates) of
225,000 British-American Tobacco Company shares valued at $5,287,500--$23.50 per share. The apparent result was sale of the whole block at twelve and one-half
cents per share under the March 1, 1913, value with consequent net loss of $28,125.00. For this sum respondent
claimed deduction upon its 1920 tax retirn.
When the Commissioner audited the return he decided
that the base value per unit (for taxation purposes) of
the 225,000 shares British-American Tobacco Company,
transferred as shown, should be ascertained by adding to
their total market value March 1,. 1913-$5,315,625.00the total paid for the 75,000 shares acquired in 1919, $326,437.50 and dividing the resulting sum by 300,000. The
quotient, $18.806,875, he held was the base cost of each
transferred share. Accordingly, he found a gain by respondent of $1,055,953.12 and made an appropriate deficiency assessment.
In brief and argument here respondent advances two
points. First, it is said the Commissioner improperly

reckoned the base value of the British-American Tobacco
Company shares. Second, that under the peculiar facts
of the cause the transaction under consideration resulted
in no true loss or gain. Respondent was merely the
agency or instrumentality of the trustees of the Estate
in administering their trust. Practically considered, the
Improvement Company and the Estate are the same
entity.
. The Board of Tax Appeals expressed no opinion concerning the Commissioner's method of reckoning-it was
not requested so to do. There the respondent relied entirely upon the second point. The Circuit Court of Appeals ruled only on the same point. In such circumstances, we do not undertake to determine what was not
considered below.
Upon the second point we think the Board of Tax Appeals. reached the right conclusion; the judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed.
Among other things, the Board well said"The petitioner does not now argue before the board
that the method of computing the gain was incorrect, but
relies entirely upon its contention that the corporation
and the estate are the same entity. If this contention
were logically applied it would follow that all income received by the corporation since its organization was properly taxable as income of P. A. B. Widener and his estate
and should have been added to any other income which
Widener and'his estate received during these years and
taxed at the rates applicable to individuals rather than
returned by the petitioner and taxed at the rates fixed for
corporations. For the purposes of inheritance and transfer taxes imposed by the various States upon the transfer
of the stocks owned by petitioner, the corporate entity
should have been disregarded upon the death of Widener
and these stocks subjected to whatever taxes would have
been payable had they been owned by the decedent. But

Opinion of the Court.

petitioner does not seek to carry its contention -tosuch a
conclusion. Having enjoyed the benefits which resulted
from its separate existence, it seeks to perpetuate those
benefits and asks that the separate existence and tax
liability of the petitioner and its single stockholder be
overlooked only with respect to transactions which take
place between them. That this is an afterthought is
plainly evidenced by the action of petitioner in claiming
a deduction upon this same transaction when it believed
a deductible loss had been sustained.
"The fact is that petitioner did have a separate legal
existence with privileges and obligations entirely separate
from those of its stockholders. The fact that it had only
one stockholder seems of no legal significance. Cannon
Mfg. Co. v. Cudahy Co., 267 U. S. 333."
Counsel for respondent concede that ordinarily a corporation and its stockholders are separate entities,
whether the shares are divided among many or are owned
by one. Consequently, they make no effort to support
any general rule under which a corporation and its single
stockholder have such identity of interest that transactions between them must be disregarded for tax purposes.
They submit, however, the peculiar facts here disclosed
suffice to show there was really no income, nothing properly taxable as such. They refer to Southern Pacific Co.
v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330 and Gulf Oil Corp. v. Lewellyn,
24 U. S. 71, not as controlling but as instances where
the court looked through mere form and regarded substance.
While unusual cases may require disregard of corporate
form, we think the record here fails. to disclose any circumstances sufficient to support the petitioner's claim.
Certainly, the Improvement Company and the Estate
were separate and distinct entities; the former was avowedly utilized to bring about a change in ownership beneficial to the latter. For years they were recognized and

treated as different things and taxed accordingly upon
separate returns. The situation is not materially different from the not infrequent one-where a corporation is
controlled by a single stockholder. See Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 208, 209; Lynch v. Hornby, 247
U. S. 339,341; United States v. Phellis, 257 U. S. 156,
172, 173.
Southern Pacific Co.v. Lowe, supra, and Gulf Oil Corp.
v. Lewellyn, supra, (the latter covered in principle by the
first,) .cannot be regarded as laying down any general rule
authorizing disregard of corporate entity in respect of taxation. These cases presented peculiar situations and
were determined upon consideration of them. In the
former this court said [p. 338]--" The case turns upon
its very peculiar facts, and is distinguishable from others
in which the question of the identity of a controlling
stockholder with his corporation has been raised. Pdll
