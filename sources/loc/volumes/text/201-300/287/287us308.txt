what circumstances the application of the regulation may
fail to comply with. the- statute because the appraisals
which are made are extravagant or impossible. In the
case before us the accuracy of every estimate of the
Commissioner is unchallenged. It cannot be said that the
regulation, as applied here, was unauthorized by the
statute because inadequate for its purpose or inconvenient or unjust in its operation.
Finally, petitioner urges that as the Commissioner failed
to find the expected royalties to be received under the
lease, the court below should have exercised its discretion
to remand the case to the Board of Tax Appeals for a
rehearing. ยง 1003 (b), Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9,
'110. As we have said above, the record does not disclose
any facts froma which the expected royalties might be determined. Neither the petitioner nor the Commissioner
asked opportunity to supply such facts. It does not appear whether such an estimate could be made, or that, if
made, the sum of the bonus and expected royalties would
P.Xceed the petitioner's capital investment, returnable' by
depletion. Hence, no case was made calling for the court
below to exercise its discretion in petitioner's favor.,

lyties based on coal production, which were received by a lessor
of coal land in 1920-1926 under leases executed before the date of
the Sixteenth Amendment, held not converted capital taxable only
by apportionment, .but income taxable under the Revenue Act of

2. Section 234- (a) (9) of the Revenue Act of 1918, and regulations
thereunder, require depletion allowances upon bonus and royalty
payments received by the lessor of mineral lands, sufficient to provide for a return in full of invested capital; and these provisions
have been continued with the later Revenue Acts. Murphy Oil Co.

operators, by which the latter acquired the right to, enter
upon and use the lands for the production of coal and
coke for a specified period, in consideration of stipulated
royalties for the coal and coke produced, including minimum royalty payments in each year. In determining
petitioner's income and profits taxes for the years 1920
to 1926, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue treated
the royalty payments, after deducting a depletion allowance of 3.& per ton of coal mined, as taxable income of
petitioner, and assessed a corresponding increase in the
tax. On appeal this ruling of the Commissioner was sustained, both by the Board of'Tax Appeals, 18 B. T. A.
901, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 55
F. (2d) 626. We granted certiorari on a petition which
assails the judgment below on three grounds, which will
be separately considered.
First. It is insisted that no part of the royalties is taxable income of petitioner. Petitioner rests this content ion on what is stated to be a rule of law of West Virginia,
that under coal leases, like those presently involved, the
title to the coal, in place, passes to the lessee or operator
immediately on execution of the lease. From this it is
argued that the royalties received were but payments for
capital assets acquired and sold before the adoption of the
Sixteenth Amendment, and that their taxation as income
is nof authorized either by the statute or by the Sixteenth
Amendment, because not apportioned.
The question whether payments of bonus and royalties
from the lessee to the lessor of an oil lease are income
within the meaning of the Revenue laws taxing income, or
a return of capital as upon a sale of the oil, was recently
before this Court in Burnet v. Harmel, ante, p. 103. Although it was contended there, as it is here, that by state
law the titie to the mineral content of the leased land
passed to the lessee upon execution of the lease, it was

BANKERS COAL CO. v. BURNET.
308

311

Opinion of the Court.

held that this characterization of the transaction in the
local law did not affect the conclusion that the payments
were gross income subject to tax, after the deductions allowed by the taxing act. The considerations which led to
the conclusion that bonus and royalties paid to the lessor
of Texas oil lands are taxable income and not a conversion
of capital, as upon a sale of capital assets, are equally applicable to West Virginia coal leases, whether the title to
the coal in place passes to the lessee at the date of the
lease, or only upon severance by the lessee.
The applicable statutes thus construed and applied do
not tax any part of petitioner's capital investment before
March 1, 1913. Section 234 (a) (9) of the Revenue Act
of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1077, and regulations under it,
require depletion allowances upon bonus and royalty payments received by the lessor of mineral lands, sufficient to
provide for a return in full of his invested capital. The
provisions of that section, and the related Treasury Regulations have been continued with the later Revenue Acts,
see Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, decided this day, ante,
p. 299. The fact that the depletion allowance under the
Revenue Act of 1913 was more limited is not pertinent
h6re. Burnet v. Thompson Oil & Gas Co., 283 U. S.301.
Second. In a suit brought by the petitioner in the District Court for Northern West Virginia, Bankers Pocahontas Coal Co. v. White, Collector of Internal Revenue,
with respect to taxes for the years 1914 to 1919, it was
held that petitioner was entitled to a depletion allowance
on royalties received from the leases involved in the present suit, of 50 per ton of coal mined. It is insisted that
the decision in that case was res adjudicataof that issue,
and that in fixing the depletion allowance of the present
case at 3.60 per ton, the court below and. the Board of
Tax Appeals erroneously refused to follow the decision of
the District Court in the earlier case. With respect to

312

287 U.S.

this contention it is-sufficient to say that the suit in the
District Court was not against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the respondent here, but against the Collector, judgment against whom is not res adjudicata
against the Commissioner or the United States. Graham
& Foster v. Goodcell, 282 U. S. 409, 430; Sage v. United
States, 250 U. S. 33; see Smietanka v. IndianaSteel Co.,
257 U. S. 1; compare Union Trust Co. v. Wardell, 258
U. S. 537.
Third. After the Board of Tax Appeals had filed its
findings of fact and opinion, both respondent and petitioner submitted recomputations of the amount of the
deficiency under the Board's report, as provided by Rule
50 of the Board's Rules of Practice. In petitioner's recomputation, the claim was made for the first time that
the minimum royalty payments stipulated by the leases
had in some instances exceeded the amount of the per ton
royalty which would have been payable on actual production, and it was asked that the depletion allowance be
computed upon the basis of the actual payments made,
instead of upon the number of tons extracted. Petitioner,
at a hearing on the recomputation, tendered evidence in
support of this claim. The Board rejected the evidence
and denied petitioner's motion for a rehearing in order to
present this contention. The court below upheld 'this
action.
The Board is authorized to prescribe rules of practice
and procedure for the conduct of proceedings before it.
ยง 601, Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Sta t. 791, 871, 872,
amending ยง 907 (a), Revenue Act of 1924, as amended;
see Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals, 270 U. S. 117.
Rule 50 prescribes the procedure for computing the
amount of the deficiency after the Board has heard and
decided the issues raised and presented on the merits. In
terms, it directs that the hearing on the computation

Opinion of the Court.

which it authorizes is to be "confined strictly to the consideration of the correct computation of the deficiency or
overpayment resulting from the determination already
made, and no argument wil be heard upon or consideration given to... any new issues." The Board has held
that under the Rule new issues may not be raised and
urged on a hearing upon the computation. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Commissioner, 10 B. T. A. 1347, affirmed on
other issues 40 F. (2d) 372. The rule was a proper exercise of the power of the Board to prescribe the practice in
proceedings before it. See O'Meara v. Cominissioner, 34
F. (2d) 390, 395; Boggs & BuhI v. Commissioner, 34 F.
(2d) 859, 861; Metropolitan Business College v. Blair, 24
F. (2d) 176, 178; compare Sooy v. Commissioner, 40 F.
(2d)- 634.
The purpose of the tendered evidence was to bring the
case within the ruling of the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit affirmed in Murphy Oil Compahy v. Burnet,
supra, that bonus payments to the lessor of a mineral lease
are to be treated as advanced payments of royalties and
depletion allowed. This was a new issue. We need not
consider the contention of the government that it does not
clearly appear either that the stipulated miinimum payments exceeded the total per ton royalties upon the leases
or that, even if they did, the excess of the minimum royalties ovek the royalties computed on actual production
can, upon a proper construction of the leases, be; treated
as advance payment of the per ton royalties to accrue in
future years. It is not shown that the evidence tendered
was-not available to the petitioner in ample tinme to present it beforedthe Board had made and filed its findings
of fact and opinion. -Under the circumstances, we cannot say that the Board abused its discretion in denying a
rehearing.
Affrmed.
