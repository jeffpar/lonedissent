STAPF v. CORSI, COM-

MISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 10. Argued October 17, 1932.-Decided November 7, 1932."
An alien seaman who had entered the United States irregularly in
1923, but under the three year limitation of the Immigration Act
of 1917 was not subject to deportation, signed in 1929 as a member
of the crew of an American ship for a round-trip voyage to Germany.' Some time after his return he was arrested for deportation
as an alien who had remained here in violation of the Act of 1924.
Held:
1. Upon his return in 1929 the alien came from a place outside
the United States within the meaning of the immigration laws, and
his arrival was an entry into this country notwithstanding he was a
member of the crew of an American ship which had made a roundtrip voyage. P. 132.
2. That he entered without permission does not entitle him as
an alien seaman to more than the sixty days stay allowed by the
regulations. P. 132.
3. The statutory duty of the master to bring back to the United
States a seaman who signs for a round-trip voyage could not make
his entry in 1929 lawful nor confer on him the right to remain here
permanently. Pp. 132-133.
4. The fact that he could not have been deported at the time -he
signed for the round-trip voyage could not make his status upon

his return in 1929 that of an "immigrant previously lawfully admitted to-the United States, who is returning from a temporary
visit abroad" and thus a non-quota immigrant within § 4 of the
1924 Act, since he was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence in 1923. P. 133.

CERTiORAR, 285 U. S. 535, to review a judgment affirming a judgment which dismissed a writ of habeas corpus
to secure the release of an alien in deportation proceedings under the Immigration Act of 1924.
Mr. Leo Stapf submitted pro se.
Assistant Attorney General Rugg, with whom Solicitor
General Thacher, Assistant Attorney General Dodds,
and Messrs. Harry S. Ridgely, W. Marvin Smith, and
Albert E. Reitzel were on the brief, for respondent.
MR., JUsTIcE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
By writ of habeas corpus petitioner challenged the
legality of-his arrest for deportation as an alien alleged
to have remained in the United States in violation of
the terms of § 14 of the Immigration Act of 1924 (c. 190,
43 Stat., 153,162). That section provides:
"Any alien who at any time after entering the United
States is found . . . to have remained therein for a longer
time than permitted under this Act or regulations made
'thereunder,, shall be taken into custody and deported..
The undisputed facts are that petitioner, a German
citizen, deserted his ship, the Hansa, February 15, 1923,
in the port of New York, and remained in this country
until Mareh, 1929, when he signed as a member of the
crew of a vessel of United States registry, the America,
for a .voyage to Germany and return. This vessel stayed
-in Germany two and a half days; but it does not appear
whether petitioner went ashore. He arrived in the

Opinion of the Court.

United States on the return voyage in April, 1929, and
was discharged from the ship, but was not exaniined by
any immigration officer, nor did -he possess an immigration visa or pay a head tax. On March 20, 1931, while
working in Florida as a butcher, he was arrested on a
warrant charging that he had remained in the country
for a period longer than permitted by the Immigration
Act of 1924 and the regulations thereunder. After hearing, an order of deportation was made. On this showing
the District Court dismissed the writ and the Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed.
The entry in 1923 was irregular, and petitioner was'not
entitled to remain.' Under the statute then in force he
was subject to be deported; but such action could be taken
only within three years of his entry.' The Immigration
Act of 1924 did not alter the status of one who had unlawfully entered the country or remained after the passage
of the act of 1917,1 but abolished the three year -period of

Sec. 32 of the Act of February 5,1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874, 895,
then in force, but since repealed by the Immigration Act of 1924, provided: "That no alien excluded from admission into the United States
by any law ... and employed on board any vessek arriving in the
United States from any foreign port or place, shall be permitted to
land in the United States, except temporarily for medical treatment,
or pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor providing for the ultimate removal or deportation of such alien from the
United States, ... "
"See. 34 of the Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874, 896:
"That any alien seaman who shall land in a port of the United States
contrary to the provisions of this Act shall be deemed to be unlawfully
in the United States, and shall, at any time within three years thereafter, upon the warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into custody and brought before a board of special inquiry for examination
as to his qualifications for admission to the United States, and if not
admitted said alien seaman shall be deported..
"See. 20 (d) of the Immigration, Act of 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 153,
165: "Section 32 of the Immigration Act of 1917 is repealed, but shall
remain in force as to ... all seamen; arriving in the United States
prior to the enactment of this Act."

limitation only as to those entering after 1924. Section
14, quoted supra; Philippidesv. Day, 283 U. S. 48. The
petitioner was therefore entitled to invoke immunity under the act of 1917 unless he lost it by making the voyage
to Germany in 1929..
The question is whether by so doing he made a new
entry into the United States. which left him amenable to
the provisions of the act of 1924. The court below answered in the affirmative.' Other Circuit Courts of Appeals have held the contrary." In view of these conflicting decisions certiorari was granted.
The relator's arrival in the United States in April, 1929,
was an entry into this country notwithstanding he was a
member of the crew of an American ship which had made
a round-trip voyage. He came from a place outside the
United States, and from a foreign port or place, within the
meaning of the immigration laws; United States ex rel.
Claussen,v. Day, 279 U. S. 398. While that case construed
§ 19 of the act of February 5, 1917, and the time limitation on deportation therein contained, the decision as to
what constitutes an entry is equally conclusive in construing other sections of the immigration law.
That petitioner entered without permission does not entitle him as an alien seaman to more than sixty days' stay
in the *United States. His non-complisnce with the regulations respecting such seamen can not confer upon him
greater rights thaii if. he had satisfied their requirements.

of April, 1929, lawful. The argument, in substance based
upon the theory that an American vessel is American soil,
was effectively answered, as respects the, requirements of
the Immigration Acts, in the Claussew case, supra. 'Irrespective of any statutory duty to return the seaman to this
country, the petitioner's entry would have been lawful had
he complied with the provisions of statute and regulation
for temporary sojourn as an alien seaman. The obligation of the master to return him did not, as contended,
confer the right to remain here permanently.
If we are to disregard petitioner's status as an alien
seaman, the law required that he should have submitted
himself to inspection; should have produced an immigration visa, and paid a head tax, if as an immigrant he
desired to apply for citizenship.6 He did none of these
things, and in this aspect remained here in violation of
law.
The suggestion is made that since the relator could not
have been deported after the expiration of three years
from his original entry in 1923, his status when discharged
as one of the crew of the America in 1929 was that of an
"immigrant previously lawfully admitted to the United
States, who is returning from a temporary visit abroad,"
and thus he was a non-quota immigrant within § 4 of
the act of 1924." But he was not lawfully admitted for
permanent residence in 1923, and his stay here can not
be converted into such lawful residence by the .merefact
that the then applicable statute limited the time within
which deportation proceedings could be had. United
States ex rel. Georgas v. Day, 43 F. (2d) 917.
