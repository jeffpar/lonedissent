not be disregarded. They expand the meaning of
"merger " or "consolidation" so as to include some
things which partake of the nature of a merger or consolidation but are beyond the ordinary and commonly
accepted meaning of those words--so as to embrace circumstances difficult to delimit but which in strictness
cannot be designated as either merger or consolidation.
But the mere purchase for money of the assets of one
Company by another is beyond the evident purpose of
the provision, and has no real semblance to a merger or
consolidation. Certainly, we think that to be within the
exemption the seller must acquire an interest in the
affairs of the purchasing company more definite than that
incident to ownership of its short-term purchase-money
notes. This general view is adopted and well sustained
in Cortland Specialty Co. v. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 60 F. (2d) 937, 939, 940. It harmonizes with
the underlying purpose of the provisions in respect of
exemptions and gives some effect to all the words
employed.

UNITED STATES v. ARZNER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 191.

Argued December 13, 1932.-Decided January 9, 1933.

Where the holder of a lapsed policy of war-risk term insurance reinstates and converts his insurance into an ordinary life policy and
thereafter surrenders this policy upon payment of its cash surrender value, he is entitled, under ยง 307 of the World War Veterans'
Act of 1924, as amended by the Act of July 3, 1930, to recover
upon the original teiji policy for total and permanent disability occurring during the life of such policy, even though the converted

Chadwick was on the brief, for respondent.
IR. JusTIcE McRYNoLDs delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Respondent Arzner enlisted in the Army March 29,
1918, and was discharged January 16, 1919. While in the
service he took out a war-risk insurance policy for $10,000
on which premiums were paid through January, 1919.
The policy lapsed; but March 1, 1920, it was reinstated
and then converted into an ordinary life policy. Premiums upon the latter were paid through February, 1921.
The respondent then gave up $5,000 of it and received
the cash surrender value-$45.00; he surrendered the remaining $5,000 in December, 1921, and accepted the cash
value--18.30.
March 5, 1929, he began this proceeding in the United
States District Court. He alleged total disability, resulting from injuries received in battle, commencing in 1918,
anid gought recovery under his original war-risk insurance
policy of 191.-57.50 per month.
Upon properly framed issues the cause went to trial in
June, 1931. The jury found respondent's total and permanent disability commenced September 29, 1918, and
returned a verdict in his favor. An appropriate judgment

followed; the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit
affirmed.
Because of conflicting views in the Circuit Courts of
Appeals we granted certiorari.
Here, it is said that the court below erred in holding
that respondent was entitled to recover upon his original
policy, since at the time final judgment went down he
could not surrender the converted policy as required by
ยง 307, Amended World War Veterans' Act 1924; c. 320,
43 Stat. 607, 627; Act July 3, 1930, c. 849, 46 Stat. 991,
1001. The facts are not in dispute.
Prior to July, 1930, federal courts held divergent views
concerning the rights of veterans whose original term insurance policies had lapsed and thereafter had been reinstated or converted into some other form. Stevens v.
United States, 29 F. (2d) 904;" United States v. Buzard,
33 F. (2d) 883; United States v. Kusnierz, 33 F. (2d) 897;
United States v. Cross, 33 F. (2d) 887; United States v.
Allen, 33 F. (2d) 888. UnitedStates v. Barker,36 F. (2d)
556; Duggan v. United States, 36 F. (2d) 804; Franks v.
United States, 43 F. (2d) 455. United States v. Golden,
34 F. (2d) 367; United States v. Acker, 35 F. (2d) 646;
United States v. Schweppe, 38 F. (2d) 595; Woolfolk v.
United States, 44 F. (2d) 701; Crawford v. United States,
40 F. (2d) 199; United States v. Andrews, 43 F. (2d) 80.
With the evident purpose to accord liberal treatment to
those veterans who at any time had become entitled to
receive benefits under any insurance policy, Congress by
the Act of July 3, 1930, amended World War Veterans'
Act, supra,so as to read"All contracts or policies of -insurance heretofore or
hereafter issued, reinstated, or converted shall be incontestable from the date of issuance, reinstatement, or conversion, except for fraud, nonpayment of premiums, or on the
ground that the applicant was not a member of the miitary or naval forces of the United States, and subject to

Opinion of the Court.

the provisions of section 23; Provided, That the insured
under such contract or policy may, without prejudicing
his rights, elect to make claim to the bureau or to bring
suit under section 19 of this Act on any prior contract or
policy, and if found entitled thereto, shall, upon surrender
of any subsequent contract or policy, be entitled to payments under the prior contract or policy; Provided further, That this section shall be deemed to be effective as
of April 6, 1917, and applicable from that date to all
contracts or policies of insurance."
When the trial court rendered final judgment respondent had given up his converted policy and therefore
could not surrender it again. For petitioner it is said,
that being unable to comply with. the literal terms of
the 1930 amendment he could not recover under the
original (1918) policy. Also-" The Government, of
course, does not question the right of a veteran who has
converted his term insurance to sue on his prior policy,
even if hehas allowed the converted policy to lapse, provided he surrenders the converted policy." The suggested construction of the statute is too narrow. It would
deprive veterans of a right which we think Congress in-.
tended to confer. The probable reason for requiring surrender of the subsequent contract or policy was to prevent any further claim and thus silence controversy.
Undoubtedly, respondent became entitled in September, 1918, during the life of his 6riginal policy, to the
benefits therein provided. And we think Congress by the
Act of 1930 intended to permit him to assert the right
which then accrued. To deprive him of this simply because he could not actually surrender a writing already
delivered to the United States would defeat the generous
purpose behind the enactment.
True it is, respondent agreed to cancellation of his
converted policy and accepted the surrender value-a
portion of the money paid by him for premiums there-

on. But this action worked no material disadvantage
to the Government. Indeed the veteran made payments
when in fact entitled to receive monthly benefits for
total disability. If the converted policy had been allowed finally to lapse because of nonpayment of premiums, the agreement between the parties would have
been fully complied with. Nevertheless the proper admission is that under such circumstances there could
have been a recovery on the original policy, upon actual
surrender of the expired policy. The Gdvernment now
has possession of the cancelled converted policy and is
in no worse position than it would be in the supposed
circumstances.

CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 314. Argued November 8, 1932.-Decided January 9, 1933.
1. The Circuit Court of Appeals, its rules so providing, may notice a
plain error, though not assigned. P. 480.
2. Where the bill of exceptions recited that a motion for a new trial
had been made and overruled but omitted to state the ground of the
motion, held that the omission was not fatal to review, the ground
being otherwise manifested in the record. Id.
3. The rule that this Court will not review the action of a federal trial
court in granting or denying a motion for a new trial for error of
fact applies also to the Circuit Court of Appeals. P. 481.
4. Where the evidence in an action on a contract is such that the
plaintiff, if entitled to recover anything, is entitled to substantial
damages, but there are issues properly before the jury going to the
liability of the defendant, a verdict for the plaintiff limited to nominal damages and costs does not reveal on its face inconsistency with
the duty of the jury to assess damages; and where in such case the
trial court, without assigning reasons, refuses a new trial, its act can
not be held erroneous as a matter of law. P. 483.
