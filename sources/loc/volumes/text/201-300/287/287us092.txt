OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Syllabus.

287 U.S.

The assignments of error based upon the court's failure
to instruct the jury concerning contributory negligence
of plaintiff's teamster in accordance with defendant's requests present no question for decision here. The record
discloses no foundation for the claim that the refusal so
to charge was, as appellant asserts, "because of the statute." It does not appear that the trial court regarded
the statute as having any relation to the precaution or
care required of plaintiff's driver when approaching the
crossing. The claim that such refusals transgressed the
constitutional rule of equality is utterly without foundation.
No substantial constitutional question being presented,
the appeal will be dismissed. Wabash R. Co. v. Flannigan, 192 U. S. 29. Erie R. v. Solamon, 237 U. S. 427,

TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 14. Argued October 18, 1932.-Decided November 7, 1932.
1. Section 267 of the Judicial Code, providing that "suits in equity
shall not be sustained in afiy court of the United States in any
case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at
law," is declaratory of the rule followed by courts of equity and
should be liberally construed as serving to guard the right of trial
by jury'preserved by the Seventh Amendment. P.-94.
2. The question whether a case should be tried at law or in equity
depends upon the facts stated in the bill. P. 95.

Opinion of the Court.

3. A suit by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover preferential payments
of ascertained and definite amounts and in which the complaint

avers no facts that call for an accounting or other equitable relief,
should be tried at law. Id.
4. Defendants who answered a bill putting all its allegations in issue
including the allegation that plaintiff had no adequate remedy at
law, and who, after the case was advanced on the equity calendar
but before it was reached for trial, made their motion for a transfer
under the 22d Equity Rule, held not to have waived their right to
such transfer. Pp. 96-97.

CERTIORARI, 285 U. S. 536, to review the affirmance of
a decree in a suit by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover the
amount of payments made by a bankrupt which the bill
challenged as preferences.
Mr. Leo Guzik, with whom Mr. Horace London was on
the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. George C. Levin for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a suit in equity brought by respondent in the
district court for southern New York to recover from
Morris Schoenthal $500 and from Fannie Schoenthal
$1,000 paid them by the bankrupt. The bill alleged facts
sufficient to show that each of these payments operated
as a preference under ยง 60b of the Bankruptcy Act,
11 U. S.- C., ยง 96b, asserted that plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law, and prayed decree declaring the
payments preferential and directing defendants to account
for and pay to plaintiff the amounts so received with
interest and costs. October 27, 1930, defendants separately answered and put in issue all the allegations of
the bill.
The case was advanced to the February, 1931, calendar.
February 13, invoking Equity Rule 22, defendants, on
petition and notice of motion to be heard four days

later, applied for an order transferring the suit to the
law side of the court and for a trial by jury. On the
return day the application was referred to the judge
sitting in equity and was taken up February 24. After
hearing counsel, the court denied the motion and immediately proceeded to trial in equity. It heard evidence,
filed findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered
judgment that plaintiff recover from Morris Schoenthal $538.74 and from Fannie Schoenthal $1,075.84 and
.have executions therefor. The Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed.
The principal question is whether, assuming they made
timely'application under Rule 22, defendants were entitled to-have the suit tried at law.
Section 267 of the Judicial Code provides: "Suits in
equity shall not be sustained in -any court of the United
States in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete
remedy may be had at law." 28 U. S. C., ยง 384. That rule
has always been followed in courts of equity. The enactment gives it emphasis-and indicates legislative purpose
that it shall not be relaxed. New York Guaranty Co. v.
Memphis Water Co., 107 U. S. 205, 214. Matthews v.
Rodgers, 284 U. S. 521, 525. It serves to guard the right
of trial by jury preserved by the Seventh Amendment
and to that end it should be liberally construed. Cf. Ex
parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 101-103. In England, long prior
to the enactment of our first Judiciary Act, common law
actions of trover and money had and received were resorted to for the recovery of preferential payments by

part of the proceedings -inbankruptcy but concern controversies arising out of it. Taylor v. Voss, 271 U. S. 176,
182. They may be brought in the state courts as well as
in the bankruptcy courts. ColIett v. Adams, 249 U. S.
545, 549. The question whether remedy must be by action at law or may be pursued in equity notwithstanding
objection by defendant depends upon the facts stated in
the bill. And, in absence of a clear showing that a court
of law lacks capacity to give the relief which the allegations show plaintiff entitled to have, a suit in equity cannot be maintained. Boyce's Executors v. Grundy, 3 Pet.
210,215. Buzard v. Houston, 119 U. S. 347,352. United
)States v. Bitter Root Co., 200 U. S. 451, 472. The facts
here alleged give no support to plaintiff's assertion that
it has no adequate remedy at law. The preferences sued
for were money payments of ascertained and definite
amounts. The bill discloses no facts that call for an accounting or other equitable relief. It is clear that there
may be had at law "a remedy as practical and as efficient
to the ends of justice and its prompt administration, as
the remedy in equity." Boyce'g Executors v. Grundy, ubi
supra. The contention that ยง 267 prohibits the maintenance of this suit in equity is sustained in principle by
numerous decisions of this c6urt 2 And upon the very.
question here presented the weight of judicial opinion in
the lower federal courts' and in the state courts 4 is that
suits such as this cannot be sustained in equity.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

287 U.S.

Plaintiff insists that defendants waived their right to
have the stilt transferred to the law side.
Rule 22 declares: " If at any time it appear that a suit
commenced in equity should have been brought as an
action on the law side of the court, it shall be forthwith
transferred to the law side and be there proceeded with,
with only such alteration in the pleadings as shall be
essential." As plaintiff's bill shows that it had a plain,
adequate and complete remedy at law, defendants were
entitled upon proper application to have the suit transferred and. trial by jury. Undoubtedly they might have
waived that right. Reynes v. Dumont, 130 U. S. 354, 395.
American Mills Co. v,. American Surety Co., 260 U. S. 360,
363. But the record discloses no act or omission of theirs
at all inconsistent with their denial by answer of the assertion in the bill that plaintiff had no remedy at law or to

tried in equity. Their application was noticed to be
heard about a week before the case was reached for trial.
It is not shown that they delayed the hearing of the wotion. Presumably the matter was referred to the judge
sitting in equity to serve the convenience of the court.
The rile directs the transfer if "at any time" it shall
appear that the suit should have been brought as an
action at law. An application for transfer brought on
for hearing before the commencement of the trial is not
too late. Parkersonv. Borst, 251 Fed. 242, 245. Plaintiff's claim that defendants waived their right under the
rule is without merit.

F APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
E COUP
CuijUMBIA.

No. 22. Argued October 20, 1932.--Decided November 7, 1932.
Section 657 of the Code of the District of Columbia, as amended,
provides that each life insurance company doing business in the
District shall deliver with each policy issued by ii a copy of the
application made by the insured, so that the whole contract may
appear in the said application and policy, "in default of which no
defense shall be allowed to such policy on account of anything
contained in, or omitted from, such application." Held: That
where the policy declared that it constituted the entire agreement,
the fact that'no application was delivered with it did not preclude a defense based upon a provision- of the policy avoiding it
if the insured was not in sound health at the time of issue. P. 100.
