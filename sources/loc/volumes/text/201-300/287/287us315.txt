REICHELDERFER ET AL. v. QUINN ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE -COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA.
No. 9.

Argued October 17, 1932.-Decided December 5, 1932.

1. Under the Act of Congress authorizing the establishment of'Rock
Creek Park in the District of Columbia, the land$ taken for 'the
park by purchase and condemnation were "perpetually dedicated
and set apart as a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and
enjoyment of the people of the United States." By Act of a later
Congress, the Commissioners of the District were 'directed to erect
a fire engine house at a designated location in the park. Owners of
'neighboring land, claiming a right, in the nature of an easement,
to have the land used for park purposes and no other, sought to
enjoin the construction. Held:
(1) The neighboring landowners derived no rights against the
Government from the dedication of the park alone, since this constituted only a declaration of Dublic policy by the particular Congress, which was not binding on its successors. P. 318,
(2) Assuming that the building of the engine hoise was a diversion of the land from park uses, the change of use wa. within the.
legislative power. P. 320.
2z The existence of value, alone does not generate interests protected
by the Constitution against diminution by the Government, espedally where the value was both created and diminished as an
incident of the operation of government. P. 319.
3. The Rock Creek Park Act directed that surrounding lands be assessed to the extent that they were "specially benefited by reason

of the location and improvement" of the park. Held, that inasmuch as the dedication of the park did not imply a promise to
neighboring landowners that it would be continued in perpetuity,
this was not one of the special benefits required to be assessed, and
the landowners therefore derived no right to perpetual maintenance
of the park by virtue of the assessment; the benefits intended to be
assessed must be taken tb be those obvious advantages which would
accrue to lands in the vicinity of the park, because of their location,
and which would be reflected in their market value, even though
there were no guaranty that the park would be continued for any
particular length of time. P. 321.
4. Statutes restricting the power of government by ,the creation of
private rights are to be strictly construed for the protection of the
public interest. P. 321.
5. Zoning regulations for the District of Columbia are not contracts
by the- Government and may be modified by Congress. P. 323.

CERT oRAm, 285 U. S. 535, to feview a decree-affirming a
decree enjoining the Commissioners of the, District of
Columbia from constructing a fire engine house in RockCreek Park.

Burkart and Henry I. Quinn were on the brief, for

This case is here on certiorari, 285 U. S. 535, to review
a decree of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, 53 F. (2d) 1079. Following its earlier decision in
Quinn v. Dougherty, 30 F. (2d) 749, that court affirmed
a decree of the Supreme Court of the District, enjoining
the petitioners, the District Commissioners, from erecting
a fire engine house in Rock Creek Park at-a point near

the Property of some of the respondents, and adjoining
that of others.
The Commissioners are-directed by Act of Congress,' 45
Stat. 667, to- SuIld the engine house at the designated
location within the.park. The presence of such a structure will, it is admitted, diminish 'the attractiveness of
respondents' lands for residence purposes and, in consequence, decrease their exchange value. Respondents contend that they have a valuable right appurtenant to their
land, in the nature of an easement, to have the land used
for park purposes, and that the Act of Congress, directing
its use for other purposes, is a taking of their property
without just compensation in violation of the Fifth
Amendment.
For present purposes we assume that the proposed
building will divert the land -frompark uses, and address
ourselves to the question upon which the other issues in
the case depend, whether the respondents, plaintiffs in the
trial court, are vested with the right for which they invoke
constitutional protection.
There is no contention that 'such a right arises as an
incident to the ownership of neighboring land, as does an
easement of light and air, under the law of some states.
See Muhlker v. Harlem R. Co., 197 U. S. 544, 54; compare Marchant v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 153 U. S. 380.
But it is argued that the right asserted, whether it be regarded as arising from a contract with the government or
an interest in its lands, has a definite source in the transaction by which the park was created.
The court below found this source in the first paragraph of the Rock Creek Park Act, 26 Stat. 492, by which
the lands taken for the park by purchase or condemnation
were CCperpetually dedicated and set apart as a public
park or pleasur6 ground for the benefit and enjoyment
of the people of the United States . . .," and in the as-

sessment under § 6,1 of surrounding lands, including those
of respondents, to the extent that they were "specially
benefited by reason of the location and improvement"
of the park. The question is thus one of construction of

the statute; if it did not create the private rights asserted,
it is unnecessary to invoke the police power, as petitioners
do, to justify the construction of the engine house. Cf.
Jackmaniv. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U. S. 22, 31.
First. The respondents derived no rights against the
government from the dedication of the park alone. The
park lands purchased or condemned by authority of the
Rock- Creek Park Act were vested in the United States
in fee. Section 3 of the Act twice declares that "the
title" and once that "the fee" of the condemned lands
shall vest in the United States. By dedicating the lands
thus acquired to a particular public use, Congress declared a public policy, but did not purport to deprive
itself of the power to change that policy by devoting the
lands to other uses. The dedication expressed no more
than the will of a particular Congress which does not impose itself upon those to follow in succeeding years. See
Newton v. Commissioners, 100 U. S. 548, 559; Connecticut
Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Spratley, 172 U. S. 602, 621.
It is true that the mere presence of the park may have
conferred a special benefit on neighboring owners and
"Sec. 6. That the commission having ascertained the cost of the
land, including expenses, shall assess such proportion of such cost and
expenses upon the lands, lots, and blocks situated in the District
of Columbia specially benefited by reason of the location, and improvement of said park, as nearly as may be, in proportion to the
benefits resulting to such real estate.
"If said commission shall find that the real estate in said District
directly benefited by reason of the location of the park is not benefited
to the full extent of the estimated cost and expenses, then they shall
assess eack tract or parcel of land specially benefited to the extent of
such benefits as they shall deem the said real estate specially
benefited .... "

enhanced the value of their property. But the existence
of value alone does not generate interests protected by
the Constitution against diminution by the government,
however unreasonable its action may be, The beneficial
use aid hence the value of abutting property is decreased
when a public street or canal is closed or obstructed by
public authority, Meyer v. Richmond, 172 U. S. 82, 95;
cf. Whitney v. New York, 96 N. Y. 240; Fox v. Cincinnati, .104 U. S. 783; Kirk v. Maumee Valley Co., 279
U. S. 797, 802, 803; Smith v. Boston, 7 Cush. 254; Stanwood v. Malden, 157 Mass. 17; 31 N. E. 702, or a street
grade is raised, Smith. v. Washington, 20 How. 135; see
Mead v. Portland,200 U. S. 148, 162, or the location of a
county seat, Newton v. Commissioners,supra,or of a railroad is changed. Bryan v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 244
Fed. 650, 659. But in such cases no private right is
infringed.

Beyond the traditional boundaries of the common law
only some imperative justification in policy will lead the
courts to recognize in old values new propertr rights.
Compare InternationalNews Service v. Associated Press,
248 U. S. 215, with Cheney Bros. v. Dori S lk Corp., 35
F. (2d) 279. The case is clear where the question is not
of private rights alone, but the value was both. created
and diminished as an incident of the operations of the
government. For if the enjoyment of a benefit thus derived from the public acts of governmen.t were a source
of legal rights to have it perpetuated, the powers of government would be exhausted by their exercise.
'Compare the decisions holding that access to a water line may be
destroyed in the interest of navigation, Gibson v. United States, 166
U. S. 269; Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141; cf. Greenleaf Johnson

Opifiion of the Court.

287 U.S.

The case of a park is not unique as the court below
seems to have thought.' See Quinn v. Dougherty, 30 F.
(2d) 749, 751. It has often been decided that when lands
are acquired by a governmental body in fee and dedicated
by statute to park purposes, it is within the legislative
power to change the use, Clark v. Providence, 16 R. I.
337; 15 Atl. 763; Mowry v. Providence, 16 R. I. 422; 16
Atl. 511; Seattle Land & Improvement Co. v. Seattle, 37
Wash. 274; 79 Pac. 780; Reichling v. Covington Lumber
Co., 57 Wash. 225; 106 Pac. 777; see Higginsonv. Boston,
212 Mass.. 583; 99 N. E. 523, or to make other disposition
of the land. Wright v. Walcott, 238 Mass. 432; 131 N. E.
29; see Brooklyi Park Commissioners v. Armstrong, 45
N. Y. 234,245; compare East Chicago Co. v. East Chicago,
171 Ind. 654; 87 N. E. 17; .Whitney v. New York, supra;
Eldridgev. Binghamton, 120 N. Y. 309; 24 N. E. 462. The
abutting owner cannot complain; the damage suffered by
him "though greater in degree than that of the rest of
the public, is the same in kind." See United States v.
Welch, 217 U. S. 333,'339:1
'A different, question is presented in the cases relied on by the
court below which indicate that a dedication of land to the public, by
an individual, or a conveyance to a municipality, to be used as a park,
is subject to a condition or imposes a trust that the use be continued,
breach of which may be restrained. Douglass v. Montgomery, 118
,Ala.599; 24 So. 745; cf. Cincinnativ. White, 6 Pet. 431; Sheffield &
Tuscumbia Street Ry. Co. v. Rand, 83 Ala. 294; 3 So. 686; see also,
Riverside v. MacLain, 210 Ill.
308; 71 N. E. 408; Price v. Thompson,
48 Mo. 861; 3 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th ed.), § 1102.
There, rights in the land or against the municipality were said to
have been reserved in the grantor or created in the owners of neighboring land by the terms of the grant.
. Equally distinguishable are th6 decisions which likewise deal with
the authority of a municipality, not the power of the legislature, to
divert- park lands from park uses, but in which the lands were
acquired by unrestricted. purchase or by eminent domain. See 3
Dillon, supra, §§ 991, 1023,

REICHELDERFER v. QUINN:

Opinion of the Court.

Second. The fact that lands, including those now owned
by respondents, were assessed for benefits, as diredted by
the Rock Creek Park Act, leads to no different conclusion.
Respondents urge that the special benefits required to be
assessed included those accruing from the perpetual maintenance of the park; that by virtue of the assessment they
have paid for the right to enjoy those benefits in perpetuity. We may assume that the landowners acquired
rights commensurate .with the assessments authorized.
But the statute does not purport to place restrictions on
the park lands in their favor, and the decision of this
Court sustaining the constitutionality of the assessment
provision (Wilson v. Lambert, 168 U. S.611)., gives no
hint that among the benefits for which they were required
to pay was a right against the government to have the
lands forever used as a park.
All that the statute says is that the lands acquired
shall be perpetually dedicated as a park for the enjoyment of the people of the United States (§ 1) and-that
benefits shall be assessed (§ 6). Statutes said to restrict
the power of government by the creation of private rights
are, like other public grants, to be strictly construed for
the protection of the public interest. Charles River
Bridge v.. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 544-548; Christ
Church v. County of Philadelphia,24 How. 300; Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, 200 U. S.22, 33; Larson v.
South Dakota, 278 U. S.429. Thus construed, the dedication of the park, a declaration .of a present purpose,
does not imply a promise to neighboring land-owners that
the park would be continued in perpetuity. Cf. Newton
v. Commissioners, supra. The benefit of a governmental
obligation which the statute neither expresses nor implies
obviously was not to be assessed.
We think that the benefits intended must be taken to
be those obvious advantages which would accrue to lands
in the vicinity of a park, because of their location, and

which would be reflected in their market vilue, 'even
though there were no guaranty that the park would be
continued'for any particular length of time.4 . See Wilson
-v. Lambert, supra, 617; cf. Susquehanna Power Co. v.
State Tax Commn., 283 U. S. 291, 296; Burbank v. Fay,
65 N. Y. 57, 64. So it-was held in Thayer v. Boston, 206
Fed. 969, where contentions very similar to those made
here were rejected. See also Brooklyn Park Commissioners v. Armstrong, supra, 245. The same result has been
reached with regard to the assessment of benefits arising
from other types of public improvements, Whitney v. New
York, supra, 246; Chicago v. Union Building Assn., 102
II1. 379, 397; Kean v. Elizabeth, 54 N. J. L. 462; 24 Atl.
495, affirmed 55 N. J. L. 337; 26 Atl. 939; see Home for
Aged Women v. Commonwealth, 202 Mass. '422, 429, 430;
89 N. E. 124; 1 Nichols, Eminent Domain (2ded.), § 116;
and is implicit in the statement, frequently made, that
such assessments axe an exercise of the taxing power. See
Bauman v. Ross, 167"U. S. 548, 588; Wilson v. Lambert;
supra, 614; Memphis & CharlestonRy. v. Pace, 282 U. S.
241, 245.
'As originally introduced and reported, the bill authorizing and. establishing the park (S. No. 4, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.) had no provision
for the assessment of benefited property. 21 Cong. Rec. 96, 353, 902,
1109, 2371, 2578-90. Such a method of financing was suggested by
Representative Payson, ibid. 2580, who offered an amendment embodying this plan, ibid. 3939, which, after conference, was adopted,
in substance, as § 6. See ibid. 3952-3, 5300-3, 5673, 5902-3, 5988,
6163, 10417-9, :10457-8, 10441-4. In explaining the. assessment
provision on the flor, Mr. Payson said: " Suppose that a man
owns a piece of property, distant, we will suppose, a quarter of a mile
from the park and that piece of property is worth.today $1,000.
Now, if by reason of the expenditure made by the Government inthis
great'public improvement this man's property should become, in the
judgment of the commission, worth $2,000, the direct benefit thus
arising to the property would be assessed against it to assist in paying

for the. proposed improvement,"

Opinion, of the Court.

The possibility that the United States might, at some
later date, rightfully exercise its power to change. the use
of the park lands, so far as it affected present value was
a proper subject for consideration in valuing the benefits
conferred. Cf. United States v. River Rouge Co., 269
U. S. 411; Sears v. Street Commissioners, 180 Mass. 274,
282; 62 N. E. 397; Whitney v. New York, supra; 1 Nichols, Eminent Domain, supra.
Property was not taken without just compensation by
either the Rock Creek Park Act or the statute authorizing
the construction of the fire house. The only taking occurred when the lands were condemned for the park. Just
compensation, the value at that tinie, Vogelstein & Co. v.
United States, 262 U. S. 337; United States v. New River
Collieries Co., 262 U. S. 341, 344, -was awarded if the
benefits iesulting from the proximity of the improvement,
valued as the Act prescribed, were, as respondents assert,
set' off against the value of the property taken from the
same owners. Bauman v. Ross, supra; Whitney v. New
York, supra; Eldridge v. Binghamton, supra; see Matter
of City of New York, 190 N. Y. -350, 357, 360; 83 N. E.
299.
We note, but do not discuss at length, the objection.
that the statute authorizing the construction of the fire
house is invalid because inconsistent with regulations
under the Zoning Act for, the. District (41 Stat. 500),
setting apart the area in the vicinity of the park for residential properties of the highest class. It is enough to
say that the zoning regulations are not contracts by the
government and may be modified by Congress. The record and briefs disclose no facts which require us to consider how far the exercise of the power to modify may be
subject to constitutional limitations.
Reversed.
