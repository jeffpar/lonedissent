regard, therefore, have no ground upon which to base a
complaint.
Nor do we find merit in the further contention that the
act arbitrarily discriminates against appellants because it
does not apply to persons, commonly known as "shipperowners," who are transporting their own commodities
under substantially similar conditions. It is obvious that
certain provisions of the statute, like that requiring the
commission to fix minimum rates, can have no application to such owners. We are of opinion, from an examination of the act and the companion act which was upheld
by this court in Sproles v. Binford, supra, that all provisions relating to contract carriers which are germane to
shipper-owners are made applicable to them. In any
event, it is not shown that the act thus far has been so
administered as to result in any unlawful discrimination.
The decree of the court below is

BAINBRIDGE v. MERCHANTS & MINERS
TRANSPORTATION CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 90.

Argued November 17, 1932.-Decided December 5, 1932.

1. The provision in § 33 of the Merchant Marine Act that jurisdiction (meaning venue) of actions by seamen for personal injuries
suffered in the course of their employment "shall be under the
court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or
in which his principal office is located," refers only to federal

courts. P. 280.
2. Where such action is in a state court, venue is determined by the
state law. Id.3. U. S. C., Title 28, § 837, (c. 113, 40 Stat. 683) provides that
courts of the United States, "including appellate courts," shall
be open to seamen without payment cf or security for fees or

that it applies to appellate proceedings in this Court, in a suit
by a seaman for personal injuries, under § 33 of the Merchant
Marine Act, which section is an amendment of the Seamen's Act.

CERTIORARI* to review the affirmance of a judgment

dismissing the action for want of jurisdiction.
Mr. Edwin J. McDermott, by leave of Court, argued
the cause pro hac vice for petitioner. Mr. McDermott
and Mr. Thomas D. McBride also filed a brief for
petitioner.
Mr. Howard H. Yocum for respondent.
MR. JusTicE SuTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Petitioner brought this action in the Court of Common
Plhas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, to recover
damages for an injury sustained by her as a member of
the crew of a steamship operated by respondent. The
action was brought under the Jones Act, § 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, U. S. C., Title 46, § 688,-which
provides: "Jurisdiction I in such actions shall be under
the court of the district in which the defendant employer
resides or in which his principal office is located.". Respondent, contending that the court in which the action
was brought was not of the proper district, since respondent's principal office was in Baltimore, Maryland, moved
to dismiss the action for want of juiisdiction. The motion

was sustained, and the action accordingly dismissed. The
judgment of dismissal was affirmed by the state supreme
court. 306 Pa. 204; 159 Atl. 19.
The question presented for our determination is whether
the quoted provision in respect of jurisdiction applies to
the state courts, or is limited to the federal courts. The
decisions are conflicting, but we think the correct construction of the provision limits it to the courts of the
United States. The word "district" is peculiarly apposite in that relation; but in order to apply it to a state
court, whose territory for venue purposes may or may
not be designated as a "district," an elasticity of interpretation would be required which it does not seem probable Congress had in mind. Thus in one instance, where
an action had been brought in a state court, it was found
necessary, in order to hold the provision applicable, to
interpret the word "district" as meaning "county" in
which the defendant resides or has his principal office.

federal courts, which we approve, is expressed in Lynott v.

various states fixing the venue of their own. courts. It
follows that the venue should have been determined by
the trial court in accordance with the law of the state.
Another question has been raised which, however, affects only the proceedings in this court. The Clerk was
requested by counsel for petitioner to docket the case here
under c. 113, 40 Stat. 683, U. S. C., Title 28, § 837, which
provides:
"'Courts of the United States, including appellate
courts, hereafter shall be open to seamen, without furnishing bonds or prepayment of or making deposit to secure
fees or costs, for the purpose of entering and prosecuting
suit or suits in their own name and for their own benefit
for wages or salvage and to enforce laws made for their
health and safety."
The Clerk, being in doubt, required a deposit to secure his
fees and costs, and accordingly this was made by counsel
for petitioner.
In Ex poarte Abdu, 247 U. S. 27, it was held that the
corresponding provision then in force (c. 27, 40 Stat. 157)
did not apply to appellate proceedings; but the words
which now appear, "including appellate courts," were not
in the provision as it then read. That case, therefore, is
not in point. With these words added, the provision now
applies to appellate proceedings..
A more serious question is whether suits under the Jones
Act may be regarded as suits by seamen "for wages or
salvage" or "to enforce laws made for their health and
safety." Such a suit is not for wages or salvage. Is it
to enforce a law made for the health or safety of seamen?

swered in the negative.
In Grant v. U..S. Shipping
Board E. F. Corp., 24 F. (2d) 812, it was answered in the
affirmative. The court in the latter case rejected the
construction put upon the provision by the decision in
The Bennington as too narrow and not in accord with the
liberality Congress intended toward seamen, holding that
the Jones Act, being an addition to the Seamen's Act, was
intended to be consistent with the spirit of that legislation,
which was directed to promote the welfare of Ameiican
seamen. We agree with that view. The Jones Act is an
amendment to § 20 of the Seamen's Act. The Jones Act
has the effect of bringing into the maritime law, for the
benefit of seamen, all appropriate statutes relating to employers' liability-for the personal injury or death of rail-*
way employees. Both acts are to be treated as part of
the maritime law. PanamaR. Co.v. Johnson, 264 U. S.
375, 389. Seamen have always been regarded as wards
of the admiralty and their rights, wrongs and injuries a
special subject of the admiralty jurisdiction. Benedict's
Admiralty, 4th ed., §§ 182, 603. The policy of Congress,
as evidenced by its legislation, has been to deal with them
as a favored class. Robertson v. .Baldwin,165 U. S. 275,
287. In the light Of and to effectuate that policy, statutes
enacted for their benefit should be liberally construed.
The Seaman's Act, which includes the Jones Act by
amendment, is entitled in part "An act :to promote the
welfare of American seamen . . . and to promote safety
at sea." Chap. 153, 38 Stat. 1164. It requires little
if any aid from the dsctrine of liberal construction to
enable us to say that the present suit is one to enforce
a law made for the safety of seamen. Petitioner will not
be required to prepay or make deposit to secure fees or
costs, and the Clerk will be directed to refund the deposit
already made.
The judgment below is reversed and the cause remanded
for further probeedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Judgment reversed.
