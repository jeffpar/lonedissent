Syllabus.

Cordinated Transport Company became owner of all
shares of "A" and "B" corporations. Through these
manipulations, the projector obtained indirect control of
corporations "A" and "B" and the lines which they
operate.
The Commissioner, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the
Circuit Court of Appeals all rightly concluded that petitioner was not party to a reorganization within the statute. Certain corporate shares owned by it were exchanged for shares which another corporation owned.
Neither party to the exchange acquired any definite immediate interest in the other. Nothing here, we think,
even remotely resembles either merger or reorganization
as commonly understood. Pinellas Ice Co. v. Commissioner, 287 U. S. 462.

FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.

No. 193.

Argued Novembe.r 11, 12, 1935.-Decided December 16,
1935.

1. Under the law of New Jersey the review by the Supreme Court
of the State of a decree of the Prerogative Court affirming a tax
assessment, is a judicial proceeding as distinguished from an administrative one. P. 400.
2. Upon appeal from a tax assessment, the Prerogative Court of New
Jersey acquires jurisdiction not only to determine the tax due, but
to take proceedings for its collection; and the docketing of its
decree affirming a tax, gives it the effect of a- judgment creating a

lien and enforcible by execution.

APPEAL

Mr. William A. Schnader for appellants.
Mr. Duane E. Minard, with whom Mr. David T.
Wilentz, Attorney General of New Jersey, and Mr. George
S. Hobart, were on the brief, for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These suits were brought, on April 1, 1935, under § 266
of the Judicial Code, to enjoin the collection of an inheritance tax in the sum of $12,247,333.52, assessed by New
Jersey upon the estate of John T. Dorrance, which was
valued at more than $1i5,000,000. The bills charge that
its transfer inheritance tax act, as construed and applied,
violates the full faith and credit clause of the"Federal
Constitution and the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. The defendants are the State Tax Commissioner and other New Jersey officials.' In No. 193, the
plaintiff is a daughter of the decedent and a beneficiary
under his will. In No. 194, his executors are the plaintiffs. A temporary restraining order issued. An appli•These are the State Supervisor of the Inheritance Tax Bureau,

cation was made for an interlocutory injunction; answers
were filed; and the case was heard before three judges
upon an elaborate record. But the injunction was denied
for want of jurisdiction upon the allegations of the bill,
because of the prohibition contained in § 265 of the
Judicial Code.' The cases are here on appeal.
The material allegations are substantially the same in
the two suits: Dorrance died on September 21, 1930, at
his residence in Cinnaminson, Burlington County, New
Jersey, leaving a will in which he named his wife, two
brothers, and the Camden Trust Company executors. On
October 2, 1930, his will was, upon petition of the executors, admitted to probate in the Orphan's Court of that
county; letters testamentary issued; and the executors
have administered the estate ever since
diction of that court. Their petition for
will, had recited that Dorrance's domicil
sey. On April 6, 1931, they filed with

under the jurisprobate, like the
was in New Jerthe Inheritance

Tax Bureau of New Jersey their return as a basis for the
assessment of the inheritance tax. The estate consisted
almost wholly of bonds, stocks, and other evidence of title
to intangible personal property; and these were then, and
still are, located in New Jersey. On October 17, 1931,
the Tax Commissioner,; finding, upon evidence presented
by the executors, that Dorrance was at the time of his
death domiciled in New Jersey, assessed the amount
stated as the tax on direct transfers payable under the
New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Act of April 20,

1909, ch. 228, as amended.
On December 12, 1931, the assessment so made was,
upon request of the executors, opened for the purpose of
Section 265 provides: "The writ of injunction shall not be granted
by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of
a State, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by
any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy." See Smith v. Apple,

enabling them to submit additional information concerning the decedent's domicil; and, introducing in evidence
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania hereafter referred to, first rendered September 26, 1932, they
claimed that Dorrance was, or must be deemed to have
been, domiciled in Pennsylvania, in view of that judgment
and other evidence. On October 10, 1932, the New Jersey
Tax Commissioner again assessed upon the estate the tax
of $12,247,333.52. The executors appealed to the Prerogative Court, which, by final decree entered May 11,
1934, affirmed the assessment, subject to a modification
not here material. In re Dorrance, 115 N. J. Eq. 268;
170 Atl. 601; 116 N. J. Eq. 204; 172 Atl. 503. The
executors procured, by writ of certiorari, a review of the
assessment by the New Jersey Supreme Court. On February 8, 1935, that court affirmed the decree of the Prerogative Court and dismissed the writ of certiorari with
costs. Dorrance v. Thayer-Martin, 13 N. J. Misc. Rep.
168; 176 Atl. 902. On February 13, 1935, the executors
notified the defendant Martin that they intended to take
an appeal to the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals.
They have not done so; but under the state practice an
appeal may be taken at any time prior to February 11,
1936.'
Dorrance had a residence also in Pennsylvania. That
State claimed that he was domiciled there at the time of
his death; and promptly commenced proceedings to subject his estate, including the intangible property, to the
Pennsylvania inheritance tax. In March, 1933, it recovered in its Supreme Court a final judgment against the
executors, which, adjudging that Dorrance's domicil was
at the time of his death in Pennsylvania, imposed an inheritance tax upon the intangible property, as well as
upon the real estate and tangible personal property situ'2 Comp. Stats. of N. J. of 1910, p. 2208, § 2; 2 Cum. Supp. of

ated there. Dorrance'sEstate, 309 Pa. 151; 163 Atl. 303.
No question under the Federal Constitution was presented. Certiorari was denied by this Court, 287 U. S.
660; 288 U. S. 617. 'In satisfaction of the judgment, the
executors paid to Pennsylvania $14,394,698.88, and $104,278.03 as interest thereon; and they also gave a bond in
the sum of $4,000,000 to pay additional amounts, if upon
final determination of the federal estate tax they should
appear to be due.
In the suits at bar, the plaintiffs insist that the Pennsylvania judgment was in rem and bound New Jersey and
the defendants although they were not parties to that litigation; that the New Jersey courts and administrative
authorities, in refusing to give effect to the Pennsylvania
judgment holding that Dorrance was domiciled in the
latter State, violated the full faith and credit clause of
the Federal Constitution; and that if they construed the
New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Act as applying to
intangible property the situs of which was outside New
Jersey, they violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs contend further that if the Pennsylvania judgment is
not in rem, the federal court is now free to ascertain the
facts as to domicil and reach its conclusion independently
of the prior decisions of the courts of the two States; and
that the evidence introduced below establishes that Dorrance's domicil was in Pennsylvania.
The 'plaintiffs claim that the District Court erred in
holding that § 265 of the Judicial Code prevents the federal court from granting the injunctions prayed for, since
at the time of the institution of these suits in the federal
court the proceedings in New Jersey had not passed into
the judicial stage; and since, in any case, an independent
judicial proceeding was necessary to collect the tax. The
defendants concede that § 265 would not bar federal
courts from staying collection of the tax if the state pro-

ceedings had not passed from the administrative into the
judicial stage. See City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v.
Schnader, 291 U. S. 24; 293 U. S. 112. But they assert
that the proceedings in the Supreme Court of New Jersey reviewing by certiorari the final decree of the Prerogative Court (itself a judicial tribunal) were proceedings
judicial in their nature; and that the stay sought is of
proceedings pending in a court of New Jersey. The defendants contend also that the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court to which the executors were parties is
res judicata as to the domicil of the deceased and as to the
liability of the estate for the taxes assessed by New
Jersey; and they set up other reasons why the relief
prayed should be denied. We have no occasion to consider any of these defenses, since we agree with the District Court that it was without jurisdiction to grant the
injunction.
First. To determine whether a judicial proceeding was
pending when these suits were brought, we turn to the law
of New Jersey. The proceedings, administrative and
judicial, governing the assessment and the collection of its
inheritance tax are, in substance, these: The assessment
is made by the State Tax Commissioner, his duty being to
"assess and fix the cash value of such estate and levy the
tax to which the same is liable." He performs this duty
after receiving the report of an appraiser appointed by
him. The appraiser makes the appraisal and essential
findings after notice to the interested parties and hearing
evidence and argument. 4 Any person dissatisfied with
the appraisal or the assessment may appeal therefrom to
the "Ordinary," that is, the Prerogative Court. Bugbee
v. Van Cleve, 99 N. J. Eq. 825, 834; 134 Atl. 646. Upon
that court is conferred jurisdiction "to hear and determine all questions in relation to any tax levied under the
' N. J. Laws of 1931, c. 303, § 1"8, pp. 763, 764; c. 336, p. 823.

provisions of" the Act.5 The decree of the Prerogative
Court is reviewable on writ of certiorari by the New
Jersey Supreme Court; I and its judgment is reviewable
by the Court of Errors and Appeals
As to the collection of the tax, § 21 of the Transfer
Inheritance Tax Act provides that "if it shall appear to
the State Tax Commissioner that any tax . . . has not
been paid according to law," he shall report such fact to
the register of the Prerogative Court, who must issue a
citation citing the interested parties to"' show cause why
such tax should not be paid." 8 The Attorney General, if
he has probable cause to believe that a tax is due and
unpaid, and is so notified by the Commissioner, shall prosecute the proceeding before the Prerogative Court.'
The service of the citation, and subsequent proceedings thereon, shall conform to the practice prevailing in
the Prerogative Court, including the power to commit for
contempt. 0 Such proceedings would be the same in
character whether the review of the original assessment
had ended with the appeal to the Prerogative Court, or
had been followed by certiorari to the Supreme Court;
and whether or not an appeal was taken from the judgment of the Supreme Court to the Court of Errors and
Appeals. Upon the making by the Prerogative Court of
any decree, a copy thereof filed by the Commissioner with
the clerk of the Supreme Court has the same effect as
a judgment at law, and execution may issue thereon."

Thenceforward, collection is pursued as prescribed for
civil judgments in "an Act respecting executions." 2
Comp. Stats. of N. J. of 1910, p. 2243. Paragraph Fifth
of § 1 of the Inheritance Tax Act provides that under
certain conditions executors (and others) "shall be personally liable for any and all such taxes until the same
shall have been paid as hereinafter directed, for which an
action of debt shall lie in the name of the State of New
Jersey."
Second. The Supreme Court's review of the administrative act of assessing was judicial action. It is a court
created by the constitution; and its jurisdiction to review,
on certiorari, proceedings of inferior tribunals is an inheritance from the Court of Kings Bench. The Supreme
Court has broad powers. It may, as recited in the New
Jersey Certiorari Act of 1903, as amended, "determine
disputed questions of fact, as well as of law "; and when
inquiring into the facts, is not limited to the evidence introduced before the tribunal whose proceeding is under
review. It may act "by depositions taken on notice, or in
such other manner as is according to the practice of the
court "; and it "may reverse or affirm, in whole or in
part, such tax or assessment." '" Power to review the
facts is conferred in New Jersey not only upon the
Supreme Court but also upon its highest appellate tribunal-the Court of Errors and Appeals. Power, upon
enquiry into the facts, to take evidence additional to that
introduced before the tribunal whose action is under review is a power not uncommonly possessed by appellate
See State v. Justices of Middlesex, 1 N. J. Law 244, 248; Royal

393

courts in proceedings strictly judicial. The power to
"reverse or affirm, in whole or in part" does not imply
that the court may exercise administrative discretion.
Such power is a common incident of the judicial review
of taxation. As the administrative proceeding of assessing the tax had ended when the Supreme Court granted
its writ of certiorari, we have no occasion, in this connection, to enquire whether it had not already ended when
the appeal to the Prerogative Court was allowed.
Third. The plaintiffs contend that even if the action of
the Supreme Court was judicial, the federal court had
jurisdiction of this controversy because the judgment of
the New Jersey courts was limited to a review of the assessment; that in order to collect the tax-to translate
the assessment into an enforceable judgment-the state
officials must institute a new and independent action,
namely either an action for debt in the name of the State
or a statutory proceeding against the persons interested
in the estate; and that since no such action or proceeding
had been taken at the time when these suits were filed,
there is here no application to '! stay proceedings in any
court of" New Jersey. That is, the plaintiffs contend
that the determination of the amount and validity of the
tax is to be treated as an isolated and distinct proceeding,
not as a step in the process of determining and collecting
the tax imposed.
It is true that if the executors fail to pay the tax adjudged to be due, New Jersey must take further proceedings to compel the executors to discharge their obligation.
This is so even if the executors do not avail themselves of
their existing right to appeal to the Court of Errors and
Appeals, or if upon such appeal that court affirms the
judgment of the Supreme Court. But it is not true that
such-further proceeding would be, in legal contemplation,
independent action. Upon dismissal of the certiorari, the

cause was remanded to the Prerogative Court. By the
appeal of the executors, it had acquired jurisdiction not
only to determine the tax due, but to take appropriate
proceedings for its collection. Its jurisdiction continues
until its decree is satisfied.
The further proceedings required to compel satisfaction
of the decree establishing liability for the tax do not differ
in essence from those required to satisfy any judgment for
a debt recovered at law or any decree in chancery for
the payment of money. The procedure of the Prerogative Court subsequent to a decree follows that of the
equity courts, which had, ordinarily, no power to enforce
their decrees except by citation for contempt." Chapter
148 of the laws of 1900, which provides, as a means of
collection, that the Prerogative Court shall issue a citation
if it appears that a tax found to be due has not been paid,
is declaratory of the existing procedure." Section 21 of
the Transfer Inheritance Tax Act provides that the lien
created by docketing a decree " shall have the same effect
"See 2 Daniell, Chancery Pleading & Practice (6th Am. ed., 1894)
1042 et seq.
" N. J. Laws of 1900, § 7, p. 347: "If any person shall neglect or
refuse to obey any citation, or to perform any sentence or decree of
the ordinary or judge of the prerogative court, it shall be lawful for
such ordinary and such court to cause such person or persons, by
process directed to any sheriff of any county of this state, to be taken
and imprisoned until he shall obey the said citation, or perform the
said sentence or decree; and every sheriff is hereby directed to cause
all such process, to him at any time directed, to be duly executed, and
to confine the person against whom such process shall be issued, as
in execution, until he shall be delivered by due course of law; and if
any sheriff shall neglect his duty therein, he shall be answerable to
the party, aggrieved in such manner as he would be answerable upon
process of the like nature issuing out of the supreme court." Imprisonment and realization upon the tax lien are means provided for
enforcing also other New Jersey taxes. See Laws of 1918, § 606,
p. 874; McLean v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Coal Co., 13
N. J. Misc. Rep. 83, 84; 176 Atl. 557; see note 10.

as a lien by judgment, and execution shall issue thereon
according to the rules and practice appertaining to other
judgments." 1
Fourth. The prohibition of § 265 is against a stay of
"proceedings in any court of a State." That term is comprehensive. It includes all steps taken or which may be
taken in the state court or by its officers from the institution to the close of the final process."6 It applies to appe 1 late as well as to original proceedings; and is independent of the doctrine of res judicata. It applies alike
to action by the court and by its ministerial officers; applies not only to an execution issued on a judgment,I but
to any proceeding supplemental or ancillary taken with
The
a view to making the suit or judgment effective.'
prohibition is applicable whether such supplementary or
ancillary proceeding is taken in the court which rendered
the judgment or in some other. And it governs a privy to
the state court proceeding-like Elinor Dorrance Hill-as
well as the parties of record. Thus, the prohibition applies whatever the nature of the proceeding, unless the
case presents facts which bring it within one of the recognized exceptions to § 265.1' It is not suggested that there
is a basis here for any such exception.
