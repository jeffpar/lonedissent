existing rates. 201 I. C. C. 165; 206 I. C. C. 445. Upon
the hearing by the District Court, composed of three
judges, the injunction was denied and the bill of complaint dismissed, but a restraining order was entered staying the enforcement of the Commission's order pending
appeal to this Court. 11 F. Supp. 588. The Railway
Company and intervening shippers appeal from so much
o F the decree as denied the injunction and dismissed the
bill of complaint, and the United States, the Interstate
Commerce Commission, and others, appeal from that part
of the decree which stayed the enforcement of the Commission's order.
This Court, upon an examination of the record, agrees
with the conclusion of the District Court that the order
in question was sustained by findings of the Commission
acting within its statutory authority and that these findings were adequatIly supported by evidence. The decree
denying injunction and dismissing the bill of complaint
'is affirmed. Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. United States,
295 U. S. 395.
This disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to
pass upon that portion of the decree which stayed the
enforcement of the Commission's order. See Virginian
Ry. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. ,658.
