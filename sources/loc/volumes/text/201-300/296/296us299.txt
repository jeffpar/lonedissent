professed, may be read beneath the surface, and by the
purpose so imputed the statute is destroyed. Thus the
process of psychoanalysis has spread to unaccustomed
fields. There is a wise and ancient doctrine that a court
will not inquire into the motives of a legislative body or
assume them to be wrongful. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch
87, 130; Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40, 44.
There is another wise and ancient doctrine that a court
will not adjudge the invalidity of a statute except for
manifest necessity. Every reasonable doubt must have
been explored and extinguished before moving to that
grave conclusion. Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 270.
The warning sounded by this court in the Sinking-Fund
Cases, 99 U. S. 700, 718, has lost none of its significance.
"Every possible presumption is in favor of the validity
of a statute, and this continues until the contrary is shown
beyond a rational doubt. One branch of the government
cannot encroach on the domain of another without danger. The safety of our institutions depends in no small
degree on a strict observance of this salutary rule." I
cannot rid myself of the conviction that in the imputation
to the lawmakers of a purpose not professed, this salutary
rule of caution is now forgotten or neglected after all the
many protestations of its cogency and virtue.
