and the benefits of proration depending upon the existence of a common source drawn upon by different producers, would not necessarily extend to any particular
county.

The Supreme Court of Oklahoma emphasized the fact

that the 1/8 of a cent per barrel tax, denominated by the
statute an "excise," is an excise tax distinguishable from
a property tax in lieu of which the gross production tax

is levied, and different from the gross production tax in
its temporary character and the method of its computation and distribution, and so concluded that it is not a
tax contemplated by the congressional consent. Construing that consent with the strictness appropriate to the
interpretation of a waiver of a defined tax immunity of
the sovereign, we think the conclusion of the state court
was right.

No. 151.

Argued December 13, 16, 1935.-Decided January 6, 1936.

1. The question whether an employer and his insurance carrier, in the
District of Columbia, were released from their obligation to an
injured employee under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act through the voluntary discontinuance by the
employee of his action against a third person, alleged to have
caused the injury, when no compromise with the third person took
place but the discontinuance occurred after the statute of limitations had run against the claim sued upon, and the employer and
insurance carrier were thereby deprived of an opportunity to pursue
the third person as subrogees,-held a question to be determined
by the general principles of suretyship. P. .528.

3. An insurance company which, under the above-mentioned compensation act, receives premiums from an employer for insuring
the performance of his duty to compensate his employees for
injuries, and which is entitled to be subrogated to any claim that
an injured employee may have against a third person, is not
released from its obligation to pay the prescribed compensation
because the employee, after bringing suit on such a claim, dismissed it when the statute of limitations had run upon it, if the
claim had been demonstrated to be groundless, so that the insurer
was not prejudiced by the loss of its right of subrogation. Pp. 529,

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

296 U.S.

Petitioner sought, in the Supreme Court of the District
of Columbia, a mandatory injunction directing respondent, a Deputy Commissioner of the District of Columbia
Compensation District, to award him compensation. In
the proceedings in that court it appeared that petitioner
had been injured in a collision with a street car, in the
course of his employment as helper on a delivery truck
of his employer, for whom the respondent, The Indemnity
Insurance Company of North America, intervenor in the
suit, is the insurance carrier: that petitioner, electing to
sue the street car company, had recovered judgment in
the District Supreme Court, which the District Court of
Appeals had reversed and remanded for further proceedings, Washington Ry. & Electric Co. v. Chapman, 62 App.
D. C. 140; 65 F. (2d) 486: that petitioner had then discontinued his suit and pressed his application for compensation before the Deputy Commissioner who denied it
on the ground that petitioner had failed to pursue to final
judgment his remedy against the third party. The present suit was dismissed by the District Supreme Court on
motion of the Insurance Company. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 64 App. D. C. 349; 78 F. (2d) 233, holding
that, as the petitioner had elected to pursue his remedy
against the third party, and as the statute of limitations
had run while the suit was pending, his failure to proceed
to final judgment operated to discharge the employer and
the insurance carrier.
While by § 33 (a) of the Compensation Act the employee may elect to pursue his remedy against a third person, election does not deprive him of his right to compensation. See American Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co.
v. Lowe, 70 F. (2d) 616. By § 33 (f) the employer or the
insurance carrier who, by §§ 32 (a), 35 and 36 is substituted for the employer, remains liable for any amount by
which the recovery against the third person falls short of
the prescribed compensation. Section 33 (a) only pro-

Opinion of the Court.

vides for release of the employer's liability for compensation when the claim against the third party is compromised without the employer's consent. In other respects
his rights and liabilities, so far as he is in the position of
a surety or indemnitor, are governed, as the court belw
held, by the general principles of suretyship.
Upon election of the employee to take compensation
the employer is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of
the employee against the third person. The insurer, who,
as an indemnitor of the employer, and by the Act, stands
in the place of the employer, is similarly entitled to subrogation. As with other indemnitors, his obligation may be
discharged by release or other relinquishment of the principal liability which deprives him of his right of subrogation. Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Moses, 287 U. S. 530;
Doleman v. Levine, 295 U. S. 221, 225; Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Great Lakes Engineering Works Co., 184 Fed.
426. Hence the only question for decision is whether the
abandonment by plaintiff of his suit against the third
party, after the running of the statute of limitations had
precluded the possibility of bringing another suit, and in
the circumstances disclosed by the record, is to be deemed
so prejudicial to the insurer's right of subrogation as to
operate as a discharge of its liability.
Whether, in any case, an indemnitor is discharged by
the mere failure of his obligee to sue the principal debtor
until suit is barred by the statute of limitations, remains
an open question in this Court. See Nelson v. First Nat.
Bank, 69 Fed. 798; Gill v. Waterhouse, 245 Fed. 75, answering it in the negative; contra: Hayward v. Sencenbaugh, 141 Ill. App. 395; Auchampaugh v. Schmidt, 70

Co., 104 Miss. 217; 61 So 178; and see Cheesman v.
Cheesman, 236 N. Y. 47, 51; 139 N. E. 775. It is unnecessary to decide it now. We assume for present purposes

Opinion of the Court.

296 U.S.

that petitioner's election to sue the third party followed
by his discontinuance of the suit when the claim was
barred by the statute is sufficient to discharge respondent from its obligation as an insurer, if prejudicial to its
right of subrogation. We confine our investigation to the
questions whether the fact of prejudice to this right is
open to inquiry and, if so, whether the right is shown in
the present circumstances to be so unsubstantial that respondent has not in fact been prejudiced by its loss.
It is generally true that the obligation of a voluntary
surety is so far regarded as strictissimijuris as to be released upon a showing, without more, that the principal
obligation has been modified or surrendered without the
consent of the surety. Sprigg v. Bank of Mt. Pleasant,
14 Pet. 201; Wood v. Steele, 6 Wall. 80; Porto Rico v.
Title Guaranty& Surety Co., 227 U. S. 382; Edwards v.
Goode, 228 Fed. 664; United States Fidelity c Casualty
7o.. v. Pensacola,263 Fed. 344. But the strictness of this
rule is relaxed in those jurisdictions where the failure of
the creditor to prosecute his claim against the principal
debtor after demand by the surety may be availed of as a
defense by the latter. In that case the surety is discharged only to the extent of the loss which results. Pain
v. Packard, 13 Johns. (N. Y.) 174; Huffman v. Hulbert,
13 Wend. (N. Y.) 377; Herrick v. Borst, 4 Hill (N. Y.)
650; Hunt v. Purdy, 82 N. Y. 486; see Snow v. Horgan,
18 R. I. 289, 291; 27 Atl. 338; cf. Pickens v. Yarboroughs'
Administrator, 26 Ala. 417; Wurster v. Albrecht, 237 Ill.
App. 284; Bingham v. Mears, 4 N. D. 437; 61 N. W. 808;
Thompson v. Watson, 10 Yerg. (Tenn.) 362; but cf. Shehan v. Hampton, 8 Ala. 942; Shenandoah Nat. Bank v.
Ayres, 87 Iowa 526; 54 N. W. 367; Sullivan v. Dwyer, 42
S. W. 355 (Tex. Civ. App.).
This follows from the fact that the surety's contract, not
being one of guaranty, does not entitle him to have the
creditor first assert his claim against the principal debtor.

CHAPMAN v. HOAGE.

531,

Opinion of the Court.

Failure by the creditor to perform any obligation to prosecute the claim arising out of his conduct subsequent to
the contract, like his failure to realize upon subsequently
acquired security, is a defense only so far as it is prejudicial to the surety. See State Bank'v. Edwards, 20 Ala.
512; Curan v. Colbert, 3 Ga. 239; Brown v. Executors of
Riggins, 3 Ga. 405; Robeson v. Roberts, 20 Ind. 155; Mt.
Sterling Improvement Co. v. Cockrell, 70 S. W. 842; 24
Ky. Law Rep. 1151; Springer v. Toothaker, 43 Me..381;
Humphrey v. Hitt, 6 Grat. (Va.) 509; Hyde v. Rogers,
59 Wis. 154; 17 N. W. 127. The analogy to the present
case, where the employee was not bound to proceed
against the third person but elected to do so, is apparent.
Moreover, respondent is a compensated surety, whose
premiums the employer is required to pay by § 32. The
rule that any modification of the principal obligation releases the surety is also abated in the case of a compensated surety or indemnitor, who is discharged only so far
as his right is shown to be in fact prejudiced by action of
the indemnitee. One who engages in the business of insurance for compensation may properly be held more
rigidly to his obligation to indemnify the insured than one
whose suretyship is an undertaking uncompensated and
casual. Atlantic Trust & Deposit Co. v. Laurinburg, 163
Fed. 690; Gunsul v. American Surety Co., 308 Ill. 312;
139 N. E. 620; United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v.
Poetker, 180 Ind. 255; 102 N. E. 372; State ex rel. Elberta Peach & Land Co. v. Chicago Bonding & Surety Co.,
279 Mo. 535; 215 S. W. 20; Royal Indemnity Co. v.
Northern Ohio Granite & Stone Co., 100 Ohio St. 373;
126 N. E. 405; Duke v. National Surety Co., 130 Wash.
276; 227 Pac. 2; cf. Guaranty Co. v. Pressed Brick Co.,
191 U. S. 416. The insurer is given a right of subrogation not to enable him to avoid his undertaking to indemnify but that it may not be enlarged beyond that of indemnity. Standard Marine Insurance Co. v. Scottish

MetropolitanAssurance Co., Ltd., 283 U. S. 284, 28,8. He
is not prejudiced by failure to prosecute a claim after it
has been demonstrated to be groundless.
Application of these principles to an insurance contract
under a compensation act such as the present does not
require that an employee who has elected to proceed
against a third person do more than prosecute his claim
in a manner and to an extent which will avoid prejudice
to the insurer's right of subrogation. The facts disclosed
show that respondent has not been prejudiced. The
judgment upon the first trial Was set~aside by the Court
of Appeals because uncontradicted evidence established
petitioner's contributory negligence so clearly that the
trial judge should have directed a verdict for the defendant. The appellate court was nevertheless required by
the rule of Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Co., 228
U. S. 364, to remand the case for further proceedings.
Meanwhile, petitioner's main witness, the driver of the
truck, had died. Petitioner, who was without funds,
asked leave of the trial court to proceed with the second
trial in forma pauperis, with the-evident purpose of preserving, by this c6urse, his rights against the insurer.
His application was denied, presumably because it was
thought a second trial would be fruitless. These circumstances are enough to. establish, at least prima facie, that
failure to proceed with a second trial did not prejudice
the insurer. Respondent, insisting that it was discharged
,by the mere failure of petitioner to proceed further,
regardless of prejudice, has offered no evidence that it did.
Reversed.
