ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY v
HENDERSON ELEVATOR COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF
KENTUCKY.
No. 105.

Argued December 1.9, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.

Failure to post rates does not estop the carrier from collecting the
published tariff rate notwithstanding a lower rate may have been

quoted to the shipper. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Albers Commission Co., 223 U. S. 573.
138 Kentucky, 220, reversed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Edmund F. Trabue, with whom Mr. Blewett Lee,
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The decision below restores the evil of rebates. Its
effect is to give the shipper a lower rate than other shippers
who had to pay for their transportation according to the
published rates. It force:s the carrier to pay the shipper
a rebate from the lawful. rate. If the judgment below
can stand, an effective way has at last been found to
guarantee shippers against future changes of railroad

rates, and the decision in Armour v. United States, 209
U. S. 56, approved in Phila. &c. Co. v. Schubert, 224 U. S.
603, 615, becomes a dead letter. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co.
v. Mugg, 202 U. S. 242, controls this case.

When several acts of Congress are passed touching the
same subject-matter, subsequent legislation may be considered to assist in the interpretation of prior legislation
upon the same subject.
See act of June 18, 1910, 36 Stat. 548, providing for
penalty on the carrier in case of misstatement of rate,
which covers the contingency of a shipper's entering into
a sale or other contract whereby the obligation arises to
ship the freight at his cost. The evident intent of the
act is. that there shall be no other remedy. It is also a
legislative construction of the actthat previously no action would lie under the circumstances for which this
remedy is provided. For legislative history of that act,

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Argument for Defendant in Error.

226 U. S.

Mr. James W. Clay, Mr. J. F. Clay and Mr. A. Y. Clay
for defendant in error, submitted:
According to every principle of the common law applicable to such cases, upon every rule of negligence and
liability therefor, upon every rule of human reason and
common justice,-the shipper under the facts of this case
is entitled to recover, and no court, having jurisdiction of
the parties and of the subject-matter, will undertake to
deprive it of that right, unless compelled to do so by some
mandatory provision of a constitutional statute.
There is nothing in the Commerce Act that deprives
the shipper of its right to recover in this case; and no
court, Federal or state, whose decisions could be regarded
even as authority by this court, has ever held that under
the facts established by the evidence in this case, the party
injured was without remedy, or could not recover.
The ten cent rate prescribed under the schedule of 1906,
was established in the manner and form required by law,
and it stands as the rule until superseded by a schedule
published, filed and posted in the manner and form required by law.
The filing of a tariff in the office of the Secretary of the
Interstate Commerce Commission does not establish the
rate. Frequently tariffs are filed in the office of the Interstate Commerce Commission which never become effective, or which are withdrawn, or repealed, or superseded before they do become effective.
When the shipper does everything one could be expected
to do, and then suffers a loss by reason of the negligent
failure of the railroad company to comply with the mandatory provisions of a statute,-no court has ever held that
the railroad company is not liable and the shipper without remedy.
The cases cited by counsel as sustaining a contrary view
as matter of fact bear out the above statement.
If the carrier in this case had filed the schedule of

ILL. CENT. R. R. v. HENDERSON ELEVATOR CO.
226 U. S.

445

Argument for Defendant in Error.

April 1, 1907, in its office at Henderson,; or published it as
contemplated by the act, with the unusual precaution
taken by the phipper as here shown, it would have been
found and the loss complained of would never have occurred.
In this case after making a contract to ,pay freight, the
shipper is notified,-not that in thirty days the rate will
be increased,-but that this increase was made five or
six months before, has been effective that long, and is
now in full force and effect. What could the shipper do?
He is deprived of the usual thirty days in which he might
carry out his contract. He cannot obtain relief from the
purchaser. It is too late to appeal to the Interstate Commerce Commission, because the rate has already gone into
effect. There is absolutely no way to protect himself, and
without any fault on his part, but through the sole fault of
the carrier, he must suffer a loss, in this case of $1,960 unless the courts make that loss fall on the carrier, where it
belongs under the facts of this case.
Neither the shipper nor the agent could have had any
knowledge of any other tariff than the one establishing
the ten cent rate, because no other tariff had been published or filed and notice of no other tariff had been given.
It is also argued that the tariff in question was not required to be filed at Henderson, aind that such tariffs are
only required to be posted or filed'at points of origin.
The carrier however is required to publish and file its
tariffs at every station which is directly or indirectly affected by it. Re Passenger Tariffs, 2 I. C. C. Rep. 445;

Railroad Co. v. Hefley, 15.3 U. S. 98; Armour v. United
States, 209, U. S. 56.
The act provides that where a suit is brought involving
a question of unreasonableness of rate, or a question of
discrimination in rates, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal courts have jurisdiction. This

action, however, is upon neither of these grounds. This
is a case, as we have shown, based upon the common-law
right to recover damages for the negligent act of another.
The state court is bound by the. Federal statute, but it
has the same right to construe it that the Federal courts
have.
'The jurisdiction of the state-courts of cases arising under
the laws of the United States is concurrent with that of
the Federal courts, save and except where such jurisdiction is expressly prohibited. Federalist, No. 82; Plaquemines Fruit Co. v. Henderson, 170 U. S. 515; Section
711 of the Rev. Stat.'; West. Un. Tel. Co. v. Call Publishing Co., 18i U. S. 92; Galveston &c. R. Co. v. Wallace,
223 U. S. 481.
Memorandum opinion, by direction of the court, by
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE.

The Henderson Elevator Company, defendant in error,
as plaintiff below brought this action to recover damages
from the Railroad Company, the plaintiff in error, because
of a loss alleged to have been sustained by an erroneous

quotation by the agent of the Railroad Company of the
.freight rate on corn shipped in interstate commerce from
the station of the Railroad Company at Henderson,
Kentucky. A rate of 10 cents per hundred pounds was
quoted by the agent when in fact the rate as fixed by the
published tariff on file with the Interstate Commerce
Commission and effective at the time was 13 /2 cents
per hundred pounds. On the trial before a'jury the court
instructed that if the loss sustained by the plaintiff "was

occasioned and brought about by defendant's failure to
have posted or on file in its office inHenderson, Kentucky,
its freight tariff rate in question and by reason of any
erroneous quotation of. defendant of its freight rate from
and to the points in question, of which plaintiff com-

plains,
." there should be a verdict for the plaintiff.
A verdict having been rendered for the plaintiff in accordance with this instruction and the judgment entered
thereon having been subsequently affirmed by the Court
of Appeals of Kentucky (138 Kentucky, 220), this writ
of error was sued out.
It is to us clear that the action of the court below in
affirming the judgment of the trial court and the reasons
upon which that action wa. based were in conflict with
the rulings of this court inteipreting and applying the Act
to Regulate Commerce. New York Cent. R. R. v. United
States (No. 2), 212 U. S. 500, 504; Texas & Pacific R. R.
Co. v. Mvgg, 202 U. S. 242:; Gulf Railroad Co. v. Hefley,
158 U. S. 98. That the failure to post does not prevent
the case from being controlled by the settled rule established by the cases referred to is now beyond question.
