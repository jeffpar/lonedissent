DARNELL, EXECUTOR, v. STATE OF INDIANA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.
No. 78.

Argued December 9, 1912.-Decided December 23, 1912.

The statutes of Indiana taxing all shares in foreign corporations except
national banks owned by inhabitants of the State, and all shares in
domestic corporations the property whereof is not exempt or taxable to the corporation itself, are not unconstitutionai as contrary
to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution.
Quweie, whether such statutes deny equal protection of the law by discriminating against stock in corporations of other States, especially
as to those having property taxed within the State.
One not within the class claimed to be discriminated against cannot
raise the question of constitutionality of a statute on the ground that
it denies equal protection by such discrimination. Hatch v. Reardon,
204 U. S. 152, followed, and Spraigue v. Thompson, 118 U. S. 90,
distinguished.
A State may tax the property of domestic corporations and the stock
of foreign ones in similar cases. Kidd v. Alabama, 188 U. S.730.
174 Indiana, 143, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under
the commerce clause of certain sections of the tax statutes
of Indiana, are stated in the opinion.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

The taxing statutes of Indiana, as construed by the
courts of that State, violate the commerce clause of the
Federal Constitution.
Shares of stock in a corporation are property. The
owner of such' shares owns and holds them as property
separate and distinct from the capital stock' and tangible
property of the corporation. Seward v. Rising Sun, 79
Indiana, 351; Darnell v. State (Ind.), 90 N. E. Rep. 769;

Tennessee, 161 U. S. 134, :146; Farrington v. Tennessee,
N
95 U. S. 679, 687.
As such shares have a vslue independent of the party
owning them and are transported, held, bought, sold and
taxed like other property, they are subjects of interstate
commerce. Cases supra and Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168;
People v. Reardon, 184 N. Y. 431; aff'd 204 U. S. 152;
Champion v. Ames, 188 U. S. 321; International Text
Book Co. v. Pigg, 217 U. S. 91.
When the statute of a State, as construed by the courts
of that State, places a greater or more onerous burden
upon property coming from a foreign State than is imposed upon like property of domestic origin, it is void,
in so far as it discriminates, because in conflict with the
commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.
Darnell v. Memphis, 208 U. S. 113; Webber v. Virginia,

The protection afforded by the commerce clause of the
Constitution is not withdrawn or suspended after the
property of foreign origin has acquired a permanent situs
in the Str ie and is commingled with and merged into the
general mass of property .therein. It continues "until

The powers granted to the Federal Government and
the corresponding limitation of the powers of the various
States are not confined to the instrumentalities of commerce known or in use when the Constitution was adopted.
They keep pace with the progress of the country and
adapt themselves to the new developments of time and
circumstances. Pensacola Co. v. West. Un. Tel. Co., 96
U. S. 1.
The commerce clause was made a part of the Constitution to insure, as nearly as was consistent with the
reserved police powers of the States, absolute freedom of
commercial intercourse within the boundaries of the
United States. Under it the States are powerless to avail
themselves of the protective principle or theory, directly
or indirectly. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1; Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434; Cook v. Marshall County, 196 U. S.
261; Webber v. Virginia, 103 U. S. 344; Walling v. Michigan, 116 U. S. 446; Brown v. Houston, 114 U. S. 622.
As the taxing statutes of Indiana as construed by her
courts require all shares of stock in foreign corporations
to be listed for taxation, while exempting from taxation
like shares of stock in domestic corporations, they violate
the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United
States. See cases supra.
The Supreme Court of Indiana has practically admitted
that the taxing statutes of that State were so framed as
to call into play the protective theory. Cook v. Board
(Ind.), 92 N. E. Rep. 876; Hasley v. Ensley, 40 Ind.
App. 598.
The mere fact that when a domestic corporation goes
into another State and establishes an industry the law
requires the stockholders in such corporation to list their
stock for taxation, does not disprove the charge of discrimination.
The taxing statutes of Indiana, as construed by the
courts of that State, violate the Fourteenth Amendment.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

While the equal protection clause of the Constitution
permits classification for purposes of taxation, it forbids
an arbitrary classification-a classification without substantial basis. Like property under like circumstances
and conditions must be treated alike, both in the privileges conferred and the liabilities imposed. Where an
act of the legislature discriminates, it is void to that
extent. Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, 216 U. S. 400; Connolly
v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540; Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U. S. 27, 31; Hone Ins. Co. v. New York, 134
U. S. 594. Kidd v. Alabama, 188 U. S. 730, and Wright v.
Louisville &c. Ry. Co., 195 U. S. 219, distinguished. In
those cases stock in foreign corporations was not required
to be listed for taxation if the foreign corporation was
doing business and was taxed in the State whose statute
was attacked, and it appears that in Indiana the manifest
intent and purpose of the act is the development of home
industries, not by legitimate inducements, but by discrimination carried so far as to even penalize the owners
of stock in domestic corporations when such corporations
go out of the State to do business.
Mr. Morton Sevier Hawkins, with whom Mr. Thomas M.
Hpnan, Attorney General of Indiana, Mr. James E. McCullough, Mr. Edward B. Raub and Mr. Martin M. Hugg
were on the brief, for defendant in error:
The statutes of Indiana taxing shares of stock in a
foreign corporation held by a resident of Indiana do not
violate the commerce clause of the Constitution.
. A State has jurisdiction of all persons and things which

such property. Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 524; Bonaparte v. Tax Court, 104 U. S. 592.
In cases of intangible personal property the tendency of
modern authorities is to apply the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, and to hold that such property may- be
taxed at the domicile of the owner as the real situs of the
property. Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194,

In corporations four elements of taxable value are
sometimes found: 1, franchises; 2, capital stock in the
hands of the corporation; 3, corporate property; and,
4, shares of the capital stock in the hands of the individual
stockholders. Tennessee v. Whitworth, 117 U. S. 129, 136;

The owner of the stocks taxed was not engaged in commerce between the States; his shares of stock were not in
transit between or through any of the States; he had not

The fact that an article is manufactured for export to
another State does not of itself make it an article of interstate commerce, and the intent of the manufacturer does
not determine when the article or product passes from the

The taxing statutes of Indiana did not deny the owner
of these stocks the equal protection of its laws in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The rule of equality, in respect to the subject, only required the same means to be applied impartially to -all the
constituents of each class, so that the law shall operate
equally and uniformly upon all persons in similar circumstances. Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, 115 U. S. 321,

Under a state law imposing a transfer tax upon personal property within the State belonging to a nonresident at the time of his death, such transfer tax may be

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action brought by the State of Indiana for
taxes on stock of a Tennessee corporation owned by the
principal defendant. The Indiana statutes purport to tax
all shares in foreign corporations except national banks
owned by inhabitants of the State, and all shares in
domestic corporations when the property of such corporations is not exempt or is not taxable to the corporation itself. If the value of the stock exceeds that of the
tangible taxable property this excess also is taxed. Burns'
Indiana Stats., 1908, §§ 10143, 10233, 10234. The declaration was demurred to on the ground that the. statutes
were contrary to the commerce clause, Art. I, § 8, and

the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff,
174 Indiana, 143, and a writ of error was allowed.
The case is pretty nearly disposed of by Kidd v. Alabama, 188 U. S. 730, where the real matter of complaint,
that the property of the corporation presumably is taxed
in Tennessee, is answered. See also Wright v. Louisville
& Nashville R. R. Co., 195 U. S. 219, 222. But it is said
that the former decision does not deal with the objection
that the statutes work a discrimination against stock in
corporations of other States contrary to principles often
recognized. I. M. Darnell & Son Co. v. Memphis, 208
U. S. 113. The most serious aspect of this objection is
that the statutes of Indiana do not make allowance if a
foreign corporation has property taxed within the State.
But as to this it is enough to say that, however the statutes
may be construed in a case of that sort, the plaintiffs in
error do not show that it is theirs, and that as they do not
belong to the class for whose sake the constitutional
protection would be given, if it would, they cannot complain on that ground. Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U. S. 447,
457. Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U. S. 152, 160. If Spraigue v.

Thompson, 118 U. S. 90, contains an intimation contrary to
this rule, the decision was supported on other grounds,
and the rule nQ longer is open to dispute. Lee v. New Jersey, 207 U. S. 67, 70. Southern Ry. Co. v. King, 217 U. S.
524, 534. Lindsley v. Natural CarbonicGas Co., 220 U. S.
61,77, 78. Yazoo & MississippiValley R. R. Co. v. Jackson
Vinegar Co., ante, p. 217.
The only difference of treatment disclosed by the record
that concerns the defendants is that the State taxes the
property of domestic corporations and the stock of foreign
ones in similar cases. That this is consistent with substantial equality notwithstanding the technical differences
was decided in Kidd v. Alabama, 188 U. 9. 730, 732.
Judgment affirmed.
