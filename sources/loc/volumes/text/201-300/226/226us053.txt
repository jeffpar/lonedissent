SMITH AND OTHERS, TRADING UNDER THE
FIRM NAME OF STREET & SMITH, APPELLANTS, v. HITCHCOCK, POSTMASTER-GENERAL.
FRANK TOUSEY. PUBLISHER, A CORPORATION,
v. SAME.
APPEALS FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT

OF COLUMBIA.
Nos. 31, 32. Argued November 5, 6, 1912.-Decided November 18, 1912.
Even though a question of law be raised by an order of the PostmasterGeneral excluding matter from the mails, the court will not interfere
unless clearly of the opinion that the order is wrong. Bates & Guild
Co. v. Payne, 194 U. S. 106.
Every series of printed papers published at definite intervals is not
necessarily a periodical within the meaning of the provisions of the
act of March 3, 1879, c. 180, 20 Stat. 355, defining second-class mail
matter.
Books that axe expressly embraced by § 17 of the act of March 3, 1879,
as third-class matter and subject to the higher rate of postage cannot
be made second-class matter by simply publishing them at regular
intervals even though, as in t1is case, purporting to be a series of
adveitures of the same person. Houghton v. Payne, 194 U. S. 88.
"Periodical" as used in the act of March 3, 1879, implies that no single
number of a series is a complete book in itself.
As a general rule, with few exceptions, a printed publication is a book
within the meaning of § 17 of the act of March 3,"1879, when its contents are complete in themselvcs, deal wit.h a single subject, need no
continuation and have appreciable size; and so held that the publications involved in this case are books and not periodicals.
Where the point to be decided is a pure question of law which can be
reviewed by the courts, the' Postmaster-General satisfies the requirements of the act of March 3, 1901, c. 851, 31 Stat. 1099, 1107,
by simply hearing the party claiming to be aggrieved by an order
excluding matter from the mail; and one so heard and who is not prevented from offering material evidence cannot complain in the court
reviewing the order that he was denied a hearing under the act.
34 App. D. C. 521 and 535, affirmed.

Argument for Appellants.

226 U. S.

THE facts, which involve the validity of orders of the
Postmaster-General excluding appellants' publications
from. second-class mail privileges, are stated in the opinion.
Mr.J. J. Darlingtonand Mr.H. H. Glassie for appellants:
The order excluding appellants' publication from the
second class was not grounded on any provision of the
statute, but upon superadded limitations not found
therein. It is therefore void.
The exclusion of appellants' publications, whereby
they are indirectly destroyed, cannot be justified upon
the pretext of a personal literary and moral censorship
unknown to the law. Lewis Pub. Co. v. Wyman, 152
Fed. Rep. 787, 792; Weybridge v. Addison, 67 Vermont,
569, 575; Nat. Ry. Pub. Co. v. Payne, 30 Wash. Law
Rep. 341; Wedderburn v. Bliss, 12 App. D. C. 485, 493;
Garfield v. Spalding, 32 App. D. C. 154, 158; Myer v.
Peabody, 212 U. S. 78, 84; Londoner v. Denver, 210 U. S.
373, 385; 15 Op. Atty.-Gen. 346.
The exclusion was really grounded not on the act ofMarch 3, 1879, but upon the amended regulation of
July 17, 1901, already adjudged void. It is conceded that
appellant's publication complies with every specified condition prescribed by this statute as a test for admission.
There has been a long-continued and general acceptance of
this publication as a periodical. The construction of the

term "periodical" as accepted and acted on by the Post
Office Department .when appellant's publication was admitted is a construction contemporaneous with the act of
March 3, 1879, itself, afd thereafter' followed for twenty
years. That construction was, moreover, the established
construction of the same term in prior postal statutes and,
as such, was deliberately and studiously adopted by Congress in the framing of this act. Mason v. Fearson,9 How.

Irrespective of evidence as to intent of Congress,
appellants' publication is a periodical in the ordinary
meaning of the term.
The tests now set up by the Department are not within
the ratio.decidendi of Houghton vi Payne, but additions to
the requirements of the statute.
The exclusion is not based upon any settled, definite
or uniform construction of the statute; but arbitrarily.
discriminates between publications essentially similar.

The Postmaster-General has no power, by misconstruction'of law, to take away from the citizen his positive
legal right to have mail matter transported at the rate
fixed by statute. Such mistake of law does not bind the
courts or preclude their granting relief.
*The right to post mail matter at the rates established
by Congress is a fixed legal right which cannot be impaired
by the act of an administrative officer. The definition
of a word of common speech used as; a statutory term is
a pure question of law. Smith v. Powditch, 1 Cowper,

SMITH v. HITCHCOCK.
226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The Solicitor General for the appellee.
The former SolicitorGenera, Mr. Frederick W. Lehmann,
also filed a brief for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

These are bills to restrain the Postmaster-General
from revoking orders according second-class mail privileges
to the several plaintiffs-in the first named case in respect of a series of publications issued under the name
of the Tip Top Weekly, hi the second in respect of a
similar one entitled Work and Win. The ground of the
bills is that the privileges were annulled without granting
the hearing required by the act of March 3, 1901, c. 851,
31 Stat. 1099, 1107, and that the publications are periodical publications within the rmeaning of the act of March 3,
1879, c. 180, §§ 7, 10, 14; 20 Stat. 355, 358, 359, and therefore must be carried as second-class matter, by the very
terms of the law.
We will take up the second question first. The facts
are not in dispute and are alike in the two cases. The
publications are weekly, each containing a single story
complete in itself, but the same character is carried through
the series and the reader is led by announcements to
expect further tales after the one before him. Most of
the stories, are, by the same author. The element of
sequence may be indicated by a few of the titles in the
Tip Top Weekly: Frank Merriwell in Arizona; or, the
Mysteries of the Mine. 'Frank Merriwell's Friend; or,
Muriel the Moonshiner. Frank Merriwell's Double;
or, Fighting for Life. Frank Merriwell Meshed; or, the
Last of the Danites. Frank Merriwell's Magic; or, the
Pearl of Tangier. Frank Merriwell in London; or, The
Grip of Doom, etc., etc. There is nothing else in a number
except a roll of honor or list of some of those who have

226 U. S.

endeavored to increase the circulation of the series,
laudatory letters with insignificant comments, and a page
or two of inquiries as to physical culture purporting to
come from readers, with short replies, all more or less
incident to the muscular tenor of the tales. The publications measure about eleven by eight incheson the outside,
are said to contain about thirty thousand words, have
thirty-two pages, including a page of advertisement
and exclusive of the cover, of which twenty-six are filled
by the story. The front cover bears a colored illustration
of some incident narrated iAithin.
Thus a question of law is raised, although as suggested
in Bates & Guild Co. v. Payne, 194 U. S. 106, 108, we
should not interfere with the decision of the PostmasterGeneral unless clearly of opinion that it was wrong. Ibid.
110. American School of Magnetic Heating v. McAnnulty,
187 U. S. 94, 106. Public Clearing House v. Coyne, 194
U. S. 497, 509. We have no such clear opinion, as the
decision is pretty nearly if not wholly sustained by Hough-

ton v. Payne, 194 U. S. 88, and Smith v. Payne, 194 U. S.
104. Indeed the latter case dealt with The Medal Library,
which was a periodical publication of several issues of
the Tip Top Weekly bound together; as the principal
plaintiff now puts it, in book form, and it is true, reprinted
in a different size and shape. Some attempt was made
to reargue the law of the decisions just cited, but we do
not feel called upon to reopen the discussion in that part
of the appellants' brief.
It must be taken as established that not every series
of printed papers published at definite intervals is a periodical publication within the meaning of the law, even if it
satisfies the conditions for admission to the second class
set forth in § 14. Houghton v. Payne, 19.4 U. S. 88, 96.
It is established by the same authorities, that books, that
are expressly embraced in mail matter of the third class
by § 17 and so made liable to a higher rate of postage,

SMITH v. HITCHCOCK.
226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

cannot be removed from that class and brought into the
second, by the simple device of publishing them in a series
at regular intervals of time. It was suggested to be sure
that the distinction was between reprints of well-known
works and new matter, but we can -see nothing in that;
neither do we find much weight in the identity of authorship, the retention of the name of the hero through successive tales, or the ever renewed promise of further wonders
in the next. All these might co-exist and yet each number
might be a book, and. if so it goes into the third class.
"Mail matter of the third class shall embrace books."
§ 17.
The noun periodical, according to the nice shade of
meaning given to it by popular speeclh, conveys at least a
suggestion if not a promise of matter on a variety of topics,
and certainly implies that no single numbex is contemplated as forming a book by itself. But we can approach
the question more profitably from the other end, and shall
have gone as far as we need when we decide whether
the numbers exhibited constitute so many books. The
word book also, of course, has its ambiguities, and may
have different meanings according to the connection in
which it is used. For purpo:ses of copyright the common
monthly magazines may be books, yet they are not so
under the present § 17. -As books are not turned into
periodicals by number and sequence, the magazines are
not brought into the third class by having a considerable
number of pages stitched together. Without attempting
a definition we may say that generally a printed publication is a book when its contents are complete in themselves, deal with a single subject, betray no need of continuation, and, perhaps, have an appreciable size. There
may be exceptions, as there are other instances of books.
It hardly would be an exception if, where the object is
information and the subject-matter is a changing one,
a publication periodically issued giving information for

the time should be held to fall into the second class. From
this point of view the Tip Top Weekly and Work and Win
are books. They are large enough to raise no doubt on
that score; each volume is complete in itself and betrays
no inward need of more, notwithstanding that, as in the
highwayman stories of an earlier generation, further adventures to follow are promised at the end.
The decision that these weeklies are books shortens
what needs to be said as to the sufficiency of the hearing.
The parties were notified that they would be grantgd a
hearing at the office of the Third Assistant PostmasterGeneral, Washington, D. C., at a fixed day and hour, to
show cause why the admission to the second class should
not be revoked and the third class rate of postage charged,
on the ground that the issues were not periodical publications but were books. They sent a representative to
Washington who left a printed response in advance,
asking for further opportunity for argument if the authorities were, not satisfied, and who called at the appointed
time. He was referred to the Chief of the Classification
Division, the proper person.. Rev. Stat., § 161. Postal
Laws and Regulations, Ed. 1902, §§ 6, 19, subsect. 1, 8.
He saw him and asked. if the brief had been received, was
answered yes and then asked if the other had any questions
to ask and was answered no. He presented a pamphlet,
'The Influence of the Dime Novel' and departed, offering
no further argument, seemingly somewhat aggrieved
at not having seen the Third Assistant PostmasterGeneral in person. Subsequently, the, Assistant AttorneyGeneral for the Post Office Department was consulted
by the officials and in accordance with his opinion the
order was issued which the'plaintiffs seek to restrain.
The matter was argued to us with some feeling, and it
is not impossible that the interview gav.e an impression of
official indifference. But the plaintiffs allege in their bills
that the question was a pure question of. law; it was a ques-

tion that they had a Yight to have reviewed and have had
reviewed in this court; it was clearly defined; the official
was not called on to state reasons or to discuss-his only
duty was to hear, and beyond offering the printed brief
the plaintiff's representatives showed no desire to be
heard. This is not a case in which even by manner or
indirection the plaintiffs were prevented from offering
material evidence. The facts and the question were as
plain then as now. The conclusion reached was .right,
and in the circumstances disclosed we are of opinion that
the plaintiffs had no cause to complain.

FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH.
No. 446. Argued April 19, 22, 23, 1912.-Decided December 2, 1912.
The purchase' by the Union Pacific Railroad Company of forty-six
per cent of the stock of the Southern Pacific Company, with the resulting control of the latter's railway system by the former, is an
illegal combination in restraint of interstate trade within the purview 'of the Sherman Anti-trust Act of i890 and must be dissolved.
The Sherman Anti-trust Act of July .2,1890, 26 Stat. 209, c. 647, applies
