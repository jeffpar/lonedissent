OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Counsel for Parties.

226 U. S.

in Hardin v. Shedd, 190 U. S. 508, 519, and Whitaker v.
McBride, 197 U. S. 510, 515, and there is no need to decide
it now. It is enough to say that by virtue of its sovereignty the State of Iowa has an interest in the condition
of the lake sufficient to entitle it to maintain this suit
against an intruder without title, whether the State owns
the bed or not. This principle has been affirmed and
acted on by the court so recently that it does not require
further argument here. Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.,
206 U. S. 230, 237. Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter, 209
U. S. 349, 356. See also Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S.
46, 93. McGilvra v. Ross, 215 U. S. 70, 79.
Decree affirmed.

KALANIANAOLE v. SMITHIES, TRUSTEE OF
COCKETT.
ERROR* TO THE SUPREME

COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF

HAWAII.
No. 109.

Argued December 20, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.

On a pure matter of form as to the parties in a suit coming here from
a court of a Territory, and where the whole interest in a judgment
sued upon was before that court, this court should not go behind the
local practice.

A joint judgment ceases to be joint by the death of one of the parties.
Where the joinder of an executor of a party whose interest has ceased
is simply a mistake, it is not reversible error.

20 Hawaii, 138, affirmed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. C. IF.-Ashford, for plaintiff in error,- submitted.
Mr. Ralph P. Quarles, with whom Mr. A. L. C. Atkinson was on thl biief, for dcfcnclant in error.

KALANIANAOLE v. SMITHIES.
226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Memorandum opinion by direction of the court.

By

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES.

This is a suit on a deficiency judgment rendered upon
foreclosure of the mortgage that was under consideration
in Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349. The judgment was in favor of Polyblank, Trustee, and Cockett,
sole beneficiary, against Kawananakoa and the plaintiff
in error, Kalanianaole. Before the present suit was begun
the trustee resigned, Smithies was duly appointed successor in the trust and the former trustee assigmed the
judgment to him. Smithies and his beneficiary then
brought this action against, the plaintiff in error and the
executor of Kawananakoa who had died. The executor
demurred and had judgment. The plaintiff in error then
answered, setting up the discharge of the executor and
that the plaintiffs allowed the claim against the latter to
be barred by time before bringing suit. The case was
heard upon mutual admissions of the facts set up in the
declaration and answer. In argument the plaintiff in
error also objects that only the original judgment creditors
could sue. Both objections were sufficiently answered in
the court below. That as to the plaintiffs is pure matter
of form, on which we should not go behind the local practice. The whole interest in the judgment was before the
court. As to the second, the judgment was sued upon as
a joint judgment, but it ceased to be joint by the death of
one of the parties bound, as is the nature of joint obligations. Edsar v. Smart, T. Raym. 26; Y. B. 3 ed. 3, 11, pl.
37. See 2 Vernon, 99. The joinder of the executor was
simply a mistake that did no harm. See Bierce V. Hutchins, 205 U. S. 340, 347.
Judgment affirmed.
