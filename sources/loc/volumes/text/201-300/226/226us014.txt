town, we can do neither. There is no question of law before us-for it hardly was argued, and could not be with
any seriousness, that the Supreme Court was not autlfiorized to review the evidence under § 497 of the Philippine Code, or that this court can consider whether it was

right in finding the preponderance of evidence to be on
the defendant's side.

UNITED STATES, CINCINNATI AND COLUMBUS
TRACTION COMPANY, AND INTERSTATE
COMMERCE COMMISSION v. BALTIMORE AND
OHIO SOUTHWESTERN RAILROAD COMPANY
AND THE NORFOLK AND WESTERN RAILWAY
COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COMMERCE COURT.
No. 648.

Argued October 25, 28, 1912.-Decided November 11, 1912.

Under § 7 of the act of June 18, 1910, 36 Stat. 539, 547, c. 309, the
Interstate Commerce Commission cannot require a main trunk road
to make switch connections with a road which is not actually at the
time a lateral branch road.
In this case held, that a railroad parallel with a main trunk line and
operated by a traction company as an independent venture and not
as a mere feeder was not a lateral branch railroad within the meaning
of § 7 of the act of June.18, 1910.
An 'order to maintain through rates incident to a requirement to make
switch connections is incidental thereto and falls with it.
Quwre whether parties are bound in a higher court by findings based
on specific investigations made by the lower tribunal without notice.
See Oregon R. R. Co. v. Fairchild,224 U. S. 510, 525.
195 Fed. Rep. 962, affirmed.

Argument for Appellants.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission to require carriers to establish switch connections, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Denison, with whom
Mr. Thurlow M. Gordon, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, was on the brief, for the United States and Mr.
Charles W. Needham for Interstate Commerce Commission, appellants:
The words "lateral branch line" as used in the American
statutes prior to their adoption by Congress would have
permitted either of the rai lroad lines to construct this
traction line under charters authorizing their construction
of "lateral branch lines." Newhall v. Galena &c. R. R., 14
Illinois, 273, 274; McAboy's Appeal, 107 Pa. St. 548, 557;
Vollmer v. Schuylkill &c. Ry. Co., 115 Pa. St. 166; B. &
0. R. R. v. Waters, 105 Maryland, '396; Greenville & Hudson Ry. Co. v. Grey, 62 N. J.. Eq. 768, 770; Florida &c. R.
Co. v. Pensacola &c. R. Co., 10 Florida, 145, 165, 169;
Blanton v. Richmond &c. R. R., 86 Virginia, 618; Wheeling
Bridge Co. v. Camden Oil (70., 35 W. Va. 205; Howard
County v. Bank, 108 U. S. 3.14.
The purpose of Congress in providing for switch connection with "lateral branch lines" was to provide an
outlet for shippers who were dependent upon such outlet
for reasonable access to the main arteries of interstate
commerce. I. C. C. v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co. (Rahway
Case), 216 U. S. 531. So long as the traction line in its
dominant and principal character served shippers to
whom the track connection was necessary to give them
such an outlet into interstate commerce, it was a "lateral
branch line" within the meaning of Congress. This conclusion of fact was found by the Commission not only
from the geographical situation but from the commercial
and industrial situation and the distribution of the population.

Argument for Appellants.

226 U. S.

The order did not lack the technical prerequisites as to
proper parties and prior formal request in writing. Act
to Regulate Commerce, § 13, as amended June 18, 1910.
The order is not invalid because it did not require the
Traction Company to furnish security for the expense of
installing the switch connection. Wisconsin &c. R. R. v.
Jacobson, 179 U. S. 287, 302; State v. Chi., M. & St. P. Ry.

Kansas, 649; 0. R. & N. Co. v. Fairchild,224 U. S. 510.
The order compelling through routes was constitutional and within the Commission's statutory power.

Neither the order nor the act required the petitioners to
send their own cars beyond their own rails. Central Stock
Yards v. L. & N R. R. Co., 192 U. S. 568, 571; Burlington

Cent. Stock Yards v. L. & N. Ry., 192 U. S. 568, 572.
The order is not void because, as to the physical condition of the Traction Company's line, the Commission
supplemented the testimony of witnesses by independent
investigation. This independent investigation was justifloDLhe
ground as supports the right of a jury to
"view" thesame
subject-matter
in controversy. Cederberg v.

However, judicial analogy should not control because

Opinion of the Court.

226 U. S.

20 I. C. C. Rep. 486. The Commerce Court made a decree as prayed, 195 Fed. Rep. 962, and an appeal was taken
to this court. The facts material to our decision are as
follows. The Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad
and the Norfolk and Western Railway are trunk, lines of
steam railroads running east and west across the State
of Ohio. After almost touching each other at Norwood,
a suburb of Cincinnati, they draw apart, the-former in a
northerly, the latter in a southerly direction, but come
together again at Hillsboro about fifty-three miles further
to the east. The line of the Traction Company is an 'interurban' electric railway, for passengers and some freighit,
running under a state charter between Norwood and Hillsboro through the middle of the dic--ond. enclosed by the
steam roads, and authorized to go on to Columbus. For'
a number of miles easterly from Norwood to Stonelick,
near Boston, the last mentioned road is very fiear and
almost parallel to the tracks of one or the other of the
steam roads, as it is again for the last five miles before
reaching Hillsboro. In the intervening space, between
Boston and Dodsonville, the towns and villages on the
electric line are from five to ten or twelve miles by wagon
distant from the nearest station on one of the steam Yoads.
The Traction Company applied to .the Commission for
switch connections and they were ordered as we have said.
Some technical objections were raised, but the substantial question is whether the Traction Company is a "lateral, branch line of railroad" within the meaning of the
first section of the Act to Regulate Commerce, amended
by act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, § 7, 36 Stat. 539, 547.
That section requires carriers subject to the act to establish switch connections with such lines on certain conditions; and, as amended, permits owners of such lines as
well as shippers to make complaint to the Commission
in case of the carriers' failure upon written application,
and authorizes the Commission to hear, investigate and

Opinion of the Court.

determine whether the conditions exist, and to make an
order directing-the carrier to comply with the act. It
will be seen without much argument that, unless the Traction Company is a lateral, branch line of railroad, the
trunk line carriers, the appellees, are not subject to the
requirement of the statute, so far as the Traction Company is concerned.
The words 'lateral, branch line' do not refer to what the
applicant may become or be made by order of the ,Con.mission but to what it already is when it applies. The
power of the Commission does not extend to ordering a
connection wherever it sees fit, but is limited to a certain
and somewhat narrow clas3 of lines. The most obvious
examples of such lines are those that are dependent upon
and incident to the main ine:--feeders, such as may be
built from mines or forests -to bring coal, ore or lumber to
the main line for shipment. We agree with the Commerce
Court that the Traction Company is not Within this class.
It is an independent venture, in its general course parallel
to, more or less competing with, the steam roads and
working on a different plan.. Presumably and so far as
appears it was built and would have been run without
regard to the existence* of the steam roads. The cases
cited on behalf of the appellants as to the power of railroad
companies to construct branch roads under their charter
do not apply. There the determination of the company
fixes the character of the branch; it builds the branch
from the beginning as incident to the purposes of the
company. But here, as we have said, this determination
of the Commission that the applicants shall be a branch
is not enough; the applicant must be a branch before it
applies. That is the absolute and reasonable condition.
-That some shippers would be accommodated by a switch
connection is not enough.
The order to maintain through routes was incident
:to. the requirement of switch connections and fags with it.

Syllabus.

226 U. S.

We understand that it was based on the assumption that
the connections were to be made, and therefore do not
go into the question of power under § 15.
It is unnecessary to consider objections to the conclusion of the Commission that it was safe and reasonably
practicable, &c., to establish the switch. We remark that
it is stated in the Commission's report that they base
their conclusion more largely upon their own investigation
than upon the testimony of the witnesses. It would be
a very Strong proposition to say that the parties were
bound in the higher courts by a finding based on specific
investigations made in the case without notice to them.
See Washington, ex rel. Oregon R. R. & Nay. Co. v. Fairchild, 224 U. S. 510, 525. Such an investigation is quite
different from a view by a jury taken with notice and
subject to the order of a court, and different again from
the question of the right of the Commission to take notice
of resultsreached by it in other cases, when its doing so
is made to appear in the record and the facts thus noticed
are specified, so that matters of law are saved.
