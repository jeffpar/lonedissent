by the record proper, independently of the special finding.
Campbell v. United States, 224 U. S. 99. But the party on
jury trial may reserve his exceptions, take a bill of exceptions and have a review upon writ of error in the manner
we have pointed out.
It is insisted for the Government that inasmuch as the
hearing in the Circuit Court of Appeals upon appeal was
without objection by the claimant, the jurisdictional objection was waived. We cannot take that view. As we
construe the statute, the Circuit Court of Appeals had no
jurisdiction upon the appeal, and neither the action of
the court nor the consent of the parties could give it. Leo

As the Circuit Court of Appeals, in our opinion, proceeded without jurisdiction by reason of the appeal, this
court, having acquired jurisdiction, should reverse the
judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals and remand the
case to that court with instructions to dismiss the appeal
for want of jurisdiction. Union & Planters'Bank v. Memphis, 189 U. S. 71.

TOYOTA v. TERRITORY OF HAWAII.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY. OF
HAWAII.
No. 49.

Submitted November 13, 1912.-Decided December 2, 1912.

Section 1343, Revised,Laws of Hawaii, imposing a license fee of sixhundred dollars for auctioneers in the district of Honolulu and
fifteen dollars for each other taxation district, is not unconstitutional

as depriving an auctioneer in Honolulu of his property without due
process of law or as denying him the equal protection of .the laws.
On writ of error to a territorial court only such questions-are before this
court as can be raised upon, writ of error to a state court.
-What amounts to selling at auction, wiihin the meaning Qf a license
statute, is for the state or territorial court to determine, aud presents
no Federal question reviewable'by this court.
It is the province of the legislature to determine upon the, amount of
license fees,- and unless the classification is arbitrary and. unreasonable it may establish different amounts for different districts.
This court will assume that the-legislature of a State or Territory takes
into consideration the varying conditions in respective localities in
which the same business4s to be conducted,and unless palpably arbitrary the classification will not be disturbed.
In view of the fact that the great bulk of the business of Hawaii is done
at Honolulu this court will not declare that a license fee of six hundred dollars for auctioneers in that district is an arbitrary and unreasonable classification as against fifteen dollars for auctioneer's
license in other districts of Hawaii.
19 Hawaii, 651, affirmed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. D. W. Burchard and Mr. A. L. C. Atkinson for
plaintiff in error:
The power of the legislature pf Hawaii under the Organic Act to :license the occupation of auctioneer is conceded. Its power to do so by a law like that in question
here, where auctioneers -in the Territory are classified
arbitrarily, with regard to locality, and with utter disregard to amount of population or amount of business

done, is denied' In the case of Trust Company v. Treas;
urer, 19 Hawaii, 262, the Supreme Court judicially determined the numerical population of the various taxing
districts, as follows: Honolulu, almost 40,000; Hilo,
almost 20,000, and all others less than Hilo. The numerical population of these districts is a part of the history of
the Territory, and it was the duty of the District Court
and of the Supreme Court to take judicial notice of the
same.

In the absence of any showing to the contrary the presumption is that these different districts so far as the
occupation in question is concerned, do a volume of business proportionately to their respective population.
The statute in question imposes a burden upon the
plaintiff in error and others engaged in the occupation of
auctioneer in the district of Honolulu unequal to that
imposed upon others engaged in the same occupation in
other districts; it denies the equal protection of the law
to the plaintiff in error and others engaged in auctioneering in Honolulu; it takes from the plaintiff in error his
property, without due process of law. Ho Ah Kow v.

The statute, because of its' discriminating nature, the
imposition by it of burdens upon some which are not
placed upon others, violates the letter and spirit of § 55
of 'the Organic Act creating the Territory of Hawaii, in
that it exempts individuals outside of Honolulu from a
burden placed upon the residents of Honolulu.
The stipulated facts do not show a public auction
within the purview of the statute.
The language of the statute contemplates a public
auction. The word " public" is not used in § 1343, nor in
§ 1344, but § 1345 prescribes a bond to the effect that the
auctioneer "will not sell goods," etc., "except at publicauction." The statute being penal must be strictly con-,
strued. Wharton's Crim. Law (10th ed.), § 28; Clark's
Crim. Law (2d ed.), p. 31.
The legislature intended by, the word "auction" in the
statute a "public" auction or one made in the usual way.
See Black's Law Dictionary for definition of the word
".auction"'; Bateman on Auctions, pp. 1, 2.
The stipulated facts show that the sale of fish was not
to the highest bidder, but that the bids were confined to
one class of persons,' namely, the retail dealers in fish, and
that the general public were excluded. See 1 Greenleaf

The license is forty times' as great as in Hilo and other
districts within the -Territory of Hawaii, and violates the
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution 'in that it takes
from such person his property without due process'of law,

of. Hawaii, and denies to the plaintiff in error the equal
protection of the law.
Mr. Alexander Lindsay, Jr., Attorney General of Hawaii,
Mr. Charles Ri Hemenway and Mr. E. W. Sutton, Deputy
Attorney General, for defendant in error:
The Hawaiian law requiring a higher license fee for
auctioneers in the district of Honolulu than in other taxation districts of the Territory does not constitute arbitrary
discrimination and is not contrary to the, equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendient to the Constitution.
The guarantee of equal protection contained in the
•EIourteenth Amendment has been considered so many
times by our courts that there can be no doubt as to the
limitations which it places upon the power of the States.
The Amendment was designed to prevent laws discriminating against some and favoring others of the same
class-arbitrary and unreasonable discriminations. It
was not designed- to prohibit the States from enacting
laws which classify the ojbjects of taxation so long as the
classification is reasonable and all persons within the class
are treated alike. Nor was it designedto prevent a State
from diversifying its legislation in this regard to meet.
diversities in situations and conditions within its borders.

Judged from the principles enunciated in these cases,
the Hawaiian statute requiring a higher license fee for
auctioneers in Honolulu than elsewhere is clearly constitutional, for the difference in license fees is based upon a
difference not only in population, but in the amount of
business transacted in the different places. Trust Company v. Treasurer, 19 Hawaii, 262.
It is not sufficient ground for holding such a statute
unconstitutional that it may possibly be arbitrary and
unreasonable, but it must be as a matter of fact actually arbitrary and unreasonable. Heath & Milligan v.

The classification made by the act in question is reasonable and based upon differences in conditions which
justify it, and consequently the act is not in conflict with
the Fourteenth Amendment.
With regard to decisions of territorial courts, the rule is
that this court "will lean toward lhe interpretation" of
the territorial court. The Supreme Court of Hawaii having construed the law with regard to auctioneers and
having reached the conclusion that the sale conducted by
this defendant was within the meaning of the Hawaiian
statute, and this construction not involving any Federal
question, this court will consider the decision upon those
points as having great weight if not decisive. Missouri,

The sale conducted by Toyota was a auction within
the meaning of the Hawaiian statute. .
MR. JUSTCE@ HUGHES delivered the-opinion of the court.

:The plaintiff in error, was -convicted in. the District
Courtrf-HIonolulu.Hawaii, of the offense of selling goods
at auction,- in Honolulu,.without an auctioneer's license,
-hdwas s.ntenced to pay a fine of six hundred dollars and•
costs. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and
the case. comes here on error.
.In. order to obtain a lipense for auction .sales it was
.ne~essary to pay the fee prescribed .by § 1343 of the Revised Laws of the Territory of Hawaii, which provides:
* "The annual fee for a license to sell goods, waxes and
merchandise or other property at auction, shall be six
hundied dollars for the district: of Honolulu, and fifteen
dollars for each other taxation district."
An agreed statement of facts showed that the plaintiff
in error was the agent of, the*corporation known as the
"Hawaiian Fisheries, Limited," which'handled fish daily
fora large number of fishermen. The catah was brought
to. the market in Honolulu, where the plaintiff in error
,.offered it in basket lots; each basket containing from 70
to 100 pounds, to the retail dealers of fish only, the one
bidding the highest pricebecomingthe puichaser.
The plaintiff in error contended in the territorial court
that he did not sell at auction:within the meaning of the.
statute, and further, that the statute, if it was applicable.
denied to him the'equal protection of the laws contrary to'
the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United 'States because of the discriminatio4 between the

Opinion of the Court.

district of Honolulu and other districts in the amount of
the license fees imposed.
The Supreme Court of Hawaii assumed, as the plaintiff
in error argues, that the word "auction" in § 1343 means
public auction. This conclusion was reached in the light
of the,requirement of § 1345 that the bond to be given by
the person receiving the license should contain a provision that he will not sell "except at public auction";
and, the court ruled that the sales conducted by the plaintiff in error were. sales at public auction within the contemplation of the statute although bids were accepted
only from the retail dealers or the persons conducting fish
tables at the market. This ruling presents no Federal
question and hence is not reviewable here, as only such
questions are before us upon this writ of error as could be
raised upon a writ of error to a state court. Act of April 30,
1900, c. 339, §86, 31 Stat. 1.41, 158; Equitable Life A8sur,ance Society v. Brown, 187 U. S. 308, 309; Notley v. Brown ,
208 U. S. 429, 440. In view of the amount involved, the
case cannot in any view come within the amendment
made by the act of March 3, 1905, c. 1465, § 3, 33 Stat.
1035; Honolulu Transit Co. v. Wilder, 211 U. S. 144.
The remaining contention, urged in various forms by.
the assignments of error, comes to the single point that
the.statute created an arbitrary classification. It cannot
be said, however, that there was no reasonable basis for a
distinction between Honolulu and other districts. And
it was the province of the legislature to decide upon the
amount of the fees which should be charged. It must be
assumed that in so deciding it took into account varying
conditions in the respective localities, as, forexample, in
the amount. of business. transacted and -in the corresponding value of .such licenses., Necessarily, as was said in
Magoun v. Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, 170 U. S.
283, 294, the power of classification "must have a wide
range of discretion." It is not reviewable "unless pal-

Co.- v. Martell, 222 U. S. 225, 235. With its intimate
knowledge of local conditions, the Supreme Court of the
Territory said upon this point: "The great bulk of the
business of the Territory is done in Honolulu. It is not
for us to say whether we would make the difference in the
amount of license fees in this case as.large as the legislature has made it. It is sufficient that we cannot say that
the difference is unreasonable or that the statute is unequal or arbitrary in its operation." We find no ground
for a different conclusion.

ERROR TO\THE

SUPREME' COURT OF THE STATE OF

No. 464.

Su1mitted October 28, 1912.-Decided December 2, 1912.,

The decision by the state court that an article is within the prohibition of.a: state statute is binding here.

The protection. accorded by the Federal Constitution -to interstate
-commerce does not extend beyond the sale in original packages as
imported; and a contract made in one State for delivery of liquor in
another State which does not limit the sale in the latter State to
original packages encounters the local statute and cannot be enforced
if contrary thereto.
Where there have been no purchases and no deliveries under a contract
for delivery of liquor,, but the vendee has given notice of refusal to
accept because the contract is illegal in the State of deliveiy, the
state court, in sustaining the illegalitjr of the contract, does not deny
the seller the right to sell the article or have-it transported in interstate commerce.
