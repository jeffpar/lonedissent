." there should be a verdict for the plaintiff.
A verdict having been rendered for the plaintiff in accordance with this instruction and the judgment entered
thereon having been subsequently affirmed by the Court
of Appeals of Kentucky (138 Kentucky, 220), this writ
of error was sued out.
It is to us clear that the action of the court below in
affirming the judgment of the trial court and the reasons
upon which that action wa. based were in conflict with
the rulings of this court inteipreting and applying the Act

PRESTON v. CITY OF CHICAGO.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 195.

Submitted December 1.6, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.

Whether a state officer is within the classified service and not subject
to removal under the Civil Service Act of the State is a matter for
the state court to determine, and its ruling is binding upon this court
and presents no Federal question. Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U. S. 548.
Where the judgment of the state court rests upon non-Federal
questions sufficient to support it, such as laches and long delay,
this court cannot review the judgment upon the ground that a
Federal question also exists. Moran v. Horsy, 178 U. S.205.

sider any rights which petitioner may have in 6.fund of which he may
be deprived without due process of law, and the judgment dismissing
for want of jurisdiction does not conclude his rights in that respect.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of this court
to review judgments of the state court by writ of error, are
stated in the opinion.
Mr. John W. Beckwith and Mr. W. H. Sexton for the
defendants in error, in support of motion to dismiss or
affirm:
If the decision of the state court is upon grounds broad
enough to support the judgment independent of any
Federal question, there is no Federal issue involved in the
case so as to give this court jurisdiction and it will not
entertain a writ of error. Rutland Railroad Co. v. Central

Memorandum opinion, by direction -of the court, by
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE.WHITE.

Upon the assertion that he had been" wrongfully dropped
"from' the pay roll of the policemen, of the City of Chicago," plaintiff in error commenced proceedings in mandamus in the state court to compel the placing of his
name upon the said. pay rolls to the end that he might
thereafter draw the pay alleged to be due him as a police
patrolman " as the other police patrolmen in said city of
Chicago are paid." This writ of error is prosecuted to a
judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois (246 Illinois,
26); affirming a judgment sustaining a demurrer to the
petition in mandamus and denying the writ.

and passed upon by the Supreme Court of Illinois was one
to the effect that he had become an officer of the classified
service and entitled to the protection against removal conferred by an act, styled the Civil Service Act and that
hence his removal from office without written charges preferred against him and -without notice and an opportunity
to be heard amounted to a denial of due process of law
within the purview of the state constitution and of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States. But the court below held these claims not maintainable on the ground that upon a proper' construction of
the state statutes the petitioner was not in the classified
service, and was subject to removal. This ruling is binding upon us and presents no Federal question. Taylor v.
Beckham, 178 U. S. 548. Even, however, if we were at
.liberty to disregard the action of the state court and attribute to the plaintiff in error the status claimed by him,
as in addition the court below held that the right to the
relief prayed was in any event barred by long delay and
laches, this would be sufficient to prevent us from reviewing the alleged Federal question. Moran v. Horsky,
178 U. S. 205, 207.
It is strenuously insisted in argument that the plaintiff
in error was entitled to participate in a police pension
fund to. which he had contributed from his wages for a
long period of time, and therefore to remove him was additionally to deprive him of property without due process
of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. But
the specific relief prayed was a writ of mandamus to restore
plaintiff in error to the pay rolls as a policeman. What if
any rights- in the pension fund referred to were protected'
by the Constitution of the United States we therefore
may not here consider, and that question from a Federal
point of view is not concluded by the judgment dismissing
the writ of error which we shall enter.
Writ of error dismissed.
