have alimony on a divorce decreed in favor of the husband,
(Harris v. Harris, 31 Gratt. 13), it is plin that such a
decree forecloses any right of the wife to have alimony or
equivalent maintenance from her husband under the law
of Virginia.
From this it results that the Court of Appeals of the
District of Columbia correctly held that the Virginia decree barred the wife's action for maintenance in the courts
of this District.
Decree affirmed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

226 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This case comes here on appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Claims dismissing appellant's petition after hearing the merits and denying a motion for a new trial. 44
Ct. Cl. 549; 45 Ct. Cl. 169. Briefly, the facts are that the
appellant, who was a chief of division and disbursing
clerk of the Enterior Department, receiving a salary of
$2,000 per year, and was also disbursing clerk of the
architect, of the Capitol, for which he received annual
compensation of $1,000, was appointed by the Secretary
of the Interior on August 10, 1901, to act as a special disbursing agent to disburse an appropriation of $925,000
provided by the acts of June 6, 1900, and March 3, 1901,
31 Stat. 588, 619, c. 791, and 1133, 1163, c. 853, for the
construction of additional buildings in the extension of
the Government Hospital for the Insane in the District
of Columbia. Further appropriations having been made
by Congress, viz.: for an office and administration building $145,000, and for a central heating and lighting plant
for the entire hospital $260,000, appellant was directed
by the Secretary, under date January 5, 1903, to disburse
these appropriations under his original appointment; and
similar action was taken May 16, 1904, directing him to
disburse an appropriation for painting the new buildings.
Appellant accepted the appointment and gave bonds,
first in the sum of $25,000, and afterwards in the additional sum of $75,000; he entered upon the duties and
faithfully discharged them, and disbursed between August,
1901, and June, 1905, the sum of $1,410,761.87. In the
order appointing him it was stated that for the service of
disbursing the appropriation he would be allowed the
maximum compensation permitted by law, not exceeding
three-eighths of one per cent. The appointment of a
special agent to make the disbursements was, in the
judgment of the Secretary of the Interior, a necessity.

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

During the time appellant acted as such special disbursing
agent he continued to hold the office of disbursing clerk
of the Interior Department and to act as disbursing clerk
of the architect of the Capitol, and for the performance of
these duties received the salary and compensation first
mentioned. For the special service of disbursing the appropriations for the Government Hospital he presented
a claim for $5,290.36, payment of which was refused by
the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, on
the ground that at the time the special service was rendered he was holding two offices under the United States,
the emoluments of which exceeded $2,500 a year, and that
the charge for such special service was in violation of
§§ 1763 and 1765, Rev. Sfat., inasmuch as the act under
which the appropriation was made did not provide for a
special allowance to an agent for disbursing it.
Three sections that stand side by side in the Revised
Statutes should be quoted:
"SEc. 1763. No person who holds an office, the salary
or annual compensation attached to which amounts to
the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars, shall receive compensation for discharging the duties of any other
office, unless expressly authorized by law.
"SEc. 1764. No allowance or compensation shall be
made to any officer or clerk, by reason of the discharge.
of duties which belong to any other officer or clerk in the
same or any other Department; and no allowance or
compensation shall be made for any extra services whatever, which any officer or clerk may be required to perform, unless expressly authorized by law.
"SEc. 1765. No officer in any branch of the public
service, or any other person whose salary, pay, or emoluments are fixed by law or regulations, shall receive any
additional pay,'extra allowance, or compensation, in any
form whatever, for the disbursement of public money, or
for any other service or duty whatever, unless the same is

authorized by law, and the appropriation therefor explicitly states that it is for such additional pay, extra
allowance, or compensation."
It seems to us that the appointment of the appellant as
"special disbursing agent" was not an appointment to a
separate and distinct office from those already held by
him, but was merely an order requiring him to perform
additional services in the way of disbursing public moneys.
This being so, payment for the extra services is prohibited
by the terms of § 1765, Rev. Stat., without reference to
the fact that the appellant already held offices whose
salary or- annual compensation amounted to more than
two thousand five hundred dollars. The case is within
the authority of Woodwell v. United States, 214 U. S. 82.
The fact that in the present case it was understood that
the appellant should have additional pay makes this case
different in its circumstances, but does not render inapplicable the statutory prohibition.
Judgment affirmed.

MISSOURI, KANSAS AND TEXAS RAILWAY COMPANY v. WULF.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 517.

Argued December 3, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.

Where the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court does not depend entirely
on diverse citizenship but is also founded upon a Federal statute
and the amount exceeds one thousand dollars, the judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals is not final under § 6 of the Judiciary Act
of 1891.
