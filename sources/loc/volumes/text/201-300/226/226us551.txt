THOMPSON v. THOMPSON.
APPEAL FROM' THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT

OF CCLUMBIA.
No. 45. Argued November 8, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.
Notwithstanding the obligation to make continuing payments for
maintenance of a wife and children is not, even when fixed by judicial decree, in the nature of a technical debt, it may, when so. fixed,
be estimated on expectancy-of life, and the total amount may sustain
a jurisdiction based on amount involved.
'Statutory :maintenance is assimilated to alimony under § 980 of the
Code of the "Districtof Columbia.
In this case, as the amount due under a judgment of the Supreme Court
of theiDistrict of Columbia for support and maintenance at the rate
of $75.00 a month together with amount to accrue due during expectancy of life of the wife 'amoumts to over $5,00,, this court has jurisdiction under the act of Fdbruary 9, 1893.
...
The words "every court within the Ui ted States" as used in § 905,
Rev. Stat., carrying into effect the full faitli and credit clause of the
Constitution, inchide the courts of theDistrict of Columbia.
The full faithand credit clause of the Federal Constitution, and the
- 'statutes enacted thereunder do not apply to judgments rendered by
a court having no jurisdiction.
Under the prior decisions of this court, service of the summons in a suit.
for diVorce may be by publication if brought in a court of the State
'of matrimonial domicile. Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155; Haddock v. Haddock, 201.U. S. 562.
The state in which the parties were married, where they resided after
marriige, and where the husband resided until the action for divorce
was brought, is the matrimonial domicile and has jurisdiction over
the absent wife.
A decree of divorce is not valid even when granted by a court of the
State of matrimonial domicile except on actual notice to the defendant, or, if a non-resident, by publication according to the law of the
State.
Where the law of the State of matrimonial domicile permits the affidavit on which an order of service by publication is granted to be

made on information and belief, the court acquires jurisdiction and
the judgment based thereon is entitled' to full faith and credit in the
courts of other States.
This court is bound to assume, in the absence of any general law or
policy of a State to the contrary being shown, -that where the court
adjudges the proceedings to be in accord with proper practice that
such ii the case.
Although an affidavit used as a basis for an order of publication of the
summons may' be defective in the mode of stating.material facts, if
the facts are stated, the judgment, though voidable on direct attack,
is not void on its face and coram non judice.
Where the courts of a State have held that a wife may by'her conduct
forfeit the right to the support of her husband, and cannot have
alimony on a divorce decreed in his favor, the courts of other States
must give the decree full faith and credit.as foreclosing the right of
the wife to have alimony and a bar to a suit for maintenance in thecourts of other States.
35 App. D. C. 14, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the degree of -faith and credit to
be given by the courts of the District of Columbia to a

judgment of divorce obtained in Virginia on service of
the summons by publication, are stated in the opinion.
Mr.William M. Lewin for appellant:

This court has jurisdiction. Section 980 of the Code is
declaratory of the inherent powers of a court of equity,
and alimony and maintenance mean the same thing.'
Lesh v. Lesh, 21 App. D. C. 475, 488.
Prior to the e"'ect of the Code the amount of alimony,
even when in arrears, might, for cause shown, be changed
by the court. Tolman v. Leonard, 6 App. D. C. 224,
233; Davis v. Davis, 29 App. D. C. 258, 263.

The Code provides for enforcement of decrees of the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and a decree\
for alimony, or maintenance, is no exception to this rule.
It is subject to immediate execution, and is appealable.

THOMPSON v. THOMPSON.

226 U. S.

Argument for Appellant.

The court's discretion %sto the amount is, in the first
instance, judicial, not arbitrary. The discretion as to
future installments is equally so, and such installments
will not be interfered with except for good cause shown.
Weber v. Travelers' Ins. Co., 45 Fed. Rep. 657; Langan
v. Langan, 86 California, 132, 133; McCaddinv. McCaddin,
116 Maryland, 567, 574.
It is not necessary that the amount in controversy
should be expressly stated in the bill of complaint. United
States v. Freight Association, 166 U. S. 290, 310; Ex parte
Bradstreet, 7 Pet. 634, 647.
The appellate jurisdiction of this court extends to all
cases in which there is a final decree involving more than
five thousand dollars.
The decree of the Court of Appeals, from which this
appeal is taken, is undoubtedly a final decree, and its
finality is not affected by the fact that leave is given to
apply at the foot of the decree, C. & P. Tel. Co. v. Manning, 186 U. S. 238, 241; French v. Shoemaker, 12 Wall.
86, 98; Red River Cattle Co. v. Needham, 137 U. S. 632, 635.
A claim of alimony, even pendente lite, may afford the
basis of this court's jurisdiction on appeal. De La Rama v.
De La Rama, 201 U. S. 303, 318.
" The fact that the decree provides that payment shall be
made periodically, instead of in solido, does not affect
the question of jurisdiction, as the amount of the possible,
indeed reasonably probable, payments under the decree
will exceed five thousand dollars. B. & 0. S. W. R. R. v.
United States, 220 U. S. 94, 106.
In determining the amount involved, for the purpose
of appeal, the scope of the inquiry may be, and generally
is, broader in a suit in equity than in a case at law. Stinson v. Dousman, 20 How. 461, 466-467; N. E. Mortgage
Co. v. Gay, 145 U. S. 123, 131-132; Troy v. Evans, 97
U. S. 1, 3; Marshzllv. Holmes, 141 U. S. 463, 595.
Jurisdictionin this case is measured by the value of

226 U. S.

the right to be protected, and not by the value of some
mere isolated element of that right. Berryman v. Whitman College, 222 U. S. 334, 346.
Statutes regulating appeals are remedial, and this court
has always construed them liberally. The PaqueteHabana,
175 U. S. 677, 682; Wetmore v. Rymer, 169 U. S. 115, 128;
Harrisv. Barber,129 U.S. 366, 369-370; Smith v. Whitney,
116 U. S. 167, 173; Audubon v. Shufeldt, 181 U. S. 575,
578.
The decree is limited by the pleadings, which adhere to
the requirements of the Code. The meaning of the decree,
therefore, is that the husband shall pay to the wife at the
least the sum of seventy-five dollars a month as long as
the child may be dependent upon her for care and support. Barnes v. Chic. &c. Ry., 122 U. S. 1; Pierce v.
Tenn. Coal &c. R. R. Co., 173 U. S. 1, 9; Ex parte Hart,
94 California, 254; Carnig v. Carr, 167 Massachusetts,
544; McCaddin v. McCaddin, 116 Maryland, 567, 574.
This court will take judicial notice of the usual tables,
showing the expectancy of life of the parties and of the
child. Lincoln v. Power, 151 U. S. 436, 441.
The Virginia decree was not final within the meaning
of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution.
Virginia Code, § 3233.
Defendant was not served with process under the provisions of § 3232 of the Code of Virginia. Raub v. Otterback, 89 Virginia, 645.
This left .- e decree subject to be set aside in the discretion of the court.
While the appellant's rights cannot be made to depend
upon this element of favor or discretion, it is sufficient to
prevent the decree being final within the meaning of the
full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. Cheely v.
Clayton, 110 U. S. 701, 708; Roller v. Holly, 176 U. S.
398, 409; Lynde v. Tynde, 181 U. S. 183, 187.
The jurisdictional affidavit in the Virginia case, being

THOMPSON v. THOMPSON.

Argument for Appellee.

made upon information and belief, is not sufficient as a
basis for an order of publication; such publication was
therefore unauthorized and .ll proceedings based upon
it null and void. Hollingsworthv. Barbour,4 Pet. 466,474;
Clowser v. Hall, 80 Virginia, 864; Rice v. Ames, 180 U. S.
371, 374; Holmes v. Holmes, 15 Nebraska, 615, 616; Fulton

§ 2959, 3230, 3282; Form of Affidavit for Attachment,
Code, p. 1571; Formof Order of Publication, Code, p. 1702.
An order of publication is not a pleading, it is process.
Loeb V. Columbia &c. Trustees, 179 U. S. 472, 482; § 954,
Rev. Stat.; Brownfield v. South Carolina, 189 U. S. 426,
428; Tucker v. United States, 151 U. S.164, 169.
Process by means of publication is purely statutory
and not. according to the course of the common law, and
it can only be instituted in the manner required by the
statute. Cooper v. Newell, 173 U. S.555, 572.
If the affidavit had been as to the defendant's domicile,
which may present a mixed question of law and fact,
there would be some basis for the contention that an affidavit upon information and- belief would be sufficient,
but as to the mere fact of residence the affidavit must be
positive. Jackson v. Webster, 6 Munf. (Va.) 462, 464;
Clowser v. Hall, 80 Virginia, 864.
Judgments which have an effect on personal rights, as
in divorce suits, are not to be assimilated too closely to
those cases in which the jurisdiction is acquired by seizure
of the property involved. Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall.

This court is without jurisdiction; $5,000 is not involved.
The value must be actual value--not a value based upon
speculation on possibilities. Barry v. Mercein, 5 How.
103; Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U. S. 487; Durham v. Seymour,
161 U. S. 235; Huntington v. Saunders, 163 U. S. 319;
Foster's Fed. Practice, Vol. 1, 4th Ed., p. 87.
The decree of the Virginia court, if valid in Virginia, is binding upon the parties in the District of
Columbia and a bar to the wife's claim for maintenance.
Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155. Haddock v. Haddock,
201 U. S. 562, does not apply to this case.
The two cases last cited hold that if a suit is brought
at the matrimonial domicile of a husband whose domicile
coincides with the domicile of matrimony, the decree obtained is, by virtue of the Constitution, entitled to full
faith and credit; but that if the husband removes from
the matrimonial domicile and the wife remains, a decree
obtained by the husband in his new place of abode is not
entitled to full faith and credit. And see Downs v. Downs,
23 App. D. C. 381; 14 Cyc. 729.
So long as the finding of wrongful desertion is undisturbed, the courts of Virginia could not allow maintenance
to the wife. Harris v. Harris, 31 Gratt. 13, 17; Carr v.
Carr, 22 Gratt. 168; Latham v. Latham, 30 Gratt. 338.
The effect of the decree in Virginia being to bar the
wife's right to maintenance, it is also a bar to her suit for
maintenance in the District of Columbia.
Under § 3233, Virginia Code, if appellant had sustained
any injustice, by reason of the fact that she was an absent
defendant and did not appear, she could at any time
within three years have had said decree set aside by
showing that it was inequitable or unjust to her.
The Virginia decree is not invalid in that State because
of insufficiency of the affidavit filed as the basis of the
order of publication.

Opinion of the Court.

Under § 3230, the affidavit is in all respects sufficient
to form a basis for the publication. 7 Ency. P1. & Pr. 110;

The giving of personal notice in the District of Columbia
did not vitiate the constructive notice of publication and
render the decree void in Virginia. 7 Ency. Pl. & Pr., p.
109; Burnes v. Burnes, 61 Mo. App. 612; Dresser v. Wood,
15 Kansas, 344.
In any event, the wife failed upon the testimony offered to establish that she was entitled to maintenance.
MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Court of Appeals
of the District of Columbia, reversing a decree of the
Supreme Court of the District in favor of the wife in a
suit for maintenance, brought under § 980 of the District
Code, act of March 3, 1901, 31 Stat. 1346, c. 854. The
bill of complaint was filed July 29, 1907, and charged the
husband with failing and refusing to maintain the complainant and with cruel treatment of such character as to
compel her to leave him. Upon the filing of the bill a subpcena to answer was issued and returned "not found,"
whereupon alias and pluries writs were successively issued
and returned until November 18, 1907, when the husband
was served with process. Meanwhile, and on September 3, 1907, he brought suit against the wife in the Circuit
Court of Loudoun County, Virginia, for divorce a mensa
et thoro, upon the ground that on June 13, 1907, the wife
wilfully abandoned his bed and board and deserted him

without cause, and that notwithstanding his repeated entreaties and endeavors to induce her to return she had
refused to do so. An order of publication having been
made and published, the Virginia court, on October 19,
1907, made a decree granting to the husband a divorce a
mena et thoro. He thereafter, on being served as already
mentioned with process in the wife's suit, filed a plea setting up the Virginia decree and the proceedings upon
which it was rendered, as a bar to her action. This plea
was, on hearing, overruled, the husband being allowed time
in which to answer the bill. He answered, denying the
wife's charges of cruelty and setting up .other matters
pertaining to the merits, and also averred that his domicile,
as well as the matrimonial domicile of the parties, was in
Loudoun County, Virginih, and again pkaded the Virginia
proceedings and decree as a bar to the wife's suif. The
Supreme Court of thW District upon final hearing held the
Virginia divorce to be invalid and made a decree awardingto the wife -custody of an infant child born to the parties
during the pendency of the proceedings, and requiring
the husband to pay to the wife $75 pert month for the
maintenance of herself and the child, to forthwith pay to
her the sum of $500 for counsel fees, and also td pay the
costs of suit to be taxed. From this decree the husband
appealed to the Court of Appeals of the District, which
court reversed the decree and remanded-the cause, with
directions to enter an order vacating the decree and dis-missing the bill. 35 App. D. C. 14.
The present appeal is based upon § 8 of the act of February 9, 1893, to establish a Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and for other purposes (27 Stat, 434,
436, c. 74), which section gives a writ of error or appeal
to review in this court any final judgment or decree of the
Court of Appeals "in all causes in which the. matter in
dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum of five
thousand dollars." Appellee challenges our jurisdictioA

THOMPSON v. THOMPSON.
226 U. S.

Opinion og' the Court.

on the ground that the matter here in dispute does not
exceed the sum mentioned.
Under the decree of the Supreme Court the payments
of $75 per month for support of the wife and child were to
commence on July 15, 1909. Supposing that decree to be
now reinstated by a reversal of the decree of the Court of
Appeals, the installments already accrued would amount
to considerably more than one-half of the jurisdictional
amount. The expectancy of life of the parties is clearly
sufficient to make up the balance.
It i +.rue that the obligation to make such payments for
maintenance in the future, even when fixed by judicial
decree, is not in the nature of a technical debt.
Section 980 of the District Code (31 Stat. 1346, c. 854)
upon which the present action. is based, enacts-" Whenever any husband shall fail or refuse to maintain his wife
and minor children, if any, although able to. do so, the
-court, on application of the Wife, may decree that he shall
pay her, periodically, such sums as would be allowed to
her as permanent alimony in case of divorce for the
maintenance of -herself and. the minor children committed to her care by the court, and the payment thereof
may be enforced in the same manner as directed in regard
to such permanent alimony.' The matter of permanent
alimony is dealt with in §§ 976, 977 and 978, the latter of
which provides-" After a decree of divorce in any case
granting alimony and providing for the care and custody
of children, the case shall stiltI be considered open for any
future orders in those respects."
The statutory maintenance is thus assimilated to alimony, in that it is subject to be modified from time to time
or even cut off entirely, in the event of a change in the
circumstalices of the parties; and it of course ceases wholly
upon the death of the husband. See Lynde v. Lynde, 181
U. S. 183; Audubon, v. Shufeldt, 181 U. S. 575, 578; Lynde
v. Lyndc, 64 N. J. 'Eq. 736, 751.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

226 U. S.

Nevertheless, such a decree clearly and finally settles
the obligation of the husband to contribute to the support
of the wife and offspring, and fixes the amount of contributions required for the present to fulfill that obligation.
The future payments are not in any proper sense contingerit or speculative, although they are subject -to be increased, decreased or even cut off, as just indicated.
The statute conferring jurisdiction on this court, while
requiring that the matter in dispute shall exceed five
thousand dollars, does not require that it shall be of such
a nature as to constitute (if the event be favorable) a
technical debt of record. In Smith v. Whitney, 116 U. S.
167, 173, the matter in dispute was stated to be "whether
the petitioner is subject to a prosecution which may end
in a sentence dismissing him from the service, and depriving him of a salary, as paymaster general during the residue of his term as such, and as pay inspector afterwards,
which in less than two years would exceed the sum of five
thousand dollars." This court sustained the appellate
jurisdiction. That case has been repeatedly cited upon
the present point, Smith v. Adams, 130 U. S. 167, 175;
South Carolinav. Seymour, 153 U. S. 353, 358; Simon v.
House, 46 Fed. Rep. 317, 318; Chesapeake & Delaware

Canal Co. v. Gring, 159 Fed. Rep. 662, 664; and its authority upholds our jurisdiction in the case before us.
The next question is whether the Court of Appeals was
right in holding that the Supreme Court of the District
erred in refusing to give credit to the Virginia decree.
Art. IV, § 1, of the Constitution declares that "Full
faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public
acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other
State. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe
the manner in which such acts, records and proceedings
shall be proved, and the effect thereof." By § 905, Rev.
Stat., the mode in which such acts, records, and proceedings are to be proved was. prescribed; and it was enacted

THOMPSON v. THOMPSON.
226 U. S.

Opinion of -the Court.

that "The said records and judicial proceedings, so authenticated, shall have such faith and credit given to them
in every court within the United States as they have by
law or usage in the courts of the State from which they
are taken." This latter clause finds its origin in the first
act passed by Congress to carry into effect the constitutional mandate (act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 1 Stat. 122);
and, in an early case, it was held that the words "every
court within the United States" include the courts of the
District of Columbia, and require those courts to give full
faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the several
States when properly authenticated. Mills v. Duryee, 7
Cranch, 481, 484, 485.
But it is established that the full faith and credit clause,
and the statutes enacted thereunder, do not apply to
judgments rendered by a court having no jurisdiction of
the parties or subject-matter, or of the res in proceedings
in rem. D'Arcy v. Ketchum, 11 How. 165; Thompson v.
Whitman, 18 Wall. 457; Reynolds v. Stockton, 140 U. S.
254; Bigelow v. Old Dominion Copper Co., 225 U. S.111,
134.
This subject in its relation to actions for divorce has
been most exhaustively considered by this court in two
recent cases; Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S.155; Haddock
v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562. In the Atherton Case the
matrimonial domicile was in Kentucky, which was also
the domicile of the husband. The wife left him there and
returned to the home of heir mother in the State of New
York. He began suit in Kentucky for a divorce a vinculo
matrimonii because of her abandonment, which was a
cause of divorce by the laws of Kentucky, and took such
proceedings to give her notice as the laws of that State
required, which included mailing of notice to the postoffice nearest her residence inNew York. No response or
appearance having been made by her, the Kentucky
court proceeded to take evidence and grant to the husVOL. ccxxvI-36

226 U. S.

band 'an absolute decree of divorce. It was held that this
decree was entitled to full faith and credit in the courts
of New York. In the Haddock Case, the husband and wife
were domiciled in New York, and the husband left her
there, and, after some years, acquired a domicile in Connecticut, and obtained in that State, and in accordance
with its laws, a judgment of divorce, based upon constructive and not actual service of process on the wife, she having meanwhile retained her domicile in New York, and
having made no appearance in the action. The wife
afterwards sued for divorce in New York, and obtained
personal service in that State upon the husband. The
New York court refused to'give credit to the Connecticut
judgment, and this court held that there was no violation
of the full faith and credit clause in the refusal, and this
because there was not at any time a matrimonial domicile
in the State of Connecticut, and therefore the res-the
marriage status-was not within the sweep of the judicial
power of that State.
In the present case it appears that the parties were
married in the State of Virginia, and had a matrimonial
domicile there, and not in the District of Columbia or
elsewhere. The husband had his actual domicile in that
State at all times until and after the conclusion of the
litigation. It is clear, therefore, under the decision in the
Atherton Case and the principles upon which it rests, that
the State of Virginia had jurisdiction over the marriage
relation, and the proper courts of that State could proceed
to adjudicate respecting it upon grounds recognized by the
laws of that State, although the wife, had left the jurisdiction and could not be reached by formal process.
But in order to make a divorce valid even when granted
by the courts of the State of the matrimonial domicile,
there must be notice to the defendant, either by service
of process, or (if the defendant be a non-resident) by such
publication or other constructive notice as is required by

THOMPSON v. THOMPSON.
226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the law of the State. Cheely v. Clayton,, 110 U. S. 701.
Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U.. S. 155, 171, 172. In Cheely v.
Clayton, because the notice was published against the
defendant without making such effort as the local law
required to serve process upon her within the State, this
court held, following repeated decisions of the state court,
that the decree of divorce was wholly void for want of
jurisdiction in the court that granted it; and that the liberty conferred by the locat statute upon a defendant on
whom constructive service only had been made to apply
within three years to set the decree aside did not make it
valid when the constructive service was so defective.
The Virginia decree now in question is attacked for
want of jurisdiction on the ground that the affidavit used
as a basis for the order of publication was made upon
information and belief, and not upon personal knowledge.
It is insisted that the order was therefore unauthorized
and all proceedings based upon it null and void.
By § 3230 of the Virginia Code it is provided that"On affidavit that a defendant is not a resident of this
State . . . an order of publication may be entered
against such defendant." Succeeding sections prescribe
the form of the order, the mode of publication, and the
proceedings to be taken when the order has been thus
executed.
The record of the Virginia proceedings shows that on
September 3, 1907, in the clerk's office of the Circuit
Court of Loudoun County, "the said Charles N. Thompson filed an affidavit setting forth that the said Jessie E.
Thompson was not a resident of the State of Virginia, said
affidavit to be used as basis for an order of publication
against the said Jessie E. Thompson,
in the words
and figures following, to wit: 'Charles N. Thompson, plaintiff, this day made oath before me in said office that Jessie E.
Thompson defendant in the suit aforesaid, is not a resident
of the said State, as he is informed and verily believes.'

This was certified by the clerk of the court as permitted
by the state practice. The order of publication follows,
which, after setting forth the title of the court, the names
of the parties and the object of the suit, proceeds thus:
"It appearing from legal evidence that the said defendant
is not a resident of this State, it is ordered that she do
appear within fifteen days after due publication hereof,
in the clerk's office of our said court, and do what is necessary to protect her interests." There follow certificates
of the publication and public posting of the required no.:
tice, and subsequent proceedings resulting in the final
decree, which is to the following effect: "It appearing
that the complainant hath proceeded regularly at rules
to mature his suit against defendant, who is a non-resident
of Virginia, both by personal service of process and by
publication, 'inthe mode prescribed by statute, this case
was set down for hearing and came on this day to be
heard on said proceedings at rules, the bill of complaint
and the depositions of witnesses regularly taken and returned to the court; on consideration whereof, the court
being of the opinion that complainant hath made out his
case by legal evidence, doth adjudge, order and decree
that the prayer of the bill be and the same is hereby
granted; that the complainant, Charles N. Thompson,
be and hereby is granted a divorce a mensa et thoro from
said defendant Jessie E. Thompson; and that each of
them be and he and she are divested of all marital rights
in the other's property. And it is further ordered that
this cause be placed upon the suspended docket, with
leave to-the complainant to apply for further relief whenever he may be advised that he is entitled thereto."
(Note: We disregard the recital of "personal service of
process," because the service referred to appears to have
been made in the District of Columbia, and whether it
was in season to serve any useful purpose under the Virginia practice is: questionable.)

THOMPSON v. THOMPSON.
226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The record clearly imports a determination by the
Virginia court that the affidavit of non-residence, although
based upon information and belief, amounted to "legal
evidence," and was in conformity with "the mode prescribed by statute." We are not referred to any provision
of the Virginia Code, nor to any decision of the courts of
that State, that excludes the use of such evidence for such
a purpose. Section 3282 of the Code provides that "where
an affidavit is required in support of any pleading, it
shall be sufficient, if the affiant swear that he believes
it to be true." Under the Code of 1874, chap. 148, § 1,
which provided for the issuance of a writ of attachment
against non-resident debtors, and required "an affidavit
stating the amount and ju:stice of the claim, that there
is present cause of action therefor, that the defendaht or
one of the defendants is not a resident of this State, and
that the affiant believes he has estate or debts due him
within the county or corporation in which the suit is,"
it was held that so much of the affidavit as set forth the
amount and justice of the claim, that there was present
cause of action therefor, and that the defendant was nonresident in the State, must be absolute, and not made
upon information and belief. Clowser v. Hall, 80 Virginia,
864. This decision was in 1885, and thereafter the section relating to foreign atbtachments was amended by
permitting all of the averments of the affidavit to be:
based upon the belief of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney.
Va. Code, § 2959.
We are not able to discover here or elsewhere any
general law or policy of the State of Virginia excluding
the use of affidavits based. upon information and belief
as the foundation of an order of publication. In. the very
decree before us the Virginia court has adjudged such an
affidavit to be sufficient. We are therefore bound to
assume that the use of such an affidavit is in accord with
proper practice in that State.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

226 U. S.

But, were it otherwise, it seems well settled that where
the affidavit used as the basis for an order of publication
is defective, not in omitting to state a material fact, but.
in the mode of stating it or in the degree of proof, the
resulting judgment, even though erroneous and therefore
voidable by direct attack, cannot be said to be coram non
judice and therefore void on its face. Atkins v. Atkins, 9
Nebraska, 191, 200; Pettiford v. Zoellner, 45 Michigan,
358, 362; Adams v. Circuit Judge, 98 Michigan, 51; Long
v. Fife, 45 Kansas, 271; Belmont v. Cornen, 82 N. Y. 256;
7 Encyc. P1. & Pr. 110; 17 Encyc. P1. & Pr. 60, 61.
The material fact upon which, according to the laws of
that State, the jurisdiction of the Virginia court depended,
was the non-residence of the defendant. The Code required (§ 3230) that this fact should appear by affidavit.
The affidavit in question set forth the fact* the circumstance that it was averred on information and belief affected merely the degree of proof. In the absence of any
local law excluding the use of such an affidavit the decision of the state court accepting it as legal evidence must
be deemed sufficient on collateral attack to confer jurisdictionon that court over the subject-matter in accordance
with local laws.
This being so, it is clear that the resulting decree is entitled, under the act of Congress, to the same faith and
credit that it would have by law or usage in the courts of
Virginia.. As the laws of that State provide for a divorce
from bed and board for the cause of desertion, and confer
jurisdiction of suits for divorce upon the Circuit Courts,
(Va. Code, §§ 2257, 2258, 2259, 2260, 2264, 2266; Bailey
v. Bailey, 21 Gratt. 43; Carrv. Carr,22 Gratt. 168; Latham
v. Latham, 30 Gratt. 307); and since the courts of Virginia
hold up'on general principles that alimony has its origin
in the legal obligation of the husband to maintain his
wife, and that although' this is her right she may by her
conduct forfeit it, and where she is the offender she cannot

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.

Counsel for Parties.

have alimony on a divorce decreed in favor of the husband,
(Harris v. Harris, 31 Gratt. 13), it is plin that such a
decree forecloses any right of the wife to have alimony or
equivalent maintenance from her husband under the law
of Virginia.
From this it results that the Court of Appeals of the
District of Columbia correctly held that the Virginia decree barred the wife's action for maintenance in the courts
of this District.
Decree affirmed.

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 65.

Argued December 5, 1912.-Decided January 6, 1913.

In this case held that the appointment of one holding a government
position as special disbursing agent was not an appointment to a
separate and distinct office from that already held, but merely an
order requiring him to perform additional services, and under
§ 1765, Rev. -Stat., payment therefor in addition to his salary is
prohibited. Woodwell v. United States, 214 U. S. 82.
44 Ct. Cl. 549; 45 Ct. Cl. 169, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the right under § 1765, Rev.
Stat., of-an employ6 of a Department to extra compensation for additional services, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Jackson H. Ralston-and Mr. William E. Richardson,
with whom Mr. Frederick L. Siddons was on the brief,
