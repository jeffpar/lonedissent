LECRONE, RECEIVER OF THE ORINOCO COMPANY, LIMITED, v. McADOO, SECRETARY OF
THE TREASURY.
ERROR TO THE

COURT OF APPEALS OF THE

DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA.

No. 304.

Submitted April 26, 1920.-Decided June 1, 1920."

A writ of error to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals of the
District of Columbia dismissing a petition for mandamus against
the Secretary of the Treasury must be dismissed if, after respondent's
resignation from office, his successor has not been substituted within
twelve months. P. 218. Act of February 8, 1899, c. 121, 30 Stat.
822.
In default of such timely substitution, the petition cannot be retained
to charge the respondent personally in damages (D. C. Code, ยง 1278),
since damages are only incident to allowance of the writ. P. 219.
Writ of error to review 48 App. D. C. 181, dismissed.
THE case is stated

JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a petition to the Supreme Court of the District
of Columbia for mandamus to direct the Secretary of the
Treasury to pay the amount of two certificates issued to
the petitioner by the Secretary of State. The petitioner
is receiver of the Orinoco Company, Limited. That
Company had claims for damages against 'the United
States of Venezuela, which, with others, by agreement

Opinion of the Court.

253 U. S.

between the two governments, the United States of
America released upon receiving from the United States
of Venezuela a certain sum in trust for the parties having
the claims. By the Act of February 27, 1896, c. 34, 29
Stat. 32, moneys so received are to be paid into the
Treasury and the Secretary of State is to "determine the
amounts due claimants, respectively,

.

.

and cer-

tify the same to the Secretary of the Treasury, who shall,
upon the presentation of the certificates of the Secretary
of State, pay the amounts so found to be due." Each of
such trust funds is declared to be "appropriated for the
payment to the ascertained beneficiaries thereof of the
certificates" provided for. The answer alleged that there
were. pending in the same Supreme Court two bills in
equity, one by a private person and one by the Orinoco
Company, Limited, asserting claims to the fund, that the
respondent and petitioner both are parties to those
proceedings, the petitioner having submitted to the
jurisdiction, and that the petitioner should be limited to
those proceedings and await the result of the decrees.
The petitioner demurred. The demurrer was overruled
and the petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court and
its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
The theory of the answer seems to be that the purpose
of the act of Congress was to appropriate a fund to the
claim and to transfer the claim to that fund, leaving the
question of title open to litigation in the ordinary courts,
as has been held in more or less similar cases. Butler v.
Goreley, 146 U. S. 303, 309, 310. S. C. 147 Massachusetts,
8, 12. United States v. Dalcour,203 U. S. 408, 422. Robertson v. Gordon, 226 U. S. 311, 317. See also Bayard v.
White, 127 U. S. 246. It is thought that Congress hardly
can have sought to confer judicial powers upon the
Secretary of State. United States v. Borcherling, 185 U.
S. 223, 234. And as the certificates are not gifts but are
in. recognition of outstanding claims, Williams v. Heard,

Syllabus.

140 U. S. 529, reversing s. c. 146 Massachusetts, 545, judicial action is supposed to be necessary for the final detrmination of the right. But we cannot consider that question or the other arguments upon the merits of the case,
because, Mr. McAdoo having resigned the office of Secretary of the Treasury, his successor was not substituted
within twelve months; which is the limit for such substitution fixed by the Act of February 8, 1899, c. 121, 30
Stat. 822. It is said that the Code of the District of
Columbia, ยง.1278, allows the petitioner to recover damages in the same proceeding and that the petition should
be retained to charge Mr. McAdoo personally. But apart
from other questions the damages are only incident to the
allowance of the writ of mandamus, and as that cannot be
allowed the whole proceeding is at an end. See Pullman
Co. v. Knott, .243 U. S. 447, 451; Pullman Co. v. Croom,
231 U. S. 571, 577.
Writ of error dismissed.

COMPANY OF NEW YORK ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND

No. 566.

CIRCUIT.

Argued April 22, 1920.-Decided June 1, 1920.

A city applied to intervene in a suit brought by a gas company to enjoin state officials from enforcing a rate alleged to be confiscatory.
Held, that the application was addressed to the discretion of the
District Court, and that an order denying it was not final for purpose of appeal. P. 221.
When the Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously assumes jurisdiction
of a case in which the District Court's jurisdiction is based wholly
on constitutional grounds, and makes a final order, this court has
