J. W. PERRY COMPANY v. CITY OF NORFOLK.
H. WHITE v. CITY OF NORFOLK.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF THE
STATE OF VIRGINIA.
Nos. 103. 104. Argued March 16, 1911.-Decided April 17, 1911.
Whether a municipality may list and tax its own property is a matter
of state practice and, except as it may affect a right previously acquired and protected by the Federal Constitution, presents no
Federal question.
This court in order to determine whether a contract has been impaired within the meaning of the Federal Constitution has power
to decide for itself what the true construction of the contract is.
A contract of exemption may be impaired by wrongful construction as
well as by an unconstitutional statute attempting a direct repeal.
A lease of property belonging to a municipality in which the lessees
have expressly agreed to pay taxes due the state or Federal Government is not impaired by an assessment made by the municipality
under power to tax acquired subsequent to the making of the lease.
Parties to a lease by a municipality not then possessing taxing powers
are chargeable with notice that the power to tax may be subsequently conferred, and the conferring of such power does not impair the contract in the lease if there is no exemption expressly contained therein.
Doubts and ambiguities as to exemptions from taxation are resolved
in favor of the public. St. Louis v. United Railways, 210 U. S. 273.
108 Virginia, 28, affirmed.

FROM the bill in 103, to enjoin the collection of city
taxes, it appears that prior to 1792 the borough of Norfolk,
Virginia, existed as a municipality of limited power. It

J. W. PERRY CO. v. NORFOLK.

Statement of the Case.

had a mayor and a council, but no power to tax. The
town owned the Fort land, and appointed commissioners
to subdivide the tract and let out the lots at public outcry. Thereupon the borough "demised, leased and to farm
let lot No. 10 to Richard Evers Lee, his executors, administrators and assigns, from August 26, 1792, for and during
the term of ninety-nine years, and after that time renewable for the further term of ninety-nine years, and so on
forever," he and they to pay yearly the rent of £6.6 and
"the public taxes which shall become due on said land."
It was provided that if there should be arrears for three
years in paying rent or taxes, the town should advertise
and lease out the lots and improvements for the remainder
of the term of ninety-nine years, said Lee and his assigns
to make good the deficiency, if any, between the first and
last prices, together with all arrears of rent and taxes, the
overplus, if any, to be paid over to said Lee or his assigns.
If the rent and taxes were paid as stipulated the borough
and its successors were to renew the lease for the further
term of ninety-nine years, and so on forever. The leases
were renewed in 1802 on practically identical terms. Subsequently, the eastern portion of lot 10 was assigned to
John L. Roper and the western portion to the J. W. Perry
Company, who, "relying on the stipulations and agreements therein, purchased the lease, and, at great expense erected costly improvements on the land." The bill
charged that "it was the intention of all the parties, in both
the original and renewal leases, that the stipulation as to
the payment of public taxes applied solely to such taxes
as might be .imposed by Virginia and the United States,
and neither the borough nor the city of Norfolk had ever
attempted to impose any municipal tax upon the property.
But "though the city owns the fee, it has for the year
1906 caused the lot to be assessed in the name of it, the
said. city of Norfolk, at a valuation of $21,000, and intends to collect the tax of $346 from the lessees of lot 10."

The bill also charged that the buildings, on being attached
to the land, became the property of the city as landlord,
and likewise free and clear from the payment of city taxes,
notwithstanding which it had assessed the improvement
to the lessee at a value of $6,500 and- demanded the tax
thereon.
.

Lot 9 was held by White on substantially identical

terms, except that the renewal lease made in 1892 provided that the lessee should "pay all rent and all state
and national taxes." The city contended that this change
was without consideration arid did not modify, the rights
or liabilities of either party, because from the instrument
as a whole it appeared that there, Was no intention to
change, but only to renew and continue in force the original lease of 1792..
In each case it Was alleged that the assessment and collection of taxes for city purposes impaired the obligation
of the lease contract.
The tial judge granted perpetual injunctions. Those
rulings were reversed by the Court of Appeals of Virginia
(108 Virginia, 28), and plaintiffs brought the cases here,
assigning as error that the collection of taxes. by the city
of Norfolk, in pursuance of authority conferred subsequent to the leases, impaired the obligations of the contracts.

ingenuity that even a claim for such exemption can be produced. North Missouri Ry. Co. v. McGuire, 20 Wall. 46.
MR. JUSTICE LAMAR,

after making the foregoing state-

ment, delivered the opinion of the court.
In 1792, at a time when it had no right to tax, the municipality of Norfolk, Virginia, leased to Lee and others several lots of land for ninety-nine years, renewable forever,
the lessees and their assigns to pay the annual rent and" the
public taxes which shall become due on said land." Subsc(euently the city was given the power of taxation, but
made no effort to assess these lofs until 1906. The lessees
then sought to enjoin their collection on the ground that
the "public taxes," they had assumed, were those which
might be due to the State and to the United States. They
contended that for Norfolk to assess -land belonging to
Norfolk for taxes payable to Norfolk constituted an inValid charge, and was not a lawful public tax of the kind
which the lessees had agreed to pay, and that if such a
tax could be assessed it was by virtue of statutes passed
since the contract was made, and for the city to exert this
new statutory power against them would impair the obligation of their contract.
In support of their claim that the city as lessor could
not tax its own property, so as to make it a valid public
tax payable by the lessee, they rely on the general rule that
taxes are assessed to the owner, and as the landlord receives the rent he ought to bear the burdens imposed upon
the property. On the authority of State v. Mississippi
Bridge Co., 134 Missouri, 321; Thruston v. Mustin, Fed.
Cases, 14,013, and like cases, they insist that this is a
liability arising out of the relation of landlord and tenant,

and is'not limited to short term leases, but applicable to
those for ninety-nine years, renewable forever.
It is true that in the present case the indenture uses apt
words to create a lease, and the Virginia court held that it
was technically such. But there are other and controlling
features which show that, even if the legal title is in the
city, the lesseeS have rights different from those usual in a

mere
leasehold estate.
On

condition broken, they do not ipsofacto lose
all interest in the property and its proceeds. The contract does not
contain the common stipulation that the tenant shall be
compensated for his permanent improvements. On the
tenant's default the city cannot at once enter: into possession, but "the lot and improvements shall be leased out
at public outcry for the remainder of the term," and after
deducting unpaid rent and taxes the overplus, if any, shall
be paid to the lessees. This overplus would represent, in
part, the value of permanent improvements and also of
the unexpired term. Selling the city's property to pay
rent due the city is not at all consistent with the idea of
a mere lease. It indicated rather that the tenant had a
substantial interest in the property which was security
for the payment of whatever he owed the city. The contract creates an estate somewhat like the perpetual lease
of the civil law, where the tenant was for many purposes
treated as owner, and liable for taxes. Merlin Rep., vol. 10,
p. 232; Cooper's Inst. 277, 278; Sohmn's Inst., 3d ed.,
346. It was also similar in its nature to ground rent, where
an annual rental and public taxes are perpetually charged
on the land, instead of a gross sum being paid or secured.
There the grantor is treated as having a fee in the rent
reserved, and the grantee a fee in the land, subject, among
other. things, to the payment of public taxes. Duane on

The Court of Appeals. held that in Virginia the general

rule that the landlord is responsible for the taxes "has
no application to the case of a perpetual leaseholder where
the tenant is in effect the virtual owner of the property
and entitled to its use forever. For the purposes of taxation the mere legal title remaining in the landlord will be
disregarded." It adopted that part of the language in
Wells v. Savannah, 87 Georgia, 397, affirmed in 181 U. S.
531, where, in speaking of the liability of one who had a
perpetual lease and a right to convert it at will into a fee,
Judge Bleckley said: "The value of property consists in
its use, and he who owns the use forever, though it be on
condition subsequent, is the true owner of the property for
the time being." Crowe v. Wilson, 65 Maryland, 479;
Brainard v. Mayor of Colchester, 31 Connecticut, 407.
Ordinarily it would be a useless thing for a city to tax
its own property. But this can be done under Virginia
practice, and is not a vain thing if thereby property of the
city, subject to taxation, is listed in its name as holder of
the legal title, so as to fix the amount of the tax on the
property which the tenant may have agreed to pay.
Cooley on Taxation (3d ed.), 263. This ruling of the
Virginia court presents no Federal question, but does
establish that the tax was not illegal, as claimed, but was
based on an assessment valid under the laws of the State.
Whether it is a "public tax" contemplated by the contract, or whether forcing the lessees to pay it impairs that
contract, is a matter we must consider; for a valid contract
of exemption from taxation may be impaired by wrongful
construction as well as by an unconstitutional statute attempting a direct repeal. This court, therefore, "has
power, in order to determine whether any contract has been
impaired, to decide for itself what the true construction of
the contract is." Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657;
Bryan v. Board of Education, 151 U. S. 639; Mobile &
Ohio R. R. Co. v. Tennessee, 153 U. S. 495; Jefferson
Branch Bank v..Skelly; l Black, 446.

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

It is admitted that the lessees have expressly agreed to
pay taxes due Virginia or. the Federal Government, regardless of the character of the estate created. And,
.while it is true that when the lease was made the borough
had no authority to tax, both parties were charged with
notice that such power might, and probably would, be
conferred when increase of population made it necessary.
Even if the borough could have made a valid contract
of exemption in 1792, there is nothing to show that it
did so. On the contrary, the provision that the lessee
was to "pay public taxes" was sufficiently comprehensive
to embrace municipal taxes whenever they could thereafter be lawfully assessed on land or the improvements
which were a part of the land. Where one relies upon an
exempti0n from taxation, both the power to exempt and
tho contract of exemption must be clear. Any doubt
oi ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the public.
Ste Louis v. United Railways, 210 U. S. 273. Here there
is not only no language of exemption, but a positive
agreement on the part of the lessees to pay public taxes
on the land. In compelling them to do so the contract
is enforced instead of impaired. The judgment of the
Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia is therefore
Affirmed.
