OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

220 U. S.

SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY v.
RHODES.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 128. Argued April 19, 20, 1911, for plaintiff in error. The court
declined, to hear further argument.-Decided May 1, 1911.
The Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid statutes and statutory
changes -to have a beginning and thus to discriminate between
rights of an earlier and later time.
In a statute relating to the use of photographs, the fact that it applies
only to those taken after the enactment does not render it unconstitutional as denying the equal protection of the law because it does
not relate to those taken prior to such enactment.
Where property is not brought into existence until after a statute is
passed, the owner is not deprived of his property without due process
of law on account of limitations thereon imposed by such statute.
The Court of Appeals of that State having construed the statute of
-New York of 1903 limiting the use of photographs of persons to
photographs taken after the statute went into effect, the statute -is
not unconstitutional as denying one owning photographs taken
thereafter of his property without due process of law, or as denying
equal protection of the law.
Judgment entered on authority of 193 N. Y. 223, affirmed.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. John Hall Jones for plaintiff in error:
As to the law in New York before the enactment, see
Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co., 171 N. Y. 538, holding there was no right at common law to prevent a company from distributing flour bags upon which was a lithograph picture of the plaintiff.
Under that decision no person in New York has any
property right in his own features, nor in the photographs
of them, and any person could take a photograph of another and use it as he chose; and see Atkinson v. Doherty,
121 Michigan, 372.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

The statute in this case was enacted soon after Chief
Judge Parker's decision in the Roberson case. It must
be noted that this statute does not in terms affect the
property right of a photographer in his work. It merely
says that one who uses the photograph of a living person
for purposes of trade or advertising without that person's
prior written consent is guilty of a crime. In other words,
the statute restricts and limits the property right in such
a way as to destroy much of the value of the photograph.
It is an unnecessary deprivation of property; nor can
the law be defended or the rule of "Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas," for the "other" has no legal right which
you are bound to -respect. The law takes no account of
"that liberty of action which is necessary in the conduct
of modern business affairs in a great city," Grossman v.
Caminez, 79 App. Div. N. Y. 15, but makes even the oral
use of a person's name a crime.
The individual must admit certain rights by the public
in his name and appearance, and must trust to advancing
standards of propriety to prevent annoyance from their
exercise. Forster v. Scott, 136 N. Y. 577, 584.
Unconstitutionality does not depend upon what has
been done under a particular statute but what may be'
done. Fisher Co. v. Woods, 187 N. Y. 90, 95; Dexter v.
Boston, 176 Massachusetts, 247, 251; Railroad Cases, 116

378, 398; St. Louis v. Dorr, 41 S. W. Rep. 1094.
The statute has no reasonable or proper relation to the
public health, safety or morals. Peck v. Chicago Sunday
Tribune, 214 U. S. 185. The statute does prevent, a per-

son from using his own property in carrying on a lawful
business, and unless such prevention is reasonably necessary the act violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Edison
v. Lubin, 122 Fed. Rep. 240; American Mutoscope Co. v.
Edison Mfg. Co., 13-7 Fed. Rep. 262.
This statute can only be sustained if it is a valid exercise
of thE policepower of 'the State. While the limits of this
power can never be accurately defined, it is submitted
that it extends only to such subjects as promote or guard
the public health, .the public safety or the public morals.

This is an action brought by the defendant in error for

Opinion of the Court.

using her photographed portrait for advertising purposes
without her written cohsent first obtained. The facts
were found against the defendant (the plaintiff in error),
an injunction was issued and damages were awarded; 120
App. Div. 467; the judgment was affirmed by the Court
of Appeals, 193 N. Y. 223, and thereupon final judgment
was entered in the Supreme Court. The suit was based
upon Chapter 132 of the New York Statutes of 1903,
which makes such use of the name, portrait or picture of
any living person a misdemeanor and gives this action.
The case comes here on the single question of the constitutionality of the act. It is argued that as before the
statute a person could not prevent the use of her portrait
by one who took and owned it, Roberson v. Rochester
FoldingBox Co., 17i N. Y. 538, to deny that use now is to
deprive the owner of his property without due process of
law.
The Court of Appeals held that the statute applied only
to photographs taken after it went into effect, as was the
photograph of the plaintiff that the defendant used. The
property was brought into existence under a law that
limited the uses to be made of it, and, if otherwise there
could have been any question, in such a case there is none.
Some comment was made in argument on the distinction
between photographs taken before and after the date in
1903 as inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.
But the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid statutes
and statutory changes to have a beginning and thus to
discriminate between the rights of an earlier and later
time.
Judgment affirmed.
