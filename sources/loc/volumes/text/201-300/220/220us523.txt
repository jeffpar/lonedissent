LIGHT v. UNITED STATES.
220 U. S.

Syllabus.

The indictment charges, and the demurrer admits that
Rule 45 was promulgated for the purpose of regulating the
occupancy and use of the public forest reservation and
preserving the forest. The Secretary did not exercise the
legislative power of declaring the penalty or fixing the punishment for grazing sheep without a permit, but the punishment is imposed by. the act itself. The offense is not
against the Secretary, but, as the indictment properly concludes, "contrary to the laws of the United States and the
peace and dignity thereof." The demurrers should have
been overruled. The affirmances by a divided court heretofore entered are set aside and the judgments in bothcases
Reversed.

LIGHT v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO.

No. 360.

Argued February 27, 28, 1911.-Decided May 1, 1911.

United States v. Grimaud, ante, p. 506, followed to effect that Congress may authorize an executive officer to make rules and regulations as to the use, occupancy and preservation of forests and that
such authority so granted is not unconstitutional as a delegation of
legislative power.
At common law the owner was responsible for damage done by his
live stock on land of third parties, but the United States has tacitly
suffered its public domain to be used for cattle so long as such tacit
consent was not cancelled, but no vested rights have been conferred on any person, nor has the United States been deprived of the
power of recalling such implied license.
While the full scope of § 3, Art. IV, of the Constitution has never been
definitely settled it is primarily a grant of power to the United States
of control over its property, Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 89; this
control is exercised by Congress to the same extent-that an individual
can control his property.

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Statement of the Case.

220 U. S.

It is for Congress and not for the courts to determine how the public
lands shall be administered.
Congress has power to set apart portions of the public domain and
establish them as forest reserves and to prohibit the grazing of
cattle thereon or to pcrmit it subject to rules and regulations.
Fence laws may condone trespasses by straying cattle where the laws
have not been complied with, but they do not authorize wanton or
willful trespass, nor do they afford immunity to those willfully turning cattle loose under circumstances showing that they were intended to graze upon the lands of another.
Where cattle are turned loose under circumstances showing that the
owner expects'and intends that they shall go upon a reserve to graze
thereon, for which he has no permit and he declines to apply for
one, and threatens to resist efforts to have the cattle removed and
contends that he has a right to have his cattle go on the reservation,
equity has jurisdiction, and such owner can be enjoined at the
instance of the Government, whether the land has been fenced or
not.
Quaere, and not decided, whether the United States is required to fence
property under laws of the State in which the property is located.
This court will, so far as it can, decide cases before it without reference to questions arising under the Federal Constitution. Sier v.
Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 213 U. S. 175.

THE Holy Cross Forest Reserve was established under
the provisions of the act of March 3, 1891. By that and
subsequent statutes the Secretary of Agriculture was
authorized to make provisions for the protection against
destruction by fire and depredations of the public forest
and forest reservations and "to make such rules and
regulations and establish such service as would insure the
objects of such reservation, namely, to regulate their occupancy and use, and to preserve the forests thereon from
destruction." 26 Stat. 1103, c. 563; 30 Stat. 35, c. 2; act
of Congress February 1, 1905; 7 Fed. Stat. Ann. 310,
312, and Supp. for 1909, p. 663. In pursuance of these
statutes regulations were adopted establishing grazing
districts on which only a limited number of cattle were
allowed. The regulations provided that a few head of
cattle: of prospectors, campers and not more than ten

belonging to a settler residing near the forest might be
admitted without permit, but saving these exceptions the
general rule was that "all persons must secure permits
before grazing any stock in a national forest."
On April 7, 1908, the United States, through the
district attorney, filed a bill in the Circuit Court for the
'District of Colorado reciting the matters above outlined,
and alleging that the defendant Fred Light owned a herd
of about 500 eattle and a ranch of 540 acres, located two
and, a half miles to the east and five miles to the north of
the reservation. This herd was turned out to range
during the spring and summer, and the ranch then used
as a place on which to raise hay for their sustenance.
That between the ranch and the reservation, was other
public and unoccupied land of the United States; but, owing to the fact that only a limited number of cattle were
allowed on the reservation, the grazing there was better
than on this public land. For this reason, and because of
the' superior water facilities and the tendency of the cattle to follow the trails and stream leading from the ranch
to the reservation, they naturally went direct to the reservation. The bill charged that the defendant when turning
them loose knew and expected that they would go upon the
reservation, and took no action to prevent them from trespassing. That by thus knowingly and wrongfully permitting them to enter on the reservation he intentionally
caused his cattle to 'make a trespass, in breach of the
United States property and administrative rights, and
has openly and privately stated his purpose to disregard
the regulations, and without permit to allow and, in the
manner stated, to cause his cattle to enter, feed and graze
thereon.
The bill prayed for an injunction. The defendants
general demurrer was overruled.
His answer denied that the topography of the country
around his ranch or. thewafer and grazing conditions were

such as to cause his cattle to go on the reservation; he
denied that many of them did go thereon, though admitting that some had grazed on the reservation. He admitted that he had liberated his cattle without having
secured or intending to apply for a permit, but denied that
he willfully or intentionally caused them to go on the
reservation, submitting that he was not required to obtain any such permit. He admits that it is his intention
hereafter, as heretofore, to turn his cattle out on the unreserved public land of the United States adjoining his
ranch to the northeast thereof, without securing or applying for any permit for the cattle to graze upon the socalled Holy Cross Reserve; denies that any damage will

be done if they do go upon the reserve; and contends that,
if because of their straying proclivities, they shall go on the
reserve, the complainant is without remedy against the
defendant at law or in equity so long as complainant fails
to fence the reserve as required by the laws of Colorado.
He claims the benefit of the Colorado statute requiring
the owner of land to erect and maintain a fence of given
height and strength, in default of which the owner is not
entitled to recover for damage occasioned by cattle or
other animals going thereon.
Evidence was taken, and after hearing, the Circuit
Court found for the Government and entered a decree
enjoining the defendant from in any manner causing, or
permitting, his stock to go, stray upon or remain within
the said forest or any portion thereof.
The defendant appealed and assigned that the decree
against him was erroneous; that the public lands are held
in trust for. the people of the several States, and the proclamation creating the reserve without the consent of the
State of Colorado is contrary to and in violation of said
trust; that the decree is void because it in effect holds that
the United, States is exempt from the municipal laws of
the State of Colorado relating to fences; lhat the statute

Argument for Appellant.

conferring upon the said Secretary of Agriculture the power
to make rules and regulations was an unconstitutional
delegation of authority to him and the rules and regulations therefore void; and that the rules mentioned in the
bill are unreasonable, do not tend to insure the object of
forest reservation and constitute an unconstitutional interference by the Government of the United States with
-fence and other statutes of the State of Colorado, enacted
through the exercise of the police power of the State.

Attorney General of Colorado, Mr. Henry M. Teller, Mr.
C. S. Thomas, Mr. E. C. Stimson, Mr. Milton Smith, Mr.

for appellant:
The jurisdiction of a State extends over all the territory within its boundaries. New York v. Miln, 11 Pet.

Anderson, 117 U. 8. 158; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S.

One who asserts the existence of any exemption from
this jurisdiction must point out the act of cession, or the
constitutional provision from which it arises. The Government holds title to public lands, not as a sovereign, but
as a proprietor merely. This, of course, applies only to
public lands properly so called, and not to lands used
for governmental purposes. Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3
How. 212; Woodruff v. N. Bloomfield G. M. Co., 18 Fed.

elusive jurisdiction over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall
be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings, means that these are
to be purchased with the consent of the legislature.
Story on Const., 5th ed., § 1227; Ft. Leavenworth Ry. Co.
v. Lowe, 114 U. S. 525; Mobile v. Eslava, 16 Pet. 277;
People v. Godfrey, 17 Johns. 225.
A forest reserve, however beneficial, is not in fact an
instrument of government and necessary to the exercise
of national sovereignty.
Even in those cases in which there is a cession of jurisdiction by the State subsequent to the adoption of a fence
law, the law prevails on such lands until repealed by the
General Government. C., R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. McGlinn,
114 U. S. 542.
If the fence law would thus apply on territory of which
the jurisdiction had been ceded by a State, it certainly
is not ousted by the mere act of reserving public lands for
forestry purposes.
The ownership by the General Government of land
within a State does not carry with it general rights of
sovereignty over such lands.
If the Federal Government has jurisdiction over these
reservations to the extent necessary to support this decree,
the State is deprived of its police power over a large portion
of its territory. The police power of a State extends over all
of its territory and is exclusive. Prigg v. Commonwealth,
16 Pet. 639; The Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 63; In
re Rahrer, 140 U. S. 554; United States v. Knight, 156 U. S.
11; L'Hote.v. New Orleans, 177 U. S. 597.
The court bases the right to prevent the fencing of
public lands upon thefact that such fencing would retard
the settlement of the lands, which is the purpose for
which the Government holds them as a trustee.
The result of this decree, as before stated, is, that

state laws passed in the exercise of the police power are
not operative on the public domain. See Shannon v.
United States, 88 C. C. A. 52. That case, however, is
not authority to the effect claimed.
Fences and the trespasses of live stock is a proper subject of legislation under the police power of the State.
Bacon v. Walker, 204 U. S. 317; Rideout v. Knox, 148
Massachusetts, 368. This decree is contrary not only
to the statutes of the State .concerning fencing and live
stock, but to the law as laid down by the state Supreme
Court prior to the adoption of these laws. Morris v.
Fraker, 5 Colorado, 425; Richards v. Sanderson, 39 Colorado, 278; Buford v. Houtz, 133 U. S. 320.
In 1885 a fence law-was enacted, but it did no more
than express in statutory form what was already the law
of the. State. See Session Laws, 1885, p. 220, §§ 2987 et
seq., Rev. Stat. Colo., 1908. The gist of the statute is
that damages from trespass by animals are not recoverable
unless the premises on which such trespass occurs are enclosed by a lawful fence as therein prescribed.
To limit the jurisdiction of States containing forest reserves is to deny to them that equality with other States
to which they are entitled.. Escanaba Co. v. Chicago,
107 U. S. 678; Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U. S. 504. This
court will take judicial notice of the proclamations of the
President which have set aside as forest reserves within
the State of Colorado an area of 21,309 square miles, more
than one-fifth of the area of the State; but see Kansas
v. Colorado, to effect that the National Government cannot enter the territory of one of the newer States and
legislate in respect to improving by irrigation or otherwise
lands within their borders, unless it has the same power
in the older States.
An act of Congress cannot restrict the sovereignty of a
State except under express constitutional authority therefor. Withers v. Buckley, 20 How. 84. The equality

of the States under the Federal Constitution is fundamental-a part of the very structure, of our system of
government. - It is guaranteed by statute and exists without statute. Ward v. Race Horse, supra.
The authority of Congress to dispose of and protect
public lands is so limited as not to deprive one State of
an attribute of sovereignty which is conceded to other
States.
The lands described in the President's proclamation
as constituting the Holy Cross Forest Reserve have not
been legally set apart as permanent disposition thereof
for the purposes in said proclamation mentioned.
The Government holds public land in trust for the
people, to be disposed of so as to promote the settlement
and ultimate prosperity of the States in which they are
situated. This contradicts the withdrawal of lands for
such purposes. Newhall v. Sanger, 92 U. S. 761; Bardon

132 U. S. 49; United States v. Trinidad Coal Co., 137 U. S.
160; Pollard's Lessee v. Hogan, supra.
While national authority to reclaim arid lands may
be sustained, on the broad ground that their reclamation
is an aid in disposing of them, reservations, on the contrary, are in effect an abandonment of the purpose of
disposing of the lands included therein. Although the
power to establish these reserves may be highly desirable,
and may be more effectually exercised by the Federal
Government than by the States, that affords no ground
for asserting the existence of the power.
The system of national forest reserves violates the trust
concerning public land, and denies to the States in which
such
reserves are established the equality with other States
to which
they are entitled. Report of House Judiciary

This subject is not within the scope of the general welfare clause of the Constitution. Story on the Const.,

Appellant has no standing to attack the reservation or
the forest-reserve policy. He does not claim any right or
interest in any of the lands reserved.
Before the reservation lhe doubtless enjoyed a license
of pasturage there. This was a mere privilege, existing,
which the Government could take away. Shannon v.
United States, 160 Fed. Rep. 870, 873; Frisbie v. Whitney,
9 Wall. 187; Yosemite Valley Case, 15 Wall. 77. The
constitutionality of the reservation is attacked solely
upon the ground of its supposed invasion of the rights and
prerogatives of the State. But the State is not here objecting, and its supposed injury is no concern of the appellant. Bacon v. Walker, 204. U. S. 311, 315; Hatch v.

Even if the United States as a property oWner is subject to the same .control by the State as individuals are,

The regulations were a valid exercise of constitutional
power. It was the duty of the individual to obey them
and of the courts to enforce them without regard to state
laws. The State has no beneficial right whatsoever in the
land; there is neither community of. ownership, nor relation of trustee and cestui que trust. While these lands
are held by the United States in trust, the pebple of the

LAMAR, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

MR. JUSTICE

The defendant was enjoined from pasturing his cattle on
the Holy Cross Forest Reserve, because he had refused to
comply with the regulations adopted by the Secretary of
Agriculture, under the authority conferred by the act of
June 4, 1897, (30 Stat. 35), to make rules and regulations
as to the use, occupancy and preservation of forests. The
validity of the rule is attacked on the ground that Congress
could not delegate to the Secretary legislative power. We
need not discuss that question in view of the opinion in
United States v.. Grimaud, just decided, ante, p. 506.

LIGHT v. UNITED STATES.
220 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The bill alleged, and there was evidence to support the
finding, that the defendant, with the expectation and
intention that they would do so, turned his cattle out at a
time and place which made it certain that they would leave
the open public lands and go at once to the Reserve, where
there was good water and fine pasturage. When notified
to remove the cattle, he declined to do so and threatened
to resist if they should be driven off by a forest officer. He
justified this position on the ground that the statute of
Colorado provided that a landowner could not recover
damages for trespass by animals unless the property was
enclosed with a fence of designated size and material.
Regardless of any Conflict in the testimony, the defendant
claims that unless the Government put a fence around the
Reserve it had no remedy, either at law or in equity, nor
could he be required to prevent his cattle straying upon
the Reserve from the open public land on which he had a
right to turn them loose.
At common law the owner was required to confine his
live stock, or else was held liable for any damage done by
them upon the land of third persons. That law was not
adapted to the situation of those States where there were
great plains and vast tracts of unenclosed land, suitable for pasture. And so, without passing a statute, or
taking any affirmative action on the subject, the United
States suffered its public domain to be used for such purposes. There thus grew up a sort of implied license that
these lands, thus left open, might be used so long as the
Government did not cancel its tacit consent. Buford v.
Houtz, 133 U. S. 326. Its failure to object, however, did
not confer any vested right on the complainant, nor did it
deprive the United States of the :power of recalling any
implied license under which the land had been used for
private purposes. Steele v. United States, 113 U. S. 130;
Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 513.

tionally withdraw large bodies of land from settlement
without the consent of the State where it is located; and
it is then argued that the act of 1891 providing for the
establishment of reservations was void, so that what is
nominally a Reserve is, in law, to be treated as open and
unenclosed land, as to which there still exists the implied
license that it may be used for grazing purposes. But "the
Nation is an owner, and has made Congress the principal
agent to dispose of its property." . . . "Congress is
the body to which is given the power to determine the
conditions upon which the public lands shall be disposed
of."

Butte City Water Co. v. Baker, 196 U. S. 126. "The

Government has with respect.to its own land the rights of
an ordinary proprietor to maintain its possession and prosecute trespassers. It may deal with such lands precisely as
an ordinary individual may deal with his farming property. It may' sell or withhold them from sale." Camfield
v. United States, 167 U. S. 524.- And if it may withhold
from sale and settlement it may also as an owner object
to its property being used for grazing purposes, for "the
Government is charged with the duty and clothed with
the power to protect the public domain from trespass
and unlawful appropriation." United States V. Beebee,
127 U. S. 342.
The United States can prohibit absolutely or fix the
terms on which its property may be used. As it can withhold or reserve the land it can do so indefinitely, Stearns
v. Minnesota, 179 U. S. 243. It is true that the "United
States do not and cannot hold property as a monarch may
for private or personal purposes." Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U. S. 158. But that does not lead to the conclusion that it is without the rights incident to ownership,
for the Constitution declares, § 3, Art. IV, that "Congress
shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules
and regulations respecting the territory or. the property belonging to the United States." "The full scope of this

paragraph has never been definitely settled. Primarily, at
least, it is a grant of power to the United, States of control
over its property." Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S-89.
"All the public lands of the nation are held in trust for
the people of the whole country," United States v. Trinidad Coal Co., 137 U. S. 160. And it is not for the courts to
say how that trust shall be administered. That is for
Congress to determine. The courts cannot compel it to
set aside the lands for settlement; or to suffer them to be
used for agridultural or grazing purposes; nor interfere
when, in the exercise of its discretion, Congress establishes
a forest reserve for what it decides to be national and public purposes. In the same way anid in the exercise of the
same trust it may disestablish'a reserve, and devote the
property to some other national and public purpose. These
are rights incident to proprietorship, to say nothing of the
power of the United States as a sovereign over the property belonging to it. Even a private owner would be entitled to protection against willful trespasses, and statutes
providing that damage done by animals cannot be recovered, unless the land had been enclosed with a fence of
the size and material required, do not give permission to
the owner of cattle to use his neighbor's land as a pasture.
They are intended to condone trespasses by straying cattle;
they have no application to cases where they are driven
upon unfenced land in order that they may feed there.

Fence laws do not authorize, wanton and willful trespass, nor do they afford immunity to those who, in disregard of property 'rights, turn loose their cattle under
circumstances showing that they were intended to graze
upon the lands of another.
This the defendant did, under circumstances equivalent
to driving his cattle upon the forest reserve. He could

have obtained a permit for reasonable pasturage. He not
only declined to apply for such license, but there is evidence that he threatened to resist efforts to have his cattle
removed from the Reserve, and in his answer he declares
that he will continue to turn out his cattle, and contends
that if they go upon the Reserve the Government has no
remedy at law or in equity. This claim answers itself.
It appears that the defendant turned out his cattle under:
circumstances which showed that he expected and intended. that they would go upon the Reserve to graze
thereon. Under the facts the court properly granted an
injunction. The judgment was right on the merits, wholly
regardless of the question as to whether the Government
had enclosed its .property.
This makes it unnecessary to consider how far the
United States is required to fence its property, or the other
constitutional questions involved. For, as said in Siler
v. Louisville & Nashville R. R., 213 U. S. 175 "where cases
in this cburt can be decided without reference to questions arising under the Federal Constitution that course is
usually pursued, and is not departed from without important reasons." The- decree is therefore
Affirmed.
