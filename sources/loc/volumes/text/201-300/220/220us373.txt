DR. MILES MEDICAL COMPANY

v. JOHN D.

PARK & SONS COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 72.

Argued January 4, 5, 1911.-Decided April 3, 1911.

An actionable wrong is committed by one who maliciously interferes
with a contract between two parties and induces one of them to
break -the contract to the injury of the other, and in the absence of
an adequate remedy at law equitable relief will be granted; but held,
in this case, that plaintiffs were not entitled to relief as the contract
under which they claimed Was invalid.
A system of contracts between Manufacturers and wholesale and retail
merchants by which the manufacturers attempt to control not merelythe prices at-which its agents may sell its products, but the prices for
all sales by all dealers at wholesale or retail whether purchasers or
subpurchasers, eliminating all competition and fixing the amount
which the consumer shall pay, amounts to restraint of trade and
'is invalid both at common law, and, so far as it affects interstate
commerce, under the Sherman Anti-trust Act of July 2, 1890; and so
held as to the contracts involved in this ease.
Such agreements are not excepted from the general rule and rendered
valid because they relate to proprietary medicines manufactured
under a secret process but not under letters patent; nor is a manufacturer entitled to.'control 'prices on all sales of his own products in
restraint of trade.
The rights enjoyed by a patentee are derived from statutory grant
under authority conferredtby . the Constitution, and are the reward
received in exchange for advantages derived by the public- after the
period of protection has expired; and the rights of one not disclosing
his secret process so as to secure a patent are outside of the policy
of the patent laws, and must be determined by the legal principles
applicable to the ownership of such process..
The protection of an unpatented process of manufacture does not
necessarily apply to the sale of articles manufactured under the
process.
A manufacturer of unpatented proprietary medicines stands on the
same footing as to right to control the sale of his product as the
manufacturers of other articles, and the fact that the article may

have curative properties does not justify restrictions which are unlawful as,to articles designed for other purposes.
A manifacturcr of unpatented articles cannot, by rule or notice,. in
absence of statutory !ight, fix prices for future sales, even though tile
restriction be known to purchasers. Whatever rights the manufacturer may have in that respect must be by agreements that are
lawful.
Although the earlier common-law doctrine in regard to restraint of
trade has been substantially modified, the public interest is still the
first consideration; to sustain the restraint it must be reasonable as
to the pulblic and parties and limited to what is reasonably necessary,
under the circumstances, for the covenantee; otherwise restraints are
void as against public policy.
Agreements' or combinations between dealers, having for their sole
purpose the destruction of competition and fixing of prices, are injurious to the public interest and void; nor are they saved by advantages which the participants expect to derive from the enhanced
price to the consumer.
164 Fed. Rep. 803, affirmed.

THIS is a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which
affirmed a judgment of the Circuit. Court dismissing, on
demurrer, the bill of complaint for want of equity. 164
Fed. Rep. 803; 90 C_ C. A. 579.
The complainant Dr. Miles Medical Company, an Indiana corporation, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of
proprietary medicines, prepared by means of secret methods and formulas and identified by distinctive packages,
labels and trade-marks. It has established an extensive
trade throughout the United States and in certain foreign
countries. It has been its practice to sell its medicines
to jobbers and wholesale druggists who in turn sell to
retail druggists for sale to the consumer. In the case
of each remedy, it has fixed not only the price of its own
sales to jobbers and wholesale dealers, but also the wholesale and retail prices. The bill alleged that most of its
sales were made through retail druggists and that the
demand for its remedies largely 4epended upon their

DR. MILES MEDICAL CO. v. PARK & SONS CO. 375
220 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

good. will and commendation, and their ability to realize
a fair profit; that certain retail establishments, particularly those known as department stores, had inaugurated
a "cut-rate" or "cut-price" system which had. caused
"much confusion, trouble and damage" to the coinplainant's business and "injuriously affected. the reputation" and "depleted the sales" of its remedies; that this
injury resulted "from the fact that the majority of retail
druggists as a rule cannot, or believe that they cannot
realize sufficient profits ' by the sale. of the medicines
"at the cut-prices announced by the cut-rate and department stores," and therefore are 'unwilling to, and do not
keep" the medicines "in stock" or "if kept in stock, do
not urge or favor sales thereof, but endeavor to foist off
some similar remedy or substitute, and from the fact that
in the public mind an article advertised or announced at
' cut' or 'reduced' price from the established price suffers
loss of reputation and becomes of inferior value and demand."
It was further alleged that for the purpose of protecting
"its trade sales and business" and of conserving "its
good will and reputation" the complainant had established
a method "of governing, regulating and controlling the
sale and marketing "of its remedies, which is thus described in the bill:
"Contracts in writing. were required to be executed by

"To Retail Dealer:
"Paste printed label, giving name and address, that
your name may be correctly listed.
"'Duplicate. Keep for reference.",
As an aid to the maintenance of the prices thus fixed
the company devised a:system for tracing and identifying,
through serial numbers and cards, each wholesale and retail package of its products.
It was alleged that all wholesale and retail druggists,
' andal dealers in proprietary mediciffes," had been given
full bpportunity, without discrimination, to sign contracts
ih the form stated, and that such contracts were in force
between the complainant "and over four hundred jobbers
and 'wholesalers and twenty-five thousand retail dealers in
proprietary medicines in the United States."
The defendant is a Kentucky corporation conducting
a wholesale drug business. The bill alleged that the defendant had formerly dealt with the complainant and had
full knowledge of all the facts relating to the trade in its
medicines; that it had been requested, and refused, to
enter into the wholesale contract required by the complainant; that in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, where the
defendant conducted a wholesale drug store, there were
a large number of wholesale and retail druggists who had
made contracts, of the sort described, with the complainant, and kept its medicines on sale pursuant to the
agreed terms and conditions. It was charged that the
defendant, "in combination and conspiracy with a number of wholesale and retail dealers in drugs' and proprietary medicines, who have not entered into said wholesale and retail contracts" required by the c.omplainant's
system and solely for the purpose of selling the remedies
to dealers "to be advertised, sold and marketed at cutrates," and "to thus attract and secure custom and patronage .for other merchandise, and not for the purpose
of making or: receiving a direct money profit" from the

sales of the remedies, had unlawfully and fraudulently
procured them from the complainant's "wholesale and
retail agents" by means "of false and fraudulent representations and statements, and by surreptitious and dishonest methods, and by persuading and inducing, directly
and indirectly,." a violation of their contracts.
It is further charged that the defendant, having procured the remedies in this manner, had advertised and sold
them at less than the jobbing and retail prices established
by the complainant; and that for the purpose of concealing the source of supply the identifying serial numbers,
which had been stamped upon the labels and cartons;
had been obliterated by the defendant or by those acting
in collusion with the defendant, and the labels and cartons
had been mutilated thus rendering the list of ailments
and directions for use illegible, and that the remedies in
this condition were sold both to the wholesale and retail dealers and ultimately to buyers for use at cut
rates.
The bill prayed7 for an injunction restraining the defendant from inducing or attempting to induce any party
to any of the said "wholesale or retail agency contracts"
to "violate or break the same, or to sell or deliver to the
defendant, or to any person for it" the complainant's
remedies; from procuring or attempting to procure in any
way any of these remedies from wholesale or retail dealers
who had executed the contracts; from advertising, selling
or offering for sale the remedies obtained by any of the
described means at less "than the established retail price
thereof" or to dealers who had not entered into contract
with the complainant; from in any way obliterating, mutilating, removing or covering up the labels and cartons
upon the bottles containing the remedies and from making sales without such labels and cartons, and the letter
presg and numerals thereon, being intact. There was also
a prayer for an accounting.

DR. MILES MEDICAL CO. v. PARK & SONS CO. 383
220 U. S.

Argument for Petitioner.

The defendant demurred to the bill generally for want
of equity and also specially to that portion of the bill
which related to the mutilation and destruction of the
identifying ' numbers and labels.
The Circuit Court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the bill and its judgment was affirmed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Mr. Frank F.JReed, with whom Mr. Edward S. Rogers
was on the brief, for petitioner:
The wholesale contracts are agency coitracts and not
contracts of sale.
Under each contract between petitioner and wholesale dealers the remedies are in terms and in fact consigned to such wholesaler as a distributing agent. The
wholesaler is designated as, and is actually made,an agent.
Hence, each sale to -aretailer is a sale by petitioner through
its agefit. The arrangement between petitioner and each
wholesaler is clearly one of bailment and not of sale or
conditional sale. Milburn Co. v. Peak, 89 Texas, 209; 34

The attempt of the petitioner in this case is manifestly
not only to acquire, without taking out a patent, rights
which are only given under the patent and copyright
laws, but to do that without complying with the condition on which alone such right can be obtained under
such laws, to-wit: the abandonment of the right 'after
a fixed period of time. It is an attempt to maintain a
scheme to give it for an unlimited period of time, or for
all time to come, a right which. the courts have uniformly
held can only be obtained for a limited period of time under
the patent and copyright laws. Such a scheme is, in the
absence of special right, illegal and unlawful. Wheaton

That a patentee may make a contract which is lawful

The control which the petitioner is attempting to maintain over the subsequent trade, by its- vendees, in the
goods manufactured by it, is in general restraint of trade
and is therefore unlawful at common law.
A restraint of trade may affect the public directly, or

directly, and the public only indirectly. 2 Parsons on

Petitioner has no cause of complaint because the respondent defaces and mutilates the labels or printed matter upon the packages which it purchases and owns.
MR.JUSTICE HUGHES, after making the above statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

The complainant, a manufacturer of proprietary medicines which are prepared in accordance with secret formulas, presents by its bill a system, carefully devised, by
which it seeks to maintain certain prices fixed by it for all
the sales of its products both at wholesale and retail. Its
purpose is to establish minimum prices at which sales shall
be made by its vendees and by all subsequent purchasers
who traffic in its remedies. Its plan is thus to govern directly the entire trade in the medicines it manufactures,
embracing interstate commerce as well as commerce within
the States respectively. To accomplish this result it has
adopted two forms of restrictive agreements limiting trade
in the articles to those who become parties to one or the
other. The one sort of contract known as "Consignment
Contract-Wholesale," has been made with over four hundred jobbers and wholesale dealers, and the other, described as "Retail Agency Contract," with twenty-five
thousand retail dealers in the United States.
The defendant is a wholesale drug concern which has refused to enter into the required contract, and is charged
with procuring medicines for sale at "cut prices" by inducing those who have made the contracts to violate the restrictions. The complainant invokes the established doctrine that an actionable wrong is committed by one who
maliciously interferes with a contract between two parties and induces one of them to break that contract to the
injury of the other and that, in the absence of an ade-

DR. MILES MEDICAL CO. v. PARK & SONS CO. 395

quate remedy at law, equitable relief will be granted.
Angle v. Chicago, St. Paul,Minneapolis & Omaha Railway
Co., 151 U. S. 1; Bitterman v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad, 207 U. S. 205.
The principal question is as to the validity of the restrictive agreements.
Preliminarily there are opposing contentions as to the
construction of the agreements, or at"least of that made
with jobbers and wholesale dealers. The complainant insists that the "consignment contract" contemplates a true
consignment for sale for account of the complainant, and
that those who make sales under it are the complainant's
agents and not its vendees. The court below did not so
construe the agreement and considered it an effort "to disguise the wholesale dealers in the mask of agency upon the
theory that in that character one link in the system for
the suppression of the 'cut rate' business might be regarded
as valid," and that under this agreement "the jobber must
be regarded as the general owner and engaged in selling
for himself and not as a mere agent of another." 164
Fed. Rep. 805.
There are certain allegations in the bill which do not
accord with the complainant's argument. Thus it is alleged that it "has been and is the uniform custom" of the
complainant "to sell said redicines, remedies and cures
to jobbers and wholesale druggists, who in turn sell and
dispose of the same to retail druggists for sale and distribution to the ultimate- purchaser or consumer." And in
setting forth the form of the agreement in question it is alleged that it was "required to be executed by all jobbers
and wholesale druggists to.whom your orator sold its aforesaid remedies, medicines and cures." It is further stated
that as a means of maintaining "said list of prices," cards
bearing serial identifying numbers are placed in each package of remedies "sold to jobbers and wholesale druggists."
But it is also alleged in the bill that under the provisions

Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

of the contract the title to the medicines remained in the
complainant "until actual sale in good faith to retail dealers, as therein provided."
Turning to the agreement itself, we find that it purports
to appoint the party with whom it is made one of the complainant's "Wholesale Distributing Agents," and it is
agreed that the complainant, as proprietor, shall consign
to the agent "for sale for the account of said Proprietor"
such goods as it may deem necessary, "the title thereto
and property therein to be and remain in the Proprietor
absolutely until sold under and in accordance with the
provisions hereof, and all unsold goods to be immediately
returned to said Proprietor on demand and the cancellation of this agreement." The goods are to be invoiced
to the consignee at stated prices, which are the same as the
minimum prices at which the consignee is allowed to sell.
It is also agreed that the consignee shall "faithfully and
promptly account and pay to the Proprietor the proceeds
of all sales, after deducting as full compensation
a commission of ten per cent of the invoice value, and a
further commission of five per cent on the net amount of
each consignment, after deducting the said ten per cent
commission, on all advances on account remitted within
ten days from the date of any consignment," such advances, however, not to affect the title to the goods and
to be repaid should the agreement be terminated and unsold goods, on which advances had been made, be returned.
The consignee guarantees payment for all goods sold and
promises "to render a full account and remit the net proceeds on the first day of each month of and for the sales of
the month preceding."
The consignee agrees "to sell only to the designated
Retail Agents of said Proprietor as specified in lists of such
Retail Agents furnished by said Proprietor and alterable
at the will of said Proprietor." A further provision permits sales "only to the said Retail or Wholesale Agents

DR. MILES MEDICAL CO. v. PARK & SONS CO. 397
220 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of said Proprietor, as per list furnished." No time is fixed
for the duration of the agreement.
It is urged that the additional commission of five per
cent is to induce, through the guise of "advances," payment for the goods before sales are made, and that unsold
goods are to be returned only on the complainant's demand and the cancellation of the agreement. But the
consignee is not bound to make these "advances" and it is
distinctly provided that he shall not acquire title by making them. It is also said that the consignee may sell at
prices higher than those listed, but he is bound by the
agreement to account for "the proceeds of all sales" less
the stipulated commissions. Nor is the provision as to
the time for accounting and remittance of net proceeds
to be regarded as inconsistent with agency, in the absence
of a showing that in the actual transactions and accounts
the consignee was treated as selling on his own behalf and
paying as purchaser.
If, however, we consider the "consignment contract"
as one which in legal effect provides for consignments of
goods to be sold by an agent for his principal's account,
and that the tenor of the agreement as set forth must be
taken to override the inconsistent general allegations to
which we have referred, this alone would not be sufficient
to support the bill.
The bill charges that the defendant has unlawfully and
fraudulently procured the. proprietary medicines from the
complainant's "wholesale and retail agents" in violation
of their contracts. But it does not allege that the goods
procured by the defendant from "wholesale agents" were
goods consigned to the latter for sale. The description
"wholesale agent" refers to-those who have signed the
"consignment contract." This contract, however, permits one "wholesale agent" to sell to another "wholesale
agent." For all that appears, the goods procured by the
defendant may have been purchased by the defendant's

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

vendors from other wholesale agents. The bill avers that
prior to the introduction of the described system the defendant, a wholesale house, had dealt in the remedies and
had purchased them from the complainant and from
"wholesale druggists and jobbers." There is nothing in
the bill which is inconsistent with such an actual course of
dealing, permitted by the agreement itself, with respect
to the wholesale dealers who have signed it. But the
goods which one wholesale agent purchased from another
wholesale agent would not be held for sale as consigned
goods belonging to the complainant and to be accounted
for as such; and their sale by the wholesale dealer, who had
acquired title, would be made for his own account and
not for that of the complainant. The allegations of the
bill and the plain purpose of the system of contracts do
not permit the conclusion that it was intended'that wholesale dealers purchasing goods in this way should be free
to sell to any one at any price. Evidently it was not contemplated that the restrictions of the system should be
escaped in such a simple manner. But if the restrictions
of the "consignment contract," as to prices and vendees,
are to be deemed to apply to the sale of goods which one
wholesale dealer has purchased from another, it is evident
that the validity of the restrictions in this aspect must be
suppdrted on some other ground than that such sale is
made by the wholesale dealer as the agent of the complainant. The case presented by the bill cannot properly be
regarded as one for inducing breach of trust by an
agent.
The other form of contract, adopted by the complainant,
while described as a "retail agency contract," is clearly
an agreement looking to sale and not to agency. The socalled "retail agents" are not agents at all, either of the
complainant or of its consignees, but are- contemplated
purchasers who buy to sell again, that is, retail dealers.
It is agreed that they may purchase the medicines manu-

factured by the complainant at stated prices. There follows this stipulation:
"In consideration whereof said Retail Agent agrees in
no case to sell or furnish the said Proprietary Medicines
to any person, firm or corporation whatsoever, at less
than the full retail price as printed on the packages, without reduction for quantity; and. said Retail Agent further
agrees not to sell the said Proprietary Medicines at any
price to Wholesale or Retail dealers not accredited agents
of the Dr. Miles Medical Company."
It will be noticed that the ".retail agents" are not forbidden to sell either to wholesale or retail dealers if these
are "accredited agents" of the complainant, that is if the
dealers have signed either of the two contracts the complainant requires. But the restriction is intended to apply whether the retail dealers have bought the goods from
those who held under consignment or from other dealers,
wholesale or retail, who had purchased them. And in
which-way the" retail agents" who supplied the medicines
to the defendant, had bought them is not shown.
The bill asserts complainant's "right to maintain and
preserve the aforesaid system and method of contracts
and sales adopted and established by it." It is, as we
have seen, a system of interlocking restrictions by which
the complainant seeks to control not merely the prices
at which its agents may sell its products, but the prices
for all sales by all dealers at wholesale or retail, whether
purchasers or subpurchasers, and thus to fix the amount
which the consumer shall pay, eliminating all competition.
The essential features of such a system are thus described
by Mr. Justice Lurton (then Circuit Judge), in the opinion
of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of John D.
Park & Sons Company v. Samuel B. Hartman, 153 Fed.
Rep. 24, 42:" Thecontracting wholesalers or jobbers covenant that they will sell to no one who.does not come with
complainant's license to buy, and that they will not sell

below a minimum price dictated by complainant. Next,
all competition between retailers is destroyed, for each
such retailer can obtain his supply only by signing one
of the uniform contracts prepared for retailers, whereby
he covenants not to sell to anyone who proposes to sell
again unless the buyer is authorized in writing by the
complainant, and not to sell at less than a standard price
named in the agreement. Thus all room for competition
between retailers, who supply the public, is made impossible. If these contracts leave any room at any point of the
line for the usual play of competition between the dealers
in the product marketed by complainant, it is not discoverable. Thus a combination between the manufacturer, the Wholesalers and the retailers to maintain prices
and stifle competition has been brought about."
That these agreements restrain trade is obvious. That,
having been made, as the bill alleges, with "most of the
jobbers and wholesale druggists and a majority of the retail druggists of the country" and having for their purpose
the control of the entire trade, they relate directly to interstate as well as intrastate trade, and operate to restrain
trade or commerce among the several States, is also clear.
Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U. S. 211;
Bement v. National Harrow Co., 186 U. S. p. 92; Montague
& Co. v. Lowry, 193 U. S. 38; Swift & Co. v. United States,
196 U. S.375.
But it is insisted that the restrictions are not invalid
either at common law or under the act of Congress of
July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. .209, upon the following
g.-unds, which may be taken to embrace the fundamental
eciltentions for the complainant: (1) That the restrictions
are valid because they relate to proprietary medicines manufactured under a secret process; and (2) that, apart from
this, a manufacturer is entitled to control the prices on all
sales of his own products.
First. The first inquiry is whether there is any dis-

DR. MILES MEDICAL CO. v. PARK & SONS CO. 401

Opinion of the Court.

tinction, with respect to such restrictions as are here presented, between the case of an article manufactured by the
owner of a secret process and that of one produced under
ordinary conditions. The complainant urges an analogy
to rights secured by letters patent. Bement v. National
Harrow Company, 186 U. S. 70. In the case cited, there
were licenses for the manufacture and sale of articles
covered by letters patent with stipulations as to the prices
at which the licensee should sell. The court said, referring
to the act of July 2, 1890 (pp. 92, 93): "But that statute
clearly does not refer to that kind of restraint of interstate
commerce which may arise from reasonable and legal conditions imposed upon the assignee or licensee of a patent
by the owner thereof, restficting the terms upon which the
article may be used and the price to be demanded therefor. Such a construction of the act we have no doubt
was never contemplated by its framers."
But whatever rights the patentee may enjoy are derived
from statutory grant under the authority conferred by the
Constitution. This grant is based upon public considerations. The purpose of the patent law is to stimulate
invention by protecting inventors for a fixed time in the
advantages that may be derived from exclusive manufacture, use and sale. As was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 241-243: "It is the reward stipulated for the advantages derived by the public
for the exertions of the individual, and is intended as a
stimulus to those exertions.

.

The public yields

nothing which it has not agreed to yield; it receives all
which it has contracted to receive. The full benefit of the
discovery, after its enjoyment by the discoverer for fourteen years, is preserved; and for his exclusive enjoyment
of it during that time the public faith is pledged. . .
The great object and intention of the act is to secure to
the public the advantages to be derived from the discoveries of individuals, and the means it employs are the comvoL. ccxx-26

220 U. S.

pensation made to those individuals for the time and labor
devoted to these discoveries, by the exclusive right to
make, use and sell, the things discovered for a limited
time."
The complainant has no statutory grant. So far as
appears, there are no letters patent relating to the remedies
in question. The complainant has not seen fit to make
the disclosure required by the statute and thus to secure
the, privileges it confers. Its case lies outside the policy
of the patent law, and the extent of the right which that
law secures is not here involved or determined.
The complainant relies upon the ownership of its secret
process and its rights. are to be determined accordingly.
Any one may use it who fairly, by analysis and experiment,
discovers it. But the complainant is entitled to be protected against invasion of its right in the process by fraud
or by breach of trust or contract. Tabor v. Hoffman, 118
N. Y. 36; Chadwick v. Covell, 151 Massachusetts, 190.
The secret process may be the subject of confidential
communication and of sale or license to use with restrictions as to territory and prices. Fowle v. Park, 131 U. S.
88. A similar principle obtains with respect to the confidential communication of quotations collected by a board
of trade. Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co.,
'198 U. S.236.
Here, however, the question concerns not the process
oif manufacture, but the manufactured product, an article
of commerce. The complainant has not communicated its
process in trust, or under contract, or executed a license for
the use of the process with restrictions as to the manufacture and sale by the licensee to whom the communication
is made. The complainant has retained its secret which
apparently it believes to be undiscoverable. Whether its
remedies are sold or unsold, whether the restrictions as to
future sales are valid or invalid, the complainant's secret
remains intact. That the complainant may rightfully ob-

Opinion of the Court.

ject to attempts to discover it by fraudulent means, or to a
breach of trust or contract relating to the process, does not
require the conclusion that it is entitled to establish restrictions with respect to future sales by those who purchase its
manufactured pioduct. It is said that the remedies "embody" the secret. It would be more correct to say that
they are manufactured according to the secret process and
do not constitute a communication of it. It is also urged
that as the process is secret no one else tan manufacture the article. But this argument rests on monopoly
of production and not on the secrecy of the process or the
particular fact that may confer that monopoly. It implies
that, if for any reason monopoly of production exists, it
carries with it the right to control the entire trade of the
produced article and to prevent any competition that
otherwise might atise between wholesale and retail dealers.
The principle would not be limited to secret processes,
but would extend to goods manufactured by any one who
secured control of the source of supply of a necessary raw
material or ingredient. But, because there is monopoly
of production, it certainly cannot be said that there is no
public interest in maintaining freedom of trade with respect to future sales after the article has been placed on
the market and the producer has parted with his title.
Moreover, every manufacturer, before sale, controls the
articles he makes. With respect to these, he has the
rights of ownership and his dominion does not depend upon
whether the process of manufacture is known or unknown,
or upon any special advantage he may possess by reason
of location, materials or efficiency. The fact that the
market may not be supplied with the particular article,
unless he produces it, is a practical consequence which
does not enlarge his right of property in what he does
produce.
If a manufacturer, in the absence of statutory privilege,
has the control over the sales of the manufactured'article,

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

for which the complainant here contends, it is not because

the process of manufacture is kept secret.

In this respect,

the maker of so-called proprietary medicines, unpatented,
stands on *no different footing from that. of other manufacturers. The fact that the article is represented to be
curative in its properties does not justify a restriction of
trade which would be unlawful as to compositions designed
for other purposes.
Second. We come, then, to the second question,'whether
the complainant, irrespective of the secrecy of its process,
is entitled to maintain the restrictions by virtue of the fact
that they relate to products of its own manufacture.
The basis of the argument appears to be that, as the
manufacturer may make and sell, or not, as he chooses,
he may affix conditions as to the use of the article or as to
the prices at which purchasers may dispose of it. The

propriety of the restraint is sought to be derived from the
liberty of the producer.
But because a manufacturer is not bound to make or
sell, it does not follow that in case of sales actually made
lie may impose upon purchasers every sort of restriction.
Thus a general restraint upon alienation is ordinarily
invalid. "The right of alienation is one of the essential
incidents of a right of general property in movables, and
restraints upon alienation have been generally regarded
as obnoxious to public policy, which is best subserved by
great freedom of traffic in such things as pass from hand
to hand. General restraint in the alienation of articles,
things, chattels, except when a very special kind of. property is involved, such as a slave or an heirloom, have been
generally held void. 'If a man,' says Lord Coke, in Coke

on Littleton, section 360, 'be possessed of a borse or any
other chattel, real or personal, and give his whole interest
or property therein, upon condition that the donee or
vendee shall not alien the same, the same is void, because
his whole interest and property is out of him, so as he hath

DR. MILES MEDICAL CO. v. PARK & SONS CO. 405

Opinion of the Court.

no possibility of reverter; and it is against trade and traffic
and bargaining and contracting between man and man."'
Park v. Hartman, supra. See also Gray on Restraints
on Alienation, §§ 27, 28.
Nor can the manufacturer by rule and notice, in the
absence of contract or statutory right, even though the
restriction be known to purchasers, fix prices for future
sales. It has been held by this court that no such privilege exists under the copyright statutes, although the
owner of the copyright has the sole right to vend copies
of the copyrighted production. Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.
Straus, 210 U. S. 339. There the court said (p. 351):
"The owner of the copyright in this case did sell copies
of the book in quantities and'at a price satisfactory to it.
It has exercised the right to vend. What the complainant
contends for embraces not only the right to sell the copies,
but to qualify the title of a future purchaser by the reservation of the right to have the remedies of the statute
against an infringer because of the printed notice of its
purpose so to do unless the purchaser sells at a price fixed
in the notice. To add to the right of exclusive sale the
authority to control all future retail sales, by a notice that
such sales must be made at a fixed sum, would give a
right not included in the terms of the statute, and, in our
view, extend its operation, by construction, beyond its
meaning, when interpreted with a view to ascertaining
the legislative intent in its enactment." It will hardly
be contended, with respect to such a matter, that the
manufacturer of an article of commerce, not protected by
any statutory grant, is in any better case. See Taddy &
Co. v. Sterious & Co. (1904), 1 Ch. 354; McGruther v.
Pitcher (1904), 2 Ch. 306; Garst v. Hall & Lyon Co., 179
Massachusetts, 588. Whatever right the manufacturer
may have to project his control beyond his own sales must
depend, not upon an inherent power incident to production and original ownership, but upon agreement.

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

With respect to contracts in restraint of trade, the
earlier doctrine of the common law has been substantially
modified in adaptation to modern conditions. But the
public interest is still the first consideration. To sustain
the restraint, it must be found to be reasonable both with
respect to the public and to the parties and that it is limited to what is fairly necessary, in the circumstances of
the particular casc, for the protection of the covenantee.
'Otherwise restraints of trade are void as against public
policy. As was said by this court in Gibbs v. Baltimore
Gas Co., 130 U. S. p. 409, "The decision in Mitchel v.
Reynblds' 1'P. Wins. 18L; S. C., Smith's Leading Cases,
407, 7th Eng. ed.; 8th Am. ed. 756, is the foundation of the
rule in relation to the invalidity of contracts in restraint
of trade; but as it was made under a condition of things,
and a state of society, different from those which now prevail, the rule laid down is not regarded as inflexible, and
has been considerably modified. Public welfare is first
considered, and if it be not involved, and the restraint
upon one party is not greater than protection to the other
party requires, the contract may be sustained. The question is, whether, under the particular circumstances of the
case and the nature of the particular contract involved in
it, the contract is, or is not, unreasonable. Rousillon v.
Rousillon, 14 Ch. D. 351; Leather Cloth Co. v. Lorsont, L.
R. 9 Eq. 345."
"The true view at the present time," said Lord Macnaghten in Nordenfelt v. Maxim-Nordenfelt &c. Co., 1904,
A. C. p. 565, "I think, is this: The public have an interest
in every person's carrying on his trade freely: so has the
individual. All interference with individual liberty of.
action in trading, and all restraints of trade of themselves,
if ,there is nothing more, are contrary to public policy,
and therefore void. That is the general rule.. But there
are exceptions: restraints, of trade and interference with
individual liberty of action may be justified by the special

DR. MILES MEDICAL CO. v. PARK & SONS CO. 407

Opinion of the Court.

circumstances of a particular case. It is a sufficient justification, and indeed it is the only justification, if the restriction is reasonable--reasonable, that is, in reference to
the interests of the parties concerned and reasonable in
reference to the interests of the public, so framed and so
guarded as to afford adequate protection to the party in
whose favor it is imposed, while at the same time it is in
no way injurious to the public."
The present case is not analogous to that of a sale of
good will, or of an interest in a business, or of the grant
of a right to use a process of manufacture. The complainant has not parted with any interest in its business
or instrumentalities of production. It has conferred no
right by virtue of which purchasers of its products may
compete with it. It retains complete control over the
business in which it is engaged, manufacturing what it
pleases and fixing such prices for its own sales as it may
desire. Nor are we dealing with a single transaction, conceivably unrelated to the public interest. The agreements
are designed to maintain prices, after the complainant
has parted with the title to the articles, and to prevent
competition among those who trade in them.
The bill asserts the importance of a standard retail
price and alleges generally that confusion and damage
have resulted from sales at less than the prices fixed. But
the advantage of established retail prices primarily concerns the dealers. The enlarged profits which would result from adherence to the established rates would go to
them and not to the complainant. It is through the
inability of the favored dealers to realize these profits,
on account of the described competition, that the complainant works out its alleged injury. If there be an advantage to a manufacturer in the maintenance of fixed
retail prices, the question remains whether it is one which
he is entitled to secure by agreements restricting the freedom of trade on the part of dealrs who own what they

Opinion of the Court.

220 U.S.

sell. As to this, the complainant can fare no better with
its plan of identical contracts than could the dealers
themselves if they formed a combination and endeavored
to establish the same restrictions, and thus to achieve the
same result, by agreement with each other. If the immediate advantage they would thus obtain would not be
sufficient to sustain such a direct agreement, the asserted,
ulterior benefit to the complainant cannot be regarded
as sufficient to support its system.
But agreements or combinations between dealers, having for their sole purpose the destruction of competition
and the fixing of prices, are injurious to the public interest
and void. They are not saved by the advantages which
the participants expect to derive from the enhanced price
to the consumer. People v. Sheldon, 139 N. Y. 251;
Judd v. Harrington, 139 N. Y. 105; People v. Milk Exchange, 145 N. Y. 267; United States v. Addyston Pipe &
Steel Co., 85 Fed. Rep. 271; on app. 175 U. S. 211; Montague &.Co. v. Lowry, 193 U. S. 38; Chapin v. Brown, 83
Iowa, 156; Craft v. McConoughy, 79 Illinois, 346; W. H.
Hill Co. v. Gray & Worcester, 127 N. W. Rep. (Mich.) 803.
The complainant's plan falls within the principle which
condemns contracts of this class. It, in effect, creates a
combination for the prohibited purposes. No distinction
can properly be made by reason of the particular character of the commodity in question. It is not entitled to
special privilege or immunity. It is an article of commerce
and the rules concerning the freedom of trade must be
held to apply to it. Nor does the fact that the margin
of freedom-is reduced by the control of production make
the protection of what remains, in such a case, a negligible
matter. And where commodities have passed into the
channels of trade and are owned by dealers, the validity
of agreements to prevent competition and to maintain
prices is not to be determined by the circumstance
whether
they were produced by several manufacturers or by one,

oF whether they were previously owned by one or by many.
The complainant having sold its product at prices satisfactory to itself, the public is entitled to whatever advantage may be derived from competition in the subspquent traffic.
The questions involved were carefully considered and
the decisions reviewed by Judge Lurton in delivering the
opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in Park v. Hartman, supra, and, in following that case, it was concluded
below that the restrictions sought to be enforced by the
bill were invalid both at common law and under the act
of Congress of July 2, 1890. We think that the court was
right.
The allegations of the bill as to the labels. and cartons
used by the complainant are evidently incidental to the
main charge as to the procurement of violation of the restrictions as to prices and vendees contained in the agreement; and failing as to this no case is made for relief with
respect to the trade-marks, which art not shown to have
been infringed.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE LURTON took no part in the consideration

and decision of this case.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES, dissenting.

This is a bill to restrain the defendant from inducing,
by corruption and fraud, agents of the plaintiff and purchasers from it to break their contracts not to sell its goods
below a certain price. There are two contracts concerned.
The first is that of the jobber or wholesale agent to whom
the plaintiff consigns its goods, and I will say a few words
about that, although it is not this branch of the case that
induces me to speak. - That they are agents and not buyers I understand to be conceded, and I do not see how it

220 U. S.

can be denied. We have nothing before us but the form
and the alleged effect of the written instrument, and they
both are express that the title to the goods is to remain
in the plaintiff until actual sale as permitted by the contract. So far as this contract limits the authority of the
agents as agents I do not understand its validity to be
disputed. But it is construed also to permit the purchase
of medicine by consignees from other consignees, and to
make the specification of prices applicable to goods so
purchased as well as to goods consigned. Hence when
the bill alleges that the defendant has obtained medicine
from these agents by inducing them to break their contracts, the allegation does not require proof of breach of
.trust by an agent, but would be satisfied by proving a
breach of promise in respect of goods that the consignee
had bought and owned. This reasoning would have been
conclusive in the days of Saunders if the construction of
the contract is right, as I suppose that it is. But the contract as to goods purchased is at least in the background
and obscure; it is not the main undertaking that the instrument is intended to express. I should have thought
that the bill ought to be read as charging the defendant
with inducing a breaoh of the ordinary duty of consignees
as such (Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S. 375, 395),
and, therefore, as entitling the plaintiff to relief. Angle
v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Ry. Co.,. 151
1.S. 1.
The second contract is that of the retail agents, so called,
being really the first purchasers, fixing the price below
which they will not sell to the public. There is no attempt
to attach a contract or condition to the goods, as in BobbsMerrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U. S.339, or in any way to restrict, dealings with them after they leave the hands of the
retail men.' The sale to the retailers is made by the plaintiff, and the only question is whether the law forbids a
purchaser to contract with his vendor that he will not sell

DR. MILES MEDICAL CO. v. PARK & SONS CO. 411
220 U. S.

HOLMES,

J., dissenting.

below a certain price. This is the important question in
this case. I suppose that in the case of a single object
such as a painting or a statue the right of the artist to
make such a stipulation hardly would be denied. In other
words, I suppose that the reason why the contract is held
bad is that it is part of a 'scheme embracing other similar
contracts each of which applies to a number of similar
things, with the object of fixing a general market price.
This reason seems to me inadequate in-the case before the
court. In the first place by a slight change in the form of
the contract the plaintiff can accomplish the result in a
way that would be beyond successful attack. If it should
make the retail dealers also agents in law as well as in
name and retain the title until the goods left their hands I
cannot conceive that even the present enthusiasm for regulating the prices to be charged by other people would
deny that the owner was acting within his rights. It
seems to me that this consideration by itself ought to give
us pause.
But I go farther. There is no statute covering the case;
there is no body of precedent that by ineluctable logic
requires the conclusion to which the court has come. The
conclusion is reached by extending a certain conception of
public policy to a new sphere. On such matters we are
in perilous country. I think that, at least, it is safe to
say that the most enlightened judicial policy is to let people manage their own business in their own way, unless
the ground for interference is very clear. What then is
the ground upon which we interfere in the present case?
Of course, it is not the interest of the producer. No one,
I judge, cares for that. It hardly can be the interest of
subordinate vendors, as there seems to be no particular reason for preferring them to the originator and firsf vendor
of the product. Perhaps it may be assumed to be the
interest of the consumers and the public. On that point
I confess that I am in a minority as to larger issues than

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
HOLMES, J., dissenting.

are concerned here. I think that we greatly exaggerate
the value and importance to the public of competition
in the production or distribution of an article (here it is
only distribution), as fixing a fair price. What really
fixes that is the competition of conflicting desires. We,
none of us, can have as much as we want 6f all the things
that we want. Therefore, we have to choose. As soon
as the price of something that we want goes above the
point at which we are willing to give up other things to
have that, We cease to buy it and buy something else. Of
course, I am speaking of things that we can get along
without. There may be necessaries that sooner or later
must be dealt with like short rations in a shipwreck, but
they are not Dr. Miles's medicines. With regard to things
like the latter it seems to me that the point of most profitable returns marks the equilibrium of social desires and
determines the fair price in the only sense in which I can
find meaning in those words. The Dr. Miles Medical
Company knows better than we do what will enable it to
do the best bisiness. We must assume its retail price to
be reasonable, for it is so alleged and the case is here on
demurrer; so I see nothing to warrant my assuming that
the public will not be served best by the company being
allowed to carry out its plan. I cannot believe that in the
long run the public will profit by this court permitting
knaves to cut reasonable prices for some ulterior purpose
of their own and thus to impair, if not to destroy, the production and sale of articles which it is assumed to be desirable that the public should be able to get.
The conduct of the defendant falls within a general prohibition of the law. It is fraudulent and has no merits of
its own to recommend it to the favor of the court. An injunction, against a defendant's dealing in non-transferable
round-trip reduced rate tickets has been granted to a
railroad company upon the general principles of the law
protecting contracts, and the demoralization of rates has

been referred to as a special circumstance in addition to
the general grounds. Bit~erman v. Louisville & Nashille
R. R. Co., 207 U. S. 205, 222, 223, 224. The general and
special considerations equally apply here, and we ought
not to disregard them, unless the evil effect of the contract is very plain. The analogy relied upon to establish
that evil effect is that of combinations in restraint of trade.
I believe that we have some superstitions on that head,
as I have said; but those combinations are entered into
with intent to exclude others from a business naturally
open to them, and we unhappily have become familiar
with the methods by which they are carried out. I venture to say that there is no likeness between them and this
case. Jayne v. Loder, 149 Fed. Rep. 21, 27; and I think
that my view prevails in England. Elliman, Sons & Co.

v. Harris, 177 Massachusetts, 72; Garst v. Charles, 187

the question and the popularity of what I deem mistaken
notions makes it my duty to express my view in this dissent.
