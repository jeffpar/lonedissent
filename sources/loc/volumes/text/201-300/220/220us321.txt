UNITED STATES v. O'BRIEN,, INDIVIDUALLY
AND AS A MEMBER OF THE FIRM OF PERKINS & O'BRIEN.
ERROR TO THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 108.

Argued March 17, 1911.-Decided A15ril 3, 1911.

The word "annul" as used in the contract involved in this case construed as refusing to perform further, not to rescind or avoid.
A government contract whichmakes the right of the contractor. to
continue work under the contract depend upon the approval.of the
engineer in charge will not in the absence of*express \terms be construed as making the dissatisfaction of such engineer with progress
of the work conclusive of a breach.
Where, except for the prohibition of the United States to allow the
contractor to proceed, the work might have. been finished within
the specified period, the United States canfiotclaim a breach ektitling it to annul the contract and hold the contractor responsible
for difference in cost of completion.
163.Fed. Rep. 1022, affirmed.
THE facts

are stated in the opinion.

The Solicitor General, with whom Mr. Assistant Attorney
General Denison was on the brief, for the United States:
The "annulment" of the contract by the engineer' was
valid. It was made in good faith; it was not premature,
and it was duly sanctioned by the chief of engineers.
By the contract the "judgment" of -the engineer in
charge was made the test of the right to annul. Where,
*then, he acted upon his "judgment," and not upon any
malicious or fraudulent motive, his decision is final, as
this and other courts have repeatedly held. Kihlberg v.

does not mean a rescission ab initio, but is merely intended
to effectuate the termination of the work under the contract on a breach. The use of this word was not intended

The provision for "forfeiture" of the retained percentages and moneys due is a provision not for liquidated
damages, but for security on account of the actual damages; this is shown by numerous considerations, including
conclusively the reference to Rev. Stat., ยง 3709.

MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit brought by the United States to recover
the extra expense incurred to complete some dredging
in Rhode Island, by reason of the failure of the defendants
Perkins and O'Brien diligently and faithfully to prosecute
the work. The complaint was dismissed by the Circuit
Court in accordance with the decision of the Circuit
Court of Appeals upon a previous tfial, 159 Fed. Rep.

UNITED STATES v. O'BRIEN.
220 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

671; 86 C. C. A. 539, and the judgment was affirmed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals. 163 Fed. Rep. 1022;
89 C. C. A. 664.
Perkins and O'Brien made a contract with the United
States to do the dredging required in improving Providence River and Narragansett Bay between certain points,
to begin work on or before March 1, 1899, and to complete it on or before July 1, 1902. One term of the contract was that if they should fail to begin on time or
should, "in the judgment of the engineer in charge, fail
to prosecute faithfully and diligently the work in accordance with the specifications and requirements of this contract, then, in either, case, the party of the first part, or
his successor legally appointed, shall have power, with the
sanction of the. Chief of Engineers, to annul this contract
by giving notice in writing to that effect, ....
and,
upon the giving of such notice all money or reserved per-.
centage due or to become due to the party or parties of
the second part by~reason of this contract shall be and
become forfeited to the United States; and the party of
the first part shall be thereupon authorized, if an immediate performance of the work or delivery of the materials be, in his opinion, required by the public exigency,
to proceed to provide for the same by open purchase or
contract, as prescribed in ยง.3709 of the Revised Statutes of the United States: " with a proviso that if the contractors should be prevented by violence of the elements
from beginning or completing the work as agreed' such
additional time might be allowed them as in the judgment
of the party of the first part should be just.
Toward the end of the contract, four paragraphs further
on than the last; was the further agreement: "In case of
failure on the part 6t the party of the second part to
complete this contract as specified and agreed upon, that
all sums due and percentage retained shall thereby be
forfeited, to the United States, and that the saidt United

States shall also have the right to recover any or all
damages due to such failure in excess 'of the sums so forfeited, and also to recover from the party of 'the second
part, as part of said damages, whatever sums may be
expended by the party of the first part in completing the
said contract, in excess of the price herein stipulated to be
paid to the party of the second part for completing the
same."
The work was begun but did not go on satisfactorily.
On December 4, 1900, the major of engineers in charge
wrote from Newport to the contractors and their surety,
now represented by the other defendant, "that from
present appearances it does not seem to be possible for
the contractors to put on other dredges than the one now
supposed to be at work," stating what had been done and
what would have to be done before the time allowed
expired, and that to do the work, it would need three
dredges upon it continuously. The letter proceeded to
give the authorized warning that "unless the contractors
have on work by January 1st, 1901, a sufficient plant to
dredge at least 100,000 cubic yards per month the contract will be annulled." On December 13 the contractors
answered from New York, stating that they expected
to make an arrangement to put on two more dredges
within a few days. On December 29, 1900, the contractors telegraphed that their representative would call upon
the major in charge on Tuesday morning, i. e., January 1.
On December 31 he replied that the representative could
accomplish nothing by coming, and on the same day wrote
to the defendants informing them that the contract was
annulled. The work afterwards was finished by other
parties, at much increased cost. There- was no substantial ground in the evidence to attribute the Government's course to. anything but the fault of the contractors,
which was ver .plain, and. the only question is what
liability they incurred.

UNITED STATES v. OBRIEN.
220 U. S.

.327

Opinion of the Court.

The sole material express promise of the contractors
was to complete the,work by July 1, 1902. If the work
was done at that date that promise was perfprmed, no
matter how irregularly or with what delays in the earlier
months. Under its terms the United -States was not
concerned with the stages of performance, but only with
the completed result. See Bacon v. Parker, 137 Massachusetts, 309, 311. Its interest in the result, however,
made it reasonable to reserve the right to employ .some
one else if, when time enough had gone by to show what
was -likely to happen, it saw that it probably would not
get what it bargained for from the present hands. - But
it would be a very severe construction of the contract,
a contract, too, framed by the United States; to read the
reservation of a right to annul, for want, of a diligence
not otherwise promised, as importing a promise to use
such diligence as should satisfy the judgment of the engineer in charge. It is one thing to make the right to
continue work under the contract depend upon his approval, another to make his dissatisfaction with progress
conclusive of a breach. In this case it was admitted that
there was time enough left to finish the work under the
contract when the defendants were turned off. It would
be a very harsh measure to pronounce the contract broken
when but for the prohibition of the United States the defendants might have done the work in time. The right
to terminate the employment of the defendants coupled
with a provision for monthly payments based upon. the
amount of material removed, and therefore, of course
giving little pay for little work, is the protection expressly
stipulated by the United States.
Again, the later paragraph that we have quoted, giving
the -right to recover expense of completing the work in
excess of the original price, gives that right only-"in case
of failure . . . to complete this contract as specified
and agreed upon." On their face these words mean failure

OCTOBER TERM, 19i0.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

to complete by July 1, 1902, not failure to complete because turned off by the engineer in charge, a year and six
months before that time arrived, when competent persons still might do the job. The earlier clause undeir
which the so-called annulment took place provides for
no such consequence, but only for a forfeiture of reserved
percentages and money due. It is true that the expression
of the right to proceed to provide for the completion of the
contract and the reference to Rev. Stat., ยง 3709, hardly
belong in that part of the contract unless the defendants
are liable for the expense, but the contract does not show
technical accuracy enough to give this consideration
great weight. If the United States wants more it must
say so in plainer words.
If the proviso for annulment be not construed to import a promise on the defendants' part, we are of opinion
that there is no ground to charge them with a breach of
contract. There were suggestions on the Government's
part of anticipatory breach, etc., that do not seem to us
'to need discussion.
We may add one further observation, although it hardly
is material, in the view that we take. The ill chosen word
'annul' in the contract, repeated in the notice to the
contractors and in the complaint, cannot be taken literally
in any of them. It means refuse to perform further,
not rescind or avoid. Philadelphia,Wilmington & Baltimore R. R. Co. v. Howard, 13 How. 307, 340. For, if the
contract were made naught by the Government's election
and notice, all rights under it would-be at an end, whereas
it. provides in terms that rights shall arise upon annulment, which but for this provision in the contract the
Government would not have. The suit is upon the contract, but the United States asks more than in our opinion
the contract gives.
Judgment affirmed.
