ARNETT v. READE.

Argument for Appellants.

ARNETT v. READE.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF
NEW MEXICO.
No. 98. Argued March 14, 1911.-Decided April 3, 1911.
Under the law of New.Mexico of 1901, providing that both husband
and wife must join in conveyances of real estate acquired during
coverture, a deed of the husband in which the wife does not join is
ineffectual to convey community property even though acquired
prior to the passage of the act.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. N. C. Frenger and Mr. Clifford S. Walton for appellants:
As to community property, the husband and wife constitute a society, association, partnership or company. The
husband is not the sole and absolute owner of community
property. Holyoke v. Jackson, 3 Wash. Ter. 235.
In adopting the community system a State is bound by
the principleg thereof according to the established rules
of the country or State from whence adopted. Reymond
v. Newcomb, 10 N. Mex. 151; Hill v. Young, 7 Washington, 33; Warburton v. White, 176 U. S. 484; Ballinger on
Comm. Prop., § 255; Lichty v. Lewis, 63 Fed. Rep. 535;
Mabie v. Whittaker, 10 Washington, 656.
The husband cannot dispose of by will, more than half
of the community property. Beard v. Knox, 5 California, 252, 256; In re Buchanan's Estate, 8 California,
507; Walton's Civil Law, Art. 1414; Thompson v. Cragg,

wife. Smith v. Smith, 12 California, 217; DeGodey v.
DeGodey, 39 California, 157.
Upon the dissolution of marriage by divorce the wife is
entitled to half of the community property. Cases .supra
and Galland v. Galland, 38 California, 265; Schmidt's
Civil Law, Art. 56.
The basis and essence of community property is that
the industry and contributions of both spouses create the
fund. Cases supra and Meyer v. Kinzer, 12 California,
248; Johmiston's Civil Law of Spain, 67; McKay on Comm.
Prop., § 168; also Ballinger on Comm. Prop., § 11.
The husband's power to dispose of community proper~y is because he is the head of the community. As soon
as he ceases to be the head, as in case of divorce, his power
fails.
The term "a mere expectancy". is a term not to be
taken literally. The wife's right of dower depends upon
whether or not the wife survives the husband, but her
right in. community property does not. Galland v. Galland, 38 California, 265.
Under the French law until the marriage is dissolved
or the community otherwise terminates, the wife has no
right whatever; she has nothing but a mere expectancy.
Dixon v. Dixon's Executors, infra.
,The admission of counsel for appellee in Garrozi v.
Dastas, 204 U. S.81, as to a similarity of provisions of the
Code Napoleon and the Spanish law prior to the civil
code of 1889, as to community property, is apt to be
misleading, if not in error.
But the law of community property as known in Spain
was not derived from the French or from the Roman law,
and under the Spanish law the rights of husband and wife
in community property grow out of the marriage contract, and do not originate in its dissolution. Walton's
Ciyil Law in Spain, 32, 42.
Upon the death of the Wife her heirs inherit her share of

Argument for Appellee.

220 U. S.

Community may be dissolved by confiscation of share
of either spouse, but the other spouse is not thereby interfered with in the rights to his or her share. The heirs
of deceased spouse and surviving spouse may form a new
community. The wife may renounce her community
rights. Schmidt's Civil Law of Spain and Mexico.
Upon the death of the husband, the wife is entitled to
half of community property not as heir nor through arbitrary divesting from husband, but by virtue of her community right. Kircherv. Murray, 54 Fed. Rep. 617 (Tex.);
Pedro Murillo Velarde, as quoted in 9 N. Mex. 205.
If no issue, upon death of one spouse the other does not
inherit, but share of deceased in community property
escheats. Babb v. ,Carroll, 21 Texas, 765, citing Spanish
authorities.
The wife loses her gains in community property if she
commits adultery. Absolute ownership means the right
to enjoy and dispose of property as one pleases (by testament or otherwise).
Mr. J. H. Paxton for appellee:
The Spanish-Mexican law as to community or acquest
property became the law of the Territory of New Mexico
from the time of the cession by Mexico, and is still in
force in so far as the same has not been modified by statute. Strong v. Eakin, 11 N. Mex. 113; Reade v. De Lea,
95 Pac. Rep. 132.
The laws in force where a contract is made and where it
-is to be performed enter into it and form a part of it as if
they were expressly referred. to or incorporated in its
terms, and this is true of a contract of marriage. Von

The extent of the impairment of the obligations of a
contract is immaterial. Whatever legislation diminishes
the efficacy impairs the obligation. Ranger v. New Orleans, 102 U. S. 206.
A vested right means the power to do certain actions

Under the Spanish-Mexican community property law,
in force in New Mexico when the marriage was celebrated
and when the land in question in this suit was acquired,
the husband acquired said land by an absolute and vested
title, during the subsistence of the community, -save only
that he could not dispose of said land in fraud of his wife's
expectancy; and the wife, during the subsistence of the
community, acquired no vested interest: or title in or to
said land, but only a revocable and fictitious ownership
or a mere expectancy. Escriche, Diccionario Razonada

There is no restraint on the power of the husband to
alienate a portion of the community property after suit
for divorce begun unless such alienation is made with a
fraudulent view of injuring the rights of the wife. Meyer

.change. The Wife's interest is a mere expectancy, like
the interest an heir possesses in the property of the ancestor. Van Maren v. Johnson, 15 California, 312;
Packard-v. Arellane', 17 California, 539. Where the marriage is dissolved by the 'death of the wife her descendants
succeed to the interest to which she would otherwise be
entitled. They do not, however; succeed to such interest
as a portion of her estate, but because it is vested in them
by the statute. Garrozi v. Dastas, 204U. S. 79; Reade v.
De Lea, 95 Pac. Rep. 131.
Under the Spanish-Mexican law the Wife is neither a
necessary nor a proper party to a suit involving title to
community property. Consequently she has no legal or
equitable vested interest therein. The title must vest
somewhere. Whiexe but in the husband? Althof v. Conheim, 38 California, 230; Jergens v. Schiele, 61 Texas, 255;

MR. JUSTICE

HOIMEs delivered the opinion. of the court.

This is a suit to quiet title brought by the appellee
against. the widow of. Adolpho Lea, for whom her heirs
were substituted upon her decease. Adolpho Lea married
in 1857. He bought the land in question in 1889 and
1893 and it became community property. In 1902 he
sold it to the appellee, shortly before his death in the
same year, his wife not joining in the conveyance. By.
the laws of*New Mexico of 1901, c. 62, § 6, (a) "neither
husband- nor wife shall convey, mortgage, incumber or
dispose of any real estate or legal or -equitable interest
therein acquired during coverture by onerous title unless
both join in the execution thereof." The courts of New
Mexico gave judgment for the plaintiff on the ground
that the husband had vested rights that would be taken
away if, the statute were allowed to apply to land previously acqfired; citing Guice v. Lawrence, 2 La. Ann. .226,
Spreckels v. Spreckels, 116 California, 339, etc. The defendants appealed to this court.
There was some suggestion" at the argument that the
husband acquired from his marriage rights by contract
that could not be impaired, but of course there :is nothing
in: that, even if it appeared, as it does not, that the parties
were married in New Mexico, then being domiciled there.
Maynard v. Hill, .125 U. S. 190, 210 et seq, Baker v. Kil'gore, 145 U. S. 487,.490, 491. The Supreme Court does
not put its decision vpon that ground, but upon.the notion

ARNETT v. READE.
220 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

that during the joint lives the husband was in substance
the owner, the wife having a mere expectancy, and that
the old saying was true that community is a partnership
which begins only at its end. We do not perceive how
this statement of the wife's position can be reconciled
with the old law of New Mexico embraced in §§ 2030,
2031 of the Compiled Laws, 1897, referred to in the dissenting opinion of Abbott, A. J.,: that after payment of the
common debts, the deduction of the survivor's separate
property and his half of the acqu8t property, and subject
to the payment of the debts of th -decedent, the remainder
of the acquest property and the separate estate of the
decedent shall constitute the body of the estate for descent
and distribution, and in the absence of a will shall descend,
one-fourth to the surviving husband, etc. For if the wife
had a mere possibility, it would seem that whatever went
to the husband from her so-called half would not descend
from her, but merely would continue his. The statement also directly contradicts the conception of the community system expressed in Warburton v. White, 176 U. S.
484, 494, that the control was given to the .husband, "not
because he was the exclusive owner,, but because by law
he was created the agent of community." And notwithstanding the citation in Garrozi v. .Dastas, 204 U. S. 64,
of some of the passages and dicta from authors and cases
most relied upon by the court below, we think it plain
that there was no intent in that decision .to deny or qualify the expression quoted from Warburton v. White. See
Garrozi v. Dastas, 204 U. S.78. Los bienes que han marido y muger que son de ambos por medio., Novisima Recopilacion, Book 10, Title 4, Law 4.
It is not necessary to go very deeply into the precise
nature of the, wife's interest during marriage. The discussion has fed the flame of juridical controversy for
many years. The notion that the husband is the true
owner is said to represent the tendency of the French

.However this may be,. it is very plain that the wife has a
greater interest than the mere possibility of an expectant
heir. For it is conceded by the court below and 'everywhere, we believe, that in one way or another she has a
remedy for an- alienation made in fraud of, her by her
husband. Novisima Recopilacion, Book 10, Title 4,

more than a, reference' to' Randall v. Krieger, '23. Wall.
137, as to the power of the legislature over an inchoate
right of dower to make us believe that a law could put
an end to her interiest without compensation consistently
with the Constitution of the United States. But whether
it could or not, it has not tried to destroy it, but, on the
contrary to protect it" And as she was protected against
fraud already, we can conceive no reason why the legislation could, not make that protection more effectual
by requiring her concurrence in her husband's deed of the
land.
