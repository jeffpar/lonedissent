OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Per Curiam

GOMEZ ET AL. v. UNITED STATES DISTRICT
COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT
OF CALIFORNIA ET AL.
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE STAY
No. A-767.

Decided April 21, 1992

The Court of Appeals granted Robert Alton Harris a stay of execution
pending a review of his 42 U. S. C. ยง 1983 claim that his execution by
lethal gas would be cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth
Amendment.
Held: The application to vacate the stay of execution is granted. Harris'
action is an obvious attempt to avoid the application of McCleskey v.
Zant, 499 U. S. 467, to bar this successive claim for relief. He has made
no convincing showing of cause for his failure to raise this claim in his
four prior federal habeas petitions. Even assuming that he could avoid
the application of McCleskey, his claim should not be considered on the
merits. Since he is seeking an equitable remedy, the State's strong
interest in proceeding with its judgment and Harris' obvious attempt at
manipulation must be taken into consideration. This claim could have
been raised more than a decade ago, and there is no reason for this
abusive delay, which has been compounded by the last-minute attempts
to manipulate the judicial process.
Application granted.
PER CURIAM.

Robert Alton Harris brought a 42 U. S. C. ยง 1983 action
claiming that execution by lethal gas is cruel and unusual in
violation of the Eighth Amendment. This action is an obvious attempt to avoid the application of McCleskey v. Zant,
499 U. S. 467 (1991), to bar this successive claim for relief.
Harris has now filed four prior federal habeas petitions. He
has made no convincing showing of cause for his failure to
raise this claim in his prior petitions.
Even if we were to assume, however, that Harris could
avoid the application of McCleskey to bar his claim, we
would not consider it on the merits. Whether his claim is

framed as a habeas petition or as a ยง 1983 action, Harris
seeks an equitable remedy. Equity must take into consideration the State's strong interest in proceeding with its judgment and Harris' obvious attempt at manipulation. See In
re Blodgett, 502 U. S. 236 (1992); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320,
322 (1990) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). This claim could have
been brought more than a decade ago. There is no good
reason for this abusive delay, which has been compounded
by last-minute attempts to manipulate the judicial process.
A court may consider the last-minute nature of an application
to stay execution in deciding whether to grant equitable
relief.
The application to vacate the stay of execution of death is
granted, and it is ordered that the orders staying the execution of Robert Alton Harris entered by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in No. 92-70237 on
April 20, 1992, are vacated.
JUSTICE STEVENS,

with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins,

dissenting.
In a time when the Court's jurisprudence concerning the
imposition of the death penalty grows ever more complicated, Robert Alton Harris brings a simple claim. He argues that California's method of execution-exposure to cyanide gas-constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and
therefore violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.
In light of all that we know today about the extreme and
unnecessary pain inflicted by execution by cyanide gas, and
in light of the availability of more humane and less violent
methods of execution, Harris' claim has merit. I would deny
the State's application to vacate the stay imposed by the
Court of Appeals and allow the courts below to hear and rule
on Harris' claim.

STEVENS, J., dissenting

Execution by cyanide gas is "in essence asphyxiation by
suffocation or strangulation."' As dozens of uncontroverted expert statements filed in this case illustrate, execution by cyanide gas is extremely and unnecessarily painful.
"Following inhalation of cyanide gas, a person will first
experience hypoxia, a condition defined as a lack of oxygen in the body. The hypoxic state can continue for
several minutes after the cyanide gas is released in the
execution chamber. During this time, a person will remain conscious and immediately may suffer extreme
pain throughout his arms, shoulders, back, and chest.
pain felt by a person
The sensation may be similar to
'2
during a massive heart attack."
"Execution by gas ... produces prolonged seizures, incontinence of stool and urine, salivation, vomiting, retching,
ballistic writhing, flailing, twitching of extremities, [and]
grimacing."' 3 This suffering lasts for 8 to 10 minutes, or
longer.4
Eyewitness descriptions of executions by cyanide gas lend
depth to these clinical accounts. On April 6, 1992, Arizona
executed Don Eugene Harding.
"When the fumes enveloped Don's head he took a
quick breath. A few seconds later he again looked in
my direction. His face was red and contorted as if he
were attempting to fight through tremendous pain. His
mouth was pursed shut and his jaw was clenched tight.
Don then took several more quick gulps of the fumes.

"At this point Don's body started convulsing violently
.... His face and body turned a deep red and the veins
in his temple and neck began to bulge until I thought
they might explode.
"After about a minute Don's face leaned partially forward, but he was still conscious. Every few seconds he
continued to gulp in. He was shuddering uncontrollably and his body was racked with spasms. His head
continued to snap back. His hands were clenched.
"After several more minutes, the most violent of the
convulsions subsided. At this time the muscles along
Don's left arm and back began twitching in a wavelike motion under his skin. Spittle drooled from his
mouth....
"Don did not stop moving for approximately eight
minutes, and after that he continued to twitch and jerk
for another minute. Approximately two minutes later,
we were told by a prison official that the execution was
complete.
"Don Harding took ten minutes and thirty one seconds
to die." 5
The unnecessary cruelty of this method of execution convinced Arizona's Attorney General that that State should
abandon execution by gas in favor of execution by lethal injection.6 His conclusion coincides with that of numerous

medical, legal, and ethical experts.

opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice." Weems
v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 378 (1910). Accordingly, we
have "interpreted the [Eighth] Amendment 'in a flexible and
dynamic manner."' Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361,369
(1989) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 171 (1976)
(opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.)). When the
California statute requiring execution by cyanide gas was
enacted in 1937, the gas chamber was considered a humane
method of execution. Fifty-five years of history and moral
development have superseded that judgment. The barbaric
use of cyanide gas in the Holocaust, the development of cyanide agents as chemical weapons, our contemporary understanding of execution by lethal gas, and the development of
less cruel methods of execution all demonstrate that execution by cyanide gas is unnecessarily cruel. "The traditional
humanity of modern Anglo-American law forbids the infliction of unnecessary pain in the execution of the death sentence." Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S.
459, 463 (1947) (opinion of Reed, J.).
Nowhere is this moral progress better demonstrated than
in the decisions of the state legislatures. Of the 20 or so
States to adopt new methods of execution since our ruling
in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976), not a single State
has chosen execution by lethal gas. Ten years ago, 10 States
mandated execution by lethal gas; one by one, those States
have abandoned that method as inhumane and torturous.
Only California, Maryland, and Arizona currently mandate
execution by gas.8 Of the 168 persons executed in the
United States since 1977, only 6 have been executed by lethal
gas. We have frequently emphasized that "[t]he clearest
and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values
is the legislation enacted by the country's legislatures."

tive indicia that reflect the public attitude" toward execution
by lethal gas, Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S., at 370, clearly
exhibit a nearly universal rejection of that means of execution.' Cf. Enmund v. Florida,458 U. S. 782, 788-796 (1982);
Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S.584, 593-597 (1977). All of this
leads me to conclude that execution by cyanide gas is both
cruel and unusual, and that it violates contemporary standards of human decency.' ยฐ
More than a century ago, we declared that "[p]unishments
are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death."
In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890). In light of our
contemporary understanding of the methods of execution
and in light of less cruel alternatives presently available, I
believe that execution by cyanide gas is "incompatible with
'the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of
a maturing society."' Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102
(1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).
The State contends that Harris should have brought his
claim earlier. This is not reason enough to upset the stay
issued by the Court of Appeals and dispatch the considered
judgment of the 14 appellate judges who voted to rehear
the case en banc. Indeed, although reluctant to recognize

Notably, a memorandum prepared by California corrections officials
correctly observes that "[l]ethal injection is considered to be more humane
than other methods of execution (e. g., hanging, firing squad, lethal gas, or
electrocution)." 1 Exhibits, Exh. 11, at 4.
1oInWilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S.130, 135-136 (1879), we ruled that punishments of "unnecessary cruelty" violated the Eighth Amendment, citing
the ancient practices of drawing and quartering and "public dissection" as
examples. Similarly in In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 446 (1890), we indicated that "burning at the stake, crucifixion, [and] breaking on the wheel"
were as well cruel and unusual. To that list we might have added the
garrotte, a device for execution by strangulation developed-and abandoned-centuries ago in Spain. See G. Scott, The History of Capital Punishment 159-160 (1950). To my mind, the gas chamber is nothing more
than a chemical garrotte.

as much, the State itself could have avoided this last-minute
litigation. In 1983, seven States authorized executions by
exposure to cyanide gas. In that year, three Members of
this Court indicated that that method of execution raised sufficiently serious questions under the Eighth Amendment to
merit review by writ of certiorari. See Gray v. Lucas, 463
U. S. 1237 (1983). Thereafter, four States (Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wyoming) abandoned cyanide gas as a
method of execution. In light of these events and the decisions of other legislatures, California as well should have revisited its 55-year-old statute.
More fundamentally, if execution by cyanide gas is in fact
unconstitutional, then the State lacks the power to impose
such punishment. Harris' delay, even if unjustified, cannot
endow the State with the authority to violate the Constitution. It was this principle that animated Justice Harlan's
opinion in Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 692-693
(1971), and that a plurality of this Court embraced in Teague
v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 306-307 (1989) (opinion of O'CONNOR,
J.). As Harlan emphasized, there are some instances in
which the State's interest in finality must give way. When
the challenged conduct falls clearly beyond the State's legitimate power, "[t]here is little societal interest in permitting
the criminal process to rest at a point where it ought properly never to repose." 401 U. S., at 693. For these reasons,
the State's interest in an immediate execution must yield to
a deliberate and careful study of the merits of Harris' claims.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
