INDOPCO, INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 90-1278.

Argued November 12, 1991-Decided February 26, 1992

On its 1978 federal income tax return, petitioner corporation claimed a
deduction for certain investment banking fees and expenses that it incurred during a friendly acquisition in which it was transformed from a
publicly held, freestanding corporation into a wholly owned subsidiary.
After respondent Commissioner disallowed the claim, petitioner sought
reconsideration in the Tax Court, adding to its claim deductions for legal
fees and other acquisition-related expenses. The Tax Court ruled that
because long-term benefits accrued to petitioner from the acquisition,
the expenditures were capital in nature and not deductible under
§ 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as "ordinary and necessary" business expenses. The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's
argument that, because the expenses did not "create or enhance ... a
separate and distinct additional asset," see Commissioner v. Lincoln
Savings & Loan Assn., 403 U. S. 345, 354, they could not be capitalized
under §263 of the Code.
Held: Petitioner's expenses do not qualify for deduction under § 162(a).
Deductions are exceptions to the norm of capitalization and are allowed
only if there is clear provision for them in the Cede and the taxpayer
has met the burden of showing a right to the deduction. Commissioner
v. Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn., supra, holds simply that the creation
of a separate and distinct asset may be a sufficient condition for classification as a capital expenditure, not that it is a prerequisite to such classification. Nor does Lincoln Savings prohibit reliance on future benefit
as means of distinguishing an ordinary business expense from a capital
expenditure. Although the presence of an incidental future benefit may
not warrant capitalization, a taxpayer's realization of benefits beyond
the year in which the expenditure is incurred is important in determining whether the appropriate tax treatment is immediate deduction or
capitalization. The record in the instant case amply supports the lower
courts' findings that the transaction produced significant benefits to
petitioner extending beyond the tax year in question. Pp. 83-90.
918 F. 2d 426, affirmed.
BLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Opinion of the Court

Richard J. Hiegel argued the cause for petitioner. With
him on the briefs were Geoffrey R. S. Brown, Rory 0. Millson, and Richard H. Walker.
Kent L. Jones argued the cause for respondent. With him
on the brief were Solicitor General Starr,Assistant Attorney General Peterson, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace,
Gilbert S. Rothenberg, and Bruce R. Ellisen.*
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we must decide whether certain professional
expenses incurred by a target corporation in the course of a
friendly takeover are deductible by that corporation as "ordinary and necessary" business expenses under § 162(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code.
I
Most of the relevant facts are stipulated. See App. 12,
149. Petitioner INDOPCO, Inc., formerly named National
Starch and Chemical Corporation and hereinafter referred
to as National Starch, is a Delaware corporation that manufactures and sells adhesives, starches, and specialty chemical
products. In October 1977, representatives of Unilever
United States, Inc., also a Delaware corporation (Unilever),1
expressed interest in acquiring National Starch, which was
one of its suppliers, through a friendly transaction. National Starch at the time had outstanding over 6,563,000 common shares held by approximately 3,700 shareholders. The
stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Frank
and Anna Greenwall were the corporation's largest shareholders and owned approximately 14.5% of the common.
The Greenwalls, getting along in years and concerned about
*Timothy J McCormalty and Mary L. Fahey filed a brief for the Tax
Executives Institute, Inc., as amicus curiae urging reversal.

Opinion of the Court

their estate plans, indicated that they would transfer their
shares to Unilever only if a transaction tax free for them
could be arranged.
Lawyers representing both sides devised a "reverse subsidiary cash merger" that they felt would satisfy the Greenwalls' concerns. Two new entities would be created-National Starch and Chemical Holding Corp. (Holding), a
subsidiary of Unilever, and NSC Merger, Inc., a subsidiary
of Holding that would have only a transitory existence. In
an exchange specifically designed to be tax free under § 351
of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C. §351, Holding
would exchange one share of its nonvoting preferred stock
for each share of National Starch common that it received
from National Starch shareholders. Any National Starch
common that was not so exchanged would be converted into
cash in a merger of NSC Merger, Inc., into National Starch.
In November 1977, National Starch's directors were formally advised of Unilever's interest and the proposed transaction. At that time, Debevoise, Plimpton, Lyons & Gates,
National Starch's counsel, told the directors that under Delaware law they had a fiduciary duty to ensure that the proposed transaction would be fair to the shareholders. National Starch thereupon engaged the investment banking
firm of Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., to evaluate its shares, to
render a fairness opinion, and generally to assist in the event
of the emergence of a hostile tender offer.
Although Unilever originally had suggested a price between $65 and $70 per share, negotiations resulted in a final
offer of $73.50 per share, a figure Morgan Stanley found to
be fair. Following approval by National Starch's board and
the issuance of a favorable private ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service that the transaction would be tax free
under §351 for those National Starch shareholders who ex-

INDOPCO, INC. v. COMMISSIONER
Opinion of the Court

changed their stock for Holding preferred, the transaction
was consummated in August 1978.2
Morgan Stanley charged National Starch a fee of
$2,200,000, along with $7,586 for out-of-pocket expenses and
$18,000 for legal fees. The Debevoise firm charged National
Starch $490,000, along with $15,069 for out-of-pocket expenses. National Starch also incurred expenses aggregating $150,962 for miscellaneous items-such as accounting,
printing, proxy solicitation, and Securities and Exchange
Commission fees-in connection with the transaction. No
issue is raised as to the propriety or reasonableness of
these charges.
On its federal income tax return for its short taxable year
ended August 15, 1978, National Starch claimed a deduction
for the $2,225,586 paid to Morgan Stanley, but did not deduct
the $505,069 paid to Debevoise or the other expenses. Upon
audit, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the
claimed deduction and issued a notice of deficiency. Petitioner sought redetermination in the United States Tax
Court, asserting, however, not only the right to deduct the
investment banking fees and expenses but, as well, the legal
and miscellaneous expenses incurred.
The Tax Court, in an unreviewed decision, ruled that the
expenditures were capital in nature and therefore not deductible under § 162(a) in the 1978 return as "ordinary and
necessary expenses." National Starch and Chemical Corp.
v. Commissioner, 93 T. C. 67 (1989). The court based its
holding primarily on the long-term benefits that accrued to
National Starch from the Unilever acquisition. Id., at 75.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
affirmed, upholding the Tax Court's findings that "both Unilever's enormous resources and the possibility of synergy
arising from the transaction served the long-term better2

ment of National Starch." National Starch & Chemical
Corp. v. Commissioner, 918 F. 2d 426, 432-433 (1990). In
so doing, the Court of Appeals rejected National Starch's
contention that, because the disputed expenses did not "create or enhance.., a separate and distinct additional asset,"
see Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn., 403
U. S.345, 354 (1971), they could not be capitalized and therefore were deductible under § 162(a). 918 F. 2d, at 428-431.

Section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code allows the
deduction of "all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid
or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade
or business." 26 U. S. C. § 162(a). In contrast, §263 of the
Code allows no deduction for a capital expenditure-an
"amount paid out for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of
any property or estate." §263(a)(1). The primary effect of
characterizing a payment as either a business expense or a
capital expenditure concerns the timing of the. taxpayer's

assets," and therefore were ordinary and necessary expenses under
§ 162(a)), and Briarcliff Candy Corp. v. Commissioner,475 F. 2d 775, 782
(CA2 1973) (suggesting that Lincoln Savings "brought about a radical
shift in emphasis," making capitalization dependent on whether the expenditure creates or enhances a separate and distinct additional asset).

1181, 1184 (CA5 1984) (inquiring whether establishment of new branches

the proper tax treatment).

Opinion of the Court

ated over the life of the relevant asset, or, where no specific
asset or useful life can be ascertained, is deducted upon dissolution of the enterprise. See 26 U. S. C. § 167(a) and
336(a); Treas. Reg. § 1.167(a), 26 CFR § 1.167(a) (1991).
Through provisions such as these, the Code endeavors to
match expenses with the revenues of the taxable period to
which they are properly attributable, thereby resulting in a
more accurate calculation of net income for tax purposes.
See, e. g., Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co., 418 U. S. 1, 16
(1974); Ellis Banking Corp. v. Commissioner,688 F. 2d 1376,
1379 (CAll 1982), cert. denied, 463 U. S. 1207 (1983).
In exploring the relationship between deductions and capital expenditures, this Court has noted the "familiar rule"
that "an income tax deduction is a matter of legislative grace
and that the burden of clearly showing the right to the
claimed deduction is on the taxpayer." Interstate Transit
Lines v. Commissioner, 319 U. S. 590, 593 (1943); Deputy v.
Du Pont, 308 U. S. 488, 493 (1940); New Colonial Ice Co. v.
Helvering,292 U. S. 435, 440 (1934). The notion that deductions are exceptions to the norm of capitalization finds support in various aspects of the Code. Deductions are specifically enumerated and thus are subject to disallowance in
favor of capitalization. See H 161 and 261. Nondeductible
capital expenditures, by contrast, are not exhaustively enumerated in the Code; rather than providing a "complete list
of nondeductible expenditures," Lincoln Savings, 403 U. S.,
at 358, §263 serves as a general means of distinguishing capital expenditures from current expenses. See Commissioner
v. Idaho Power Co., 418 U. S., at 16. For these reasons, deductions are strictly construed and allowed only "as there is
a clear provision therefor." New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helve4
ring, 292 U. S., at 440; Deputy v. Du Pont, 308 U. S., at 493.

Opinion of the Court

The Court also has examined the interrelationship between the Code's business expense and capital expenditure
provisions.5 In so doing, it has had occasion to parse § 162(a)
and explore certain of its requirements. For example, in
Lincoln Savings, we determined that, to qualify for deduction under § 162(a), "an item must (1) be 'paid or incurred
during the taxable year,' (2) be for 'carrying on any trade or
business,' (3) be an 'expense,' (4) be a 'necessary' expense,
and (5) be an 'ordinary' expense." 403 U. S., at 352. See
also Commissioner v. Tellier, 383 U. S. 687, 689 (1966) (the
term "necessary" imposes "only the minimal requirement
that the expense be 'appropriate and helpful' for 'the development of the [taxpayer's] business,"' quoting Welch v.
Helvering,290 U. S. 111, 113 (1933)); Deputy v. Du Pont, 308
U. S., at 495 (to qualify as "ordinary," the expense must relate to a transaction "of common or frequent occurrence in

(1972) (cooperatives' required purchases of stock in Bank for Cooperatives
are not currently deductible); Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings & Loan
Assn., 403 U. S. 345 (1971) (additional premiums paid by bank to federal
insurers are capital expenditures); Woodward v. Commissioner, 397 U. S.

deductible); Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U. S. 79 (1938) (brokerage commissions are capital expenditures); Welch v. Helvering, 290 U. S. 111 (1933)
(payments of former employer's debts are capital expenditures).

Opinion of the Court

the type of business involved"). The Court has recognized,
however, that the "decisive distinctions" between current expenses and capital expenditures "are those of degree and not
of kind," Welch v. Helvering, 290 U. S., at 114, and that because each case "turns on its special facts," Deputy v. Du
Pont, 308 U. S., at 496, the cases sometimes appear difficult
to harmonize. See Welch v. Helvering, 290 U. S., at 116.
National Starch contends that the decision in Lincoln Savings changed these familiar backdrops and announced an exclusive test for identifying capital expenditures, a test in
which "creation or enhancement of an asset" is a prerequisite
to capitalization, and deductibility under § 162(a) is the rule
rather than the exception. Brief for Petitioner 16. We do
not agree, for we conclude that National Starch has overread
Lincoln Savings.
In Lincoln Savings, we were asked to decide whether certain premiums, required by federal statute to be paid by a
savings and loan association to the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), were ordinary and necessary expenses under § 162(a), as Lincoln Savings argued and
the Court of Appeals had held, or capital expenditures under
§263, as the Commissioner contended. We found that the
"additional" premiums, the purpose of which was to provide
FSLIC with a secondary reserve fund in which each insured
institution retained a pro rata interest recoverable in certain
situations, "serv[e] to create or enhance for Lincoln what is
essentially a separate and distinct additional asset." 403
U. S., at 354. "[A]s an inevitable consequence," we concluded, "the payment is capital in nature and not an expense,
let alone an ordinary expense, deductible under § 162(a)."
Ibid.
Lincoln Savings stands for the simple proposition that a
taxpayer's expenditure that "serves to create or enhance...
a separate and distinct" asset should be capitalized under
§263. It by no means follows, however, that only expenditures that create or enhance separate and distinct assets are

Cite as: 503 U. S. 79 (1992)
Opinion of the Court

to be capitalized under §263. We had no occasion in Lincoln
Savings to consider the tax treatment of expenditures that,
unlike the additional premiums at issue there, did not create
or enhance a specific asset, and thus the case cannot be read
to preclude capitalization in other circumstances. In short,
Lincoln Savings holds that the creation of a separate and
distinct asset well may be a sufficient, but not a necessary,
condition to classification as a capital expenditure. See General Bancshares Corp. v. Commissioner, 326 F. 2d 712, 716
(CA8) (although expenditures may not "resul[t] in the acquP
sition or increase of a corporate asset,.., these expenditures
are not, because of that fact, deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses"), cert. denied, 379 U. S. 832 (1964).
Nor does our statement in Lincoln Savings, 403 U. S., at
354, that "the presence of an ensuing benefit that may have
some future aspect is not controlling" prohibit reliance on
future benefit as a means of distinguishing an ordinary business expense from a capital expenditure. Although the
mere presence of an incidental future benefit--"some future
aspect"-may not warrant capitalization, a taxpayer's realization of benefits beyond the year in which the expenditure
is incurred is undeniably important in determining whether
the appropriate tax treatment is immediate deduction or
capitalization. See United States v. Mississippi Chemical
Corp., 405 U. S. 298, 310 (1972) (expense that "is of value
in more than one taxable year" is a nondeductible capital
expenditure); Central Texas Savings & Loan Assn. v. United
States, 731 F. 2d 1181, 1183 (CA5 1984) ('"While the period of
the benefits may not be controlling in all cases, it nonetheless

Petitioner contends that, absent a separate-and-distinct-asset requirement for capitalization, a taxpayer will have no "principled basis" upon
which to differentiate business expenses from capital expenditures. Brief
for Petitioner 37-41. We note, however, that grounding tax status on the
existence of an asset would be unlikely to produce the bright-line rule that
petitioner desires, given that the notion of an "asset" is itself flexible and
amorphous. See Johnson, 53 Tax Notes, at 477-478.

INDOPCO, INC. v. COMMISSIONER
Opinion of the Court

remains a prominent, if not predominant, characteristic of a
capital item"). Indeed, the text of the Code's capitalization
provision, §263(a)(1), which refers to "permanent improvements or betterments," itself envisions an inquiry into the
duration and extent of the benefits realized by the taxpayer.
III
In applying the foregoing principles to the specific expenditures at issue in this case, we conclude that National Starch
has not demonstrated that the investment banking, legal, and
other costs it incurred in connection with Unilever's acquisition of its shares are deductible as ordinary and necessary
business expenses under § 162(a).
Although petitioner attempts to dismiss the benefits that
accrued to National Starch from the Unilever acquisition as
"entirely speculative" or "merely incidental," Brief for Petitioner 39-40, the Tax Court's and the Court of Appeals' findings that the transaction produced significant benefits to National Starch that extended beyond the tax year in question
are amply supported by the record. For example, in commenting on the merger with Unilever, National Starch's 1978
"Progress Report" observed that the company would "benefit greatly from the availability of Unilever's enormous resources, especially in the area of basic technology." App. 43.
See also id., at 46 (Unilever "provides new opportunities
and resources"). Morgan Stanley's report to the National
Starch board concerning the fairness to shareholders of a
possible business combination with Unilever noted that National Starch management "feels that some synergy may
exist with the Unilever organization given a) the nature of
the Unilever chemical, paper, plastics and packaging operations ... and b) the strong consumer products orientation of

Unilever United States, Inc." Id., at 77-78.
In addition to these anticipated resource-related benefits,
National Starch obtained benefits through its transformation
from a publicly held, freestanding corporation into a wholly

Cite as: 503 U. S. 79 (1992)

Opinion of the Court

owned subsidiary of Unilever. The Court of Appeals noted
that National Starch management viewed the transaction as
"'swapping approximately 3500 shareholders for one."' 918
F. 2d, at 427; see also App. 223. Following Unilever's acquisition of National Starch's outstanding shares, National
Starch was no longer subject to what even it terms the "substantial" shareholder-relations expenses a publicly traded
corporation incurs, including reporting and disclosure obligations, proxy battles, and derivative suits. Brief for Petitioner 24. The acquisition also allowed National Starch, in
the interests of administrative convenience and simplicity, to
eliminate previously authorized but unissued shares of preferred and to reduce the total number of authorized shares
of common from 8,000,000 to 1,000. See 93 T. C., at 74.
Courts long have recognized that expenses such as these,
"'incurred for the purpose of changing the corporate structure for the benefit of future operations are not ordinary and
necessary business expenses."' General Bancshares Corp.
v. Commissioner,326 F. 2d, at 715 (quoting Farmers Union
Corp. v. Commissioner, 300 F. 2d 197, 200 (CA9), cert. denied, 371 U. S. 861 (1962)). See also B. Bittker & J. Eustice,
Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders
5-33 to 5-36 (5th ed. 1987) (describing "well-established
rule" that expenses incurred in reorganizing or restructuring corporate entity are not deductible under § 162(a)). Deductions for professional expenses thus have been disallowed
in a wide variety of cases concerning changes in corporate
structure. Although support for these decisions can be

Inc. v. Commissioner,206 F. 2d 244 (CA2 1953) (recapitalization).

INDOPCO, INC. v. COMMISSIONER
Opinion of the Court

found in the specific terms of § 162(a), which require that deductible expenses be "ordinary and necessary" and incurred
"in carrying on any trade or business, '" courts more frequently have characterized an expenditure as capital in nature because "the purpose for which the expenditure is made
has to do with the corporation's operations and betterment,
sometimes with a continuing capital asset, for the duration
of its existence or for the indefinite future or for a time somewhat longer than the current taxable year." General Bancshares Corp. v. Commissioner, 326 F. 2d, at 715. See also
Mills Estate, Inc. v. Commissioner,206 F. 2d 244, 246 (CA2
1953). The rationale behind these decisions applies equally
to the professional charges at issue in this case.
IV
The expenses that National Starch incurred in Unilever's
friendly takeover do not qualify for deduction as "ordinary
and necessary" business expenses under § 162(a). The fact
that the expenditures do not create or enhance a separate
and distinct additional asset is not controlling; the
acquisition-related expenses bear the indicia of capital expenditures and are to be treated as such.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.

e. g., Motion Picture Capital Corp. v. Commissioner,80 F. 2d 872,

873-874 (CA2 1936) (recognizing that expenses may be "ordinary and necessary" to corporate merger, and that mergers may be "ordinary and necessary business occurrences," but declining to find that merger is part of
"ordinary and necessary business activities," and concluding that expenses
are therefore not deductible); Greenstein, The Deductibility of Takeover
Costs After National Starch, 69 Taxes 48, 49 (1991) (expenses incurred to
facilitate transfer of business ownership do not satisfy the "carrying on [a]
trade or business" requirement of § 162(a)).
