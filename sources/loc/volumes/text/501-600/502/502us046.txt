GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-6352.

Argued October 7, 1991-Decided December 3, 1991

Petitioner Griffin and others were charged in a multiple-object conspiracy.
The evidence introduced at trial implicated Griffin in the first object of
the conspiracy but not the second. The District Court nevertheless
instructed the jury in a manner that would permit it to return a verdict
against Griffin if it found her to have participated in either one of the
two objects. The jury returned a general verdict of guilty. The Court
of Appeals upheld Griffin's conviction, rejecting the argument that the
verdict could not stand because it left in doubt whether the jury had
convicted her as to the first or the second object.
Held: Neither the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment nor this
Court's precedents require, in a federal prosecution, that a general
guilty verdict on a multiple-object conspiracy be set aside if the evidence
is inadequate to support conviction as to one of the objects. Pp. 49-60.
(a) The historical practice fails to support Griffin's due process claim,
since the rule of criminal procedure applied by the Court of Appeals
was a settled feature of the common law. Pp. 49-51.
(b) The precedent governing this case is not Yates v. United States,
354 U. S. 298, which invalidated a general verdict when one of the possible bases of conviction was legally inadequate, but Turner v. United
States, 396 U. S. 398, 420, which upheld a general verdict when one of
the possible bases of conviction was supported by inadequate evidence.
The line between Yates and Turner makes good sense: Jurors are not
generally equipped to determine whether a particular theory of conviction is contrary to law, but are well equipped to determine whether
the theory is supported by the facts. Although it would generally be
preferable to give an instruction removing from the jury's consideration
an alternative basis of liability that does not have adequate evidentiary
support, the refusal to do so does not provide an independent basis for
reversing an otherwise valid conviction. Pp. 51-60.

This case presents the question whether, in a federal
prosecution, a general guilty verdict on a multiple-object
conspiracy charge must be set aside if the evidence is inadequate to support conviction as to one of the objects.
I
A federal grand jury returned a 23-count indictment
against petitioner Diane Griffin and others. Count 20, the
only count in which Griffin was named, charged her, Alex
Beverly, and Betty McNulty with conspiring to defraud an
agency of the Federal Government in violation of 18 U. S. C.
ยง 371, which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:
"If two or more persons conspire either to commit any
offense against the United States, or to defraud the
United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or
for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any
act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be
[guilty of a crime]."
The unlawful conspiracy was alleged to have had two objects:
(1) impairing the efforts of the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) to ascertain income taxes; and (2) impairing the efforts
of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to ascertain
forfeitable assets.
The evidence introduced at trial implicated Beverly and
McNulty in both conspiratorial objects, and petitioner in the

GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

IRS object. However, because testimony anticipated by the
Government from one of its witnesses did not materialize,
the evidence did not connect petitioner to the DEA object.
On that basis, petitioner moved for a severance, but her motion was denied. At the close of trial, she proposed instructions to the effect that she could be convicted only if the jury
found she was aware of the IRS object of the conspiracy.
She also proposed special interrogatories asking the jury to
identify the object or objects of the conspiracy of which she
had knowledge. Both requests were denied. The court instructed the jury in a manner that would permit it to return
a guilty verdict against petitioner on Count 20 if it found her
to have participated in either one of the two objects of the
conspiracy. The jury returned a general verdict of guilty on
Count 20 against Beverly, McNulty, and petitioner.
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld petitioner's conviction, rejecting the argument that the general
verdict could not stand because it left in doubt whether the
jury had convicted her of conspiring to defraud the IRS, for
which there was sufficient proof, or of conspiring to defraud
the DEA, for which (as the Government concedes) there was
not. United States v. Beverly, 913 F. 2d 337 (1990). We
granted certiorari, 498 U. S. 1082 (1991).
The question presented for review, as set forth in the petition, is simply whether a general verdict of guilty under circumstances such as existed here "is reversible." The body
of the petition, however, sets forth the Due Process Clause
of the Fifth Amendment and the jury trial provision of the
Sixth Amendment as bases for the relief requested. Only
the former has been discussed (and that briefly) in the written and oral argument before us. For that reason, and also
because the alleged defect here is not that a jury determination was denied but rather that a jury determination was
permitted, we find it unnecessary to say anything more
about the Sixth Amendment. We address below the Due

Opinion of the Court

Process Clause and also the various case precedents relied
upon by petitioner.
II
The rule of criminal procedure applied by the Seventh
Circuit here is not an innovation. It was settled law in England before the Declaration of Independence, and in this
country long afterwards, that a general jury verdict was
valid so long as it was legally supportable on one of the submitted grounds-even though that gave no assurance that a
valid ground, rather than an invalid one, was actually the
basis for the jury's action. As Wharton wrote in 1889:
"For years it was the prevailing practice in England
and this country, where there was a general verdict of
guilty on an indictment containing several counts, some
bad and some good, to pass judgment on the counts that
were good, on the presumption that it was to them that
the verdict of the jury attached, and upon the withdrawal by the prosecution of the bad counts.... [I]n the
United States, with but few exceptions, the courts have
united in sustaining general judgments on an indictment
in which there are several counts stating cognate offences, irrespective of the question whether one of
these counts is bad." F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading
and Practice ยง 771, pp. 533-536 (9th ed. 1889) (footnotes
omitted).
And as this Court has observed:
"In criminal cases, the general rule, as stated by Lord
Mansfield before the Declaration of Independence, is
'that if there is any one count to support the verdict, it
shall stand good, notwithstanding all the rest are bad.'
And it is settled law in this court, and in this country
generally, that in any criminal case a general verdict and
judgment on an indictment or information containing
several counts cannot be reversed on error, if any one of
the counts is good and warrants the judgment, because,

GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

in the absence of anything in the record to show the
contrary, the presumption of law is that the court
awarded sentence on the good count only." Claassenv.
United States, 142 U. S. 140, 146 (1891) (quoting Peake
v. Oldham, 1 Cowper 275, 276, 98 Eng. Rep. 1083 (K. B.
1775)) (other citations omitted).
See also Snyder v. United States, 112 U. S.216, 217 (1884);
Clifton v. United States, 4 How. 242, 250 (1846); 1 J. Bishop,
Criminal Procedure ยง 1015, p. 631 (2d ed. 1872).
This common-law rule applied in a variety of contexts. It
validated general verdicts returned on multicount indictments where some of the counts were legally defective
("bad"), see, e. g., Clifton, supra, at 250; State v. Shelledy, 8
Iowa 477, 511 (1859); State v. Burke, 38 Me. 574, 575-576
(1854); Commonwealth v. Holmes, 17 Mass. 336, 337 (1821),
and general verdicts returned on multicount indictments
where some of the counts were unsupported by the evidence,
see, e. g., State v. Long, 52 N. C. 24, 26 (1859); State v. Bugbee,
22 Vt. 32, 35 (1849); 1 Bishop, supra, ยง 1014, p. 630. It also
applied to the analogous situation at issue here: a general
jury verdict under a single count charging the commission
of an offense by two or more means. For example, in reviewing a count charging defendants with composing, printing, and publishing a libel, Lord Ellenborough stated:
"It is enough to prove publication. If an indictment
charges that the defendant did and caused to be done a
particular act, it is enough to prove either. The distinction runs through the whole criminal law, and it is invariably enough to prove so much of the indictment as
shows that the defendant has committed a substantive
crime therein specified." King v. Hunt, 2 Camp. 583,
584-585, 170 Eng. Rep. 1260 (N. P. 1811).

Opinion of the Court

The latter application of the rule made it a regular practice
for prosecutors to charge conjunctively, in one count, the various means of committing a statutory offense, in order to
avoid the pitfalls of duplicitous pleading.
"A statute often makes punishable the doing of one
thing or another,... sometimes thus specifying a consid-

erable number of things. Then, by proper and ordinary
construction, a person who in one transaction does all,
violates the statute but once, and incurs only one penalty. Yet he violates it equally by doing one of the
things. Therefore the indictment on such a statute may
allege, in a single count, that the defendant did as many
of the forbidden things as the pleader chooses, employing the conjunction and where the statute has 'or,' and
it will not be double, and it will be established at the
trial by proof of any one of them." 1 J. Bishop, New
Criminal Procedure ยง436, pp. 355-356 (2d ed. 1913)
(footnotes omitted).
See, e. g., Crain v. United States, 162 U. S. 625, 636 (1896);
Sanford v. State, 8 Ala. App. 245, 247, 62 So. 317, 318 (1913);
State v. Bresee, 137 Iowa 673, 681, 114 N. W. 45, 48 (1907);
Morgansternv. Commonwealth, 94 Va. 787, 790, 26 S.E. 402,
403 (1896). See also Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S.624, 630631 (1991); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 7(c)(1) (authorizing a single
count to allege that an offense was committed "by one or
more specified means").
The historical practice, therefore, fails to support petitioner's claim under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.
See Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co.,
18 How. 272, 276-277 (1856). Petitioner argues, however,
that-whether as a matter of due process or by virtue of our
supervisory power over federal courts-a result contrary to
the earlier practice has been prescribed by our decision in
Yates v. United States, 354 U. S.298 (1957). Yates involved
a single-count federal indictment charging a conspiracy "(1)

GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing the Government of the United States by force and violence, and (2) to organize, as the Communist Party of the
United States, a society of persons who so advocate and
teach." Id., at 300. The first of these objects (the "advocacy" charge) violated ยง 2(a)(1) of the Smith Act of 1940 (subsequently repealed and substantially reenacted as 18 U. S. C.
ยง2385), and the second of them (the "organizing" charge) violated ยง2(a)(3). We found that the "organizing" object was
insufficient in law, since the statutory term referred to initial
formation, and the Communist Party had been "organized"
in that sense at a time beyond the period of the applicable
statute of limitations. 354 U. S., at 304-311. We then rejected the Government's argument that the convictions could
nonetheless stand on the basis of the "advocacy" object.
Our analysis made no mention of the Due Process Clause but
consisted in its entirety of the following:
"In these circumstances we think the proper rule to be
applied is that which requires a verdict to be set aside
in cases where the verdict is supportable on one ground,
but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which
ground the jury selected. Stromberg v. California,283
U. S. 359, 367-368; Williams v. North Carolina, 317
U. S. 287, 291-292; Cramer v. United States, 325 U. S. 1,
36, n. 45." Id., at 312.
None of the three authorities cited for that expansive
proposition in fact establishes it. The first of them, Stromberg v. California,283 U. S. 359 (1931), is the fountainhead
of decisions departing from the common law with respect to
the point at issue here. That case, however-which does not
explicitly invoke the Due Process Clause-does not sanction
as broad a departure as the dictum in Yates expresses, or
indeed even the somewhat narrower departure that the holding in Yates adopts. The defendant in Stromberg was

Cite as: 502 U. S. 46 (1991)
Opinion of the Court

charged in one count of violating a California statute prohibiting the display of a red flag in a public place for any one of
three purposes: (a) as a symbol of opposition to organized
government; (b) as an invitation to anarchistic action; or (c)
as an aid to seditious propaganda. Id., at 361. The jury
was instructed that it could convict if it found the defendant
guilty of violating any one purpose of the statute. Id., at
363-364. A conviction in the form of a general verdict followed. The California appellate court upheld the conviction
on the ground that, even though it doubted the constitutionality of criminalizing the first of the three purposes, the statute (and conviction) could be saved if that provision was severed from the statute. We rejected that:
"As there were three purposes set forth in the statute,
and the jury were instructed that their verdict might be
given with respect to any one of them, independently
considered, it is impossible to say under which clause of
the statute the conviction was obtained. If any one of
these clauses, which the state court has held to be separable, was invalid, it cannot be determined upon this record that the appellant was not convicted under that
clause.... It follows that instead of its being permissible
to hold, with the state court, that the verdict could be
sustained if any one of the clauses of the statute were
found to be valid, the necessary conclusion from the
manner in which the case was sent to the jury is that,
if any of the clauses in question is invalid under the
Federal Constitution, the conviction cannot be upheld."
Id., at 368.
This language, and the holding of Stromberg, do not necessarily stand for anything more than the principle that, where
a provision of the Constitution forbids conviction on a particular ground, the constitutional guarantee is violated by a
general verdict that may have rested on that ground.

GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

The same principle explains the other two cases relied on
by Yates. In Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287
(1942), the defendant was convicted of bigamous cohabitation
after the jury had been instructed that it could disregard the
defendants' Nevada divorce decrees on the ground either
that North Carolina did not recognize decrees based on substituted service or that the decrees were procured by fraud.
Id., at 290-291. The former of these grounds, we found, violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause. We continued:
"[T]he verdict of the jury for all we know may have been
rendered on that [unconstitutional] ground alone, since
it did not specify the basis on which it rested .... No
reason has been suggested why the rule of the Stromberg case is inapplicable here. Nor has any reason been
advanced why the rule of the Stromberg case is not both
appropriate and necessary for the protection of rights of
the accused. To say that a general verdict of guilty
should be upheld though we cannot know that it did not
rest on the invalid constitutional ground on which the
case was submitted to the jury, would be to countenance
a procedure which would cause a serious impairment of
constitutional rights." Id., at 292.
The third case cited by Yates, Cramer v. United States, 325
U. S. 1 (1945), was our first opportunity to interpret the provision of Article III, ยง3, which requires, for conviction of
treason against the United States, that there be "two Witnesses to the same overt Act." The prosecution had submitted proof of three overt acts to the jury, which had returned
a general verdict of guilty. After a comprehensive analysis
of the overt-act requirement, id., at 8-35, we found that two
of the acts proffered by the prosecution did not satisfy it, id.,
at 36-44, and accordingly reversed the conviction. "Since it
is not possible," we said, "to identify the grounds on which
Cramer was convicted, the verdict must be set aside if any

Cite as: 502 U. S. 46 (1991)

Opinion of the Court

of the separable acts submitted was insufficient."

Id., at

36, n. 45.1

A host of our decisions, both before and after Yates, has
applied what Williams called "the rule of the Stromberg
case" to general-verdict convictions that may have rested on
an unconstitutional ground. See, e. g., Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U. S. 564, 570-571 (1970); Leary v. United States,
395 U. S.6, 31-32 (1969); Street v. New York, 394 U. S.576,
585-588 (1969); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 5 (1949);
Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S.516, 529 (1945). Cf. Zant v.
Stephens, 462 U. S.862, 880-884 (1983) (rejecting contention
that Stromberg required a death sentence to be set aside if
one of several statutory aggravating circumstances underlying the jury verdict was unconstitutionally vague). Yates,
however, was the first and only case of ours to apply Stromberg to a general verdict in which one of the possible bases
of conviction did not violate any provision of the Constitution
but was simply legally inadequate (because of a statutory
time bar). As we have described, that was an unexplained

IAt the outset of its discussion

of the two overt acts, the Cramer Court
said: "At the present stage of the case we need not weigh their sufficiency
as a matter of pleading. Whatever the averments might have permitted
the Government to prove, we now consider their adequacy on the proof as
made." 325 U. S., at 37. Petitioner suggests this means that Cramer
was a sufficiency-of-the-evidence case-a point relevant to our later analysis, see infra, at 58-59. That suggestion is mistaken. As is apparent
from the Court's full discussion, "adequacy on the proof as made" meant
not whether the evidence sufficed to enable an alleged fact to be found,
but rather whether the facts adduced at trial sufficed in law to constitute
overt acts of treason. Thus the Court could say: "It is not relevant to our
issue to appraise weight or credibility of the evidence apart from determining its constitutional sufficiency." 325 U. S., at 43. The Court of Appeals' opinion in Cramer makes even clearer that legal as opposed to evidentiary sufficiency was at issue; it specifically distinguishes the case from
those in which multiple overt acts sufficient in law are submitted to the
jury and the conviction is upheld as long as the evidence suffices to show
one of them. See United States v. Cramer, 137 F. 2d 888, 893-894 (CA2
1943).

GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

extension, explicitly invoking neither the Due Process
Clause (which is an unlikely basis) nor our supervisory powers over the procedures employed in a federal prosecution.
Our continued adherence to the holding of Yates is not at
issue in this case. What petitioner seeks is an extension of
its holding-an expansion of its expansion of Stromberg-to
a context in which we have never applied it before. Petitioner cites no case, and we are aware of none, in which we
have set aside a general verdict because one of the possible
bases of conviction was neither unconstitutional as in Stromberg, nor even illegal as in Yates, but merely unsupported
by sufficient evidence. If such invalidation on evidentiary
grounds were appropriate, it is hard to see how it could be
limited to those alternative bases of conviction that constitute separate legal grounds; surely the underlying principle
would apply equally, for example, to an indictment charging
murder by shooting or drowning, where the evidence of
drowning proves inadequate. See Schad v. Arizona, 501
U. S., at 630-631. But petitioner's requested extension is
not merely unprecedented and extreme; it also contradicts
another case, postdating Yates, that in our view must govern here.
Turner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398 (1970), involved a
claim that the evidence was insufficient to support a general
guilty verdict under a one-count indictment charging the defendant with knowingly purchasing, possessing, dispensing,
and distributing heroin not in or from the original stamped
package, in violation of 26 U. S. C. ยง 4704(a) (1964 ed.). We
held that the conviction would have to be sustained if there
was sufficient evidence of distribution alone. We set forth
as the prevailing rule: "[W]hen a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, as Turner's indictment did, the verdict stands if the
evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts

Cite as: 502 U. S. 46 (1991)

Opinion of the Court

charged." Id., at 420. Cf. United States v. Miller, 471 U. S.
130, 136 (1985).
Although petitioner does not ask us to overrule Turner,
neither does she give us any adequate basis for distinguishing it. She claims that we have not yet applied the rule of
that case to multiple-act conspiracies. That is questionable.
See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S.150,
250 (1940). But whether we have yet done so or not, the
controlling point is that a logical and consistent application
of Turner demands that proof of alternative facts in conspiracy cases be treated the same as proof of alternative facts in
other contexts. Imagine the not unlikely case of a prosecution for defrauding an insurer through two means and for
conspiring to defraud the insurer through the same two
means; and imagine a failure of proof with respect to one of
the means. Petitioner's proposal would produce the strange
result of voiding a conviction on the conspiracy while sustaining a conviction on the substantive offense. We agree
with the vast majority of Federal Courts of Appeals, which
have made no exception to the Turner rule for multipleobject and multiple-overt-act conspiracies. See, e. g., United
States v. Bilzerian, 926 F. 2d 1285, 1302 (CA2 1991), cert.
denied, post, p. 813; United States v. Beverly, 913 F. 2d 337,
362-365 (CA7 1990) (case below); United States v. Johnson,
713 F. 2d 633, 645-646, and n. 15 (CAll 1983), cert. denied
sub nom. Wilkins v. United States, 465 U. S. 1081 (1984);
United States v. Wedelstedt, 589 F. 2d 339, 341-342 (CA8
1978), cert. denied, 442 U. S. 916 (1979); United States v.
James, 528 F. 2d 999, 1014 (CA5), cert. denied sub nom. Austin v. United States, 429 U. S. 959 (1976); Moss v. United
States, 132 F. 2d 875, 877-878 (CA6 1943).2
2The only Court of Appeals we are aware of that adheres to the contrary

rule is the Third Circuit, albeit without distinguishing, or even acknowledging the existence of, Turner. See United States v. Tarnopol, 561 F. 2d
466, 474-475 (1977). Many cases can be found, some of which are cited

GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

Petitioner also seeks to distinguish Turner on the basis
that it applies only where one can be sure that the jury did
not use the inadequately supported ground as the basis of
conviction. That assurance exists, petitioner claims, when
the prosecution presents no evidence whatever to support
the insufficient theory; if the prosecution offers some, but
insufficient, evidence on the point, as it did in this case, then
the Yates "impossible to tell" rationale controls. This novel
theory posits two different degrees of failure of proof-a failure that is sufficiently insufficient, to which Turner would
apply, and one that is insufficiently insufficient, to which
Yates would apply. Besides producing an odd system in
which the greater failure of proof is rewarded, the rule
seems to us full of practical difficulty, bereft of support in
Turner,and without foundation in the common-law presumption upon which Turner is based.
Finally, petitioner asserts that the distinction between
legal error (Yates) and insufficiency of proof (Turner)is illusory, since judgments that are not supported by the requisite
minimum of proof are invalid as a matter of law-and indeed, in the criminal law field at least, are constitutionally
by petitioner, that invalidate general conspiracy verdicts on the basis of
legal deficiency of some of the objects rather than inadequacy of proof;
these are of course irrelevant. See, e. g., United States v. Irwin, 654 F. 2d
671, 680 (CA10 1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 1016 (1982); United States v.
Head,641 F. 2d 174, 178-179 (CA4 1981), cert. denied, 462 U. S. 1132 (1983);
United States v. Kavazanjian, 623 F. 2d 730, 739-740 (CA1 1980); United
States v. Carman, 577 F. 2d 556, 567-568 (CA9 1978); United States v.
Baranski, 484 F. 2d 556, 560-561 (CA7 1973); Van Liew v. United States,
321 F. 2d 664, 672 (CA5 1963). Some other cases cited by petitioner do
not involve a conspiracy charge at all, e. g., United States v. Natelli, 527
F. 2d 311, 324-325 (CA2 1975), cert. denied, 425 U. S. 934 (1976), or apply
their ruling to both substantive and conspiracy charges, e. g., United
States v. Garcia,907 F. 2d 380, 381 (CA2 1990)-which means that they
flatly contradict Turner and offer no support for the distinction that petitioner suggests. Still others have been distinguished (or effectively overruled) by later cases within the Circuit, see, P. g., United States v. Berardi,
675 F. 2d 894, 902 (CA7 1982).

requiredto be set aside. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S.
307, 319 (1979). Insufficiency of proof, in other words, is
legal error. This represents a purely semantical dispute.
In one sense "legal error" includes inadequacy of evidencenamely, when the phrase is used as a term of art to designate
those mistakes that it is the business of judges (in jury cases)
and of appellate courts to identify and correct. In this sense
"legal error" occurs when a jury, properly instructed as to
the law, convicts on the basis of evidence that no reasonable
person could regard as sufficient. But in another sense-a
more natural and less artful sense-the term "legal error"
means a mistake about the law, as opposed to a mistake concerning the weight or the factual import of the evidence.
The answer to petitioner's objection is simply that we are
using "legal error" in the latter sense.
That surely establishes a clear line that will separate
Turner from Yates, and it happens to be a line that makes
good sense. Jurors are not generally equipped to determine
whether a particular theory of conviction submitted to them
is contrary to law-whether, for example, the action in question is protected by the Constitution, is time barred, or fails
to come within the statutory definition of the crime. When,
therefore, jurors have been left the option of relying upon a
legally inadequate theory, there is no reason to think that
their own intelligence and expertise will save them from that
error. Quite the opposite is true, however, when they have
been left the option of relying upon a factually inadequate
theory, since jurors are well equipped to analyze the evidence, see Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 157 (1968).
As the Seventh Circuit has put it:
"It is one thing to negate a verdict that, while supported
by evidence, may have been based on an erroneous view
of the law; it is another to do so merely on the chanceremote, it seems to us-that the jury convicted on a
ground that was not supported by adequate evidence
when there existed alternative grounds for which the

evidence was sufficient." United States v. Townsend,
924 F. 2d 1385, 1414 (1991).
What we have said today does not mean that a district
court cannot, in its discretion, give an instruction of the sort
petitioner requested here, eliminating from the jury's consideration an alternative basis of liability that does not have
adequate evidentiary support. Indeed, if the evidence is insufficient to support an alternative legal theory of liability,
it would generally be preferable for the court to give an instruction removing that theory from the jury's consideration.
The refusal to do so, however, does not provide an independent basis for reversing an otherwise valid conviction. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.

concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that petitioner has not made out a
violation of the Due Process Clause, although I do not follow
the Court on its self-guided tour of the common law. See
ante, at 49-52. It is enough, I think, to observe that petitioner has not presented any sustained constitutional argument whatsoever.
I agree further with the Court's conclusion that Yates v.
United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957), does not require reversal
in this case, and that petitioner has not sufficiently distinguished Turner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398 (1970). See
ante, at 56-59. I would emphasize more strongly than does
the Court, however, the danger of jury confusion that was
inherent in this multiple-defendant, 23-count indictment and
the resulting 5- to 6-week trial.

BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment

The Court rightly observes that "it would generally be
preferable" for the trial court to remove unsupported theories from the jury's consideration. See ante, at 60. I would
also note that the Government had two other means of avoiding the possibility, however remote, that petitioner was convicted on a theory for which there was insufficient evidence:
The Government either could have charged the two objectives in separate counts, or agreed to petitioner's request
for special interrogatories. The Court wisely rejects, albeit
silently, the Government's argument that these practices, but
not the complex and voluminous proof, would likely have confused the jury. I would go further than the Court and commend these techniques to the Government for use in complex
conspiracy prosecutions.
