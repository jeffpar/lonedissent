COUNTY OF YAKIMA ET AL. V. CONFEDERATED
TRIBES AND BANDS OF THE YAKIMA
INDIAN NATION
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-408. Argued November 5, 1991-Decided January 14, 1992*
Yakima County, Washington, imposes an ad valorem levy on taxable real
property within its jurisdiction and an excise tax on sales of such land.
The county proceeded to foreclose on various properties for which these
taxes were past due, including certain fee-patented lands held by the
Yakima Indian Nation or its members on the Tribe's reservation within
the county. Contending that federal law prohibited the imposition or
collection of the taxes on such lands, the Tribe filed suit for declaratory
and injunctive relief and was awarded summary judgment by the District Court. The Court of Appeals agreed that the excise tax was impermissible, but held that the ad valorem tax would be impermissible
only if it would have a "'demonstrably serious"' impact on the Tribe's
"'political integrity, economic security or ... health and welfare"' (quoting Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492
U. S. 408, 431 (opinion of WHrrE, .)), and remanded to the District Court
for that determination.
Held: The Indian General Allotment Act of 1887 permits Yakima County
to impose an ad valorem tax on reservation land patented in fee pursuant to the Act and owned by reservation Indians or the Yakima Indian
Nation itself, but does not allow the county to enforce its excise tax on
sales of such land. Pp. 257-270.
(a) As the Court held in Goudy v. Meath, 203 U. S. 146, 149, the Indian
General Allotment Act authorizes taxation of fee-patented land. This
determination was explicitly confirmed in a 1906 amendment to the Act,
known as the Burke Act, which includes a proviso authorizing the Secretary of the Interior, "whenever... satisfied that any [Indian] allottee is
competent ...

[,] to ...

issu[e] to such allottee a patent in fee simple,"

and provides that "thereafterall restrictions as to ... taxation of said
land shall be removed." (Emphasis added.) Thus, the Indian General
Allotment Act contains the unmistakably clear expression of intent that

same court.

is necessary to authorize state taxation of Indian lands. See, e. g., Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S. 759, 765. The contention of the Tribe
and the United States that this explicit statutory conferral of taxing
power has been repudiated by subsequent Indian legislation rests upon
a misunderstanding of this Court's precedents, particularly Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, 425 U. S. 463, and a misperception of the structure of the Indian General Allotment Act. Pp. 257-266.
(b) Because, under state law, liability for the ad valorem tax flows
exclusively from ownership of realty on the annual assessment date, and
the tax creates a burden on the property alone, this tax constitutes
"taxation of ... land" within the meaning of the Indian General Allotment Act, and is therefore prima facie valid. Nevertheless, Brendale,
supra, and its reasoning are inapplicable to the present cases, which
involve an asserted restriction on a State's congressionally conferred
powers over Indians rather than a proposed extension of a tribe's inherent powers over the conduct of non-Indians on reservation fee lands.
Moreover, application of a balancing test under Brendale would contravene the per se approach traditionally followed by this Court in the area
of state taxation of tribes and tribal members, under which taxation
is categorically allowed or disallowed, as appropriate, depending exclusively upon whether it has in fact been authorized by Congress.
Pp. 266-268.
(c) However, the excise tax on sales of fee-patented reservation land
cannot be sustained. The Indian General Allotment Act explicitly authorizes only "taxation of... land," not "taxation with respect to land,"
"taxation of transactions involving land," or "taxation based on the
value of land." Because it is eminently reasonable to interpret that
language as not including a tax upon the activity of selling real estate,
this Court's cases require that that interpretation be applied for the benefit of the Tribe. See, e. g., Blackfeet Tribe, supra,at 766. Pp. 268-270.
(d) The factual question whether the parcels at issue were patented
under the Indian General Allotment Act or some other federal allotment
statute, and the legal question whether it makes any difference, are left
for resolution on remand. P. 270.

COUNTY OF YAKIMA v. CONFEDERATED TRIBES
AND BANDS OF YAKIMA NATION
Opinion of the Court

Indian tribes gave way to a policy of allotting those lands
to tribe members individually. The objectives of allotment
were simple and clear cut: to extinguish tribal sovereignty,
erase reservation boundaries, and force the assimilation of
Indians into the society at large. See, e. g., In re Heft, 197
U. S. 488, 499 (1905). Congress was selective at first, allotting lands under differing approaches on a tribe-by-tribe
basis. See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 129130 (1982); Gates, Indian Allotments Preceding the Dawes
Act, in The Frontier Challenge 141 (J. Clark ed. 1971).
These early efforts were marked by failure, however. Because allotted land could be sold soon after it was received,
see, e. g., Treaty with Wyandot Nation, Apr. 1, 1850, 9 Stat.
987, 992, many of the early allottees quickly lost their land
through transactions that were unwise or even procured by
fraud. See Cohen, supra, at 130. Even if sales were for
fair value, Indian allottees divested of their land were deprived of an opportunity to acquire agricultural and other
self-sustaining economic skills, thus compromising Congress'
purpose of assimilation.
Congress sought to solve these problems in the Indian
General Allotment Act of 1887, also known as the Dawes
Act, 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U. S. C. ยง 331 et seq., which
empowered the President to allot most tribal lands nationwide without the consent of the Indian nations involved.
The Dawes Act restricted immediate alienation or encumbrance by providing that each allotted parcel would be held
by the United States in trust for a period of 25 years or
longer; only then would a fee patent issue to the Indian allottee. 24 Stat. 389; see United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S.
535, 543-544 (1980). Section 6 of the Act furthered Congress' goal of assimilation by providing that "each and every
member of the respective bands or tribes of Indians to whom
allotments have been made shall have the benefit of and be
subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the State or
Territory in which they may reside." 24 Stat. 390.

Opinion of the Court

In In re Heft, supra, at 502-503, we held that this latter
provision subjected Indian allottees to plenary state jurisdiction immediately upon issuance of a trust patent (and prior
to the expiration of the 25-year trust period). Congress
promptly altered that disposition in the Burke Act of 1906, 34
Stat. 182, decreeing that state civil and criminal jurisdiction
would lie "at the expiration of the trust period ... when the
lands have been conveyed to the Indians by patent in fee."
A proviso, however, gave the President authority, when he
found an allottee "competent and capable of managing his or
her affairs," to "issu[e] ... a patent in fee simple" prior to
the expiration of the relevant trust period. Upon such a
premature patenting, the proviso specified (significantly for
present purposes) not that the patentee would be subject to
state civil and criminal jurisdiction but that "all restrictions
as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed." Id., at 183.
The policy of allotment came to an abrupt end in 1934 with
passage of the Indian Reorganization Act. See 48 Stat. 984,
25 U. S. C. ยง461 et seq. Returning to the principles of tribal
self-determination and self-governance which had characterized the pre-Dawes Act era, Congress halted further allotments and extended indefinitely the existing periods of trust
applicable to already allotted (but not yet fee-patented) Indian lands. See ยงยง 461, 462. In addition, the Act provided
for restoring unallotted surplus Indian lands to tribal ownership, see ยง463, and for acquiring, on behalf of the tribes,
lands "within or without existing reservations." ยง 465. Except by authorizing reacquisition of allotted lands in trust,
however, Congress made no attempt to undo the dramatic
effects of the allotment years on the ownership of former
Indian lands. It neither imposed restraints on the ability of
Indian allottees to alienate or encumber their fee-patented
lands nor impaired the rights of those non-Indians who had
acquired title to over two-thirds of the Indian lands allotted

under the Dawes Act. See W. Washburn, Red Man's Land/
White Man's Law 145 (1971).
B
The Yakima Indian Reservation, which was established by
treaty in 1855, see Treaty with Yakima Nation, 12 Stat. 951,
covers approximately 1.3 million acres in southeastern Washington State. Eighty percent of the reservation's land is
held by the United States in trust for the benefit of the Tribe
or its individual members; 20 percent is owned in fee by Indians and non-Indians as a result of patents distributed during
the allotment era. See Brendale v. Confederated Tribes
and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 415 (1989) (plurality opinion). Some of this fee land is owned by the Yakima Indian Nation itself.
The reservation is located almost entirely within the confines of petitioner/cross-respondent Yakima County. Pursuant to Washington law, Yakima County imposes an ad valorem levy on taxable real property within its jurisdiction
and an excise tax on sales of such land. Wash. Rev. Code
ยงยง 84.52.030, 82.45.070 (1989). According to the county, these
taxes have been levied on the Yakima Reservation's fee lands
and collected without incident for some time. In 1987, however, as Yakima County proceeded to foreclose on properties
throughout the county for which ad valorem and excise taxes
were past due, including a number of reservation parcels in
which the Tribe or its members had an interest, respondent/
cross-petitioner Yakima Nation commenced this action for
declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that federal law
prohibited these taxes on fee-patented lands held by the
Tribe or its members.
On stipulated facts, the District Court awarded summary
judgment to the Tribe and entered an injunction prohibiting
the imposition or collection of the taxes on such lands. On
appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed
that the excise tax was impermissible, but held that the ad

Opinion of the Court

valorem tax would be impermissible only if it would have a
"'demonstrably serious"' impact on the "'political integrity,
economic security, or the health and welfare of the tribe,"'
and remanded to the District Court for that determination to
be made. 903 F. 2d 1207, 1218 (CA9 1990) (emphasis deleted)
(quoting Brendale, supra, at 431). We granted certiorari.
500 U. S. 903 (1991).
II
The Court's earliest cases addressing attempts by States
to exercise dominion over the reservation lands of Indians
proceeded from Chief Justice Marshall's premise that the
"several Indian nations [constitute] distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, within which their authority is exclusive .... ." Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515,
556-557 (1832). Because Congress, pursuant to its constitutional authority both "[t]o regulate Commerce . . . with the
Indian Tribes" and to make treaties, U. S. Const., Art. I, ยง8,
cl. 3; Art II, ยง 2, cl. 2, had determined by law and treaty that
"all intercourse with them [would] be carried on exclusively
by the [Federal Government]," Worcester v. Georgia, supra,
at 557, the Court concluded that within reservations state
jurisdiction would generally not lie. The assertion of taxing
authority was not excepted from this principle. E. g., The
Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 755-757 (1867); The New York
Indians, 5 Wall. 761, 771-772 (1867).
The "platonic notions of Indian sovereignty" that guided
Chief Justice Marshall have, over time, lost their independent sway. See McClanahanv. Arizona State Tax Comm'n,
411 U. S. 164, 172, and n. 8 (1973); Organized Village of Kake
v. Egan, 369 U. S. 60, 71-73 (1962). Congress abolished
treatymaking with the Indian nations in 1871, Rev. Stat.
ยง2079, as amended, 25 U. S. C. ยง 71, and has itself subjected
the tribes to substantial bodies of state and federal law.
This Court's more recent cases have recognized the rights of
States, absent a congressional prohibition, to exercise criminal (and, implicitly, civil) jurisdiction over non-Indians lo-

258

AND BANDS OF YAKIMA NATION
Opinion of the Court

cated on reservation lands. See, e. g., New York ex rel. Ray
v. Martin, 326 U. S. 496 (1946); see also Cohen, Handbook of
Federal Indian Law, at 352, and n. 39. We have even observed that state jurisdiction over the relations between reservation Indians and non-Indians may be permitted unless
the application of state laws "would interfere with reservation self-government or impair a right granted or reserved
by federal law." Organized Village of Kake, supra, at 75.
In the area of state taxation, however, Chief Justice Marshall's observation that "the power to tax involves the power
to destroy," McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431
(1819), has counseled a more categorical approach: "[A]bsent
cession of jurisdiction or other federal statutes permitting
it," we have held, a State is without power to tax reservation
lands and reservation Indians. Mescalero Apache Tribe v.
Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 148 (1973). And our cases reveal a consistent practice of declining to find that Congress has authorized state taxation unless it has "made its intention to do so
unmistakably clear." Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S.
759, 765 (1985); see also Californiav. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians,480 U. S. 202, 215, n. 17 (1987).
Yakima County persuaded the Court of Appeals, and urges
upon us, that express authority for taxation of fee-patented
land is found in ยง6 of the General Allotment Act, as
amended.1 We have little doubt about the accuracy of that
threshold assessment. Our decision in Goudy v. Meath, 203
1Section 6 provides in pertinent part:
"At the expiration of the trust period and when the lands have been
conveyed to the Indians by patent in fee,.. . then each and every allottee
shall have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal,
of the State or Territory in which they may reside ....
Provided,That
the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, and he is authorized,
whenever he shall be satisfied that any Indian allottee is competent and
capable of managing his or her affairs at any time to cause to be issued
to such allottee a patent in fee simple, and thereafter all restrictions as
to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed." 25
U. S. C. ยง 349 (emphasis added).

Cite as: 502 U. S. 251 (1992)

Opinion of the Court

U. S. 146, 149 (1906), without even mentioning the Burke Act
proviso, held that state tax laws were "[a]mong the laws to
which [Indian allottees] became subject" under ยง6 upon the
expiration of the Dawes Act trust period. And we agree
with the Court of Appeals that by specifically mentioning
immunity from land taxation "as one of the restrictions that
would be removed upon conveyance in fee," Congress in the
Burke Act proviso "manifest[ed] a clear intention to permit
the state to tax" such Indian lands. 903 F. 2d, at 1211.
Neither the Yakima Nation nor its principal amicus, the
United States, vigorously disputes this.2 Instead, they contend that ยง6 of that Act-the Burke Act proviso included2The Yakima Nation does, however, make a preliminary objection to the
taxes on the ground that the Washington State Constitution permits land
taxes to be imposed only on those Indians holding fee patents who have
terminated their affiliations with the Tribe-which the Indian plaintiffs in
these cases have not done. The provision at issue provides in pertinent
part as follows:
"That the people inhabiting this state do agree and declare that they
forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying
within the boundaries of this state, and to all lands lying within said limits
owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes; and that until the title
thereto shall have been extinguished by the United States, the same shall
be and remain subject to the disposition of the United States, and said
Indian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control
of the congress of the United States ... ; Provided,That nothing in this
ordinance shall preclude the state from taxing as other lands are taxed
any lands owned or held by any Indian who has severed his tribal relations, and has obtainedfrom the United States or from any person a title
thereto by patent or other grant,save and except such lands as have been
or may be granted to any Indian or Indians under any act of congress
containing a provision exempting the lands thus granted from taxation,
which exemption shall continue so long and to such an extent as such act
of congress may prescribe." Wash. Const., Art. XXVI, Second (emphasis added).
We agree with the Court of Appeals that, under this text, the Indian lands
not covered by the quoted proviso are not exempted from taxation, but
merely committed to "the absolute jurisdiction and control of [Congress]."
If Congress has permitted taxation, the provision is not violated.

260

COUNTY OF YAKIMA v. CONFEDERATED TRIBES
AND BANDS OF YAKIMA NATION
Opinion of the Court

is a dead letter, at least within the confines of an Indian
reservation. The Tribe argues that, by terminating the
allotment program and restoring tribal integrity through the
Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, Congress impliedly repealed ยง 6's jurisdictional grant and returned the law to its
pre-General Allotment Act foundations. Congress' subsequent actions, according to the Tribe, confirm this implication. In 1948, for instance, Congress defined "Indian country" to include all fee land within the boundaries of an
existing reservation, whether or not held by an Indian, and
pre-empted state criminal laws within "Indian country" insofar as offenses by and against Indians were concerned. See
Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 757-758, as amended, 18 U. S. C.
ยงยง 1151-1153; Seymour v. Superintendent of Washington
State Penitentiary,368 U. S. 351 (1962). And in 1953, Congress once again signaled its belief in the dormition of ยง 6
by enacting Pub. L. 280, which authorized States to assume
criminal and civil jurisdiction over Indians within Indian
country in certain circumstances. See Act of Aug. 15, 1953,
67 Stat. 588.
Though generally in agreement with the Tribe, the United
States takes a slightly different tack. It claims that the
General Allotment Act removed only those barriers to state
jurisdiction that existed at the time of its enactment, e. g.,
those associated with tribal sovereignty and the trust status
of allotted land. The General Allotment Act did not remove-indeed, the argument goes, could not have removed-a jurisdictional bar arising after the Act's passage.
For just such an after-arising jurisdictional bar, the United
States points to the same statutes on which the Tribe rests
its position. In the United States' view, these enactments
must be construed to pre-empt the application "of state laws
(especially state tax laws) to Indians and their property
within a reservation." Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 14.

Opinion of the Court

In support of their convergent arguments, the Yakima Nation and the United States cite this Court's unanimous decision in Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, 425
U. S. 463 (1976), which they contend repudiates the continuing jurisdictional force of the General Allotment Act. In
that case, the State of Montana sought to impose its cigarette
sales and personal property taxes, as well as vendorlicensing fees, on Indian residents of a reservation located
entirely within the State. It relied for jurisdiction upon ยง 6
of the General Allotment Act, but did not limit its claim of
taxing authority to the reservation's allottees or even to
those activities taking place on allotted reservation fee land.
Instead, the State made an "all or nothing" claim to
reservation-wide jurisdiction (trust land included), arguing
that any scheme of divided jurisdiction would be inequitable.
Brief for Appellants in Moe, 0. T. 1975, No. 74-1656, p. 17.
We declined Montana's invitation to ignore the plain language of ยง 6, which "[b]y its terms [did] not reach Indians
residing" or conducting business on trust lands. Moe, 425
U. S., at 478. The assertion of reservation-wide jurisdiction,
we said, could not be sustained. But we went much further:
In light of Congress' repudiation in 1934 of the policies behind the General Allotment Act, we concluded that the Act
could no longer be read to provide Montana plenary jurisdiction even over those Indians residing on reservation fee
lands:
"The State has referred us to no decisional authorityand we know of none-giving the meaning for which it
contends to ยง 6 of the General Allotment Act in the face
of the many and complex intervening jurisdictional statutes directed at the reach of state law within reservation lands ....

Congress by its more modern legisla-

tion has evinced a clear intent to eschew any such
'checkerboard' approach within an existing Indian reservation, and our cases have in turn followed Congress'
lead in this area." Id., at 479.

262

COUNTY OF YAKIMA v. CONFEDERATED TRIBES
AND BANDS OF YAKIMA NATION
Opinion of the Court

Reasoning from Moe, the Yakima Nation and the United
States argue that if ยง 6 no longer provides for plenary state
jurisdiction over the owners of reservation fee lands, then
it cannot support the exercise of the narrower jurisdiction
asserted by Yakima County here. They concede, as they
must, that in Moe the Court did not address the Burke Act
proviso to ยง 6, which figures so prominently in Yakima County's analysis. But real property taxes were not at issue in
Moe, they argue, making the proviso irrelevant. And because a proviso can only operate within the reach of the principal provision it modifies, cf. United States v. Morrow, 266
U. S. 531, 534-535 (1925), neither the language of ยง 6 proper
nor the proviso can be considered effective after Moe.
We think this view rests upon a misunderstanding of Moe
and a misperception of the structure of the General Allotment Act. As to the former: The Tribe's and the United
States' interpretation of our opinion in Moe reduces ultimately to the proposition that we held ยง6 to have been repealed by implication. That is not supportable, however,
since it is a "cardinal rule ...that repeals by implication are
not favored," Posadasv. National City Bank, 296 U. S. 497,
503 (1936), and since we made no mention of implied repeal
in our opinion. Moe was premised, instead, on the implausibility, in light of Congress' postallotment era legislation, of
Montana's construction of ยง 6 that would extend the State's
in personam jurisdiction beyond the section's literal coverage ("each and every allottee") to include subsequent Indian
owners (through grant or devise) of the allotted parcels.
This approach, we said, would create a "checkerboard" pattern in which an Indian's personal law would depend upon
his parcel ownership; it would contradict "the many and complex intervening jurisdictional statutes" dealing with States'
civil and criminal jurisdiction over reservation Indians; and
it would produce almost surreal administrative problems,
making the applicable law of civil relations depend not upon
the locus of the transaction but upon the character of the

Cite as: 502 U. S. 251 (1992)
Opinion of the Court

reservation land owned by one or both parties. See Moe,
supra, at 478-479.
Thus, even as to ยง 6 personal jurisdiction, Moe in no way
contradicts Goudy v. Meath, which involved the personal liability for taxes of an Indian who not merely owned an allotted parcel, but was, as the language of ยง6 requires, himself
an allottee. See 203 U. S., at 147, 149. But (and now we
come to the misperception concerning the structure of the
General Allotment Act) Goudy did not rest exclusively, or
even primarily, on the ยง 6 grant of personal jurisdiction over
allottees to sustain the land taxes at issue. Instead, it was
the alienability of the al'lotted lands-a consequence produced in these cases not by ยง 6 of the General Allotment Act,
but by ยง 538-that the Court found of central significance.
As the first basis of its decision, before reaching the "further" point of personal jurisdiction under ยง6, id., at 149, the
Goudy Court said that, although it was certainly possible
for Congress to "grant the power of voluntary sale, while
withholding the land from taxation or forced alienation,"
such an intent would not be presumed unless it was "clearly
manifested." Ibid. For "it would seem strange to withdraw [the] protection [of the restriction on alienation] and
permit the Indian to dispose of his lands as he pleases, while
at the same time releasing it [sic] from taxation." Ibid.
Thus, when ยง 5 rendered the allotted lands alienable and enI Section

5 of the General Allotment Act provides in part:

"[A]t the expiration of said [trust] period the United States will convey
[the allotted lands] by patent to said Indian ... in fee, discharged of said
trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever ....
And if any
conveyance shall be made of the lands set apart and allotted as herein
provided, or any contract made touching the same, before the expiration
of the time above mentioned, such conveyance or contract shall be absolutely null and void...." 25 U. S. C. ยง348.
The negative implication of the last quoted sentence, of course, is that a
conveyance of allotted land is permitted once the patent issues.

264

COUNTY OF YAKIMA v. CONFEDERATED TRIBES
AND BANDS OF YAKIMA NATION
Opinion of the Court

cumberable, it also rendered them subject to assessment and
forced sale for taxes.
The Burke Act proviso, enacted in 1906, made this implication of ยง 5 explicit, and its nature more clear. As we have
explained, the purpose of the Burke Act was to change the
outcome of our decision in In re Heft, 197 U. S. 488 (1905), so
that ยง6's general grant of civil and criminal jurisdiction over
Indian allottees would not be effective until the 25-year trust
period expired and patents were issued in fee. The proviso,
however, enabled the Secretary of the Interior to issue fee
patents to certain allottees before expiration of the trust
period. Although such a fee patent would not subject its
Indian owner to plenary state jurisdiction, fee ownership
would free the land of "all restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation." 25 U. S.C. ยง 349. In other words,
the proviso reaffirmed for such "prematurely" patented land
what ยง 5 of the General Allotment Act implied with respect
to patented land generally: subjection to state real estate
taxes. 4 And when Congress, in 1934, while putting an end
to further allotment of reservation land, see 25 U. S. C. ยง 461,
chose not to return allotted land to pre-General Allotment
Act status, leaving it fully alienable by the allottees, their
heirs, and assigns, see Brendale, 492 U. S., at 423 (plurality
opinion); Hodel v. Irving, 481 U. S. 704, 708-709 (1987), it
chose not to terminate state taxation upon those lands as
well.

risdiction over reservation fee-patented land. But because
the jurisdiction is in rem rather than in personam, it is
assuredly not Moe-condemned; and it is not impracticable
either. The parcel-by-parcel determinations that the State's
tax assessor is required to make on the reservation do not
differ significantly from those he must make off the reservation, to take account of immunities or exemptions enjoyed,
for example, by federally owned, state-owned, and churchowned lands. We cannot resist observing, moreover, that
the Tribe's and the United States' favored disposition also
produces a "checkerboard," and one that is less readily administered: They would allow state taxation of only those fee
lands owned (from time to time) by nonmembers of the Tribe.
See Brief for Yakima Nation 16, n. 8; Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 12. See also Brendale, supra, at
422-425 (plurality opinion) (affirming "checkerboard" with
respect to zoning power over reservation fee land).
Turning away from the statutory texts altogether, the
Yakima Nation argues that state jurisdiction over reservation fee land is manifestly inconsistent with the policies of
Indian self-determination and self-governance that lay behind the Indian Reorganization Act and subsequent congressional enactments. This seems to us a great exaggeration.
While the in personam jurisdiction over reservation Indians
at issue in Moe would have been significantly disruptive of
tribal self-government, the mere power to assess and collect
a tax on certain real estate is not. In any case, these policy
objections do not belong in this forum. If the Yakima Nation believes that the objectives of the Indian Reorganization
Act are too much obstructed by the clearly retained remnant
of an earlier policy, it must make that argument to Congress.
Judges "are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments, and when two [or more] statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a
clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to

regard each as effective."
535, 551 (1974).

Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S.
III

Yakima County sought to impose two separate taxes with
respect to reservation fee lands, an ad valorem tax and an
excise tax on sales. We discuss each in turn, in light of the
principles set forth above.

A
Liability for the ad valorem tax flows exclusively from
ownership of realty on the annual date of assessment. See
Timber Traders, Inc. v. Johnston, 87 Wash. 2d 42, 47, 548
P. 2d 1080, 1083 (1976). The tax, moreover, creates a burden on the property alone. See Wash. Rev. Code ยง 84.60.020
(1989) ("The taxes assessed upon real property.., shall be
a lien thereon from and including the first day of January
in the year in which they are levied until the same are
paid . . ."); Clizer v. Krauss, 57 Wash. 26, 30-31, 106 P. 145,
146-147 (1910). See also Timber Traders, Inc., supra;In re
Electric City, Inc., 43 B. R. 336, 341 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Wash.
1984) (dictum). The Court of Appeals held, the Tribe does
not dispute, and we agree, that this ad valorem tax constitutes "taxation of ...land" within the meaning of the General Allotment Act and is therefore prima facie valid.
The Court of Appeals, however, derived from our decision
three Terms ago in Brendale the conclusion that the Yakima
Nation has a "protectible interest" against imposition of the
tax on Tribe members upon demonstration of the evils described in that opinion, and remanded to the District Court
for further findings in that regard. Neither of the parties
supports this aspect of the Ninth Circuit's ruling, believing
that the law affords an unconditional answer to permissibility of the tax. We agree.
Brendale addressed a challenge to the Yakima Nation's
assertion of authority to zone reservation fee land owned by
non-Indians. The concept of "protectible interest" to which

Cite as: 502 U. S. 251 (1992)

Opinion of the Court
JUSTICE WHITE'S opinion in

the case referred, see 492 U. S.,

at 431, grew out of a long line of cases exploring the very
narrow powers reserved to tribes over the conduct of nonIndians within their reservations. See Montana v. United
States, 450 U. S. 544, 566 (1981) (citing cases). Even though
a tribe's "inherent sovereign powers ... do not extend to the
activities of nonmembers, . . . [a] tribe may ... retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of
non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that
conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political
integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of
the tribe." Id., at 565-566 (emphasis added). Brendale and
its reasoning are not applicable to the present cases, which
involve not a proposed extension of a tribe's inherent powers,
but an asserted restriction of a State's congressionally conferred powers. Moreover, as the Court observed recently
in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480
U. S., at 215, n. 17, we have traditionally followed "a per se
rule" "[i]n the special area of state taxation of Indian tribes
and tribal members." Though the rule has been most often
applied to produce categorical prohibition of state taxation
when there has been no "cession of jurisdiction or other federal [legislative permission]," Mescalero Apache Tribe, 411
U. S., at 148, we think it also applies to produce categorical
allowance of state taxation when it has in fact been authorized by Congress. "Either Congress intended to pre-empt
the state taxing authority or it did not. Balancing of interests is not the appropriate gauge for determining validity
since it is that very balancing which we have reserved to
Congress." Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville
Reservation, 447 U. S. 134, 177 (1980) (opinion of REHNQUIST, J.). If the Ninth Circuit's Brendale test were the law,
litigation would surely engulf the States' annual assessment
and taxation process, with the validity of each levy dependent upon a multiplicity of factors that vary from year to year,

268

COUNTY OF YAKIMA v. CONFEDERATED TRIBES
AND BANDS OF YAKIMA NATION

Opinion of the Court

and from parcel to parcel. For reasons of practicality, as
well as text, we adhere to our per se approach.
B
We think the excise tax on sales of fee land is another
matter, as did the Court of Appeals. While the Burke Act
proviso does not purport to describe the entire range of in
rem jurisdiction States may exercise with respect to feepatented reservation land, we think it does describe the entire range of jurisdiction to tax. And that description is
"taxation of... land." Yakima County seeks to expand this
text by citing our statement in Squire v. Capoeman,351 U. S.
1 (1956), to the effect that "[t]he literal language of the
[Burke Act] proviso evinces a congressional intent to subject
an Indian allotment to all taxes" after it has been patented
in fee. Id., at 7-8 (emphasis added). This dictum was addressed, however, to the United States' assertion that the
General Allotment Act barred only States and localities, and
not the Federal Government, from levying taxes on Indian
allotments during the trust period. "All taxes," in the sense
of federal as well as local, in no way expands the text beyond
"taxation of... land."
It does not exceed the bounds of permissible construction
to interpret "taxation of land" as including taxation of the
proceeds from sale of land; and it is even true that such
a construction would be fully in accord with Goudy's emphasis upon the consequences of alienability, which underlay
the Burke Act proviso. That is surely not, however, the
phrase's unambiguous meaning-as is shown by the Washington Supreme Court's own observation that "a tax upon
the sale of property is not a tax upon the subject matter of
that sale." Mahler v. Tremper, 40 Wash. 2d 405, 409, 243
P. 2d 627, 629 (1952). It is quite reasonable to say, in other
words, that though the object of the sale here is land, that
does not make land the object of the tax, and hence does not

Cite as: 502 U. S. 251 (1992)

Opinion of the Court

invoke the Burke Act proviso. When we are faced with
these two possible constructions, our choice between them
must be dictated by a principle deeply rooted in this Court's
Indian jurisprudence: "[S]tatutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit." Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471
U. S., at 766. See also McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax
Comm'n, 411 U. S., at 174.
To render this a "taxation of land" in the narrow sense, it
does not suffice that, under Washington law, the excise tax
creates "a specific lien upon each piece of real property sold
from the time of sale until the tax shall have been paid .... "
Wash. Rev. Code ยง82.45.070 (1989). A lien upon real estate
to satisfy a tax does not convert the tax into a tax upon real
estate-otherwise all sorts of state taxation of reservationIndian activities could be validated (even the cigarette sales
tax disallowed in Moe) by merely making the unpaid tax
assessable against the taxpayer's fee-patented real estate.
Thus, we cannot even accept the county's narrower contention that the excise tax lien is enforceable against reservation fee property conveyed by an Indian seller to a
non-Indian buyer. The excise tax remains a tax upon the
Indian's activity of selling the land, and thus is void, whatever means may be devised for its collection. Cf., e. g.,
Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation,
supra, at 154-159 (Indian proprietors may be compelled to
precollect taxes whose incidence legally falls on nonIndians); Moe, 425 U. S., at 482 (same).
The short of the matter is that the General Allotment Act
explicitly authorizes only "taxation of ... land," not "taxation with respect to land," "taxation of transactions involving land," or "taxation based on the value of land." Because
it is eminently reasonable to interpret that language as not
including a tax upon the sale of real estate, our cases require
us to apply that interpretation for the benefit of the Tribe.

270

COUNTY OF YAKIMA v. CONFEDERATED TRIBES
AND BANDS OF YAKIMA NATION
Opinion of BLACKMUN, J.

Accordingly, Yakima County's excise tax on sales of land
cannot be sustained.
*

*

*

We hold that the General Allotment Act permits Yakima
County to impose an ad valorem tax on reservation land patented in fee pursuant to the Act, but does not allow the
county to enforce its excise tax on sales of such land. The
Yakima Nation contends it is not clear whether the parcels
at issue in these cases were patented under the General Allotment Act, rather than under some other statutes in force
prior to the Indian Reorganization Act. E. g., 25 U. S. C.
ยงยง 320, 379, 404, 405. We leave for resolution on remand that
factual point, and the prior legal question whether it makes
any difference.
The judgment is affirmed, and the cause is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in part and dissenting in

part.
I have wandered the maze of Indian statutes and case law
tracing back 100 years. Unlike the Court, however, I am
unable to find an "unmistakably clear" intent of Congress
to allow the States to tax Indian-owned fee-patented lands.
Accordingly, while I concur with the majority's conclusion
that Yakima County may not impose excise taxes, I dissent
from its conclusion that the county may impose ad valorem
taxes on Indian-owned fee-patented lands.
The Court correctly sets forth the "'unmistakably clear"'
intent standard to be applied. Ante, at 258. But then, in
my view, it seriously misapplies it, over the well-taken objections of the Yakima Nation and against the sound guidance
of the United States as amicus curiae. At bottom, I believe
the Court misapprehends the nature of federal pre-emption
analysis and, as a result, dramatically devalues longstanding

Cite as: 502 U. S. 251 (1992)
Opinion of BLACKMUN, J.

federal policies intended to preserve the integrity of our Nation's Indian tribes. As I see it, the Court errs in three
ways in arriving at its finding of "unmistakably clear" intent
to allow taxation of Indian-owned fee-patented lands. First,
it divines "unmistakably clear" intent from a proviso, which
by its very terms applies only to land patented prematurely
(and not to all patented land) and which is now orphaned, its
antecedent principal clause no longer having any force of law.
Second, acting on its own intuition that it would be "strange"
for land to be alienable and encumberable yet not taxable,
the Court infers "unmistakably clear" intent of Congress
from an otherwise irrelevant statutory section that itself
makes no mention of taxation of fee lands. Finally, misapprehending the nature of federal pre-emption of state laws
taxing the Indians, the Court mistakenly assumes that it cannot give any effect to the many complex intervening statutes
reflecting a complete turnabout in federal Indian policynow aimed at preserving tribal integrity and the Indian land
base-since enactment at the turn of the century of the statutory provisions upon which the Court relies. These current and now longstanding federal policies weigh decisively
against the Court's finding that Congress has intended the
States to tax-and, as in these cases, to foreclose uponIndian-held lands.
1. The majority concedes that the principal clause of ยง6 of
the Dawes Act, which subjected allottees to the plenary civil
and criminal jurisdiction of the States, can "no longer be read
to provide ... plenary jurisdiction even as to those Indians
residing on reservation fee lands." Ante, at 261. See also
DeCoteau v. District County Court, 420 U. S. 425, 427, n. 2
(1975) (recognizing that statutory definition of "Indian country," which includes all reservation land "notwithstanding
the issuance of any patent," 18 U. S. C. ยง 1151, demarcates
general boundary of civil jurisdiction of States); McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164, 177-178,
and n. 17 (1973) (discussing more recent congressional enact-

Opinion of BLACKMUN, J.

ments, i. e., Pub. L. 280 and the Indian Civil Rights Act of
1968, giving States civil and criminal jurisdiction over reservations but only upon consent of the affected tribe).
Rather than rely on the principal clause of ยง 6, the Court
turns to a proviso added by the Burke Act, enacted in 1906.1
Ante, at 264. It acknowledges that the proviso was not even
mentioned in Goudy v. Meath, 203 U. S. 146 (1906),2 a case
upon which the majority relies. Ante, at 258-259. As an
initial matter, the proviso's attachment to an obsolete principal clause, if anything, must diminish its force as a measure
of congressional intent. Moreover, by its terms, the proviso
does not remove "restrictions as to... taxation" from all
allotted land. It removes restrictions solely from allotted
land that happened to be patented in fee "prematurely," i. e.,
prior to the expiration of the 25-year trust period. To be
sure, the proviso could be read to suggest that Congress possibly intended taxation of allotted lands other than those
lands patented prematurely.3 But a possibility, or even a
likelihood, does not meet this Court's demanding standard of
"unmistakably clear" intent.

IThe

proviso states in pertinent part:

"[The Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion.., whenever he
shall be satisfied that any Indian allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs at any time to cause to be issued to such allottee
a patent in fee simple, and thereafter all restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed. ... " 25 U. S. C. ยง 349.
2Goudy relied upon the principal clause of ยง6. Even if this principal
clause had any continuing vitality, whether Goudy would still be good law
is questionable in light of the Court's more recent decision in Bryan v.
Itasca County, 426 U. S. 373 (1976), where it declined to find a clear intent
of Congress to allow a State to tax Indians on the basis of a statute, ยง4(a)
of Pub. L. 280, that on its face conferred upon the State general civil
jurisdictional powers over Indian country.
8This reading, which would imply the taxability of all fee-patented lands
regardless of whether the owner was an original allottee, is in some tension with what the majority points out to be the "literal coverage ('each
and every allottee')"of the principal general-jurisdiction-conferring clause.
Ante, at 262.

Cite as: 502 U. S. 251 (1992)
Opinion of BLACKMUN, J.

2. And so the Court turns to ยง5 of the Dawes Act for support. The majority claims that "the proviso reaffirmed for
such 'prematurely' patented land what ยง 5 of the [Dawes Act]
implied with respect to patented land generally: subjection
to state real estate taxes." Ante, at 264 (emphasis added).
Because ยง 5 renders fee-patented lands alienable and encumberable, the majority suggests that "'it would seem strange
to withdraw [the] protection [of the restriction on alienation]
and permit the Indian to dispose of his lands as he pleases,
while at the same time releasing it [sic] from taxation."'
Ante, at 263 (quoting Goudy v. Meath, 203 U. S., at 149).
The majority concedes that ยง 5 only "implied" this conclusion. Ante, at 263. In my view, a "mere implication" falls
far short of the "unmistakably clear" intent standard. Cf.
EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 260
(1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("Given the presumption against extraterritoriality...
and the requirement that the intent to overcome it be 'clearly
expressed,' it is in my view not reasonable to give effect to
mere implications from the statutory language as the EEOC
has done").
Nor can what this Court finds "strange" substitute for the
"unmistakably clear" intent of Congress. To impute to Congress an intent to tax Indian land because the Court thinks
it "strange" not to do so overlooks the countervailing presumption that "Congress has.., acted consistently upon the
assumption that the States have no power to regulate the
affairs of Indians on a reservation." Williams v. Lee, 358
U. S. 217, 220 (1959). I need not pass upon the wisdom of
the majority's fiscal theory that if land is alienable and encumberable, it must be taxable. I pause only to comment
that Congress has made its own agreement with this particular economic theory less than "unmistakably clear." Cf.
Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting) ("This case is decided upon an economic theory
which a large part of the country does not entertain").

274

AND BANDS OF YAKIMA NATION
Opinion of BLACKMUN, J.

3. In any event, if "strangeness" is the benchmark of what
Congress unmistakably intends, I find it stranger still to presume that Congress intends States to tax-and, as in these
cases, foreclose upon-Indian-owned reservation lands. This
presumption does not account for Congress' "abrupt" termination of the assimilationist policies of the Dawes Act
in favor of the Indian Reorganization Act's now wellestablished "principles of tribal self-determination and selfgovernance." See ante, at 255.
The Court announces that the Yakima's "policy objections
do not belong in this forum." Ante, at 265. Yet, not to consider the policies of the Indian Reorganization Act is to forget that "we previously have construed the effect of legislation affecting reservation Indians in light of 'intervening'
legislative enactments." Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U. S.
373, 386 (1976). See also Moe v. Confederated Salish and
Kootenai Tribes, 425 U. S. 463, 479 (1976) (noting that State's
interpretation of ยง 6 of the Dawes Act cannot survive "the
many and complex intervening jurisdictional statutes" subsequently enacted). The majority appears to assume that
these intervening enactments need not be given any effect
here, because they do not rise to the level of a "repeal" of
the Dawes and Burke Acts. Ante, at 262. I agree with the
majority that implied repeals are not favored. But this is
beside the point. A "repeal"-whether express or impliedneed not be shown to preclude the States from taxing Indian lands.
As in all state-Indian jurisdiction cases, the relevant inquiry is whether Congress has pre-empted state law, not
whether it has repealed its own law. See, e. g., Californiav.
Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202, 216 (1987);
Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U. S., at 376, n. 2. Under established principles of pre-emption, and notwithstanding the
majority's derisive characterizations, see ante, at 264-265,
state laws may in fact give way to "mere" federal policies
and interests. See English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S.
72, 79 (1990) (state law is pre-empted to the extent that it

Cite as: 502 U. S. 251 (1992)

Opinion of BLACKMUN, J.

"'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution
of the full purposes and objectives of Congress' ") (quoting
Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)) (emphasis
added)). Thus, in the Indian context, "'[s]tate jurisdiction
is pre-empted... if it interferes or is incompatible with federal and tribal interests reflected in federal law, unless the
state interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion
of state authority."' California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S., at 216 (quoting New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U. S. 324, 334 (1983)). 4 See also
White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136,
143-145 (1980) (recognizing "firm federal policy" of promoting tribal self-sufficiency and economic development and noting that the pre-emption inquiry "call[s] for a particularized
inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake") (emphasis added).
Accordingly, this Court has made clear that "[tihe inquiry
is to proceed in light of traditional notions of Indian sovereignty and the congressional goal of Indian self-government,
including its 'overriding goal' of encouraging tribal selfsufficiency and economic development." Cabazon, 480 U. S.,
at 216. In Cabazon, for example, the Court gave weight to
recent policy statements by Congress and the President in
support of Indian autonomy and self-determination, deeming
them to be "particularly significant in this case." Id., at 216,
n. 19; see also id., at 217-218, and nn. 20-21. 5
4In Cabazon, the Court reiterated that "the federal tradition of Indian
immunity from state taxation is very strong and that the state interest in
taxation is correspondingly weak." 480 U. S., at 215, n. 17.
61 have previously observed:
"Surely, in considering whether Congress intended tribes to enjoy civil
jurisdiction,.. . this Court should direct its attention not to the intent of
the Congress that passed the Dawes Act, but rather to the intent of the
Congress that repudiated the Dawes Act, and established the Indian policies to which we are heir." Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands
of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 464 (1989) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).

COUNTY OF YAKIMA v. CONFEDERATED TRIBES
AND BANDS OF YAKIMA NATION
Opinion of BLACKMUN, J.

I believe that if the majority were inclined to give federal
policy interests any effect, its conclusion as to Congress' "unmistakably clear" intent would doubtless be different today.
The nature of federal policy interests emerges clearly from
a review of the effects of the Indian land-allotment policies.
During the allotment period from 1887 to 1934, Indian landholdings were reduced nationwide, through a combination of
sales by allottees to non-Indians and Government sales of
"surplus" unallotted lands, from about 138 million acres to
48 million acres. See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian
Law 138 (1982). Of the 90 million acres lost, about 27 million acres passed from Indians to non-Indians, as a result of
the alienability of the newly allotted land. Ibid. See also
Readjustment of Indian Affairs, Hearings on H. R. 7902 before the House Committee on Indian Affairs, 73d Cong., 2d
Sess., 17 (Comm. Print 1934) (Memorandum of John Collier,
Commissioner of Indian Affairs) (Hearings).
For 12,000 years, the Yakima Indians have lived on their
lands in eastern Washington. See H. Schuster, The Yakima
14 (1990). Because of the allotment policies, non-Indians
today own more than a quarter million acres, more than half
the land originally allotted to individual members of the Yakimas. Id., at 83. "Allotment and the subsequent sale or
lease of Indian lands accomplished what the 'genocide' of epidemics, war, and bootlegged alcohol had not been able to do:
a systematic 'ethnocide' brought about by a loss of Indian
identity with the loss of land." H. Schuster, The Yakimas:
A Critical Bibliography 70 (1982).
It is little wonder that, as Congress moved toward repudiating the allotment system in 1934, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs informed Congress:
"It is difficult to imagine any other system which with
equal effectiveness would pauperize the Indian while
impoverishing him, and sicken and kill his soul while
pauperizing him, and cast him in so ruined a condition

into the final status of a nonward dependent upon the
States and counties." Hearings, at 18.

I am mystified how this Court, sifting through the wreckage
of the Dawes Act, finds any "clearly retained remnant," ante,
at 265, justifying further erosions-through tax foreclosure

actions as in this litigation-to the landholdings of the Indian people.
The majority deems any concerns for tribal selfdetermination to be a "great exaggeration." Ante, at 265.
I myself, however, am "far from convinced that when a
State imposes taxes upon reservation members without
their consent, its action can be reconciled with tribal
self-determination."
McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax

Comm'n, 411 U. S., at 179. The majority concludes that, as
a practical matter, "mere" property taxes are less disruptive
of tribal integrity than cigarette sales taxes and certain personal property taxes (as on automobiles) that were at issue
in Moe. Ante, at 264-265. I cannot agree that paying a
few more pennies for cigarettes or a tax on some personal

property is more a threat to tribal integrity and selfdetermination than foreclosing upon and seizing tribal lands.
6

The Court concludes that Congress' decision in the Indian Reorganization Act not to reimpose restraints on alienation of land already patented
suggests that Congress also "chose not to terminate state taxation upon
those lands as well." Ante, at 264. In 1934, when the process of allotment was halted, 246,569 assignments had been made nationwide, totaling
nearly 41 million acres (slightly less than the entire acreage of the State
of Washington). Indian Heirship Land Survey, Memorandum of the
Chairman to the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 86th
Cong., 2d Sess., pt. I, p. 2 (Comm. Print 1960). In my judgment, Congress' choice not to effect a taking of this magnitude does not reflect an
intent to continue other policies contributing to the loss of Indian lands.
If anything, Congress' intent is to be gauged not by negative implication
from what it failed to do, but from provisions in the Act that stop further
allotment, that freeze in trust already allotted-but-not-yet-patented land,
and that affirmatively authorize repurchases of Indian lands to rebuild the
tribal land base. See generally 25 U. S. C. ยงยง461-465.

Finally, the majority platitudinously suggests that the

Ante, at 265. I am less confident than my colleagues that
the 31 Yakima Indian families likely to be rendered landless
and homeless by today's decision are well positioned to lobby
for change in the vast corridors of Congress.
