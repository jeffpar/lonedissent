EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL, COMMISSIONER
OF SOCIAL SECURITY, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIRST CIRCUIT
No. 97-42. Argued March 4, 1998-Decided June 25, 1998
In 1946, a historic labor agreement between coal operators and the United
Mine Workers of America (UMWA) led to the creation of benefit funds
that provided for the medical expenses of miners and their dependents,
with the precise benefits determined by UMWA-appointed trustees.
Those trusts served as the model for the United Mine Workers of
America Welfare and Retirement Fund (1947 W&R Fund), which was
established by the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1947
(1947 NBCWA). The Fund used proceeds of a royalty on coal production to provide benefits to miners and their families, and trustees determined benefit levels and other matters. The 1950 NBCWA created a
new fund (1950 W&R Fund), which used a fixed amount of royalties for
benefits, gave trustees the authority to establish and adjust benefit levels so as to remain within the budgetary restraints, and did not guarantee lifetime health benefits for retirees and their dependents. The 1950
W&R Fund continued to operate with benefit levels subject to revision
until the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)
introduced specific funding and vesting requirements for pension plans.
To comply with ERISA, the UIMWA and the Bituminous Coal Operators'
Association entered into the 1974 NBCWA, which created four new
trusts. It was the first agreement to expressly reference health benefits for retirees, but it did not alter the employers' obligation to contribute a fixed amount of royalties. The new agreement did not extend the
employers' liability beyond the term of the agreement. Miners who
retired before 1976 were covered by the 1950 Benefit Plan and Trust
(1950 Benefit Plan), and those retiring after 1975 were covered by the
1974 Benefit Plan and Trust (1974 Benefit Plan).. The increase in benefits and other factors-the decline in coal production, the retirement of
a generation of miners, and rapid acceleration in health care costsquickly caused financial problems for the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans.
To ensure the Plans' solvency, the 1978 NBCWA obligated signatories
to make sufficient contributions to maintain benefits as long as they
were in the coal business. As the Plans continued to suffer financially,
employers began to withdraw, leaving the remaining signatories to absorb the increasing cost of covering retirees left behind.

Syllabus
Ultimately, Congress passed the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit
Act of 1992 (Coal Act) to stabilize funding and provide for benefits to
retirees by merging the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans into a new fund
(Combined Fund) that provides substantially the same benefits as provided by the 1950 and 1974 Plans and is funded by premiums assessed
against coal operators that signed any NBCWA or other agreement requiring contributions to the 1950 or 1974 Benefit Plans. Respondent,
Commissioner of Social Security, assigns retirees to signatory coal operators according to the following allocation formula: First, to the most
recent signatory to the 1978 or a subsequent NBCWA to employ the
retiree in the coal industry for at least two years, 26 U. S. C. ยง9706(a)(1);
second, to the most recent signatory to the 1978 or a subsequent
NBCWA to employ the retiree in the coal industry, ยง9706(a)(2); and
third, to the signatory operator that employed the retiree in the coal
industry for the longest period of time prior to the effective date of the
1978 NBCWA, ยง9706(a)(3).
Petitioner Eastern Enterprises (Eastern) was a signatory to every
NBCWA executed between 1947 and 1964. It is "in business" within
the Coal Act's meaning, although it left the coal industry in 1965, after
transferring its coal operations to a subsidiary (EACC) and ultimately
selling its interest in EACC to respondent Peabody Holding Company,
Inc. (Peabody). Under the Coal Act, the Commissioner assigned Eastern the obligation for Combined Fund premiums respecting over 1,000
retired miners who had worked for the company before 1966. Eastern
sued the Commissioner and other respondents, claiming that the Coal
Act violates substantive due process and constitutes a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court granted respondents
summary judgment, and the First Circuit affirmed.
Hel& The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
110 F. 3d 150, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CoNNoR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA,
and JUSTICE THOMAS, concluded:
1. The declaratory judgment and injunction petitioner seeks are an
appropriate remedy for the taking alleged in this case, and it is within
the district courts' power to award such equitable reief. The Tucker
Act may require that a just compensation claim under the Takings
Clause be filed in the Court of Federal Claims, but petitioner does not
seek compensation from the Government. In situations analogous to
the one here, this Court has assumed the lack of a compensatory remedy
and has granted equitable relief for Takings Clause violations without
discussing the Tucker Act's applicability. See, e. g., Babbitt v. Youpee,
519 U. S. 234,234-235. Pp. 519-522.

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Syllabus
2. The Coal Act's allocation of liability to Eastern violates the Takings
Clause. Pp. 522-537.
(a) Economic regulation such as the Coal Act may effect a taking.
United States v. Security IndustrialBank, 459 U. S. 70, 78. The party
challenging the government action bears a substantial burden, for not
every destruction or injury to property by such action is a constitutional
taking. A regulations constitutionality is evaluated by examining the
governmental action's "justice and fairness." See Andrus v. Allard,
444 U. S. 51, 65. Although that inquiry does not lend itself to any set
formula, three factors traditionally have informed this Court's regulatory takings analysis: "[T]he economic impact of the regulation, its
interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and the
character of the governmental action." Kaiser Aetna v. United States,
444 U. S. 164, 175. Pp. 522-524.
(b) The analysis in this case is informed by previous decisions considering the constitutionality of somewhat similar legislative schemes:
Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1 (Black Lung Benefits
Act of 1972); Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,475
U. S. 211 (Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980); and
Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602 (same). Those opinions
make clear that Congress has considerable leeway to fashion economic
legislation, including the power to affect contractual commitments between private parties; and that it may impose retroactive liability to
some degree, particularly where it is "'confined to short and limited
periods required by the practicalities of producing national legislation,"'
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporationv. R. A Gray & Co., 467 U. S.
717, 731. The decisions, however, have left open the possibility that
legislation might be unconstitutional if it imposes severe retroactive liability on a limited class of parties that could not have anticipated the
liability, and if the extent of that liability is substantially disproportionate to the parties' experience. Pp. 524-529.
(c) The Coal Act's allocation scheme, as applied to Eastern, presents such a case, when the three traditional factors are considered. As
to the economic impact, Eastern's Coal Act liability is substantial, and
the company is clearly deprived of the $50 to $100 million it must pay
to the Combined Fund. An employer's statutory liability for multiemployer plan benefits should reflect some proportionality to its experience
with the plan. Concrete Pipe, supra, at 645. Eastern contributed to
the 1947 and 1950 W&R Funds, but ceased its coal mining operations in
1965 and neither participated in negotiations nor agreed to make contributions in connection with the Benefit Plans established under the 1974,
1978, or subsequent NBCWA's. It is the latter agreements, however,
that first suggest an industry commitment to funding lifetime health

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Syllabus
benefits for retirees and their dependents. During the years that Eastern employed miners, such benefits were far less extensive than under
the 1974 NBCWA, were unvested, and were fully subject to alteration
or termination. To the extent that Eastern may be able to seek indemnification from EACC or Peabody under contractual arrangements that
might insure Eastern against liabilities arising out of its former coal
operations, that indemnity is neither enhanced nor supplanted by the
Coal Act and does not affect the availability of the declaratory relief
sought here. Respondents' argument that the Coal Act moderates and
mitigates the economic impact by allocating some of Eastern's former
employees to signatories of the 1978 NBCWA is unavailing. That Eastern is not forced to bear the burden of lifetime benefits for all of its
former employees does not mean that its liability is not a significant
economic burden.
For similar reasons, the Coal Act substantially interferes with Eastern's reasonable investment-backed expectations. It operates retroactively, reaching back 80 to 50 years to impose liability based on Eastern's
activities between 1946 and 1965. Retroactive legislation is generally
disfavored. It presents problems of unfairness because it can deprive
citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions. General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 508 U. S. 181, 191. The distance into the
past that the Coal Act reaches back to impose liability on Eastern and
the magnitude of that liability raise substantial fairness questions. The
pre-1974 NBCWA's do not demonstrate that there was an implicit industrywide agreement to fund lifetime health benefits at the time that
Eastern was involved in the coal industry. The 1947 and 1950 W&R
Funds, in which Eastern participated, operated on a pay-as-you-go basis
and the classes of beneficiaries were subject to the trustees' discretion.
Not until 1974, when ERISA forced revisions to the 1950 W&R Fund
and when Eastern was no longer in the industry, could lifetime medical
benefits have been viewed as promised. Thus, the Coal Act's scheme
for allocating Combined Fund premiums is not calibrated either to Eastern's past actions or to any agreement by the company. Nor would the
Federal Government's pattern of involvement in the coal industry have
given Eastern sufficient notice that lifetime health benefits might be
guaranteed to retirees several decades later. Eastern's liability for
such benefits also differs from coal operators' responsibility under the
Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, which spread the cost of employmentrelated disabilities to those who profited from the fruits of the employees' labor, Turner Elkhorn, supra, at 18. Finally, the nature of the
governmental action in this case is quite unusual in that Congress' solution to the grave funding problem that it identified singles out certain
employers to bear a substantial burden, based on the employers' conduct

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Syllabus
far in the past, and unrelated to any commitment that the employers
made or to any injury they caused. Pp. 529-537.
JUSTICE KENNEDY concluded that application of the Coal Act to Eastern would violate the proper bounds of settled due process principles.
Although the Court has been hesitant to subject economic legislation to
due process scrutiny as a general matter, this country's law has harbored a singular distrust of retroactive statutes, and that distrust is
reflected in this Court's due process jurisprudence. For example, in
Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 15, the Court held
that due process requires an inquiry into whether a legislature acted in
an arbitrary and irrational way when enacting a retroactive law. This
formulation has been repeated in numerous recent cases, e. g., United
States v. Carlton, 512 U. S. 26, 31, which reflect the recognition that
retroactive lawmaldng is a particular concern because of the legislative
temptation to use it as a means of retribution against unpopular groups
or individuals, Landgrafv. USI Film Products,511 U.S. 244,266. Because change in the legal consequences of transactions long closed can
destroy the reasonable certainty and security which are the very objects
of property ownership, due process protection for property must be understood to incorporate the settled tradition against retroactive laws of
great severity. The instant case presents one of those rare instances
where the legislature has exceeded the limits imposed by due process.
The Coal Act's remedy bears no legitimate relation to the interest which
the Government asserts supports the statute. The degree of retroactive effect, which is a significant determinant in a statute's constitutionality, e. g., United States v. Carlton, supra, at 32, is of unprecedented
scope here, since the Coal Act created liability for events occurring 35
years ago. While the Court has upheld the imposition of liability on
former employers based on past employment relationships when the remedial statutes were designed to impose an actual, measurable business
cost which the employer had been able to avoid in the past, e. g., Turner
Elkhorn, supra, at 19, the Coal Act does not serve this purpose. The
beneficiaries' expectation of lifetime benefits was created by promises
and agreements made long after Eastern left the coal business, and
Eastern was not responsible for the perilous condition of the 1950 and
1974 Plans which jeopardized the benefits. Pp. 547-550.

Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Coal Act or
Act), 26 U. S. C. ยงยง 9701-9722 (1994 ed. and Supp. II), which
establishes a mechanism for funding health care benefits for
retirees from the coal industry and their dependents. We
conclude that the Coal Act, as applied to petitioner Eastern
Enterprises, effects an unconstitutional taking.
I
A
For a good part of this century, employers in the coal industry have been involved in negotiations with the United
Mine Workers of America (UMWA or Union) regarding the
provision of employee benefits to coal miners. When petitioner Eastern Enterprises (Eastern) was formed in 1929,
coal operators provided health care to their employees
through a prepayment system funded by payroll deductions.
Because of the rural location of most mines, medical facilities
were frequently substandard, and many of the medical professionals willing to work in mining areas were "company
doctors," often selected by the coal operators for reasons
other than their skills or training. The health care available
to coal miners and their families was deficient in many respects. In addition, the cost of company-provided services,
such as housing and medical care, often consumed the bulk of
miners' compensation. See generally U. S. Dept. of Interior,
Report of the Coal Mines Administration, A Medical Survey
of the Bitutminous-Coal Industry (1947) (Boone Report); Report of United States Coal Commission, S. Doe. No. 195, 68th
Cong., 2d Sess. (1925).
In the late 1930's, the UMWA began to demand changes
in the manner in which essential services were provided to
miners, and by 1946, the subject of miners' health care had
become a critical issue in collective bargaining negotiations
between the Union and bituminous coal companies. When
a breakdown in those negotiations resulted in a nationwide

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

strike, President Truman issued an Executive order directing Secretary of the Interior Julius Krug to take possession of all bituminous coal mines and to negotiate "appropriate changes in the terms and conditions of employment"
of miners with the UMWA. 11 Fed. Reg. 5593 (1946). A
week of negotiations between Secretary Krug and UMWA
President John L. Lewis produced the historic Krug-Lewis
Agreement that ended the strike. See App. in No. 96-1947
(CAI), p. 610 (hereinafter App. (CAI)).
That agreement, described as "an almost complete victory
for the miners," M. Fox, United We Stand 405 (1990), led
to the creation of benefit funds, financed by royalties on
coal produced and payroll deductions. The funds compensated miners and their dependents and survivors for wages
lost due to disability, death, or retirement. The funds also
provided for the medical expenses of miners and their
dependents, with the precise benefits determined by
UMWA-appointed trustees. In addition, the Krug-Lewis
Agreement committed the Government to undertake a comprehensive survey of the living conditions in coal mining
areas in order to assess the improvements necessary to bring
those communities up to "recognized American standards."
Krug-Lewis Agreement ยง 5, App. (CAl) 613. That study
concluded that the medical needs of miners and their dependents would be more effectively served through "a broad
prepayment system, based on sound actuarial principles."
Boone Report 226-227.
Shortly after the study was issued, the mines returned to
private control and the UMWA and several coal operators
entered into the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement
of 1947 (1947 NBCWA), App. (CAl) 615, which established
the United Mine Workers of America Welfare and Retirement Fund (1947 W&R Fund), modeled after the KrugLewis benefit trusts. The Fund was to use the proceeds of
a royalty on coal production to provide pension and medical

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

benefits to miners and their families. The 1947 NBCWA did
not specify the benefits to which miners and their dependents were entitled. Instead, three trustees appointed by
the parties were given authority to determine "coverage and
eligibility, priorities among classes of benefits, amounts of
benefits, methods of providing or arranging for provisions
for benefits, investment of trust funds, and all other related
matters."

1947 NBCWA 146, App. (CA) 619.

Disagreement over benefits continued, however, leading
to the execution of another NBCWA in 1950, which created
a new multiemployer trust, the United Mine Workers of
America Welfare and Retirement Fund of 1950 (1950 W&R
Fund). The 1950 W&R Fund established a 30-cents-per-ton
royalty on coal produced, payable by signatory operators on
a "several and not joint" basis for the duration of the 1950
Agreement. 1950 NBCWA 63, App. (CA) 640. As with
the 1947 W&R Fund, the 1950 W&R Fund was governed by
three trustees chosen by the parties and vested with responsibility to determine the level of benefits. Id., at 59-61,
App. (CA) 638-639. Between 1950 and 1974, the 1950
NBCWA was amended on occasion, and new NBCWA's were
adopted in 1968 and 1971. Except for increases in the
amount of royalty payments, however, the terms and structure of the 1950 W&R Fund remained essentially unchanged.
A 1951 amendment recognized the creation of the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association (BCOA), a multiemployer
bargaining association, which became the primary representative of coal operators in negotiations with the Union.
See App. (CAl) 647-648.
Under the 1950 W&R Fund, miners and their dependents
were not promised specific benefits. As the 1950 W&R
Fund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1955, explained:
"Under the legal and financial obligations ... imposed
[by the Trust Agreement], the Fund is operated on
a pay-as-you-go basis, maintaining a sound relation-

Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

ship between revenues and expenditures. Resolutions
adopted by the Trustees governing Fund Benefits-Pensions, Hospital and Medical Care, and Widows and Survivors Benefits-specifically provide that all these Benefits are subject to termination, revision, or amendment,
by the Trustees in their discretion at any time. No
vested interest in the Fund extends to any beneficiary."
Id., at 3-4, App. (CAI) 869-870.
See also Mine Workers Health and Retirement Funds v.
Robinson, 455 U. S. 562, 565, and n. 2 (1982). Thus, the
Fund operated using a fixed amount of royalties, with the
trustees having the authority to establish and adjust the
level of benefits provided so as to remain within the budgetary constraints.
Subsequent annual reports of the 1950 W&R Fund reiterated that benefits were subject to change. See, e. g., 1950
W&R Fund Annual Report for the Year Ending June 30,
1956 (1956 Annual Report), p. 30, App. (CAI) 929 ("Resolutions adopted by the Trustees governing Fund BenefitsPensions, Hospital and Medical Care, and Widows and Survivors Benefits-specifically provide that all these Benefits are
subject to termination, revision, or amendment, by the
Trustees in their discretion at any time"); 1950 W&R Fund
Annual Report for the Year Ending June 30, 1958, pp. 20-21,
App. (CAl) 955-956 ("Trustee regulations governing Benefits specifically provide that all Benefits which have been authorized are subject to termination, suspension, revision, or
amendment by the Trustees in their discretion at any time.
Each beneficiary is officially notified of this governing provision at the time his Benefit is authorized").' Thus, although

persons involved in the coal industry may have made occasional statements intimating that the 1950 W&R Fund promised lifetime health benefits, see App. (CAl) 1899, 1971-1972,
it is clear that the 1950 W&R Fund did not, by its terms,
guarantee lifetime health benefits for retirees and their dependents. In fact, as to widows of miners, the 1950 W&R
Fund expressly limited health benefits to the time period
during which widows would also receive death benefits.
See, e. g., Robinson, supra, at 565-566; 1956 Annual Report
14, App. (CAl) 913.
Between 1950 and 1974, the trustees often exercised their
prerogative to alter the level of benefits according to the
Fund's budget. In 1960, for instance, "[t]he Trustees of the
Fund, recognizing their legal and fiscal obligation to soundly
administer the Trust Fund, took action prior to the close
of the fiscal year, to curtail the excess of expenditures over
income," by "limit[ing] or terminat[ing] eligibility for [certain] Trust Fund Benefits." 1960 Annual Report 2, App.
(CAl) 1011. Similar concerns prompted the trustees to reduce monthly pension benefits by 25% at one point, and to
limit the range of medical and pension benefits available to
miners employed by operators who did not pay the required
royalties. See 1961 Annual Report 2, 11-12, App. (CAl)
1044, 1053-1054; 1963 Annual Report 13, 16, App. (CAl)
1121, 1124.
Reductions in benefits were not always acceptable to the
miners, and some wildcat strikes erupted in the 1960's. See
Secretary of Labor's Advisory Commission on United Mine
Workers of America Retiree Health Benefits, Coal Commission Report 22-23 (1990) (Coal Comm'n Report), App. (CAI)

1352-1353. Nonetheless, the 1950 W&R Fund continued to
provide benefits on a "pay-as-you-go" basis, with the level of
benefits fully subject to revision, until the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C.
ยง 1001 et seq., introduced specific funding and vesting requirements for pension plans. To comply with ERISA, the
UMWA and the BCOA entered into a new agreement, the
1974 NBCWA, which created four trusts, funded by royalties
on coal production and premiums based on hours worked by
miners, to replace the 1950 W&R Fund. See Robinson,
supra, at 566. Two of the new trusts, the UMWA 1950 Benefit Plan and Trust (1950 Benefit Plan) and the UMWA 1974
Benefit Plan and Trust (1974 Benefit Plan), provided nonpension benefits, including medical benefits. Miners who retired before January 1, 1976, and their dependents were covered by the 1950 Benefit Plan, while active miners and those
who retired after 1975 were covered by the 1974 Benefit
Plan.
The 1974 NBCWA thus was the first agreement between
the UMWA and the BCOA to expressly reference health
benefits for retirees; prior agreements did not specifically
mention retirees, and the scope of their benefits was left to
the discretion of fund trustees. The 1974 NBCWA explained that it was amending previous medical benefits to
provide a Health Services card for retired miners until their
death, and to their widows until their death or remarriage.
1974 NBCWA 99, 105 (Summary of Principal Provisions,
UMWA Health and Retirement Benefits), App. (CAl) 755,
758. Despite the expanded benefits, the 1974 NBCWA did
not alter the employers' obligation to contribute only a fixed
amount of royalties, nor did it extend employers' liability beyond the life of the agreement. See id., Art. XX, ยง (d), App.
(CAl) 749.
As a result of the broadened coverage under the 1974
NBCWA, the number of eligible benefit recipients jumped
dramatically. See 1977 Annual Report of the UMWA Wel-

"The 1974 agreement was the first NBCWA to mention retiree health benefits. As part of a substantial
liberalization of benefits and eligibility under both the
pension and health plans, the 1974 contract provided
lifetime health benefits for retirees, disabled mine workers, and spouses, and extended the benefits to surviving
spouses .... ." House Committee on Ways and Means,

Benefits, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (Comm. Print 1993)

The increase in benefits, combined with various other
circumstances-such as a decline in the amount of coal
produced, the retirement of a generation of miners, and rapid
escalation of health care costs-quickly resulted in financial
problems for the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans. In response,
the next NBCWA, executed in 1978, assigned responsibility
to signatory employers for the health care of their own active
and retired employees. See 1978 NBCWA, Art. XX, ยง (c)(3),
App. (CA1) 778. The 1974 Benefit Plan remained in effect,
but only to cover retirees whose former employers were no
longer in business.
To ensure the Benefit Plans' solvency, the 1978 NBCWA
included a "guarantee' clause obligating signatories to make
sufficient contributions to maintain benefits during that
agreement, and "evergreen" clauses were incorporated into
the Benefit Plans so that signatories would be required to
contribute as long as they remained in the coal business, regardless of whether they signed a subsequent agreement.
See id., ยง (h), App. (CA1) 787-788; House Report 5. As a
result, the coal operators' liability to the Benefit Plans
shifted from a defined contribution obligation, under which
employers were responsible only for a predetermined

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CoNNoR, J.

amount of royalties, to a form of defined benefit obligation,
under which employers were to fund specific benefits.
Despite the 1978 changes, the Benefit Plans continued to
suffer financially as costs increased and employers who had
signed the 1978 NBCWA withdrew from the agreement,
either to continue in business with nonunion employees or to
exit the coal business altogether. As more and more coal
operators abandoned the Benefit Plans, the remaining signatories were forced to absorb the increasing cost of covering
retirees left behind by exiting employers. A spiral soon developed, with the rising cost of participation leading more
employers to withdraw from the Benefit Plans, resulting in
more onerous obligations for those that remained. In 1988,
the UMWA and BCOA attempted to relieve the situation by
imposing withdrawal liability on NBCWA signatories who
seceded from the Benefit Plans. See 1988 NBCWA, Art.
XX, ยงยง (i) and (j), App. (CA) 805, 828-829. Even so, by
1990, the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans had incurred a deficit
of about $110 million, and obligations to beneficiaries were
continuing to surpass revenues. See House Report 9; Coal
Comm'n Report 43-44, App. (CA) 1373-1874.
B
In response to unrest among miners, such as the lengthy
strike that followed Pittston Coal Company's refusal to sign
the 1988 NBCWA, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole announced the creation of the Advisory Commission on United
Mine Workers of America Retiree Health Benefits (Coal
Commission or Commission). The Coal Commission was
charged with "recommend[ing] a solution for ensuring that
orphan retirees in the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Trusts will continue to receive promised medical care." Coal Comm'n Report 2, App. (CAl) 1333. The Commission explained that
"[h]ealth care benefits are an emotional subject in the coal
industry, not only because coal miners have been promised

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

and guaranteed health care benefits for life, but also because
coal miners in their labor contracts have traded lower pensions over the years for better health care benefits." Coal
Comm'n Report, Executive Summary vii, App. (CAI) 1324.
The Commission agreed that "a statutory obligation to contribute to the plans should be imposed on current and former
signatories to the [NBCWA]," but disagreed about "whether
the entire [coal] industry should contribute to the resolution
of the problem of orphan retirees." Id., at vii-viii, App.
(CAl) 1324-1325. Therefore, the Commission proposed two
alternative funding plans for Congress' consideration.
First, the Commission recommended that Congress establish a fund financed by an industrywide fee to provide health
care to orphan retirees at the level of benefits they were
entitled to receive at that fund's inception. To cover the
cost of medical benefits for retirees from signatories to the
1978 or subsequent NBCWA's who remained in the coal business, the Commission proposed the creation of another fund
financed by the retirees' most recent employers. Id., at 61,
App. (CAI) 1390. The Commission also recommended that
Congress codify the "evergreen" obligation of the 1978 and
subsequent NBCWA's. Id., at 63, App. (CAl) 1392.
As an alternative to imposing industrywide liability, the
Commission suggested that Congress spread the cost of retirees' health benefits across "a broadened base of current
and past signatories to the contracts," apparently referring
to the 1978 and subsequent NBCWA's. See id., at 58, 65,
App. (CAl) 1387, 1394. Not all Commission members
agreed, however, that it would be fair to assign such a burden to signatories of the 1978 agreement. Four Commissioners explained that "[i]ssues of elemental fairness are involved" in imposing obligations on "respectable operators
who made decisions in the past to move to different locales,
invest in different technology, or pursue their business with
or without respect to union presence." Id., at 85, App.
(CAI) 1414 (statement of Commissioners Michael J. Mahoney,

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

Carl J.Schramm, Arlene Holen, Richard M. Holsten); see also
id., at 81-82, App. (CAI) 1410-1411 (statement of Commissioner Richard M. Holsten).
After the Coal Commission issued its report, Congress
considered several proposals to fund health benefits for
UMWA retirees. At a 1991 hearing, a Senate subcommittee
was advised that more than 120,000 retirees might not receive "the benefits they were promised." Coal Commission
Report on Health Benefits of Retired Coal Miners: Hearing
before the Subcommittee on Medicare and Long-Term Care
of the Senate Committee on Finance, 102d Cong., 1st Sess.,
45 (1991) (statement of BCOA Chairman Michael K. Reilly).
The Coal Commission's Chairman submitted a statement
urging that Congress' assistance was needed "to fulfill the
promises that began in the collective bargaining process
nearly 50 years ago ....

."

Id., at 306 (prepared statement

of W. J. Usery, Jr.). Some Senators expressed similar concerns that retired miners might not receive the benefits
promised to them. See id., at 16 (statement of Sen. Dave
Durenberger) (describing issue as involving "a whole bunch
of promises made to a whole lot of people back in the 1940s
and 1950s when the cost consequences of those problems
were totally unknown"); id., at 59 (prepared statement of
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch) (stating that "miners and their families
...

were led to believe by their own union leaders and the

companies for which they worked that they were guaranteed
lifetime [health] benefits").
In 1992, as part of a larger bill, both Houses passed legislation based on the Coal Commission's first proposal, which
required signatories to the 1978 or any subsequent NBCWA
to fund their own retirees' health care costs and provided for
orphan retirees' benefits through a tax on future coal production. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 102-461, pp. 268-295 (1992).
President Bush, however, vetoed the entire bill. See H. R.
Doe. No. 102-206, p. 1 (1992).

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

Congress responded by passing the Coal Act, a modified
version of the Coal Commission's alternative funding plan.
In the Act, Congress purported "to identify persons most
responsible for [1950 and 1974 Benefit Plan] liabilities in
order to stabilize plan funding and allow for the provision of
health care benefits to... retirees." ยง 19142(a)(2), 106 Stat.
3037, note following 26 U. S. C. ยง 9701; see also 138 Cong. Rec.
34001 (1992) (Conference Report on Coal Act) (explaining
that, under the Coal Act, "those companies which employed
the retirees in question, and thereby benefitted from their
services, will be assigned responsibility for providing the
health care benefits promised in their various collective bargaining agreements").
The Coal Act merged the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans into
a new multiemployer plan called the United Mine Workers
of America Combined Benefit Fund (Combined Fund). See
26 U. S. C. ยง8 9702(a)(1), (2).2 The Combined Fund provides
"substantially the same" health benefits to retirees and their
dependents that they were receiving under the 1950 and
1974 Benefit Plans. See 88 9703(b)(1), (f). It is financed by
annual premiums assessed against "signatory coal operators," i. e., coal operators that signed any NBCWA or any
other agreement requiring contributions to the 1950 or 1974
Benefit Plans. See 88 9701(b)(1), (3); ยง9701(c)(1). Any signatory operator who "conducts or derives revenue from any
business activity, whether or not in the coal industry," may
be liable for those premiums. ยงยง 9706(a), 9701(c)(7). Where
a signatory is no longer involved in any business activity,
premiums may be levied against "related person[s]," including successors in interest and businesses or corporations
under common control. 88 9706(a), 9701(c)(2)(A).
The Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner) calculates the premiums due from any signatory operator based

The Coal Act also established another fund, the 1992 UMWA Benefit
Plan, which is not at issue here. See 26 U. S. C. ยง 9712.

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)

Opinion of O'CoNNoR, J.

on the following formula, by which retirees are assigned to
particular operators:
"For purposes of this chapter, the Commissioner of
Social Security shall... assign each coal industry retiree
who is an eligible beneficiary to a signatory operator
which (or any related person with respect to which) remains in business in the following order:
"(1) First, to the signatory operator which"(A) was a signatory to the 1978 coal wage agreement
or any subsequent coal wage agreement, and
"(B) was the most recent signatory operator to employ the coal industry retiree in the coal industry for at
least 2 years.
"(2) Second, if the retiree is not assigned under paragraph (1), to the signatory operator which"(A) was a signatory to the 1978 coal wage agreement
or any subsequent coal wage agreement, and
"(B) was the most recent signatory operator to employ the coal industry retiree in the coal industry.
"(3) Third, if the retiree is not assigned under paragraph (1) or (2), to the signatory operator which employed the coal industry retiree in the coal industry for
a longer period of time than any other signatory operator prior to the effective date of the 1978 coal wage
agreement." ยง9706(a).
It is the application of the third prong of the allocation for3
mula, ยง 9706(a)(3), to Eastern that we review in this case.
3The Coal Act also provides for an allocation of liability for unassigned
beneficiaries. See 26 U. S. C. ยง 9704(d). That liability, however, has thus
far been covered through the transfer of funds from other sources. See
ยง 9705; 30 U. S. C. ยง1232(h). This case presents no question regarding the
assignment to Eastern of liability for any retirees other than its own

former employees.

A
Eastern was organized as a Massachusetts business trust
in 1929, under the name Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates.
Its current holdings include Boston Gas Company and a
barge operator. Therefore, although Eastern is no longer
involved in the coal industry, it is "in business" within the
meaning of the Coal Act. Until 1965, Eastern conducted extensive coal mining operations centered in West Virginia and
Pennsylvania. As a signatory to each NBCWA executed between 1947 and 1964, Eastern made contributions of over $60
million to the 1947 and 1950 W&R Funds. Brief for Petitioner 6.
In 1963, Eastern decided to transfer its coal-related operations to a subsidiary, Eastern Associated Coal Corp. (EACC).
The transfer was completed by the end of 1965, and was described in Eastern's federal income tax return as an agreement by EACC to assume all of Eastern's liabilities arising
out of coal mining and marketing operations in exchange for
Eastern's receipt of EACC's stock. EACC made similar
representations in Security and Exchange Commission filings, describing itself as the successor to Eastern's coal
business. See App. (CAl) 117-118. At that time, the 1950
W&R Fund had a positive balance of over $145 million.
1966 Annual Report 3, App. (CAl) 1207.
Eastern retained its stock interest in EACC through a
subsidiary corporation, Coal Properties Corp. (CPC), until
1987, and it received dividends of more than $100 million
from EACC during that period. See Brief for Petitioner 6,
n. 13. In 1987, Eastern sold its interest in CPC to respondent Peabody Holding Company, Inc. (Peabody). Under the
terms of the agreement effecting the transfer, Peabody, CPC,
and EACC assumed responsibility for payments to certain
benefit plans, including the "Benefit Plan for UMWA Represented Employees of EACC and Subs." App. 206a, 210a.

Opinion of

O'CONNOR, J.

As of June 30, 1987, the 1950 and 1974 Benefit Plans reported
surplus assets, totaling over $33 million. House Report 9.
B
Following enactment of the Coal Act, the Commissioner
assigned to Eastern the obligation for Combined Fund premiums respecting over 1,000 retired miners who had worked
for the company before 1966, based on Eastern's status
as the pre-1978 signatory operator for whom the miners
had worked for the longest period of time. See 26 U. S. C.
ยง9706(a). Eastern's premium for a 12-month period exceeded $5 million. See Brief for Petitioner 16.
Eastern responded by suing the Commissioner, as well as
the Combined Fund and its trustees, in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Eastern
asserted that the Coal Act, either on its face or as applied,
violates substantive due process and constitutes a taking of
its property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Eastern
also challenged the Commissioner's interpretation of the
Coal Act. The District Court granted summary judgment
for respondents on all claims, upholding both the Commissioner's interpretation of the Coal Act and the Act's constitutionality. Eastern Enterprisesv. Shalala,942 F. Supp. 684
(Mass. 1996).
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.
Eastern Enterprises v. Chater, 110 F. 3d 150 (1997). The
court rejected Eastern's challenge to the Commissioner's interpretation of the Coal Act. Addressing Eastern's substantive due process claim, the court described the Coal Act as
"entitled to the most deferential level of judicial scrutiny,"
explaining that, "[w]here, as here, a piece of legislation is
purely economic and does not abridge fundamental rights, a
challenger must show that the legislature acted in an arbitrary and irrational way." Id., at 155-156 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the court's view, the retroactive liability imposed by the Act was permissible "[a]s long as the

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Opinion of O'CoNNOR, J.
retroactive application.., is supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means," for "judgments
about the wisdom of such legislation remain within the exclusive province of the legislative and executive branches."
Id., at 156 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court
concluded that Congress' purpose in enacting the Coal Act
was legitimate and that Eastern's obligations under the Act
are rationally related to those objectives, because Eastern's
execution of pre-1974 NBCWA's contributed to miners' expectations of lifetime health benefits. Id., at 157. The
court rejected Eastern's argument that costs of retiree
health benefits should be borne by post-1974 coal operators,
reasoning that Eastern's proposal would require coal operators to fund health benefits for miners whom the operators
had never employed. Id., at 158, n. 5. The court also noted
the substantial dividends that Eastern had received from
EACC. Id., at 158.
The court analyzed Eastern's claim that the Coal Act effects an uncompensated taking under the three factors set
out in Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
475 U. S. 211, 225 (1986): "(1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant, (2) the extent to which the regulation interferes with the claimant's reasonable investmentbacked expectations, and (3) the nature of the governmental
action." 110 F. 3d, at 160. With respect to the Act's economic impact on Eastern, the court observed that the Act
"does not involve the total deprivation of an asset." Ibid.
The Act's terms, the court found, "reflec[t] a sufficient degree
of proportionality" because Eastern is assigned liability only
for miners "whom it employed for a relevant (and relatively
long) period of time," and then only if no post-1977 NBCWA
signatory (or related person) can be found. Ibid. The
court also rejected Eastern's contention that the Act unreasonably interferes with its investment-backed expectations,
explaining that the pattern of federal intervention in the coal
industry and Eastern's role in fostering an expectation of

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

lifetime health benefits meant that Eastern "had every reason to anticipate that it might be called upon to bear some
of the financial burden that this expectation engendered."
Id., at 161. Finally, in assessing the nature of the challenged governmental action, the court determined that the
Coal Act does not result in the physical invasion or permanent appropriation of Eastern's property, but merely "adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote
the common good." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The court also noted that the premiums are disbursed
to the privately operated Combined Fund, not to a government entity. For those reasons, the court concluded, "there
is no basis whatever for [Eastern's] claim that the [Coal Act]
transgresses the Takings Clause." Ibid.
Other Courts of Appeals have also upheld the Coal Act
against constitutional challenges. 4 In view of the importance of the issues raised in this case, we granted certiorari.
522 U. S.931 (1997).

We begin with a threshold jurisdictional question, raised
in the federal respondent's answer to Eastern's complaint:
Whether petitioner's takings claim was properly filed in Federal District Court rather than the United States Court of
Federal Claims. See App. (CAI) 40. Although the Commissioner no longer challenges the Court's adjudication of
this action, see Brief for Federal Respondent 38-39, n. 30, it
is appropriate that we clarify the basis of our jurisdiction
over petitioner's claims.

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of O'CoNNoR, J.

Under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. ยง 1491(a)(1), the Court of
Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction to render judgment
upon any claim against the United States for money damages
exceeding $10,000 that is "founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract
with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated
damages in cases not sounding in tort." Accordingly, a
claim for just compensation under the Takings Clause must
be brought to the Court of Federal Claims in the first instance, unless Congress has withdrawn the Tucker Act grant
of jurisdiction in the relevant statute. See, e. g., Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1016-1019 (1984).
In this case, however, Eastern does not seek compensation
from the Government. Instead, Eastern requests a declaratory judgment that the Coal Act violates the Constitution
and a corresponding injunction against the Commissioner's
enforcement of the Act as to Eastern. Such equitable relief
is arguably not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act. See United States v.
Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 216 (1983) (explaining that, in order
for a claim to be "cognizable under the Tucker Act," it "must
be one for money damages against the United States"); see
also, e. g., Bowen v. Massachusetts,487 U. S. 879, 905 (1988).
Some Courts of Appeals have accepted the view that the
Tucker Act does not apply to suits seeking only equitable
relief, see In re Chateaugay Corp., 53 F. 3d 478, 493 (CA2),
cert. denied sub nom. LTV Steel Co. v. Shalala, 516 U. S. 913
(1995); Southeast Kansas Community Action Program,Inc.
v. Secretary of Agriculture, 967 F. 2d 1452, 1455-1456 (CA10
1992), while others have concluded that a claim for equitable
relief under the Takings Clause is hypothetical, and therefore not within the district courts' jurisdiction, until compensation has been sought and refused in the Court of Federal
Claims, see Bay View, Inc. v. Ahtna, Inc., 105 F. 3d 1281,

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

1286 (CA9 1997); Rose Acre Farms, Inc. v. Madigan, 956
F. 2d 670, 673-674 (CA7), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 820 (1992).
On the one hand, this Court's precedent can be read to
support the latter conclusion that regardless of the nature of
relief sought, the availability of a Tucker Act remedy renders
premature any takings claim in federal district court. See
Preseaultv. ICC, 494 U. S. 1, 11 (1990); see also Monsanto,
supra, at 1016. On the other hand, in a case such as this
one, it cannot be said that monetary relief against the Government is an available remedy. See Brief for Federal Respondent 38-39, n. 30. The payments mandated by the Coal
Act, although calculated by a Government agency, are paid
to the privately operated Combined Fund. Congress could
not have contemplated that the Treasury would compensate
coal operators for their liability under the Act, for "[e]very
dollar paid pursuant to a statute would be presumed to generate a dollar of Tucker Act compensation." In re Chateaugay Corp., 53 F. 3d, at 493. Accordingly, the "presumption
of Tucker Act availability must be reversed where the challenged statute, rather than burdening real or physical property, requires a direct transfer of funds" mandated by the
Government. Ibid. In that situation, a claim for compensation "would entail an utterly pointless set of activities."
Student Loan Marketing Assn. v. Riley, 104 F. 3d 397, 401
(CADC), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 913 (1997). Instead, as we
explained in Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental
Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 71, n. 15 (1978), the Declaratory Judgment Act "allows individuals threatened with a
taking to seek a declaration of the constitutionality of the
disputed governmental action before potentially uncompensable damages are sustained."
Moreover, in situations analogous to this case, we have
assumed the lack of a compensatory remedy and have
granted equitable relief for Takings Clause violations without discussing the applicability of the Tucker Act. See, e. g.,
Babbitt v. Youpee, 519 U. S. 234, 243-245 (1997); Hodel v. Ir-

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

Opinion of O'CoNNoR, J.

ving, 481 U. S. 704, 716-718 (1987).

Without addressing the

basis of this Court's jurisdiction, we have also upheld similar
statutory schemes against Takings Clause challenges. See
Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. ConstructionLaborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602, 641647 (1993); Connolly, 475 U. S., at 221-228. "While we are
not bound by previous exercises of jurisdiction in cases in
which our power to act was not questioned but was passed
sub silentio, neither should we disregard the implications of
an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper" in
previous cases. Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S.
294, 307 (1962) (citations omitted). Based on the nature of
the taking alleged in this case, we conclude that the declaratory judgment and injunction sought by petitioner constitute
an appropriate remedy under the circumstances, and that it
is within the district courts' power to award such equitable
relief.
IV
A
The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides:
"[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." The aim of the Clause is to prevent
the government "from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne
by the public as a whole." Armstrong v. United States, 364
U. S. 40, 49 (1960).
This case does not present the "classi[c] taking" in which
the government directly appropriates private property for
its own use. See United States v. Security Industrial
Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 78 (1982). Although takings problems
are more commonly presented when "the interference with
property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, than when interference arises from some public
program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life
to promote the common good," Penn Central Transp. Co. v.
New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978) (citation omitted),

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CoNNOR,

J.

economic regulation such as the Coal Act may nonetheless
effect a taking, see Security IndustrialBank, supra, at 78.
See also Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798) (opinion of
Chase, J.) ("It is against all reason and justice" to presume
that the legislature has been entrusted with the power to
enact "a law that takes property from A. and gives it to B").
By operation of the Act, Eastern is "permanently deprived
of those assets necessary to satisfy its statutory obligation,
not to the Government, but to [the Combined Fund]," Connolly, supra, at 222, and "a strong public desire to improve
the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the
desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying
for the change," PennsylvaniaCoal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S.
393, 416 (1922).
Of course, a party challenging governmental action as an
unconstitutional taking bears a substantial burden. See
United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 60 (1989). Government regulation often "curtails some potential for the use
or economic exploitation of private property," Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51, 65 (1979), and "not every destruction or
injury to property by governmental action has been held to
be a 'taking' in the constitutional sense," Armstrong, supra,
at 48. In light of that understanding, the process for evaluating a regulation's constitutionality involves an examination
of the "justice and fairness" of the governmental action.
See Andrus, 444 U. S., at 65. That inquiry, by its nature,
does not lend itself to any set formula, see ibid., and the
determination whether "'justice and fairness' require that
economic injuries caused by public action [must] be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons," is essentially ad hoc
and fact intensive, Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S.
164, 175 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have
identified several factors, however, that have particular significance: "[T]he economic impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of O'CoNNoR, J.

the character of the governmental action."
Connolly, supra,at 224-225.

Ibid.; see also

B
Our analysis in this case is informed by previous decisions
considering the constitutionality of somewhat similar legislative schemes. In Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428
U. S. 1 (1976), we had occasion to review provisions of the
Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, 30 U. S. C. ยง 901 et seq.,
which required coal operators to compensate certain miners
and their survivors for death or disability due to black lung
disease caused by employment in coal mines. Coal operators challenged the provisions of the Act relating to miners
who were no longer employed in the industry, arguing that
those provisions violated substantive due process by imposing "an unexpected liability for past, completed acts
that were legally proper and, at least in part, unknown to be
dangerous at the time." 428 U. S., at 15.
In rejecting the operators' challenge, we explained that
"legislative Acts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life come to the Court with a presumption of constitutionality, and . .. the burden is on one complaining
of a due process violation to establish that the legislature
has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way." Ibid. We
observed that stricter limits may apply to Congress' authority when legislation operates in a retroactive manner, id., at
16-17, but concluded that the assignment of liability for black
lung benefits was "justified as a rational measure to spread
the costs of the employees' disabilities to those who have
profited from the fruits of their labor," id., at 18.
Several years later, we confronted a due process challenge to the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act
of 1980 (MPPAA), 94 Stat. 1208. See PensionBenefit Guaranty Corporationv. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717 (1984).
The MPPAA was enacted to supplement ERISA, 29 U. S. C.
ยง 1001 et seq., which established the Pension Benefit Guar-

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CoNNoR, J.

anty Corporation (PBGC) to administer an insurance program for vested pension benefits. For a temporary period,
the PBGC had discretionary authority to pay benefits upon
the termination of multiemployer pension plans, after which
insurance coverage would become mandatory. If the PBGC
exercised that authority, employers who had contributed to
the plan during the five years before its termination faced
liability for an amount proportional to their share of contributions to the plan during that period. See 467 U. S., at
720-721.
Despite Congress' effort to insure multiemployer plan benefits through ERISA, many multiemployer plans were in a
precarious financial position as the date for mandatory coverage approached. After a series of hearings and debates,
Congress passed the MPPAA, which imposed a payment
obligation upon any employer withdrawing from a multiemployer pension plan, the amount of which depended on the
employer's share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits.
The MPPAA applied retroactively to withdrawals within
the five months preceding the statute's enactment. Id., at
721-725.
In Gray, an employer that had participated in a multiemployer pension plan brought a due process challenge to the
statutory liability stemming from its withdrawal from the
plan four months before the MPPAA was enacted. Relying
on our decision in Turner Elkhorn, we rejected the employer's claim. It was rational, we determined, for Congress to
impose retroactive liability "to prevent employers from taking advantage of a lengthy legislative process [by] withdrawing while Congress debated necessary revisions in the statute." 467 U. S., at 731. In addition, we explained, "as the
[MPPAA] progressed through the legislative process, Congress advanced the effective date chosen so that it would
encompass only that retroactive time period that Congress
believed would be necessary to accomplish its purposes."
Ibid. Accordingly, we concluded that the MPPAA exem-

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

plified the "customary congressional practice" of enacting
"retroactive statutes confined to short and limited periods
required by the practicalities of producing national legislation." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
This Court again considered the constitutionality of the
MPPAA in Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 475 U. S. 211 (1986), which presented the question
whether the MPPAA's withdrawal liability provisions effected an unconstitutional taking. The action was brought
by trustees of a multiemployer pension plan that, under collective bargaining agreements, received contributions from
employers on the basis of the hours worked by their employees. We agreed that the liability imposed by the MPPAA
constituted a permanent deprivation of assets, but we rejected the notion that "such a statutory liability to a private
party always constitutes an uncompensated taking prohibited by the Fifth Amendment." Id., at 222. "In the course
of regulating commercial and other human affairs," we explained, "Congress routinely creates burdens for some that
directly benefit others." Id., at 223. Consistent with our
decisions in Gray and Turner Elkhorn, we reasoned that
legislation is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise
settled expectations.
Moreover, given our holding in Gray that the MPPAA did
not violate due process, we concluded that "it would be surprising indeed to discover" that the statute effected a taking.
475 U. S., at 223. Although the employers in Connolly had
contractual agreements expressly limiting their contributions to the multiemployer plan, we observed that "ec]ontracts, however express, cannot fetter the constitutional authority of Congress" and "the fact that legislation disregards
or destroys existing contractual rights does not always
transform the regulation into an illegal taking." Id., at 223224 (internal quotation marks omitted). Focusing on the
three factors of "particular significance"-the economic impact of the regulation, the extent to which the regulation

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

interferes with investment-backed expectations, and the
character of the governmental action-we determined that
the MPPAA did not violate the Takings Clause. Id., at 225.
The governmental action at issue in Connolly was not
a physical invasion of employers' assets; rather, it "safeguard[ed] the participants in multiemployer pension plans by
requiring a withdrawing employer to fund its share of the
plan obligations incurred during its association with the
plan." Ibid. In addition, although the amounts assessed
under the MPPAA were substantial, we found it important
that "[t]he assessment of withdrawal liability [was] not made
in a vacuum,... but directly depend[ed] on the relationship
between the employer and the plan to which it had made
contributions." Ibid. Further, "a significant number of
provisions in the Act . . .moderate[d] and mitigate[d] the

economic impact of an individual employer's liability." Id.,
at 225-226. Accordingly, we found "nothing to show that
the withdrawal liability actually imposed on an employer
w[ould] always be out of proportion to its experience with
the plan." Id., at 226. Nor did the MPPAA interfere with
employers' reasonable investment-backed expectations, for,
by the time of the MPPAA's enactment, "[p]rudent employers.., had more than sufficient notice not only that pension
plans were currently regulated, but also that withdrawal itself might trigger additional financial obligations." Id., at
227. For those reasons, we determined that "fairness and
justice" did not require anyone other than the withdrawing
employers and the remaining parties to the pension agreements to bear the burden of funding employees' vested benefits. Ibid.
We once more faced challenges to the MPPAA under the
Due Process and Takings Clauses in Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust
for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602 (1993). In that case, the
employer focused on the fact that its contractual commitment
to the multiemployer plan did not impose withdrawal liabil-

ity. We first rejected the employer's substantive due process challenge based on our decisions in Gray and Turner
Elkhorn, notwithstanding the employer's argument that the
MPPAA imposed upon it a higher liability than its contract
contemplated. 508 U. S., at 636-641. The claim under the
Takings Clause, meanwhile, was resolved by Connolly. We
explained that, as in that case, the Government had not occupied or destroyed the employer's property. 508 U. S., at
643-644. As to the severity of the MPPAA's impact, we
concluded that the employer had not shown that its withdrawal liability was "'out of proportion to its experience
with the plan'" Id., at 645 (quoting Connolly, supra, at
226). Turning to the employer's reasonable investmentbacked expectations, we repeated our observation in Connolly that "pension plans had long been subject to federal
regulation." 508 U. S., at 645. Moreover, although the employer's liability under the MPPAA exceeded ERISA's original cap on withdrawal liability, we found that there was "no
reasonable basis to expect that [ERISA's] legislative ceiling
would never be lifted." Id., at 646. In sum, as in Connolly,
the employer "voluntarily negotiated and maintained a pension plan which was determined to be within the strictures
of ERISA," making the burden the MPPAA imposed upon
it neither unfair nor unjust. 508 U. S., at 646-647 (internal
quotation marks omitted).
Our opinions in Turner Elkhorn, Connolly, and Concrete
Pipe make clear that Congress has considerable leeway to
fashion economic legislation, including the power to affect
contractual commitments between private parties. Congress also may impose retroactive liability to some degree,
particularly where it is "confined to short and limited periods
required by the practicalities of producing national legislation." Gray, 467 U. S., at 731 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Our decisions, however, have left open the possibility that legislation might be unconstitutional if it imposes severe retroactive liability on a limited class of parties

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

that could not have anticipated the liability, and the extent
of that liability is substantially disproportionate to the parties' experience.
C
We believe that the Coal Act's allocation scheme, as applied to Eastern, presents such a case. We reach that conclusion by applying the three factors that traditionally have
informed our regulatory takings analysis. Although JUSTICE KENNEDY and JUSTICE BREYER would pursue a different course in evaluating the constitutionality of the Coal Act,
they acknowledge that this Court's opinions in Connolly and
Concrete Pipe indicate that the regulatory takings framework is germane to legislation of this sort. See post, at 545546 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in
part); post, at 555-556 (BREYER, J., dissenting).
As to the first factor relevant in assessing whether a regulatory taking has occurred, economic impact, there is no
doubt that the Coal Act has forced a considerable financial
burden upon Eastern. The parties estimate that Eastern's
cumulative payments under the Act will be on the order of
$50 to $100 million. See Brief for Petitioner 2 ($100 million);
Brief for Respondents UMWA Combined Benefit Fund et al.
46 ($51 million). Eastern's liability is thus substantial, and
the company is clearly deprived of the amounts it must pay
the Combined Fund. See Connolly, 475 U. S., at 222. The
fact that the Federal Government has not specified the assets
that Eastern must use to satisfy its obligation does not negate that impact. It is clear that the Act requires Eastern
to turn over a dollar amount established by the Commissioner under a timetable set by the Act, with the threat of
severe penalty if Eastern fails to comply. See 26 U. S. C.
ยงยง 9704(a) and (b) (directing liable operators to pay annual
premiums as computed by the Commissioner); ยง9707 (imposing, with limited exceptions, a penalty of $100 per day per
eligible beneficiary if payment is not made in accordance
with ยง 9704).

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of O'CoNNoR, J.

That liability is not, of course, a permanent physical occupation of Eastern's property of the kind that we have viewed
as a per se taking. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 441 (1982). But our decisions
upholding the MPPAA suggest that an employer's statutory
liability for multiemployer plan benefits should reflect some
"proportion[ality] to its experience with the plan." Concrete
Pipe, 508 U. S., at 645 (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also Connolly, supra, at 225 (noting that employer's liability under the MPPAA "directly depend[ed] on the relationship between the employer and the plan to which it had
made contributions"). In Concrete Pipe and Connolly, the
employers had "voluntarily negotiated and maintained a pension plan which was determined to be within the strictures
of ERISA," Concrete Pipe, supra, at 646 (internal quotation marks omitted); Connolly, supra, at 227, and consequently, the statutory liability was linked to the employers'
conduct.
Here, however, while Eastern contributed to the 1947 and
1950 W&R Funds, it ceased its coal mining operations in
1965 and neither participated in negotiations nor agreed to
make contributions in connection with the Benefit Plans
under the 1974, 1978, or subsequent NBCWA's. It is the
latter agreements that first suggest an industry commitment
to the funding of lifetime health benefits for both retirees
and their family members. Although EACC continued mining coal until 1987 as a subsidiary of Eastern, Eastern's liability under the Act bears no relationship to its ownership of
EACC; the Act assigns Eastern responsibility for benefits
relating to miners that Eastern itself, not EACC, employed,
while EACC would be assigned the responsibility for any
miners that it had employed. See 26 U.S. C. ยง 9706(a).
Thus, the Act does not purport, as JUSTICE BREYER suggests, post, at 566, to assign liability to Eastern based on the
"'last man out' problem" that developed after benefits were
significantly expanded in 1974. During the years in which

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of

O'CONNOR,

J.

Eastern employed miners, retirement and health benefits
were far less extensive than under the 1974 NBCWA, were
unvested, and were fully subject to alteration or termination.
Before 1974, as JUSTICE BREYER notes, Eastern could not

have contemplated liability for the provision of lifetime benefits to the widows of deceased miners, see post, at 562-563,
a beneficiary class that is likely to be substantial. See General Accounting Office, Human Resources Division Report,
Retired Coal Miners' Health Benefits 7 (July 1992) (reporting
to Congress that widows composed 45% of beneficiaries in
Jan. 1992); see also Brief for Petitioner 45, n. 54 (citing affidavit that 75% of the beneficiaries assigned to Eastern are
spouses or dependent children of miners). Although Eastern at one time employed the Combined Fund beneficiaries
that it has been assigned under the Coal Act, the correlation
between Eastern and its liability to the Combined Fund is
tenuous, and the amount assessed against Eastern resembles
a calculation "made in a vacuum." See Connolty, supra,at
225. The company's obligations under the Act depend solely
on its roster of employees some 30 to 50 years before the
statute's enactment, without any regard to responsibilities
that Eastern accepted under any benefit plan the company
itself adopted.
It is true that Eastern may be able to seek indemnification
from EACC or Peabody. But although the Act preserves
Eastern's right to pursue indemnification, see 26 U. S. C.
ยง 9706(f)(6), it does not confer any right of reimbursement.
See also Conference Report on Coal Act, 138 Cong. Rec., at
34004 (explaining that the Coal Act allows parties to "enter
into private litigation to enforce ... contracts for indemnifi-

cation," but "does not create new private rights of action").
Moreover, the possibility of indemnification does not alter
the fact that Eastern has been assessed over $5 million in
Combined Fund premiums and that its liability under the
Coal Act will continue for many years. To the extent that
Eastern may have entered into contractual arrangements to

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

insure itself against liabilities arising out of its former coal
operations, that indemnity is neither enhanced nor supplanted by the Coal Act and does not affect the availability
of the declaratory relief Eastern seeks.
We are also not persuaded by respondents' argument that
the Coal Act "moderate[s] and mitigate[s] the economic impact" upon Eastern. See Connolly, 475 U. S., at 225-226.
Although Eastern is not assigned the premiums for former
employees who later worked for companies that signed the
1978 NBCWA, see 26 U. S. C. ยงยง 9706(a)(1), (2), Eastern had
no control over the activities of its former employees subsequent to its departure from the coal industry in 1965. By
contrast, the provisions of the MPPAA that we identified as
potentially moderating the employer's liability in Connolly
were generally within the employer's control. See 475 U. S.,
at 226, n. 8. The mere fact that Eastern is not forced to bear
the burden of lifetime benefits respecting all of its former
employees does not mean that the company's liability for
some of those employees is not a significant economic burden.
For similar reasons, the Coal Act substantially interferes
with Eastern's reasonable investment-backed expectations.
The Act's beneficiary allocation scheme reaches back 30 to
50 years to impose liability against Eastern based on the
company's activities between 1946 and 1965. Thus, even
though the Act mandates only the payment of future health
benefits, it nonetheless "attaches new legal consequences to
[an employment relationship] completed before its enactment." Landgrafv. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270
(1994).
Retroactivity is generally disfavored in the law, Bowen v.
Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988), in accordance with "fundamental notions of justice" that have
been recognized throughout history, Kaiser Aluminum &
Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 855 (1990)
(ScAIA, J., concurring).

lish common law, as ancient as the law itself, that a statute,
even of its omnipotent parliament, is not to have a retrospective effect"); H. Broom, Legal Maxims 24 (8th ed. 1911)
("Retrospective laws are, as a rule, of questionable policy,
and contrary to the general principle that legislation by
which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought to
deal with future acts, and ought not to change the character
of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the then
existing law"). In his Commentaries on the Constitution,
Justice Story reasoned: "Retrospective laws are, indeed, generally unjust; and, as has been forcibly said, neither accord
with sound legislation nor with the fundamental principles
of the social compact." 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the
Constitution ยง 1398 (5th ed. 1891). A similar principle
abounds in the laws of other nations. See, e. g., Gustavson
Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, 66
D. L. R. 3d 449, 462 (Can. 1975) (discussing rule that statutes
should not be construed in a manner that would impair existing property rights); The French Civil Code, Preliminary
Title, Art. 2, p. 2 ("Legislation only provides for the future;
it has no retroactive effect") (J. Crabb transl., rev. ed. 1995);
Aarnio, Statutory Interpretation in Finland 151, in Interpreting Statutes: A Comparative Study (D. MacCormick &
R. Summers eds. 1991) (discussing prohibition against retroactive legislation). "Retroactive legislation," we have explained, "presents problems of unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective legislation, because it
can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset
settled transactions." GeneralMotors Corp.v. Romein, 503
U. S. 181, 191 (1992).
Our Constitution expresses concern with retroactive laws
through several of its provisions, including the Ex Post Facto
and Takings Clauses. Landgraf,supra, at 266. In Calder
v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), this Court held that the EX Post
Facto Clause is directed at the retroactivity of penal legislation, while suggesting that the Takings Clause provides

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of O'CoNNoR, J.

a similar safeguard against retrospective legislation concerning property rights. See id., at 394 (opinion of Chase,
J.) ("The restraint against making any ex post facto laws
was not considered, by the framers of the constitution, as
extending to prohibit the depriving a citizen even of a vested
right to property; or the provision, 'that private property
should not be taken for public use, without just compensation,' was unnecessary"). -In Security IndustrialBank, we
considered a Takings Clause challenge to a Bankruptcy Code
provision permitting debtors to avoid certain liens, possibly
including those predating the statute's enactment. We expressed "substantial doubt whether the retroactive destruction of the appellees' liens . . .comport[ed] with the Fifth
Amendment," and therefore construed the statute as applying only to lien interests vesting after the legislation took
effect. 459 U. S., at 78-79. Similar concerns led this Court
to strike down a bankruptcy provision as an unconstitutional
taking where it affected substantive rights acquired before
the provision was adopted. Louisville Joint Stock Land
Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S.555, 601-602 (1935).
Like those provisions, the Coal Act operates retroactively,
divesting Eastern of property long after the company believed its liabilities under the 1950 W&R Fund to have been
settled. And the extent of Eastern's retroactive liability is
substantial and particularly far reaching. Even in areas in
which retroactivity is generally tolerated, such as tax legislation, some limits have been suggested. See, e. g., United
States v. Darusmont, 449 U. S.292, 296-297 (1981) (per curiam) (noting Congress' practice of confining retroactive application of tax provisions to "short and limited periods").
The distance into the past that the Act reaches back to
impose a liability on Eastern and the magnitude of that
liability raise substantial questions of fairness. See Connolly, supra, at 229 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (questioning
constitutionality of imposing liability on "employers for unfunded benefits that accrued in the past under a pension plan

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

whether or not the employers had agreed to ensure that benefits would be fully funded"); see also Landgraf,511 U. S.,
at 265 ("Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that
individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law
is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted").
Respondents and their amici curiae assert that the extent of retroactive liability is justified because there was
an implicit, industrywide agreement during the time that
Eastern was involved in the coal industry to fund lifetime
health benefits for qualifying miners and their dependents.
That contention, however, is not supported by the pre-1974
NBCWA's. No contrary conclusion can be drawn from the
few isolated statements of individuals involved in the coal
industry, see, e. g., Brief for Respondents Peabody Holding
Company, Inc., et al. 8-10, or from statements of Members
of Congress while considering legislative responses to the
issue of funding retiree benefits. Moreover, even though
retirees received medical benefits before 1974, and perhaps
developed a corresponding expectation that those benefits
would continue, the Coal Act imposes liability respecting
a much broader range of beneficiaries. In any event, the
question is not whether miners had an expectation of lifetime
benefits, but whether Eastern should bear the cost of those
benefits as to miners it employed before 1966.
Eastern only participated in the 1947 and 1950 W&R
Funds, which operated on a pay-as-you-go basis, and under
which the degree of benefits and the classes of beneficiaries
were subject to the trustees' discretion. Not until 1974,
when ERISA forced revisions to the 1950 W&R Fund, could
lifetime medical benefits under the multiemployer agreement
have been viewed as promised. Eastern was no longer in
the industry when the evergreen and guarantee clauses of
the 1978 and subsequent NBCWA's shifted the 1950 and 1974
Benefit Plans from a defined contribution framework to a
guarantee of defined benefits, at least for the life of the

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of O'CoNNoR, J.

agreements. See Connolly, 475 U. S., at 230-231 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (imposition of liability "without regard
to the extent of a particular employer's actual responsibility
for [a benefit] plan's promise of fixed benefits to employees"
could raise serious concerns under the Takings Clause).
Thus, unlike the pension withdrawal liability upheld in Concrete Pipe and Connolly, the Coal Act's scheme for allocation
of Combined Fund premiums is not calibrated either to Eastern's past actions or to any agreement-implicit or otherwise-by the company. Nor would the pattern of the Federal Government's involvement in the coal industry have
given Eastern "sufficient notice" that lifetime health benefits
might be guaranteed to retirees several decades later. See
Connolly, supra, at 227.
Eastern's liability also differs from coal operators' responsibility for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act of
1972. That legislation merely imposed "liability for the
effects of disabilities bred in the past [that] is justified as a
rational measure to spread the costs of the employees' disabilities to those who have profited from the fruits of their
labor." Turner Elkhorn, 428 U. S., at 18. Likewise, Eastern might be responsible for employment-related health
problems of all former employees whether or not the cost
was foreseen at the time of employment, see id., at 16, but
there is no such connection here. There is no doubt that
many coal miners sacrificed their health on behalf of this
country's industrial development, and we do not dispute that
some members of the industry promised lifetime medical
benefits to miners and their dependents during the 1970's.
Nor do we, as JUSTICE STEVENS suggests, post, at 553, question Congress' policy decision that the miners are entitled to
relief. But the Constitution does not permit a solution to
the problem of funding miners' benefits that imposes such
a disproportionate and severely retroactive burden upon
Eastern.

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

Finally, the nature of the governmental action in this case
is quite unusual. That Congress sought a legislative remedy
for what it perceived to be a grave problem in the funding
of retired coal miners' health benefits is understandable;
complex problems of that sort typically call for a legislative
solution. When, however, that solution singles out certain
employers to bear a burden that is substantial in amount,
based on the employers' conduct far in the past, and unrelated to any commitment that the employers made or to
any injury they caused, the governmental action implicates
fundamental principles of fairness underlying the Takings
Clause. Eastern cannot be forced to bear the expense of
lifetime health benefits for miners based on its activities decades before those benefits were promised. Accordingly, in
the specific circumstances of this case, we conclude that the
Coal Act's application to Eastern effects an unconstitutional
taking.
D
Eastern also claims that the manner in which the Coal Act
imposes liability upon it violates substantive due process.
To succeed, Eastern would be required to establish that its
liability under the Act is "arbitrary and irrational." Turner
Elkhorn, supra,at 15. Our analysis of legislation under the
Takings and Due Process Clauses is correlated to some extent, see Connolly, supra, at 223, and there is a question
whether the Coal Act violates due process in light of the
Act's severely retroactive impact. At the same time, this
Court has expressed concerns about using the Due Process
Clause to invalidate economic legislation. See Fergusonv.
Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 731 (1963) (noting "our abandonment
of the use of the 'vague contours' of the Due Process Clause
to nullify laws which a majority of the Court believ[e] to be
economically unwise" (footnote omitted)); see also Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S.483, 488 (1955)
("The day is gone when this Court uses the Due Process
Clause ...to strike down ... laws, regulatory of business

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL

and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of
thought"). Because we have determined that the third tier
of the Coal Act's allocation scheme violates the Takings
Clause as applied to Eastern, we need not address Eastern's
due process claim. Nor do we consider the first two tiers of
the Act's allocation scheme, 26 U. S. C. ยงยง 9706(a)(1) and (2),
as the liability that has been imposed on Eastern arises only
under the third tier. Cf. Printz v. United States, 521 U. S.
898, 934-935 (1997).
V
In enacting the Coal Act, Congress was responding to
a serious problem with the funding of health benefits for
retired coal miners. While we do not question Congress'
power to address that problem, the solution it crafted improperly places a severe, disproportionate, and extremely
retroactive burden on Eastern. Accordingly, we conclude
that the Coal Act's allocation of liability to Eastern violates
the Takings Clause, and that 26 U. S. C. ยง 9706(a)(3) should
be enjoined as applied to Eastern. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S opinion correctly concludes that the

Coal Act's imposition of retroactive liability on petitioner violates the Takings Clause. I write separately to emphasize
that the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, Art. I,
ยง 9, cl. 3, even more clearly reflects the principle that "[r]etrospective laws are, indeed, generally unjust." 2 J. Story,
Commentaries on the Constitution ยง 1398, p. 272 (5th ed.
1891). Since Calder v. Bull, 3 Dali. 386 (1798), howevef,
this Court has considered the Ex Post Facto Clause to apply
only in the criminal context. I have never been convinced
of the soundness of this limitation, which in Calder was

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

principally justified because a contrary interpretation would
render the Takings Clause unnecessary. See id., at 394
(opinion of Chase, J.). In an appropriate case, therefore,
I would be willing to reconsider Calder and its progeny to
determine whether a retroactive civil law that passes muster under our current Takings Clause jurisprudence is nonetheless unconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause.
Today's case, however, does present an unconstitutional
taking, and I join JUSTICE O'CoNNoR's well-reasoned opin-

ion in full.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in the judgment and dis-

senting in part.
The plurality's careful assessment of the history and purpose of the statute in question demonstrates the necessity to
hold it arbitrary and beyond the legitimate authority of the
Government to enact. In my view, which is in full accord
with many of the plurality's conclusions, the relevant portions of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992
(Coal Act), 26 U. S. C. ยง 9701 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. II),
must be invalidated as contrary to essential due process
principles, without regard to the Takings Clause of the Fifth
Amendment. I concur in the judgment holding the Coal Act
unconstitutional but disagree with the plurality's Takings
Clause analysis, which, it is submitted, is incorrect and quite
unnecessary for decision of the case. I must record my respectful dissent on this issue.
I
The final Clause of the Fifth Amendment states:
"[N]or shall private property be taken for public use,
without just compensation." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5.
The provision is known as the Takings Clause. The concept
of a taking under the Clause has become a term of art, and
my discussion begins here.

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

Our cases do not support the plurality's conclusion that the
Coal Act takes property. The Coal Act imposes a staggering financial burden on the petitioner, Eastern Enterprises,
but it regulates the former mine owner without regard to
property. It does not operate upon or alter an identified
property interest, and it is not applicable to or measured
by a property interest. The Coal Act does not appropriate,
transfer, or encumber an estate in land (e. g., a lien on a particular piece of property), a valuable interest in an intangible
(e.
g., intellectual property), or even a bank account or accrued interest. The law simply imposes an obligation to
perform an act, the payment of benefits. The statute is indifferent as to how the regulated entity elects to comply or
the property it uses to do so. To the extent it affects property interests, it does so in a manner similar to many laws;
but until today, none were thought to constitute takings. To
call this sort of governmental action a taking as a matter of
constitutional interpretation is both imprecise and, with all
due respect, unwise.
As the role of Government expanded, our experience
taught that a strict line between a taking and a regulation
is difficult to discern or to maintain. This led the Court in
PennsylvaniaCoal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393 (1922), to try
to span the two concepts when specific property was subjected to what the owner alleged to be excessive regulation.
"The general rule at least is, that while property may be
regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it
will be recognized as a taking." Id., at 415. The quoted
sentence is, of course, the genesis of the so-called regulatory
takings doctrine. See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1014 (1992) ('Prior to Justice
Holmes's exposition in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, it
was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only
a 'direct appropriation' of property or the functional equivalent of a 'practical ouster of [the owner's] possession'" (citations omitted)). Without denigrating the importance the

Opinion of KENNEDY, J.
regulatory takings concept has assumed in our law, it is fair
to say it has proved difficult to explain in theory and to implement in practice. Cases attempting to decide when a
regulation becomes a taking are among the most litigated
and perplexing in current law. See Penn Central Transp.
Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 123 (1978) ("The question
of what constitutes a 'taking' for purposes of the Fifth
Amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable difficulty"); Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164, 175
(1979) (the regulatory taking question requires an "essentially ad hoc, factual inquir[y]").
Until today, however, one constant limitation has been that
in all of the cases where the regulatory taking analysis has
been employed, a specific property right or interest has been
at stake. After the decision in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.
Mahon, supra,we confronted cases where specific and identified properties or property rights were alleged to come
within the regulatory takings prohibition: air rights for
high-rise buildings, Penn Central, supra; zoning on parcels
of real property, e. g., MacDonald,Sommer & Fratesv. Yolo
County, 477 U. S. 340 (1986); Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447
U. S. 255 (1980); trade secrets, Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.,
467 U. S. 986 (1984); right of access to property, e. g., PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74 (1980); Kaiser
Aetna, supra; right to affix on structures, Loretto v. TeleprompterManhattanCATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419 (1982); right
to transfer property by devise or intestacy, e. g., Hodel v.
Irving, 481 U. S. 704 (1987); creation of an easement, Dolan
v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374 (1994); Nollan v. California
Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987); right to build or improve, Lucas, supra; liens on real property, Armstrong v.
United States, 364 U. S. 40 (1960); right to mine coal, Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470
(1987); right to sell personal property, Andrus v. Allard, 444

Opinion of

KENNEDY, J.

v. Central Eureka Mining Co., 357 U. S. 155 (1958). The
regulations in the cited cases were challenged as being so
excessive as to destroy, or take, a specific property interest.
The plurality's opinion disregards this requirement and, by
removing this constant characteristic from takings analysis,
would expand an already difficult and uncertain rule to a
vast category of cases not deemed, in our law, to implicate
the Takings Clause.
The difficulties in determining whether there is a taking
or a regulation even where a property right or interest is
identified ought to counsel against extending the regulatory
takings doctrine to cases lacking this specificity. The existence of at least this outer boundary for application of the
regulatory takings rule provides some necessary predictability for governmental entities. Our definition of a taking,
after all, is binding on all of the States as well as the Federal
Government. The plurality opinion would throw one of the
most difficult and litigated areas of the law into confusion,
subjecting States and municipalities to the potential of new
and unforeseen claims in vast amounts. The existing category of cases involving specific property interests ought not
to be obliterated by extending regulatory takings analysis
to the amorphous class of cases embraced by the plurality's
opinion today.
True, the burden imposed by the Coal Act may be just as
great if the Government had appropriated one of Eastern's
plants, but the mechanism by which the Government injures
Eastern is so unlike the act of taking specific property that
it is incongruous to call the Coal Act a taking, even as that
concept has been expanded by the regulatory takings principle. In the terminology of our regulatory takings analysis,
the character of the governmental action renders the Coal
Act not a taking of property. While the usual taking occurs
when the government. physically acquires property for itself,
e. g., Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897),
our regulatory takings analysis recognizes a taking may
occur when property is not appropriated by the government

J.

or is transferred to other private parties. See, e. g., United
States v. Security IndustrialBank, 459 U. S. 70, 78 (1982)
("[O]ur cases show that takings analysis is not necessarily
limited to outright acquisitions by the government for itself"); Loretto, supra (transfer of physical space from landlords to cable companies).
As the range of governmental conduct subjected to takings analysis has expanded, however, we have been careful
not to lose sight of the importance of identifying the property allegedly taken, lest all governmental action be subjected to examination under the constitutional prohibition
against taking without just compensation, with the attendant
potential for money damages. We have asked how the challenged governmental action is implemented with particular
emphasis on the extent to which a specific property right is
affected. See id., at 432 (physical invasion "is a government
action of such a unique character that it is a taking without
regard to other factors"); Hodel, supra, at 715-716 (declaring a law, which otherwise would not be a taking because of
its insignificant economic impact, a taking because the character of the governmental action destroyed the right to pass
property to one's heirs, a right which "has been part of the
Anglo-American legal system since feudal times"); Penn
Central, supra, at 124 ("A 'taking' may more readily be
found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common
good" (citation omitted)). The Coal Act neither targets a
specific property interest nor depends upon any particular
property for the operation of its statutory mechanisms. The
liability imposed on Eastern no doubt will reduce its net
worth and its total value, but this can be said of any law
which has an adverse economic effect.
The circumstance that the statute does not take money for
the Government but instead makes it payable to third persons is not a factor I rely upon to show the lack of a taking.

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

While there are instances where the Government's selfenrichment may make it all the more evident a taking has
occurred, e.g., Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies,Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155 (1980); United States v. Causby, 328 U. S.
256 (1946), the Government ought not to have the capacity
to give itself immunity from a takings claim by the device of
requiring the transfer of property from one private owner
directly to another. Cf. Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229 (1984). At the same time, the Government's imposition of an obligation between private parties,
or destruction of an existing obligation, must relate to a specific property interest to implicate the Takings Clause. For
example, in United States v. Security Industrial Bank, we
confronted a statute which was alleged to destroy an existing
creditor's lien in certain chattels to the benefit of the debtor.
We acknowledged that, given the nature of the property
interest at stake, which resembled a contractual obligation,
the takings challenge "fits but awkwardly into the analytic
framework" of our regulatory takings analysis. 459 U. S.,
at 75. We decided the analysis could apply because the
property interest was a "traditional property interes[t],"
though in the end the statute was found inapplicable to the
lien at issue. In so holding, we relied on Louisville Joint
Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S. 555 (1935), which invalidated the Frazier-Lemke Farm-Mortgage Act, because it
interfered with mortgages on farms and thus worked a
"'taking of substantive rights in specific property acquired
by the Bank prior to"' the Act. 459 U. S., at 77 (quoting
Radford, supra, at 590, 601). Unlike the statutes at issue
in Security Industrial Bank and Radford, the Coal Act
does not affect an obligation relating to a specific property
interest.
If the plurality is adopting its novel and expansive concept
of a taking in order to avoid making a normative judgment
about the Coal Act, it fails in the attempt; for it must make
the normative judgment in all events. See, e. g., ante, at 537
("IT]he governmental action implicates fundamental princi-

Opinion of

ples of fairness"). The imprecision of our regulatory takings doctrine does open the door to normative considerations
about the wisdom of government decisions. See, e. g., Agins
v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S., at 260 (zoning constitutes a
taking if it does not "substantially advance legitimate state
interests"). This sort of analysis is in uneasy tension with
our basic understanding of the Takings Clause, which has not
been understood to be a substantive or absolute limit on the
government's power to act. The Clause operates as a conditional limitation, permitting the government to do what
it wants so long as it pays the charge. The Clause presupposes what the government intends to do is otherwise
constitutional:
"As its language indicates, and as the Court has frequently noted, [the Takings Clause] does not prohibit the
taking of private property, but instead places a condition
on the exercise of that power. This basic understanding of the Amendment makes clear that it is designed
not to limit the governmental interference with property rights per se, but rather to secure compensation
in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking." First English Evangelical Lutheran
Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S.
304, 314-315 (1987) (emphasis and citations omitted).
Given that the constitutionality of the Coal Act appears to
turn on the legitimacy of Congress' judgment rather than on
the availability of compensation, see ante, at 521 ("[I]n a case
such as this one, it cannot be said that monetary relief
against the Government is an available remedy"), the more
appropriate constitutional analysis arises under general due
process principles rather than under the Takings Clause.
It should be acknowledged that there are passages in some
of our cases on the imposition of retroactive liability for an
employer's withdrawal from a pension plan which might give
some support to the plurality's discussion of the Takings
Clause. See Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpo-

ration,475 U. S. 211, 223 (1986); Concrete Pipe & Products
of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for
Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602, 641 (1993). In Connolly, the
Court said the definition of a taking was not controlled by
"any set formula," but was dependent "on ad hoc, factual
inquiries into the circumstances of each particular case."
475 U. S., at 224. The Court then applied the three-factor
regulatory takings analysis set forth in Penn Central,which
examines the economic impact of the regulation, the extent
to which it interferes with investment-backed expectations,
and the character of the governmental action. 475 U. S., at
225. This analysis did not result in a finding of a taking.
The Court, moreover, prefaced the entire takings discussion
with the admonition it would be surprising to discover that
there had been a taking in the instance where a due process
attack had been rejected. See id., at 223; see also Concrete
Pipe, supra, at 641 ("Given that [the] due process arguments
are unavailing, 'it would be surprising indeed to discover'
the challenged statute nonetheless violating the Takings
Clause") (quoting Connolly, supra, at 223). At best, Connolly is equivocal on the question whether we should apply
the regulatory takings analysis to instances like the one now
before us. My reading of Connolly, and Concrete Pipe, is
that we should proceed first to general due process principles, reserving takings analysis for cases where the governmental action is otherwise permissible. See Connolly,
supra, at 224 ("[H]ere, the United States has taken nothing
for its own use, and only has nullified a contractual provision
limiting liability by imposing an additional obligation that is
otherwise within the power of Congress to impose"); see also
Duke Power Co. v. CarolinaEnvironmental Study Group,
Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 94, n. 39 (1978) (upholding on due process
grounds the Price-Anderson Act, 42 U. S. C. ยง 2210 (1970 ed.,
Supp. V), which placed a cap on civil liability for nuclear accidents, but declining to address petitioner's request that the

ed.)). These authorities confirm my view that the case is
controlled not by the Takings Clause but by well-settled due
process principles respecting retroactive laws.
Given my view that the takings analysis is inapplicable
in this case, it is unnecessary to comment upon the plurality's effort to resolve a jurisdictional question despite little
briefing by the parties on a point which has divided the
Courts of Appeals.
II

When the constitutionality of the Coal Act is tested under
the Due Process Clause, it must be invalidated. Accepted
principles forbidding retroactive legislation of this type are
sufficient to dispose of the case.
Although we have been hesitant to subject economic legislation to due process scrutiny as a general matter, the Court
has given careful consideration to due process challenges to
legislation with retroactive effects. As today's plurality
opinion notes, for centuries our law has harbored a singular
distrust of retroactive statutes. Ante, at 532-533. In the
words of Chancellor Kent: "A retroactive statute would partake in its character of the mischiefs of an ex post facto law
...;and in every other case relating to contracts or property,

it would be against every sound principle." 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *455; see also ibid. (rule against
retroactive application of statutes to be "founded not only in
English law, but on the principles of general jurisprudence").
Justice Story reached a similar conclusion: "Retrospective
laws are, indeed, generally unjust; and, as has been forcibly
said, neither accord with sound legislation nor with the fundamental principles of the social compact." 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution ยง 1398 (5th ed. 1891).
The Court's due process jurisprudence reflects this distrust. For example, in Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining
Co., 428 U. S. 1, 15 (1976), the Court held due process requires an inquiry into whether in enacting the retroactive
law the legislature acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.
Even though prospective economic legislation carries with it

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

the presumption of constitutionality, "[i]t does not follow...
that what Congress can legislate prospectively it can legislate retrospectively. The retrospective aspects of [economic] legislation, as well as the prospective aspects, must
meet the test of due process, and the justifications for the
latter may not suffice for the former." Id., at 16-17. We
have repeated this formulation in numerous recent decisions
and given serious consideration to retroactivity-based due
process challenges, all without questioning the validity of the
underlying due process principle. United States v. Carlton,
512 U. S. 26, 31 (1994); Concrete Pipe, supra, at 636-641;
General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U. S. 181, 191 (1992);
United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 64 (1989); United
States v. Hemme, 476 U. S. 558, 567-572 (1986); PensionBenefit Guaranty Corporationv. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S.
717, 729-730 (1984). These decisions treat due process challenges based on the retroactive character of the statutes in
question as serious and meritorious, thus confirming the vitality of our legal traditions disfavor of retroactive economic
legislation. Indeed, it is no accident that the primary retroactivity precedents upon which today's plurality opinion relies in its takings analysis were grounded in due process.
Ante, at 524-528 (citing Turner Elkhorn, R. A. Gray, and
Concrete Pipe).
These cases reflect our recognition that retroactive lawmaking is a particular concern for the courts because of the
legislative "tempt[ation] to use retroactive legislation as a
means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals." Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 266
(1994); see also Hochman, The Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Retroactive Legislation, 73 Harv. L. Rev.
692, 693 (1960) (a retroactive law "may be passed with an
exact knowledge of who will benefit from it"). If retroactive
laws change the legal consequences of transactions long
closed, the change can destroy the reasonable certainty and
security which are the very objects of property ownership.

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
Opinion of KENNEDY, J.

As a consequence, due process protection for property must
be understood to incorporate our settled tradition against
retroactive laws of great severity. Groups targeted by retroactive laws, were they to be denied all protection, would
have a justified fear that a government once formed to protect expectations now can destroy them. Both stability of
investment and confidence in the constitutional system, then,
are secured by due process restrictions against severe retroactive legislation.
The case before us represents one of the rare instances
where the Legislature has exceeded the limits imposed by
due process. The plurality opinion demonstrates in convincing fashion that the remedy created by the Coal Act bears
no legitimate relation to the interest which the Government
asserts in support of the statute. Ante, at 529-537. In our
tradition, the degree of retroactive effect is a significant
determinant in the constitutionality of a statute. United
States v. Carlton,supra, at 32; United States v. Darusmont,
449 U. S. 292, 296-297 (1981) (per curiam); see also Dunbar
v. Boston & P. R. Corp., 181 Mass. 383, 386, 63 N. E. 916, 917
(1902) (Holmes, C. J.). As the plurality explains today, in
creating liability for events which occurred 35 years ago the
Coal Act has a retroactive effect of unprecedented scope.
Ante, at 532.
While we have upheld the imposition of liability on former
employers based on past employment relationships, the statutes at issue were remedial, designed to impose an "actual,
measurable cost of [the employer's] business" which the employer had been able to avoid in the past. Turner Elkhorn,
supra, at 19; accord, Concrete Pipe, 508 U. S., at 638; Romein, supra, at 191-192; R. A. Gray, supra, at 733-734. As
Chancellor Kent noted: "Such statutes have been held valid
when clearly just and reasonable, and conducive to the general welfare, even though they might operate in a degree
upon existing rights." 1 Kent, Commentaries on American
Law, at *455-*456. The Coal Act, however, does not serve

this purpose. Eastern was once in the coal business and
employed many of the beneficiaries, but it was not responsible for their expectation of lifetime health benefits or for the
perilous financial condition of the 1950 and 1974 plans which
put the benefits in jeopardy. As the plurality opinion discusses in detail, the expectation was created by promises and
agreements made long after Eastern left the coal business.
Eastern was not responsible for the resulting chaos in the
funding mechanism caused by other coal companies leaving the framework of the National Bituminous Coal Wage
Agreement. Ante, at 535-536. This case is far outside the
bounds of retroactivity permissible under our law.
Finding a due process violation in this case is consistent
with the principle that "under the deferential standard of
review applied in substantive due process challenges to economic legislation there is no need for mathematical precision
in the fit between justification and means." Concrete Pipe,
supra, at 639 (citing Turner Elkhorn, 428 U. S., at 19).
Statutes may be invalidated on due process grounds only
under the most egregious of circumstances. This case represents one of the rare instances in which even such a permissive standard has been violated.
Application of the Coal Act to Eastern would violate the
proper bounds of settled due process principles, and I concur
in the plurality's conclusion that the judgment of the Court
of Appeals must be reversed.
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE
GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.

between the coal operators and the miners that enabled coal
production to continue during the 1950's and 1960's depended
more on the value of a handshake than the fine print in written documents. During that period there was an implicit
understanding on both sides of the bargaining table that
the operators would provide the miners with lifetime health
benefits. It was this understanding that kept the mines in
operation and enabled Eastern to earfi handsome profits
before it transferred its coal business to a wholly owned subsidiary in 1965.
My understanding of this critical fact is shared by the
judges of the Seventh Circuit,2 the Sixth Circuit,3 and the
2

"[E]very [National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (NBCWA)] signatory company shared some responsibility in creating a legitimate expectation among miners of lifetime health benefits. Imposing liability on
companies that have profited from the retirees' labor was found rational
in [Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 18 (1976)] ....
Every signatory company, including plaintiffs, participated in the creation
and development of a multi-employer health benefit program that provided
lifetime health benefits for retirees for almost fifty years. Congress could
rationally have concluded that such participation led to a legitimate expectation of lifetime health benefits that should be honored under the Coal
Act. Again, in this light, it would have been arbitrary to draw the line
anywhere other than at all NBCWA signatories. Plaintiffs respond that
it was not until the 1974 NBCWA and the 'guarantee' and 'evergreen'
clauses of the 1978 NBCWA that miners were promised lifetime health
benefits-promises that plaintiffs never made. Therefore, they argue, it
was irrational for Congress to require contributions from pre-1974 signatories. But the fact that plaintiffs never contractually agreed to provide lifetime benefits does not rebut the rationality of finding that they
contributed to the expectation of lifetime benefits. The Coal Commission
and Congress found that the promise of lifetime benefits dates back to the
1940s, even though it is not explicit in any NBCWA until 1974." Davon,
Inc. v. Shalala,75 F. 3d 1114, 1124-1125 (1996) (footnote omitted).

,"Blue Diamond further argues that it was irrational for Congress to
impose Coal Act liability upon Blue Diamond because Blue Diamond did
not promise its employees that they would receive lifetime health benefits. It is undisputed that the NBCWAs did not contain an explicit promise of lifetime benefits until the 1974 NBCWA agreement. However, several federal courts have found that [United Mine Workers of America
(UMWA)] members had a legitimate expectation of lifetime benefits be-

First Circuit.4 It is the same understanding that motivated

the members of the Coal Commission to conclude that the
operators who had employed the "orphaned miners" should
share responsibility for their health benefits. 5 And it is
fore the 1974 NBCWA, based on the various funds' more than 30-year
history of continuous payment of benefits and the statements of coal industry officials. Davon, 75 F. 3d at 1124-25 ('Congress could rationally
have concluded that such participation [in the NBCWA benefit funds] led
to a legitimate expectation of lifetime benefits.'). See also Templeton
Coal [Co., Inc. v. Shalala,882 F. Supp. 799, 825 (SD Ind. 1995)] (describing
basis for lifetime benefits expectation). Congress certainly had a rational
basis for concluding that all NBCWA signatories and 'me-too' operators
who agreed to be bound by the NBCWAs, including Blue Diamond, contributed toward the legitimate expectations of the UMWA members." In
re Blue Diamond Coal Co., 79 F. 3d 516, 522 (1996).
4"[I]t is not accurate to claim that only those [signatory operators] which
executed NBCWAs in or after 1974 created a legitimate expectation of
lifetime health benefits for miners. Congress and the Coal Commission
both reviewed the historical evidence and concluded that pre-1974 signatories had made an implicit commitment to furnish such benefits....
"Of course, the appellant is correct in insisting that the commitment
distilled by Congress from the historical data was not made explicit in the
text of those NBCWAs which were written before 1974. But Eastern
reads too much into that omission. To be sure, such an implied commitment might not be enforceable in a civil suit ex contractu-but this is a
constitutional challenge, not a breach of contract case. For purposes of
due process review, Congress' determination that a commitment was made
need not rest upon a legally enforceable promise; it is enough that Congress' conclusions as to the existence and effects of such a commitment
are rational." Eastern Enterprises v. Chater, 110 F. 3d 150, 157 (1997).
5,,The Commission firmly believes that the retired miners are entitled
to the health care benefits that were promised and guaranteed them and
that such commitments must be honored....
"Retired coal miners have legitimate expectations of health care benefits for life; that was the promise they received during their working lives
and that is how they planned their retirement years. That commitment
should be honored. But today those expectations and commitments are
in jeopardy." Secretary of Labor's Advisory Commission on United Mine

the same understanding that led legislators in both political parties to conclude that the Coal Act of 1992 represented
a fair solution to a difficult problem.
Given the critical importance of the reasonable expectations of both the miners and the operators during the period
before their implicit agreement was made explicit in 1974,
I am unable to agree with the plurality's conclusion that the
retroactive application of the 1992 Act is an unconstitutional
"taking" of Eastern's property. Rather, it seems to me that
the plurality and JUSTICE KENNEDY have substituted their
judgment about what is fair for the better informed judg-6
ment of the members of the Coal Commission and Congress.

Accordingly, I conclude that, whether the provision in
question is analyzed under the Takings Clause or the Due
Process Clause, Eastern has not carried its burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality accorded to
an Act of Congress, by demonstrating that the provision is
unsupported by the reasonable expectations of the parties
in interest.
JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE
SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.

We must decide whether it is fundamentally unfair for
Congress to require Eastern Enterprises to pay the health
care costs of retired miners who worked for Eastern before
1965, when Eastern stopped mining coal. For many years
Eastern benefited from the labor of those miners. Eastern
helped to create conditions that led the miners to expect continued health care benefits for themselves and their families

It may well be true that the majority might have been able to fashion

a wiser solution to a difficult problem. Nevertheless, as Chief Justice
Hughes observed in a dissent joined by Justices Brandeis, Stone, and Cardozo: "The power committed to Congress to govern interstate commerce
does not require that its government should be wise, much less that it
should be perfect." RailroadRetirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S.
330, 391-392 (1935).

after they retired. And Eastern, until 1987, continued to
draw sizable profits from the coal industry through a wholly
owned subsidiary. For these reasons, I believe that Congress did not act unreasonably or otherwise unjustly in imposing these health care costs upon Eastern. Consequently,
in my view, the statute before us is constitutional.
I
As a preliminary matter, I agree with JUSTICE KENNEDY,
ante, at 539-547 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part), that the plurality views this case through
the wrong legal lens. The Constitution's Takings Clause
does not apply. That Clause refers to the taking of "private
property . . . for public use, without just compensation."

U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. As this language suggests, at the
heart of the Clause lies a concern, not with preventing arbitrary or unfair government action, but with providing compensation for legitimate government action that takes "private property" to serve the "public" good.
The "private property" upon which the Clause traditionally has focused is a specific interest in physical or intellectual property. See, e. g., Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New
York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978); Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986 (1984). It requires compensation
when the government takes that property for a public purpose. See Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374, 384 (1994)
(Clause requires payment so that government cannot
"'forc[e] some people alone to bear public burdens which, in
all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a
whole"' (quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40,
49 (1960))). This case involves not an interest in physical or
intellectual property, but an ordinary liability to pay money,
and not to the Government, but to third parties.
This Court has not directly held that the Takings Clause
applies to the creation of this kind of liability. The Court
has made clear that not only seizures through eminent do-

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
BREYER,

J., dissenting

main but also certain "takings" through regulation can require "compensation" under the Clause. See, e. g., Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415 (1922) ("[W]hile
property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation
goes too far it will be recognized as a taking"); Lucas v.
South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003 (1992)
(land-use regulation that deprives owner of all economically
beneficial use of property constitutes taking); Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987) (public easement across property may constitute taking). But these
precedents concern the taking of interests in physical
property.
The Court has also made clear that the Clause can apply
to monetary interest generated from a fund into which a private individual has paid money. Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155 (1980). But the monetary interest at issue there arose out of the operation of a
specific, separately identifiable fund of money. And the government took that interest for itself. Here there is no specific fund of money; there is only a general liability; and that
liability runs not to the Government, but to third parties.
Cf., e. g., Armstrong, supra, at 48 (Government destroyed
liens "for its own advantage"); Connolly v. Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation,475 U. S. 211, 225 (1986) (no taking
where "the Government does not physically invade or permanently appropriate any... assets for its own use" (emphasis added)).
The Court in two cases has arguably acted as if the Takings Clause might apply to the creation of a general liability.
Connolly, supra; Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v.
ConstructionLaborersPension Trustfor Southern Cal., 508
U. S. 602 (1993). But in the first of those cases, the Court
said that the Takings Clause had not been violated, in part
because "the Government does not physically invade or permanently appropriate any.., assets for its own use." Connolly, 475 U. S., at 225. It also rejected the position that a

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
BREYER, J.,

dissenting

taking occurs "whenever legislation requires one person to
use his or her assets for the benefit of another." Id., at 223.
The second case basically followed the analysis of the first
case. Concrete Pipe, 508 U. S., at 641-647. And both cases
rejected the claim of a Takings Clause violation. Id., at 646647; Connolly, supra, at 227-228.
The dearth of Takings Clause authority is not surprising,
for application of the Takings Clause here bristles with conceptual difficulties. If the Clause applies when the government simply orders A to pay B, why does it not apply when
the government simply orders A to pay the government, i. e.,
when it assesses a tax? Cf. In re Leckie Smokeless Coal
Co., 99 F. 3d 573, 583 (CA4 1996) (characterizing "reachback"
liability payments as a "tax"), cert. denied, 520 U. S. 1118
(1997); In re Chateaugay Corp., 53 F. 3d 478, 498 (CA2 1995)
(same), cert. denied sub nom. LTV Steel Co., Inc. v. Shalala,
516 U. S. 913 (1995). Would that Clause apply to some or to
all statutes and rules that "routinely creat[e] burdens for
some that directly benefit others"? Connolly, supra, at 223.
Regardless, could a court apply the same kind of Takings
Clause analysis when violation means the law's invalidation,
rather than simply the payment of "compensation?" See
First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.
County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 315 (1987) ("[The Takings Clause] is designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights per se, but rather to secure
compensationin the event of otherwise proper interference
amounting to a taking").
We need not face these difficulties, however, for there is
no need to torture the Takings Clause to fit this case. The
question involved-the potential unfairness of retroactive
liability-finds a natural home in the Due Process Clause,
a Fifth Amendment neighbor. That Clause says that no
person shall be "deprive[d] ... of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, ยง 1. It
safeguards citizens from arbitrary or irrational legislation.

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
BREYER, J., dissenting

And the Due Process Clause can offer protection against legislation that is unfairly retroactive at least as readily as the
Takings Clause might, for as courts have sometimes suggested, a law that is fundamentally unfair because of its retroactivity is a law that is basically arbitrary. See, e. g., Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporationv. R. A. Gray & Co., 467
U. S. 717, 728-730 (1984); id., at 780 ("[R]etroactive aspects
of legislation [imposing withdrawal liability on employers
participating in pension plan] must meet the test of due process"); id., at 733 ("[R]etrospective civil legislation may offend
due process if it is particularly harsh and oppressive" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Usery v. Turner Elkhorn
Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 17 (1976). Cf. United States v. Carlton, 512 U. S.26, 30 (1994) (retroactive tax provision); Welch
v. Henry, 305 U. S. 134, 147 (1938) (same); National Labor
Relations Board v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 195 F. 2d 141, 149,
151 (CA9 1952) (invalidating administrative order as "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion," see 5 U. S. C.
ยง706(2)(A), because "[t]he inequity of... retroactive policy
making... is the sort of thing our system of law abhors").
Nor does application of the Due Process Clause automatically trigger the Takings Clause, just because the word
"property" appears in both. That word appears in the midst
of different phrases with somewhat different objectives,
thereby permitting differences in the way in which the term
is interpreted. Compare, e. g., United States v. Martin
Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S.564 (1977) ("person" includes corporations for purposes of Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy
Clause), with Doe v. United States, 487 U. S.201, 206 (1988)
("person" does not include a corporation for purposes of Fifth
Amendment Self-Incrimination Clause).
Insofar as the plurality avoids reliance upon the Due Process Clause for fear of resurrecting Lochner v. New York,
198 U. S. 45 (1905), and related doctrines of "substantive
due process," that fear is misplaced. Cf. id., at 75-76
(Holmes, J., dissenting)- Lincoln Fed. Union v. Northwestern

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
BREYER, J., dissenting

Iron & Metal Co., 335 U. S. 525, 535 (1949) (repudiating the
"Allgeyer-Lochner-Adair-Coppageconstitutional doctrine").
As the plurality points out, ante, at 533, an unfair retroactive
assessment of liability upsets settled expectations, and it
thereby undermines a basic objective of law itself. See, e. g.,
2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution ยง 1398 (5th ed.
1891) (criticizing retrospective laws as failing to "accord with
...the fundamental principles of the social compact"); ibid.
(retroactive legislation invalid "upon principles derived from
the general nature of free governments, and the necessary
limitations created thereby"); General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U. S. 181, 191 (1992) ("Retroactive legislation...
can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations"); Fletcherv.
Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 143 (1810) (Johnson, J., concurring) (suggesting that retroactive legislation is invalid because it offends principles of natural law).
To find that the Due Process Clause protects against this
kind of fundamental unfairness-that it protects against an
unfair allocation of public burdens through this kind of specially arbitrary retroactive means-is to read the Clause in
light of a basic purpose: the fair application of law, which
purpose hearkens back to the Magna Carta. It is not to
resurrect long-discredited substantive notions of "freedom of
contract." See, e. g., Fergusonv. Skrupa, 372 U. S.726, 729732 (1963).
Thus, like the plurality I would inquire if the law before us
is fundamentally unfair or unjust. Ante, at 534-537. But I
would ask this question because, like JUsTIcE KENNEDY, I
believe that, if so, the Coal Act would "deprive" Eastern of
"property, without due process of law." U. S. Const., Amdt.
14, ยง1.
II
The substantive question before us is whether or not it
is fundamentally unfair to require Eastern to make future
payments for health care costs of retired miners and their
families, on the basis of Eastern's past association with these

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
BREYER, J.,

dissenting

miners. Congress might have assessed all those who
now use coal, or the taxpayer, in order to pay for those retired coal miners' health benefits. But Congress, instead,
imposed this liability on Eastern. Coal Industry Retiree
Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Coal Act), 26 U. S. C. ยงยง 97019722 (1994 ed. and Supp. II). The "fairness" question is,
why Eastern?
The answer cannot lie in a contractual promise to pay, for
Eastern made no such contractual promise. Nor did Eastern participate in any benefit plan that made such a contractual promise, prior to its departure from the coal industry in
1965. But, as JUSTICE STEVENS points out, this case is not
a civil law suit for breach of contract. It is a constitutional
challenge to Congress' decision to assess a new future liability on the basis of an old employment relationship. Ante, at
551-552, n. 3 (dissenting opinion). Unless it is fundamentally unfair and unjust, in terms of Eastern's reasonable reliance and settled expectations, to impose that liability, the
Coal Act's "reachback" provision meets that challenge. See
Connolly, 475 U.S., at 227; Concrete Pipe, 508 U.S., at
645-646.
I believe several features of this case demonstrate that the
relationship between Eastern and the payments demanded
by the Coal Act is special enough to pass the Constitution's
fundamental fairness test. That is, even though Eastern
left the coal industry in 1965, the historical circumstances,
taken together, prevent Eastern from showing that the Coal
Act's "reachback" liability provision so frustrates Eastern's
reasonable settled expectations as to impose an unconstitutional liability. Cf. Penn Central,438 U. S., at 127-128.
For one thing, the liability that the statute imposes upon
Eastern extends only to miners whom Eastern itself employed. See 26 U. S. C. ยง 9706(a) (imposing "reachback" liability only where no presently operating coal firm which ratified 1978 or subsequent bargaining agreement ever employed
the retiree, and Eastern employed the retiree longer than

EASTERN ENTERPRISES v. APFEL
BREYER, J.,

dissenting

any other "reachback" firm). They are miners whose labor
benefited Eastern when they were younger and healthier.
Insofar as working conditions created a risk of future health
problems for those miners, Eastern created those conditions.
And these factors help to distinguish Eastern from others
with respect to a later obligation to pay the health care costs
that inevitably arise in old age. See, e. g., 138 Cong. Rec.
34001 (1992) (Conference Report on Coal Act) (Coal Act
assigns liability to "those companies which employed the
retirees . .. and thereby benefitted from their services");

Hearings on Provisions Relating to the Health Benefits of
Retired Coal Miners before the House Committee on Ways
and Means, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 8-9, 32 (1993) (hereinafter
Hearings on Health Benefits); House Committee on Ways and
Means, Financing UMWA Coal Miner "Orphan Retiree"
Health Benefits, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 50-51 (Comm. Print
1993) (hereinafter House Report).
Congress has sometimes imposed liability, even "retroactive" liability, designed to prevent degradation of a natural
resource, upon those who have used and benefited from it.
See, e. g., Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U. S. C. ยง 9601 et seq.
(1994 ed. and Supp. I). That analogy, while imperfect, calls
attention to the special tie between a firm and its former
employee, a human resource, that helps to explain the special
retroactive liability. That connection, while not by itself
justifying retroactive liability here, helps to distinguish a
firm like Eastern, which employed a miner but no longer
makes coal, from other funding sources, say, current coal producers or coal consumers, who now make or use coal but who
have never employed that miner or benefited from his work.
More importantly, the record demonstrates that Eastern,
before 1965, contributed to the making of an important
"promise" to the miners. That "promise," even if not contractually enforceable, led the miners to "develo[p]" a reasonable "expectation" that they would continue to receive

Cite as: 524 U. S. 498 (1998)
BREYER,

J., dissenting

"[retiree] medical benefits." Ante, at 535. The relevant
history, outlined below, shows that industry action (including
action by Eastern), combined with Federal Government
action and the miners' own forbearance, produced circumstances that made it natural for the miners to believe that
either industry or Government (or both) would make every
effort to see that they received health benefits after they
retired-regardless of what terms were explicitly included
in previously signed bargaining agreements.
(1) Before the 1940's, health care for miners, insofar as it
existed, was provided by "company doctors" in company
towns. See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of Interior, Report of the Coal
Mines Administration, A Medical Survey of the BituminousCoal Industry 121, 144 (1947) (hereinafter Boone Report);
id., at 131, 191, 193 (describing care as substandard and criticizing the "noticeable deficiency" in the number of doctors);

Workers of America Retiree Health Benefits, Coal Commission Report 19 (1990) (hereinafter Coal Comm'n Report),
App. in No. 96-1947 (CAI), p. 1350 (hereinafter App. (CAl)).
By the late 1940's, health care and pension rights had become the issue for miners, a central demand in collective bargaining, and a rallying cry for those who urged a nationwide
coal strike. M. Fox, United We Stand 404, 416 (1990);
I. Krajcinovic, From Company Doctors to Managed Care 17,

(1988); see also ante, at 504-505. John L. Lewis, head of
the United Mine Workers of America (hereinafter UMWA or
Union), urged the mine owners to "'remove that fear"' of
sudden death from "'their minds so that they will know if
that occurs.., their families will be provided with proper
insurance."' Zieger, supra, at 153. In 1946, the workers
struck. The Government seized the mines. And the Government, together with the Union, effectively imposed a
managed health care agreement on the coal operators. Seltzer, supra, at 58.

(2) The resulting 1946 "Krug-Lewis Agreement" created
a Medical and Hospital Fund designed to "provide, or to arrange for the availability of, medical, hospital, and related
services for the miners and their dependents." Krug-Lewis
Agreement ยง 4(b), App. (CAl) 612-613. One year later, this
fund was consolidated with a "Welfare and Retirement
Fund" also established in 1946 (hereinafter W&R Fund).
1947 National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (hereinafter NBCWA) 150, App. (CAl) 621. Under the 1947 and
successive agreements, the W&R Fund's three trustees
(union, management, and "neutral") determined the specific
benefits provided under the plan. 1947 NBCWA 144, App.
(CAI) 618.
(3) Between 1947 and 1965, the benefits that the W&R
Fund provided included retiree benefits quite similar to
those at issue here. The bargaining agreements between
the coal operators and miners (NBCWA's) and the W&R
Fund's Annual Reports make clear that the W&R Fund provided benefits to all "employees

Benefits, at 36 (suggesting retirees eligible "'from the inception of bargained benefits"').
The only significant difference between the coverage provided before 1974 and after 1974 consists of greater generosity after 1974 with respect to widows, for the earlier 12month limitation was repealed and health benefits extended
to widows' remarriage or death. See 1974 NBCWA 105,
App. (CAI) 758.
(4) In return for what the miners thought was an assurance (though not a contractual obligation) from management
of continued pension and health care benefits, the Union
agreed to accept mechanization of mining, a concession that
meant significant layoffs and a smaller future work force.
Coal Comm'n Report 11-14, App. (CAl) 1342-1345 (75% decline in employment from 1950 to 1969); Krajcinovic 4, 43-44;
Seltzer, supra,at 36; see also C. Perry, Collective Bargaining
and the Decline of the United Mine Workers 43 (1984) (detailing benefits of mechanization for coal operators). The president of the Southern Coal Operators' Association said in 1953
that the miners "have been promised and grown accustomed
to" health benefits. App. (CAl) 2000. Those benefits, the
management's W&R Fund trustee said in 1951, covered
"mine workers], including pensioners, and dependents ...

without limit as to duration." Id., at 1972. This Court, too,
has said that the UMWA "agreed not to oppose the rapid
mechanization of the mines" in exchange for "increased
wages" and "payments into the welfare fund." Mine Workers v. Pennington,381 U. S.657, 660 (1965); see also id., at
698 (Goldberg, J., concurring in judgment) (improved wages,

BREYER, J., dissenting

benefits, and working conditions were a "quid pro quo" for
automation).
Others have reached similar conclusions. The Coal Commission more recently said:
"Retired coal miners have legitimate expectations of
health care benefits for life; that was the promise they
received during their working lives and that is how
they planned their retirement years. That commitment
should be honored." Coal Comm'n Report 1, App.
(CA) 1332.
And numerous supporters of the present law read the history as showing, for example, that the "miners went to work
each day under the assumption that their health benefits
would be there when they retired." 138 Cong. Rec. 20121
(1992) (Sen. Wofford); see also id., at 20118 (Sen. Rockefeller)
(Coal Act "will see to it that the promise of health care is
kept to tens of thousands of retired coal miners and their
families"); id., at 20119 (Sen. Byrd) (Coal Act will "assure...
retired coal miners ...

that promises made to them during

their working years are not now.., reneged upon"); id., at
20120 (Sen. Ford) (Coal Act assures that "promise made to
[retirees] can be kept"); id., at 34001 (Conference Report on
Coal Act) ("Under [NBCWA's], retirees and their dependents
have been promised lifetime health care benefits").
Further, the Federal Government played a significant role
in developing the expectations that these "promises" created.
In 1946, as mentioned above, during a strike related to
health and pension benefits, the Government seized the
mines and imposed the "Krug-Lewis Agreement," which established the basic health benefits framework. Supra, at
561; see also 11 Fed. Reg. 5593 (1946) (President Truman's
seizure order). In 1948, during a strike related to pension
benefits, the Government again intervened to ensure continued availability of these benefits. 13 Fed. Reg. 1579 (1948)

cinovic 37-38. In later years, but before 1965, Congress provided the W&R Fund with special tax benefits, helped the
Fund to build hospitals, and established health and safety
standards. Brief for Respondents UMWA Combined Benefit Fund et al. 11-12 (citing relevant statutes and record materials). This kind of Government intervention explains
why the president of the Southern Coal Producers' Association said, in the 1950's, that if benefits were reduced, it was
"entirely conceivable that Congress [would] step in and
take over the mines, assuming responsibility for the welfare collections and payment." App. (CAl) 2000.
I repeat that the Federal Government's words and deeds,
along with those of the pre-1965 industry, did not necessarily
create contractually binding promises (which, had they existed, might have eliminated the need for this legislation).
But in labor relations, as in human relations, one can create
promises and understandings which, even in the absence of
a legally enforceable contract, others reasonably expect will
be honored. Indeed, in labor relations such industrywide
understandings may spell the difference between labor war
and labor peace, for the parties may look to a strike, not to a
court, for enforcement. It is that kind of important, mutual
understanding that is at issue here. For the record shows
that pre-1965 statements and other conduct led management
to understand, and labor legitimately to expect, that health
care benefits for retirees and their dependents would continue to be provided.
Finally, Eastern continued to obtain profits from the coal
mining industry long after 1965, for it operated a wholly
owned coal-mining subsidiary, Eastern Associated Coal
Corp. (hereinafter EACC), until the late 1980's. Between
1966 and 1987, Eastern effectively ran EACC, sharing officers, supervising management, and receiving 100% of
EACC's approximately $100 million in dividends. Brief for
Petitioner 6, n. 13; App. (CAI) 2172 (affidavit of T. Gallagher,

Bituminous Coal Operators' Association, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 28, and n. 20; Brief for Respondent Peabody Holding
Co., Inc., et al. 14-15, and must have remained aware of the
W&R Fund's deepening financial crisis.
Taken together, these circumstances explain why it is not
fundamentally unfair for Congress to impose upon Eastern
liability for the future health care costs of miners whom it
long ago employed-rather than imposing that liability, for
example, upon the present industry, coal consumers, or taxpayers. Each diminishes the reasonableness of Eastern's
expectation that, by leaving the industry, it could fall within
the Constitution's protection against unfairly retroactive
liability.
These circumstances, as elaborated by the record, mean
that Eastern knew of the potential funding problems that
arise in any multiemployer benefit plan, see Concrete Pipe,
508 U. S., at 637-639, before it left the industry. Eastern
knew or should have known that, in light of the structure of
the benefit plan and the frequency with which coal operators
went out of business, a "last man out" problem could exacerbate the health plan's funding difficulties. See, e. g., Boone
Report xvi; House Report 34; Coal Commission Report on
Health Benefits of Retired Coal Miners: Hearing before the
Subcommittee on Medicare and Long-Term Care of the Senate Committee on Finance, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 15, 21
(1991) (statement of Coal Commission Vice Chairman Henry
Perritt, Jr.). Eastern also knew or should have known that
because of prior federal involvement, future federal intervention to solve any such problem was a serious possibility.

Eastern knew, by the very nature of the problem, that any
legislative effort to solve such a problem could well occur
many years into the future. And, most importantly, Eastern played a significant role in creating the miners' expectations that led to this legislation. Add to these circumstances
the two others I have mentioned-that Eastern had benefited from the labor of the miners for whose future health
care it must provide, and that Eastern remained in the industry, drawing from it substantial profits (though doing business through a subsidiary, which usually, but not always, insulates an owner from liability).
The upshot, if I follow the form of analysis this Court used
in Connolly, is that I cannot say the Government's regulation
has unfairly interfered with Eastern's "distinct investmentbacked expectations." See Connolly, supra, at 225-227
(analyzing "taking" in terms of three factors: (1) "economic
impact"; (2) interference "'With distinct investment-backed
expectations' "; and (3) "'character of the governmental action"' (citations omitted)). Within that framework, I could
find additional support for the constitutionality of the "reachback" liability provision by adding that the "character of the
governmental action" here amounts to the creation of a liability to a third party, and not a direct "taking" of an interest in physical property. And the fact that the statute
here narrows Eastern's liability to those whom it employed,
while explicitly preserving Eastern's rights to indemnification from others (thereby helping Eastern spread the risk of
this liability), 26 U. S. C. ยง 9706(f)(6), helps to diminish the
Coal Act's "economic impact" upon Eastern as well.
I would put the matter more directly, however. The law
imposes upon Eastern the burden of showing that the statute, because of its retroactive effect, is fundamentally unfair
or unjust. The circumstances I have mentioned convince
me that Eastern cannot show a sufficiently reasonable expectation that it would remain free of future health care cost
liability for the workers whom it employed. Eastern has

therefore failed to show that the law unfairly upset its legitimately settled expectations. Because, in my view, Eastern
has not met its burden, I would uphold the "reachback" provision of the Coal Act as constitutional.
