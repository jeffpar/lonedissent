CASES ADJUDGED
IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1993

DAY v. DAY
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 92-8788.

Decided October 12, 1993*

Since this Court's Rule 39.8 was first invoked in June 1993 to deny pro se petitioner Day in forma pauperis status, he has filed eight more petitions for certiorari, all of them demonstrably frivolous.
Held: Day is denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis in the instant
cases, and the Clerk is directed not to accept any further petitions for
certiorari from him in noncriminal matters unless he pays the required
docketing fee and submits his petition in compliance with this Court's
Rule 33. This order will free the Court's limited resources to consider
the claims of those petitioners who, unlike Day, have not abused the
certiorari process.
Motions denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Roy A. Day requests leave to proceed in
forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this
request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Day is allowed until November 2, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees required
by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliance with
*Together with No. 92-8792, Day v. Bekiempis, No. 92-8888, Day v.
Heinrich et al., No. 92-8905, Day v. GAF Building Materials Corp.,
No. 92-8906, Day v. Clinton et al., No. 92-9018, Day v. Black et al.,
No. 92-9101, Day v. Deason et al., and No. 93-5430, Day v. Day, also
on motions for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.

DAY v. DAY
Per Curiam

this Court's Rule 33. We also direct the Clerk not to accept
any further petitions for certiorari from Day in noncriminal
matters unless he pays the docketing fee required byl Rule
38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.
Day is an abuser of this Court's certiorari process. We
first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Day informa pauperis status
last June. See In re Day, 509 U. S. 902 (1993). At that time
he had filed 27 petitions in the past nine years. Although
Day was granted informa pauperis'status to file these petitions, all were denied without recorded dissent. Since we
first denied him in forma pauperis status last June, he has
filed eight more petitions for certiorari with this Court-all
of them demonstrably frivolous.
As we have recognized, "[e]very paper filed with the Clerk
of this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources. A
part of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests
of justice." In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 184 (1989) (per
curiam). Consideration of Day's repetitious and frivolous
petitions for certiorari does not promote this end.
We have entered orders similar to the present one on previous occasions to prevent pro se petitioners from filing repetitious and frivolous requests for certiorari, see Martin v.
District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992)
(per curiam), and repetitious and frivolous requests for extraordinary relief. See In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991)
(per curiam); In re McDonald, supra.
Day's refusal to heed our earlier warning requires us to
take this step. His abuse of the writ of certiorari has been
in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not prevent Day from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him. But it will free this Court's limited resources
to consider the claims of those petitioners who have not
abused our certiorari process.
It is so ordered.

J., dissenting

JusrICE STEVENS, dissenting.

Adhering to the views expressed in the dissenting opinions
in Brown v. Herald Co., 464 U.S. 928, 931 (1983), In re
McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 185 (1989), and Wrenn v. Benson,
490 U. S. 89, 92 (1989), I would deny these petitions for writs
of certiorari without reaching the merits of the motions to
pioceed in forma pauperis. In the future, however, I shall
not encumber the record by noting my dissent from Â§imilar
orders denying leave to proceed in forma pauperis, absent
exceptional circumstances.
