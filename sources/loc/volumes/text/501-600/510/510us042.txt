Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. JAMES DANIEL GOOD REAL
PROPERTY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 92-1180.

Argued October 6, 1993-Decided December 13, 1993

Four and one-half years after police found drugs and drug paraphernalia
in claimant Good's home and he pleaded guilty to promoting a harmful
drug in violation of Hawaii law, the United States filed an in rem action
in the Federal District Court, seeking forfeiture of his house and land,
under 21 U. S. C. §881(a)(7), on the ground that the property had been
used to commit or facilitate the commission of a federal drug offense.
Following an ex pare proceeding, a Magistrate Judge issued a warrant
authorizing the property's seizure, and the Government seized the property without prior notice to Good or an adversary proceeding. In his
claim for the property and answer to the Government's complaint, Good
asserted that he was deprived of his property without due process
of law and that the action was invalid because it had not been timely
commenced. The District Court ordered that the property be forfeited,
but the Court of Appeals reversed. It held that the seizure without
prior notice and a hearing violated the Due Process Clause, and remanded the case for a determination whether the action, although filed
within the 5-year period provided by 19 U. S. C. § 1621, was untimely
because the Government failed to follow the internal notification and
reporting requirements of §§ 1602-1604.
Held
1. Absent exigent circumstances, the Due Process Clause requires the
Government to afford notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard
before seizing real property subject to civil forfeiture. Pp. 48-62.
(a) The seizure of Good's property implicates two "'explicit textual
source[s] of constitutional protection,"' the Fourth Amendment and the
Fifth. Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56, 70. While the Fourth
Amendment places limits on thie Government's power to seize property
for purposes of forfeiture, it does not provide the sole measure of constitutional protection that must be afforded property owners in forfeiture
proceedings. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103; Graham v. Connor,490
U. S. 386, distinguished. Where the Government seizes property not to
preserve evidence of criminal wrongdoing but to assert ownership and
control over the property, its action must also comply with the Due
