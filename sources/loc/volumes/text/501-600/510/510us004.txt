OCTOBER TERM, 1993
Per Curiam

IN RE SASSOWER
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 92-8933.

Decided October 12, 1993*

In the three years prior to this Term, pro se petitioner Sassower had
filed 11 petitions. However, in the last four months, he has suddenly
increased his filings and now has 10 petitions pending before this Court,
all of them patently frivolous.
Held, Sassower is denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis in the instant cases, pursuant to this Court's Rule 39.8, and the Clerk is directed
not to accept any further petitions for certiorari nor any petitions for
extraordinary writs from him in noncriminal matters, unless he pays
the required docketing fee and submits his petition in compliance with
this Court's Rule 33. For the important reasons discussed in Martin
v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, In re Sindram,
498 U. S. 177, and In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, the Court feels compelled to enter this order, which will allow the Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who, unlike Sassower, have
not abused the Court's process.
Motions denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner George Sassower requests leave to pro-

ceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We
deny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Sassower is allowed until November 2, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions
in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. For the reasons
explained below, we also direct the Clerk not to accept any
further petitions for certiorari nor any petitions for extraor*Together with No. 92-8934, Sassower v. Mead Data Central Inc. et al.,

dinary writs from Sassower in noncriminal matters unless
he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits
his petition in compliance with Rule 33.
Prior to this Term, Sassower had filed 11 petitions in this
Court over the last three years. Although Sassower was
granted in forma pauperis status to file these petitions, all
were denied without recorded dissent.* During the last
four months, Sassower has suddenly increased his filings.
He currently has 10 petitions pending before this Court-all
of them patently frivolous.
Although we have not previously denied Sassower. in
forma pauperis status pursuant to Rule 39.8, we think it
appropriate to enter an order pursuant to Martin v. District
of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992). In both
In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991) (per curiam), and In re
McDonald, 489 U. S. 180 (1989) (per curiam), we entered
orders similar to this one without having previously denied
petitioners' motions to proceed in forma pauperis under
Rule 39.8. For the important reasons discussed in Martin,
Sindram, and McDonald, we feel compelled to enter the
order today barring prospective filings from Sassower.
Sassower's abuse of the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has been in noncriminal cases, and so we
limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not
prevent Sassower from petitioning to challenge criminal
sanctions which might be imposed on him. The order, how*See Sassower v. New York, 499 U. S. 966 (1991) (certiorari); In re Sassower, 499 U. S. 935 (1991) (mandamus/prohibition); In re Sassower, 499
