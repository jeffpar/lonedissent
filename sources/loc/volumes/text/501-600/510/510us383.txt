CASPARI, SUPERINTENDENT, MISSOURI
EASTERN CORRECTIONAL CENTER,
ET AL. v. BOHLEN
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
No. 92-1500.

Argued December 6, 1993-Decided February 23, 1994

The state trial judge sentenced respondent as a persistent offender following his conviction on three robbery counts, but the Missouri Court of
Appeals reversed the sentence because there was no proof of prior convictions, as is necessary to establish persistent-offender status under
state law. On remand, the trial judge resentenced respondent as a
persistent offender based on evidence of prior felony convictions, rejecting his contention that allowing the State another opportunity to prove
such convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. In affirming, the
State Court of Appeals agreed that there was no double jeopardy bar,
as did the Federal District Court, which denied respondents habeas
corpus petition. However, in reversing, the Federal Court of Appeals
extended the rationale of Bullington v. Missouri,451 U. S. 430, a capital
case, to hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a State from
subjecting a defendant to successive noncapital sentence enhancement
proceedings. The court ruled that taking that step did not require the
announcement of a "new rule" of constitutional law, and thus that granting habeas relief to respondent would not violate the nonretroactivity
principle of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, which prohibits such relief
based on a rule announced after the defendant's conviction and sentence
became final.
Held:
1. Because the State argued in the certiorari petition, as it had in the
courts below and as it does in its brief on the merits, that the nonretroactivity principle barred the relief sought by respondent, this Court
must apply Teague analysis before considering the merits of respondent's claim. See Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 466-467. The
Teague issue is a necessary predicate to the resolution of the primary
question presented in the petition: whether the Double Jeopardy Clause
should apply to successive noncapital sentence enhancement proceedings. Pp. 388-390.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in directing the District Court to grant
respondent habeas relief because doing so required the announcement

CASPARI v. BOHLEN
Syllabus
and application of a new rule in violation of Teague and subsequent
cases. Pp. 390-396.
(a) Under those precedents, a court must proceed in three steps:
(1) it must ascertain the date on which the conviction and sentence became final for Teague purposes; (2) it must determine whether a state
court considering the defendant's claim on that date would have felt
compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule sought was
required by the Constitution; and (3), even if it determines that the
defendant seeks the benefit of a new rule, it must decide whether that
rule falls within one of the two narrow exceptions to the nonretroactivity principle. P. 390.
(b) Respondent's conviction and sentence became final for purposes
of retroactivity analysis on January 2, 1986, the date on which the 90-day
period for filing a certiorari petition elapsed following exhaustion of
the availability of direct appeal to the state courts. See Griffith v.
Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6. Pp. 390-391.
(c) The Federal Court of Appeals announced a new rule in this case.
A reasonable jurist reviewing this Court's precedents as of January 2,
1986, would not have considered the application of the Double Jeopardy
Clause to a noncapital sentencing proceeding to be dictated by precedent. At that time, the Court had not so applied the Clause, cf., e. g.,
United States v. DiFrancesco,449 U. S. 117, 133-135; Bullington, supra,
and Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, distinguished, and indeed several of the Court's decisions pointed in the opposite direction, see,
e. g., Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. Moreover, two Federal
Courts of Appeals and several state courts had reached conflicting holdings on the issue. Because that conflict concerned a development in the
law over which reasonable jurists could disagree, Sawyer v. Smith, 497
U. S. 227, 234, the Court of Appeals erred in resolving it in respondent's
favor. To the limited extent this Court's cases decided subsequent
to January 2, 1986, have any relevance to the Teague analysis, they
are entirely consistent with the foregoing new rule determination.
Pp. 391-396.
(d) Neither of the two narrow exceptions to the nonretroactivity
principle applies in this case. First, imposing a double jeopardy bar
here would not place respondent's conduct beyond the power of the
criminal law-making authority, since he is still subject to imprisonment
on each of his robbery convictions, regardless of whether he is sentenced
as a persistent offender. Second, applying the Double Jeopardy Clause
in these circumstances would not constitute a watershed criminal rule,
since persistent-offender status is a fact objectively ascertainable on the
basis of readily available evidence, and subjecting a defendant to a second proceeding at which the State has the opportunity to show the req-

Syllabus
uisite number of prior convictions is not unfair and will enhance the
proceeding's accuracy by ensuring that the determination is made on
the basis of competent evidence. P. 396.
3. Because of the resolution of this case on Teague grounds, the Court
need not reach the questions whether the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to noncapital sentencing, whether Missouri's persistent-offender
scheme is sufficiently trial-like to invoke double jeopardy protections, or
whether Bullington should be overruled. Pp. 396-397.

CASPARI v. BOHLEN
Opinion of the Court

delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981), we held
that a defendant sentenced to life' imprisonment following a
trial-like capital sentencing proceeding is protected by the
Double Jeopardy Clause against imposition of the death penalty if he obtains reversal of his conviction and is retried and
reconvicted. In this case we are asked to decide whether
the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a State from twice
subjecting a defendant to a noncapital sentence enhancement proceeding.
I
Respondent and others entered a jewelry store in St.
Louis County, Missouri, on April 17, 1981. Holding store
employees and customers at gunpoint, they stole money and
jewelry. After a jury trial, respondent was convicted on
three counts of first-degree robbery. See Mo. Rev. Stat.
§569.020 (1978). The authorized punishment for that offense, a class A felony, is "a term of years not less than ten
years and not to exceed thirty years, or life imprisonment."
Mo. Rev. Stat. §558.011.1(1) (Supp. 1982).
Under Missouri law, the jury is to "assess and declare the
punishment as a part of [the] verdict." § 557.036.2. The
judge is then to determine the punishment "having regard
to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and character of the defendant," §557.036.1, although
the sentence imposed by the judge generally cannot be more
severe than the advisory sentence recommended by the jury.
§557.036.3. If the trial judge finds the defendant to be a
"persistent offender," however, the judge sets the punishment without seeking an advisory sentence from the jury.
§§ 557.036.4, 557.036.5. A persistent offender is any person
"who has pleaded guilty to or has been found guilty of two
or more felonies committed at different times." § 558.016.3.
The judge must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is a persistent offender. § 558.021. For a defendant
who has committed a class A felony, a finding of persistentJUSTICE O'CONNOR

Opinion of the Court

offender status shifts the sentencing decision from the jury
to the judge but does not alter the authorized sentencing
range. §§557.036.4(2), 558.016.6(1).
The trial judge in this case sentenced respondent as a
persistent offender to three consecutive terms of 15 years in
prison. The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed respondent's convictions. State v. Bohlen, 670 S. W. 2d 119 (1984).
The state court reversed respondent's sentence, however, because "although [respondent] was sentenced by the judge as
a persistent offender no proof was made of the prior convictions." Id., at 123. Following Missouri practice, see State
v. Holt, 660 S. W. 2d 735, 738-739 (Mo. App. 1983), the court
remanded for proof of those convictions and resentencing.
On remand, the State introduced evidence of four prior
felony convictions. Rejecting respondent's contention that
allowing the State another opportunity to prove his prior
convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, the trial
judge found respondent to be a persistent offender and again
sentenced him to three consecutive 15-year terms. App.
A-29, A-35. The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed: "The
question of double jeopardy was not involved because those
provisions of the Fifth Amendment have been held not to
apply to sentencing." State v. Bohlen, 698 S. W. 2d 577, 578
(1985), citing State v. Lee, 660 S. W. 2d 394, 399 (Mo. App.
1983). The Missouri Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed the trial court's denial of respondent's motion for
postconviction relief. Bohlen v. State, 743 S. W. 2d 425
(1987).
In 1989, respondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Missouri. The District Court, adopting the report and recommendation of a Magistrate, denied the petition. App. to Pet. for Cert. A25-A26. The court rejected
respondent's contention that the Double Jeopardy Clause
barred the State from introducing evidence of respondent's

CASPARI v. BOHLEN
Opinion of the Court

prior convictions at the second sentencing hearing. Id., at
A37-A49.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
reversed. 979 F. 2d 109 (1992). Based on its conclusion
that "[t]he persistent offender sentenc[e] enhancement procedure in Missouri has protections similar to those in the capital sentencing hearing in Bullington," id., at 112, the court
stated that "it is a short step to apply the same double jeopardy protection to a non-capital sentencing hearing as the
Supreme Court applied to a capital sentenc[ing] ... hearing."
Id., at 113. The court held that taking that step did not
require the announcement of a "new rule" of constitutional
law, and thus that granting habeas relief to respondent would
not violate the nonretroactivity principle of Teague v. Lane,
489 U. S. 288 (1989) (plurality opinion). The Court of Appeals accordingly directed the District Court to grant respondent a writ of habeas corpus. 979 F. 2d, at 115.
We granted certiorari, 508 U. S. 971 (1993), and now
reverse.
II
We have consistently declined to consider issues not raised
in the petition for a writ of certiorari. See this Court's Rule
14.1(a) ("Only the questions set forth in the petition, or fairly
included therein, will be considered by the Court"). In Yee
v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519 (1992), for example, the question
presented was whether certain governmental action had effected a physical taking of the petitioner's property; we held
that the question whether the same action had effected a
regulatory taking, while "related" and "complementary" to
the question presented, was not fairly included therein. Id.,
at 537. In Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U S.
Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27 (1993) (percuriam), the question
presented in the petition was whether the courts of appeals
should routinely vacate district court judgments when cases
are settled while on appeal; we held that the "analytically
and factually" distinct issue whether the petitioner was im-

Cite as: 510 U. S. 383 (1994)

Opinion of the Court

properly denied leave to intervene in the court below was
not fairly included in the question presented. Id., at 32.
See also American Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago v.
Haroco, Inc., 473 U. S. 606, 608 (1985) (percuriam).
The primary question presented in the petition for a writ
of certiorari in this case was "[w]hether the Double Jeopardy
Clause ... should apply to successive non-capital sentence

enhancement proceedings." Pet. for Cert. 1. The State argues that answering that question in the affirmative would
require the announcement of a new rule of constitutional law
in violation of Teague and subsequent cases. We conclude
that this issue is a subsidiary question fairly included in the
question presented.
The nonretroactivity principle prevents a federal court
from granting habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner based
on a rule announced after his conviction and sentence became final. See, e. g., Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S.222, 227
(1992). A threshold question in every habeas case, therefore, is whether the court is obligated to apply the Teague
rule to the defendant's claim. We have recognized that the
nonretroactivity principle "is not 'jurisdictional' in the sense
that [federal courts] ... must raise and decide the issue sua

sponte." Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S.37, 41 (1990) (emphasis omitted). Thus, a federal court may, but need not,
decline to apply Teague if the State does not argue it. See
Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S.222, 228-229 (1994). But if the
State does argue that the defendant seeks the benefit of a
new rule of constitutional law, the court must apply Teague
before considering the merits of the claim. See Graham v.
Collins, 506 U. S.461, 466-467 (1993).
In this case, the State argued in the petition, as it had in
the courts below and as it does in its brief on the merits,
that the nonretroactivity principle barred the relief sought
by respondent. In contrast to Yee, which involved a claim
that was related but not subsidiary, and Izumi, in which the
intervention question was a procedural one wholly divorced

CASPARI v. BOHLEN
Opinion of the Court

from the question on which we granted review, the Teague
issue raised by the State in this case is a necessary predicate
to the resolution of the question presented in the petition.
Cf. Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 342-343, n. 6 (1980).
We therefore proceed to consider it.
III
"[A] case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final." Teague v. Lane, supra, at 301. In
determining whether a state prisoner is entitled to habeas
relief, a federal court should apply Teague by proceeding in
three steps. First, the court must ascertain the date on
which the defendant's conviction and sentence became final
for Teague purposes. Second, the court must "[s]urve[y] the
legal landscape as it then existed," Grahamv. Collins, supra,
at 468, and "determine whether a state court considering
[the defendant's] claim at the time his conviction became final
would have felt compelled by existing precedent to conclude
that the rule [he] seeks was required by the Constitution,"
Saffie v. Parks,494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990). Finally, even if the
court determines that the defendant seeks the benefit of a
new rule, the court must decide whether that rule falls
within one of the two narrow exceptions to the nonretroactivity principle. See Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U. S. 333, 345
(1993).
A
A state conviction and sentence become final for purposes
of retroactivity analysis when the availability of direct appeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for
filing a petition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely
filed petition has been finally denied. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987). The Missouri Court of
Appeals denied respondent's petition for rehearing on October 3, 1985, and respondent did not file a petition for a writ of
certiorari. Respondent's conviction and sentence therefore

Cite as: 510 U. S. 383 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

became final on January 2, 1986-91 days (January 1 was a
legal holiday) later. 28 U. S. C. § 2101(c); see this Court's
Rules 13.4 and 30.1.
B
In reviewing the state of the law on that date, we note
that it was well established that there is no double jeopardy
bar to the use of prior convictions in sentencing a persistent
offender. Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 560 (1967). Cf.
Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 678 (1895). Respondent's
claim, however, is that the State's failure to prove his
persistent-offender status at his first sentencing hearing
operated as an "acquittal" of that status, so that he cannot
be again subjected to a persistent-offender determination.
See United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 343 (1975) ("When
a defendant has been acquitted of an offense, the Clause
guarantees that the State shall not be permitted to make
repeated attempts to convict him").
At first blush, respondent's argument would appear to be
foreclosed by the fact that "[h]istorically, the pronouncement
of sentence has never carried the finality that attaches to an
acquittal." United States v. DiFrancesco,449 U. S. 117, 133
(1980). In that case, we upheld the constitutionality of 18
U. S. C. §3576, a pre-Guidelines statute that allowed the
United States to appeal the sentence imposed on a defendant
adjudged to be a "dangerous special offender," and allowed
the court of appeals to affirm the sentence, impose a different
sentence, or remand to the district court for further sentencing proceedings. A review of our prior cases led us to the
conclusion that "[t]his Court's decisions in the sentencing
area clearly establish that a sentence does not have the qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal." 449
U. S., at 134; see also id., at 135, citing Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17 (1973); North Carolina v. Pearce, 395
U. S. 711 (1969); Bozza v. United States, 330 U. S. 160 (1947);
and Stroud v. United States, 251 U. S. 15 (1919).

CASPARI v. BOHLEN
Opinion of the Court

Respondent acknowledges our traditional refusal to extend the Double Jeopardy Clause to sentencing, but contends
that a different result is compelled in this case by Bullington
v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981), and Arizona v. Rumsey,
467 U. S. 203 (1984). In Bullington, the defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.
After he obtained a reversal of his conviction on appeal and
was reconvicted, the State again sought the death penalty.
We recognized the general principle that "[t]he imposition of
a particular sentence usually is not regarded as an 'acquittal'
of any more severe sentence that could have been imposed."
451 U. S., at 438. We nonetheless held that because Missouri's "presentence hearing resembled and, indeed, in all relevant respects was like the immediately preceding trial on
the issue of guilt or innocence," ibid., the first jury's refusal
to impose the death penalty operated as an acquittal of that
punishment. In Rumsey, we extended the rationale of Bullington to a capital sentencing scheme in which the judge, as
opposed to a jury, had initially determined that a life sentence was appropriate. 467 U. S., at 212.
Both Bullington and Rumsey were capital cases, and our
reasoning in those cases was based largely on the unique
circumstances of a capital sentencing proceeding. In Bullington itself we distinguished our contrary precedents, particularly DiFrancesco,on the ground that "[tihe history of
sentencing practices is of little assistance to Missouri in this
case, since the sentencing procedures for capital cases instituted after the decision in Furman [v. Georgia,408 U. S. 238
(1972),] are unique." 451 U. S., at 441-442, n. 15 (internal
quotation marks omitted). We recognized as much in Pennsylvania v. Goldhammer, 474 U. S. 28 (1985) (per curiam):
"[T]he decisions of this Court 'clearly establish that a sentenc[ing in a noncapital case] does not have the qualities of
constitutional finality that attend an acquittal."' Id., at 30,
quoting DiFrancesco,supra, at 134 (bracketed phrase added
by the Goldhammer Court; emphasis added).

Cite as: 510 U. S. 383 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), we held
that the same standard for evaluating claims of ineffective
assistance of counsel applies to trials and to capital sentencing proceedings because "[a] capital sentencing proceeding
... is sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in
the existence of standards for decision, see [Bullington],
that counsel's role in the proceeding is comparable to counsel's role at trial." Id., at 686-687. Because Strickland involved a capital sentencing proceeding, we left open the
question whether the same test would apply to noncapital
cases: "We need not consider the role of counsel in an ordinary sentencing, which may involve informal proceedings
and standardless discretion in the sentencer, and hence may
require a different approach to the definition of constitutionally effective assistance." Id., at 686; see also id., at 704-705
(Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(" 'Time and again the Court has condemned procedures in
capital cases that might be completely acceptable in an ordinary case. See, e. g., [Bullington]'") (quoting Barefoot v.
Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 913-914 (1983) (Marshall, J., dissenting)). See also Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 458
(1984).
While our cases may not have foreclosed the application of
the Double Jeopardy Clause to noncapital sentencing, neither
did any of them apply the Clause in that context. On the
contrary, Goldhammer and Strickland strongly suggested
that Bullington was limited to capital sentencing. We
therefore conclude that a reasonable jurist reviewing our
precedents at the time respondent's conviction and sentence
became final would not have considered the application of
the Double Jeopardy Clause to a noncapital sentencing proceeding to be dictated by our precedents. Cf. Stringer v.
Black, 503 U. S., at 236-237.
This analysis is confirmed by the experience of the lower
courts. Prior to the time respondent's conviction and sentence became final, one Federal Court of Appeals and two

CASPARI v. BOHLEN
Opinion of the Court

state courts of last resort had held that the Double Jeopardy
Clause did not bar the introduction of evidence of prior convictions at resentencing in noncapital cases, Linam v. Griffin, 685 F. 2d 369, 374-376 (CA10 1982); Durhamv. State, 464
N. E. 2d 321, 323-326 (Ind. 1984); People v. Sailor,65 N. Y. 2d
224, 231-236, 480 N. E. 2d 701, 706-710 (1985), while another
Federal Court of Appeals and two other state courts of last
resort had held to the contrary, Briggs v. Procunier,764
F. 2d 368, 371 (CA5 1985); State v. Hennings, 100 Wash. 2d
379, 386-390, 670 P. 2d 256, 259-262 (1983); Cooper v. State,
631 S. W. 2d 508, 513-514 (Tex. Crim. App. 1982). Moreover,
the Missouri Court of Appeals had previously rejected precisely the same claim raised by respondent. State v. Lee,
660 S. W. 2d, at 399-400.
In its retroactivity analysis, the Court of Appeals dismissed the Tenth Circuit's decision in Linam as "ultimately
based on trial error," 979 F. 2d, at 114, failing to recognize
that the Linam court offered two "alternative bas[e]s for decision," 685 F. 2d, at 374-the second being that the "uniqueness of the death penalty unquestionably serves to distinguish DiFrancescofrom Bullington," id., at 375. Nor did
the Court of Appeals acknowledge the relevant portion of
the Lee decision, in which a Missouri court held that "the
death penalty second stage trial in a capital murder case
bears no similarity to a determination of persistent offender
status by a judge upon the basis of largely formal evidence."
660 S. W. 2d, at 400. Instead, the court focused on whether
there was any "federal holding resting squarely on the proposition that Bullington does not apply to non-capital sentenc[e] enhancement proceedings." 979 F. 2d, at 114 (emphasis added).
At oral argument in this Court, counsel for respondent
candidly admitted that he did not know "exactly what State
courts had decided or when" with respect to the applicability
of the Double Jeopardy Clause to noncapital sentencing. Tr.
of Oral Arg. 31. In fact, two state courts had held the Dou-

Cite as: 510 U. S. 383 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

ble Jeopardy Clause inapplicable to noncapital sentencing
prior to 1986. Durham v. State, supra; People v. Sailor,
supra. Constitutional law is not the exclusive province of
the federal courts, and in the Teague analysis the reasonable
views of state courts are entitled to consideration along with
those of federal courts. See Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S.
407, 414 (1990).
In sum, at the time respondent's conviction and sentence
became final this Court had not applied the Double Jeopardy
Clause to noncapital sentencing, and indeed several of our
cases pointed in the opposite direction. Two Federal Courts
of Appeals and-several state courts had reached conflicting
holdings on the issue. Because that conflict concerned a
"developmen[t] in the law over which reasonable jurists
[could] disagree," Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990),
the Court of Appeals erred in resolving it in respondent's
favor.
Finally, to the limited extent our cases decided subsequent
to the time respondent's conviction and sentence became
final have any relevance to the Teague analysis, cf. Graham
v. Collins, 506 U. S., at 472, 477, they are entirely consistent
with our conclusion that the Court of Appeals announced a
new rule in this case. See Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S.
33, 37-38, n. 6 (1988) (reserving question whether Double
Jeopardy Clause applies to noncapital sentencing); see also
Poland v. Arizona, 476 U. S. 147, 155 (1986) ("Bullington
indicates that the proper inquiry is whether the sentencer or
reviewing court has 'decided that the prosecution has not
proved its case' that the death penalty is appropriate")(emphasis in original); Hunt v. New York, 502 U. S. 964 (1991)
(White, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (noting conflict on the question "whether the Double Jeopardy Clause
applies to trial-like sentence enhancement proceedings in
noncapital cases"). Because "[t]he 'new rule' principle ...
validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing
precedents made by state courts even though they are shown

CASPARI v. BOHLEN
Opinion of the Court

to be contrary to later decisions," Butler v. McKellar, supra,
at 414, a fortiori it should protect a reasonable interpretation that is entirely consistent with subsequent cases.
C
Neither of the two narrow exceptions to the nonretroactivity principle applies to this case. The first exception is for
new rules that place "certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making
authority to proscribe." Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S., at 307
(internal quotation marks omitted). Imposing a double
jeopardy bar in this case would have no such effect. Respondent is subject to imprisonment on each of his three convictions, regardless of whether he is sentenced as a persistent
offender. The second exception is for "'watershed rules of
criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and
accuracy of the criminal proceeding." Saffle v. Parks, 494
U. S., at 495. Applying the Double Jeopardy Clause to successive noncapital sentencing is not such a groundbreaking
occurrence. Persistent-offender status is a fact objectively
ascertainable on the basis of readily available evidence.
Either a defendant has the requisite number of prior convictions, or he does not. Subjecting him to a second proceeding
at which the State has the opportunity to show those convictions is not unfair and will enhance the accuracy of the proceeding by ensuring that the determination is made on the
basis of competent evidence.
IV
The Court of Appeals recognized that it was a "stretch" to
apply the Double Jeopardy Clause to a noncapital sentencing
proceeding, 979 F. 2d, at 115, one that required "[e]xtending"
the rationale of Bullington, 979 F. 2d, at 115, but held that
because it was only a "short step," id., at 113, the nonretroactivity principle was not violated. We disagree. The Court
of Appeals erred in directing the District Court to grant re-

spondent a writ of habeas corpus because doing so required
the announcement and application of a new rule of constitutional law. Because of our resolution of this case on Teague
grounds, we have no occasion to decide whether the Double
Jeopardy Clause applies to noncapital sentencing, or whether
Missouri's persistent-offender scheme is sufficiently trial-like
to invoke double jeopardy protections; nor need we consider
the State's contention that Bullington should be overruled.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
dissenting.
The nonretroactivity principle announced in the plurality
opinion in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), is a judgemade defense that can be waived. Collins v. Youngblood,
497 U. S. 37, 41 (1990). In recent years, the Court has fashioned harsh rules regarding waiver and claim forfeiture to
defeat substantial constitutional claims. See, e. g., Coleman
v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991); Murray v. Carrier,477
U. S. 478 (1986). If we are to apply such a strict approach
to waiver in habeas corpus litigation, we should hold the warden to the same standard. Accordingly, given the treatment
accorded the private litigant in Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27 (1993) (per
curiam), I would hold that petitioner Caspari forfeited his
Teague defense under this Court's Rule 14.1(a).
Distinguishing Izumi, the Court explains that the intervention question in that case was "wholly divorced from the
question on which we granted review," whereas here the
Teague issue "is a necessary predicate to the resolution of
the question presented in the petition." Ante, at 389-390.
Yet Izumi itself opened by acknowledging that it "would
have to address" the intervention issue "[i]n order to reach
the merits of this case." 510 U. S., at 28. It is no more
"necessary" to answer the Teague question in this case than
it was, for example, in Collins, supra.
JUSTICE STEVENS,

CASPARI v. BOHLEN
STEVENS, J., dissenting

On the merits, I agree with the Court of Appeals. Under
Missouri law courts must make findings of fact that
persistent-offender status is warranted for those convicted
of certain offenses when the prosecutor establishes requisite
facts by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.* That status subjects the defendant to more severe sentences, Mo. Rev. Stat.
§ 558.016.1 (Supp. 1982), and deprives him of the opportunity
to have a jury sentence him, §557.036.2. The sentence enhancement thus has the same legal effect as conviction of a
separate offense; the separate sentencing hearing likewise is
the practical equivalent of the trial. Missouri law acknowledges as much by properly requiring prosecutors to prove
the factual predicate for the enhanced sentence beyond a reasonable doubt.
A defendant opposing such an enhancement undoubtedly
has a constitutional right to counsel and to the basic procedural protections the Due Process Clause affords. I have
no hesitation in concluding that these protections include the
right not to be "twice put in jeopardy" for the same offense.
U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. I would affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeals.

*Mo. Rev. Stat. § 558.021.1(2) (Supp. 1982). A "persistent offender" had
previously been adjudged guilty of two or more felonies committed at different times. §558.016.3. Missouri also mandates an enhanced sentence
if the prosecutor proves that the defendant is a "dangerous offender"meaning one who is being sentenced for a felony during which he knowingly "murdered or endangered or threatened the life" of another, who
"knowingly inflicted or attempted or threatened to inflict serious physical
injury" on another, or who is guilty of certain felonies. §558.016.4. It
is unfair to afford the prosecutor two opportunities to satisfy either
provision.
