QUILL

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 95-1858.

Argued January 8, 1997-Decided June 26, 1997

In New York, as in most States, it is a crime to aid another to commit or
attempt suicide, but patients may refuse even lifesaving medical treatment. Respondent New York physicians assert that, although it would
be consistent with the standards of their medical practices to prescribe
lethal medication for mentally competent, terminally ill patients who
are suffering great pain and desire a doctor's help in taking their own
lives, they are deterred from doing so by New York's assisted-suicide
ban. They, and three gravely ill patients who have since died, sued the
State's Attorney General, claiming that the ban violates the Fourteenth
Amendment's Equal -Protection Clause. The Federal District Court
disagreed, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding (1) that New York
accords different treatment to those competent, terminally ill persons
who wish to hasten their deaths by self-administering prescribed drugs
than it does to those who wish to do so by directing the removal of
life-support systems, and (2) that this supposed unequal treatment is
not rationally related to any legitimate state interests.
Held: New York's prohibition on assisting suicide does not violate the
Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 799-809.
(a) The Equal Protection Clause embodies a general rule that States
must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly. E. g.,
Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 216. The New York statutes outlawing
assisted suicide neither infringe fundamental rights nor involve suspect
classifications, e. g., Washington v. Glucksberg, ante, at 719-728, and are
therefore entitled to a strong presumption of validity, Heller v. Doe, 509
U. S. 312, 319. On their faces, neither the assisted-suicide bannor the
law permitting patients to refuse medical treatment treats anyone differently from anyone else or draws any distinctions between persons.
Everyone, regardless of physical condition, is entitled, if competent, to
refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment; no one is permitted to
assist a suicide. Generally, laws that apply evenhandedly to all unquestionably comply with equal protection. E. g., New York City Transit
Authority v. Beazer, 440 U. S. 568, 587. This Court disagrees with the
Second Circuit's submission that ending or refusing lifesaving medical
treatment "is nothing more nor less than assisted suicide." The distinc-

tion between letting a patient die and making that patient die is important, logical, rational, and well established: It comports with fundamental legal principles of causation, see, e. g., People v. Kevorkian, 447 Mich.
436, 470-472, 527 N. W. 2d 714, 728, cert. denied, 514 U. S. 1083, and
intent, see, e. g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394,403-406; has been
recognized, at least implicitly, by this Court in Cruzan v. Director,Mo.
Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 278-280; id., at 287-288 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring); and has been widely recognized and endorsed in the medical profession, the state courts, and the overwhelming majority of state
legislatures, which, like New York's, have permitted the former while
prohibiting the latter. The Court therefore disagrees with respondents' claim that the distinction is "arbitrary" and "irrational." The line
between the two acts may not always be clear, but certainty is not
required, even were it possible. Logic and contemporary practice support New York's judgment that the two acts are different, and New
York may therefore, consistent with the Constitution, treat them differently. Pp. 799-808.
(b) New York's reasons for recognizing and acting on the distinction
between refusing treatment and assisting a suicide-including prohibiting intentional killing and preserving life; preventing suicide; maintaining physicians' role as their patients' healers; protecting vulnerable people from indifference, prejudice, and psychological and financial pressure
to end their lives; and avoiding a possible slide toward euthanasia-are
valid and important public interests that easily satisfy the constitutional
requirement that a legislative classification bear a rational relation to
some legitimate end. See Glucksberg, ante. Pp. 808-809.

Opinion of the Court

lifesaving medical treatment.2 The question presented by
this case is whether New York's prohibition on assisting suicide therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. We hold that it does not.
Petitioners are various New York public officials. Respondents Timothy E. Quill, Samuel C. Klagsbrun, and Howard A. Grossman are physicians who practice in New York.
They assert that although it would be "consistent with the
standards of [their] medical practice[s]" to prescribe lethal
medication for "mentally competent, terminally ill patients"
who are suffering great pain and desire a doctor's help in
taking their own lives, they are deterred from doing so by
New York's ban on assisting suicide. App. 25-26.3 Respondents, and three gravely ill patients who have since
died,4 sued the State's Attorney General in the United States
Ronald Dworkin et al. by Mr. Dworkin, pro se, Peter L. Zimroth, Philip
H. Curtis, Kent A Yalowitz, Anand Agneshwar, and Abe Krash.
I New York Penal Law § 125.15 (McKinney 1987) ("Manslaughter in the
second degree") provides: "A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when ...(3) He intentionally causes or aids another person to
commit suicide. Manslaughter in the second degree is a class C felony."
Section 120.30 ("Promoting a suicide attempt") states: "A person is guilty
of promoting a suicide attempt when he intentionally causes or aids another person to attempt suicide. Promoting a suicide attempt is a class
E felony." See generally Washington v. Glucksberg, ante, at 710-719.
2,,It is established under New York law that a competent person may
refuse medical treatment, even if the withdrawal of such treatment will
result in death." Quill v. Koppell, 870 F. Supp. 78, 84 (SDNY 1994); see
N. Y. Pub. Health Law, §§ 2960-2979 (McKinney 1993 and Supp. 1997) ("Orders Not to Resuscitate") (regulating right of "adult with capacity" to
direct issuance of orders not to resuscitate); id., §§2980-2994 ("Health
Care Agents and Proxies") (allowing appointment of agents "to make...
health care decisions on the principal's behalf," including decisions to refuse lifesaving treatment).

Opinion of the Court

District Court. They urged that because New York permits
a competent person to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment, and because the refusal of such treatment is "essentially the same thing" as physician-assisted suicide, New
York's assisted-suicide ban violates the Equal Protection
Clause. Quill v. Koppell, 870 F. Supp. 78, 84-85 (SDNY
1994).
The District Court disagreed: "[I]t is hardly unreasonable
or irrational for the State to recognize a difference between
allowing nature to take its course, even in the most severe
situations, and intentionally using an artificial deathproducing device." Id., at 84. The court noted New York's
"obvious legitimate interests in preserving life, and in protecting vulnerable persons," and concluded that "[u]nder the
United States Constitution and the federal system it establishes, the resolution of this issue is left to the normal democratic processes within the State." Id., at 84-85.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. 80
F. 3d 716 (1996). The court determined that, despite the
assisted-suicide ban's apparent general applicability, "New
York law does not treat equally all competent persons who
are in the final stages of fatal illness and wish to hasten their
deaths," because "those in the final stages of terminal illness
who are on life-support systems are allowed to hasten their
deaths by directing the removal of such systems; but those
who are similarly situated, except for the previous attachment of life-sustaining equipment, are not allowed to hasten
death by self-administering prescribed drugs." Id., at 727,
729. In the court's view, "[t]he ending of life by [the withdrawal of life-support systems] is nothing more nor less than
assisted suicide." Id., at 729 (emphasis added). The Court
of Appeals then examined whether this supposed unequal
treatment was rationally related to any legitimate state
their lives. App. 25-26; Declaration of William A. Barth, id., at 96-98;
Declaration of George A. Kingsley, id., at 99-102; Declaration of Jane Doe,
id., at 105-109.

Opinion of the Court

interests,5 and concluded that "to the extent that [New
York's statutes] prohibit a physician from prescribing medications to be self-administered by a mentally competent,
terminally-ill person in the final stages of his terminal illness, they are not rationally related to any legitimate state
interest." Id., at 731. We granted certiorari, 518 U. S. 1055
(1996), and now reverse.
The Equal Protection Clause commands that no State shall
"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." This provision creates no substantive
rights. San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 33 (1973); id., at 59 (Stewart, J., concurring).
Instead, it embodies a general rule that States must treat
like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.
Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 216 (1982) (" '[T]he Constitution
does not require things which are different in fact or opinion
to be treated in law as though they were the same' ") (quoting Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S. 141, 147 (1940)). If a legislative classification or distinction "neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold [it]
so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end."
Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 631 (1996).
New York's statutes outlawing assisting suicide affect and
address matters of profound significance to all New Yorkers
alike. They neither infringe fundamental rights nor involve
suspect classifications. Washington v. Glucksberg, ante, at
719-728; see 80 F. 3d, at 726; San Antonio School Dist., 411
U. S., at 28 ("The system of alleged discrimination and the
class it defines have none of the traditional indicia of suspectness"); id., at 33-35 (courts must look to the Constitution,
not the "importance" of the asserted right, when deciding
whether an asserted right is "fundamental"). These laws
5The court acknowledged that because New York's assisted-suicide statutes "do not impinge on any fundamental rights [or] involve suspect classifications," they were subject only to rational-basis judicial scrutiny. 80

are therefore entitled to a "strong presumption of validity."
Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319 (1993).
On their faces, neither New York's ban on assisting suicide
nor its statutes permitting patients to refuse medical treatment treat anyone differently from anyone else or draw
any distinctions between persons. Everyone, regardless of
physical condition, is entitled, if competent, to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment; no one is permitted to
assist a suicide. Generally speaking, laws that apply evenhandedly to all "unquestionably comply" with the Equal Protection Clause. New York City Transit Authority v.
Beazer, 440 U. S. 568, 587 (1979); see PersonnelAdministrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 271-273 (1979) ("[M]any
[laws] affect certain groups unevenly, even though the law
itself treats them no differently from all other members of
the class described by the law").
The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that some terminally ill people-those who are on life-support systemsare treated differently from those who are not, in that the
former may "hasten death" by ending treatment, but the latter may not "hasten death" through physician-assisted suicide. 80 F. 3d, at 729. This conclusion depends on the submission that ending or refusing lifesaving medical treatment
"is nothing more nor less than assisted suicide." Ibid. Unlike the Court of Appeals, we think the distinction between
assisting suicide and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment,
a distinction widely recognized and endorsed in the medical
profession 6 and in our legal traditions, is both important and
"The American Medical Association emphasizes the "fundamental difference between refusing life-sustaining treatment and demanding a lifeending treatment." American Medical Association, Council on Ethical
and Judicial Affairs, Physician-Assisted Suicide, 10 Issues in Law & Medicine 91, 93 (1994); see also American Medical Association, Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, Decisions Near the End of Life, 267 JAMA 2229,
2230-2231, 2233 (1992) ("The withdrawing or withholding of life-sustaining
treatment is not inherently contrary to the principles of beneficence and
nonmaleficence," but assisted suicide "is contrary to the prohibition

Opinion of the Court

logical; it is certainly rational. See Feeney, supra, at 272
("When the basic classification is rationally based, uneven
effects upon particular groups within a class are ordinarily
of no constitutional concern").
The distinction comports with fundamental legal principles
of causation and intent. First, when a patient refuses lifesustaining medical treatment, he dies from an underlying
fatal disease or pathology; but if a patient ingests lethal medication prescribed by a physician, he is killed by that medication. See, e. g., People v. Kevorkian, 447 Mich. 436, 470-472,
527 N. W. 2d 714, 728 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U. S. 1083
(1995); Matter of Conroy, 98 N. J. 321, 355, 486 A. 2d 1209,
1226 (1985) (when feeding tube is removed, death "result[s]
...from [the patient's] underlying medical condition"); In re
Colyer, 99 Wash. 2d 114, 123, 660 P. 2d 738, 743 (1983)
("[D]eath which occurs after the removal of life sustaining
systems is from natural causes"); American Medical Association, Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, PhysicianAssisted Suicide, 10 Issues in,Law & Medicine 91, 93 (1994)
("When a life-sustaining treatment is declined, the patient
dies primarily because of an underlying disease").
Furthermore, a physician who withdraws, or honors a patient's refusal to begin, life-sustaining medical treatment
purposefully intends, or may so intend, only to respect his
patient's wishes and "to cease doing useless and futile or degrading things to the patient when [the patient] no longer
stands to benefit from them." Assisted Suicide in the

organizations] consistently distinguish assisted suicide and euthanasia
from the withdrawing or withholding of treatment, and from the provision

Brief for American Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 18-25. Of
course, as respondents' lawsuit demonstrates, there are differences of
opinion within the medical profession on this question. See New York
Task Force, supra, at 104-109.

VACCO v. QUILL
Opinion of the Court

United States, Hearing before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 104th
Cong., 2d Sess., 368 (1996) (testimony of Dr. Leon R. Kass).
The same is true when a doctor provides aggressive palliative care; in some cases, painkilling drugs may hasten a patient's death, but the physician's purpose and intent is, or
may be, only to ease his patient's pain. A doctor who assists
a suicide, however, "must, necessarily and indubitably, intend
primarily that the patient be made dead." Id., at 367. Similarly, a patient who commits suicide with a doctor's aid necessarily has the specific intent to end his or her own life,
while a patient who refuses or discontinues treatment might
not. See, e. g., Matter of Conroy, supra, at 351, 486 A. 2d,
at 1224 (patients who refuse life-sustaining treatment "may
not harbor a specific intent to die" and may instead "fervently wish to live, but to do so free of unwanted medical
technology, surgery, or drugs"); Superintendent of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz, 373 Mass. 728, 743, n. 11, 370
N. E. 2d 417, 426, n. 11 (1977) ("[I]n refusing treatment the
patient may not have the specific intent to die").
The law has long used actors' intent or purpose to distinguish between two acts that may have the same result. See,
e. g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 403-406 (1980)
("[T]he ... common law of homicide often distinguishes ...

between a person who knows that another person will be
killed as the result of his conduct and a person who acts with
the specific purpose of taking another's life"); Morissette v.
United States, 342 U. S. 246, 250 (1952) (distinctions based on
intent are "universal and persistent in mature systems of
law"); M. Hale, 1 Pleas of the Crown 412 (1847) ("If A. with
an intent to prevent a gangrene beginning in his hand doth
without any advice cut off his hand, by which he dies, he is
not thereby felo de se for tho it was a voluntary act, yet it
was not with an intent to kill himself"). Put differently, the
law distinguishes actions taken "because of" a given end

Cite as: 521 U. S. 793 (1997)

Opinion of the Court

from actions taken "in spite of" their unintended but foreseen consequences. Feeney, 442 U. S., at 279; Compassion
in Dying v. Washington, 79 F. 3d 790, 858 (CA9 1996) (Kleinfeld, J., dissenting) ("When General Eisenhower ordered
American soldiers onto the beaches of Normandy, he knew
that he was sending many American soldiers to certain death
.... His purpose, though, was to ...liberate Europe from

the Nazis").
Given these general principles, it is not surprising that
many courts, including New York courts, have carefully distinguished refusing life-sustaining treatment from suicide.
See, e. g., Fosmire v. Nicoleau, 75 N. Y.2d 218, 227, and n. 2,
551 N. E. 2d 77, 82, and n. 2 (1990) ("[M]erely declining medical care ...

is not considered a suicidal act").7

In fact, the

first state-court decision explicitly to authorize withdrawing lifesaving treatment noted the "real distinction between
the self-infliction of deadly harm and a self-determination
against artificial life support." In re Quinlan, 70 N. J. 10,
43, 52, and n. 9, 355 A. 2d 647, 665, 670, and n. 9, cert. denied
sub nom. Garger v. New Jersey, 429 U. S. 922 (1976). And
recently, the Michigan Supreme Court also rejected the argument that the distinction "between acts that artificially
sustain life and acts that artificially curtail life" is merely a
"distinction without constitutional significance-a meaning7
Thus, the Second Circuit erred in reading New York law as creating a
"right to hasten death"; instead, the authorities cited by the court recognize a right to refuse treatment, and nowhere equate the exercise of this
right with suicide. Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital, 211
N. Y. 125, 129-130, 105 N. E. 92, 93 (1914), which contains Justice Cardozo's
famous statement that "[elvery human being of adult years and sound
mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body," was
simply an informed-consent case. See also Rivers v. Katz, 67 N. Y 2d 485,
495, 495 N. E. 2d 337, 343 (1986) (right to refuse antipsychotic medication is
not absolute, and may be limited when "the patient presents a danger to
himself"); Matter of Storar,52 N. Y.2d 363, 377, n. 6, 420 N. E. 2d 64, 71,

VACCO v. QUILL
Opinion of the Court

States move to protect and promote patients' dignity at the
end of life, they remain opposed to physician-assisted suicide.
New York is a case in point. The State enacted its current assisted-suicide statutes in 1965.' 0 Since then, New
York has acted several times to protect patients' commonlaw right to refuse treatment. Act of Aug. 7, 1987, ch. 818,
§ 1, 1987 N. Y. Laws 3140 ("Do Not Resuscitate Orders")
(codified as amended at N. Y. Pub. Health Law §§ 2960-2979
(McKinney 1993 and Supp. 1997)); Act of July 22, 1990, ch.
752, §2, 1990 N. Y. Laws 3547 ("Health Care Agents and
Proxies") (codified as amended at N. Y. Pub. Health Law
§§ 2980-2994 (McKinney 1993 and Supp. 1997)). In so doing,
however, the State has neither endorsed a general right to
"hasten death" nor approved physician-assisted suicide.
Quite the opposite: The State has reaffirmed the line between "killing" and "letting die." See N. Y. Pub. Health
Law § 2989(3) (McKinney 1993) ("This article is not intended
to permit or promote suicide, assisted suicide, or euthanasia"); New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, LifeSustaining Treatment: Making Decisions and Appointing a
Health Care Agent 36-42 (July 1987); Do Not Resuscitate
Orders: The Proposed Legislation and Report of the New
York State Task Force on Life and the Law 15 (Apr. 1986).
More recently, the New York State Task Force on Life and
Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 672.017, 672.020, 672.021 (1992); Utah Code
Ann. §§75-2-1116, 75-2-1118 (1993); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §5260 (1987);
Va. Code Ann. §54.1-2990 (1994); V. I. Code Ann., Tit. 19, §§ 198(a), (g)
(1995); Wash. Rev. Code §§70.122.070(1), 70.122.100 (Supp. 1997); W. Va.
Code §§ 16-30-10, 16-30A-16(a), 16-30B-2(b), 16-30B-13, 16-30C-14
(1995); Wis. Stat. §§ 154.11(1), (6), 154.25(7), 155.70(7) (Supp. 1996); Wyo.
Stat. §§3-5-211, 35-22-109, 35-22-208 (1994 and Supp. 1996). See also
42 U. S. C. §§ 14402(b)(1), (2), (4) (1994 ed., Supp. III) ("Assisted Suicide
Funding Restriction Act of 1997").
10It has always been a crime, either by statute or under the common
law, to assist a suicide in New York. See Marzen, O'Dowd, Crone, &
Balch, Suicide: A Constitutional Right?, 24 Duquesne L. Rev. 1, 205-210
(1985) (App.).

Opinion of the Court

the Law studied assisted suicide and euthanasia and, in 1994,
unanimously recommended against legalization. When
Death is Sought: Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the
Medical Context vii (1994). In the Task Force's view,
"allowing decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatment and
allowing assisted suicide or euthanasia have radically different consequences and meanings for public policy." Id., at
146.
This Court has also recognized, at least implicitly, the distinction between letting a patient die and making that patient die. In Cruzan v. Director,Mo. Dept. of Health, 497
U. S. 261, 278 (1990), we concluded that "[t]he principle that
a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty
interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions," and we assumed the existence of such a right for purposes of that case, id., at 279.
But our assumption of a right to refuse treatment was
grounded not, as the Court of Appeals supposed, on the proposition that patients have a general and abstract "right to
hasten death," 80 F. 3d, at 727-728, but on well-established,
traditional rights to bodily integrity and freedom from unwanted touching, Cruzan, 497 U. S., at 278-279; id., at 287288 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring). In fact, we observed that
"the majority of States in this country have laws imposing
criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide." Id., at 280. Cruzan therefore provides no support
for the notion that refusing life-sustaining medical treatment
is "nothing more nor less than suicide."
For all these reasons, we disagree with respondents' claim
that the distinction between refusing lifesaving medical
treatment and assisted suicide is "arbitrary" and "irrational." Brief for Respondents 44.11 Granted, in some cases,
1'Respondents also argue that the State irrationally distinguishes between physician-assisted suicide and "terminal sedation," a process respondents characterize as "induc[ing] barbiturate coma and then starv[ing] the person to death." Brief for Respondents 48-50; see 80 F. 3d,

VACCO v. QUILL
Opinion of the Court

the line between the two may not be clear, but certainty is
not required, even were it possible.12 Logic and contemporary practice support New York's judgment that the two acts
are different, and New York may therefore, consistent with
the Constitution, treat them differently. By permitting everyone to refuse unwanted medical treatment while prohibiting anyone from assisting a suicide, New York law follows a
longstanding and rational distinction.

New York's reasons for recognizing and acting on this distinction-including prohibiting intentional killing and preserving life; preventing suicide; maintaining physicians' role
as their patients' healers; protecting vulnerable people from
at 729. Petitioners insist, however, that "'[a]lthough proponents of
physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia contend that terminal sedation
is covert physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, the concept of sedating
pharmacotherapy is based on informed consent and the principle of double
effect."' Reply Brief for Petitioners 12 (quoting P. Rousseau, Terminal
Sedation in the Care of Dying Patients, 156 Archives Internal Med. 1785,
1785-1786 (1996)). Just as a State may prohibit assisting suicide while
permitting patients to refuse unwanted lifesaving treatment, it may permit palliative care related to that refusal, which may have the foreseen
but unintended "double effect" of hastening the patient's death. See New
York Task Force, When Death is Sought, supra n. 6, at 163 ("It is widely
recognized that the provision of pain medication is ethically and professionally acceptable even when the treatment may hasten the patient's
death, if the medication is intended to alleviate pain and severe discomfort,
not to cause death").
1We do not insist, as JUSTICE STEVENS suggests, ante, at 750 (opinion
concurring in judgments), that "in all cases there will in fact be a significant
difference between the intent of the physicians, the patients, or the families [in withdrawal-of-treatment and physician-assisted-suicide cases]."
See supra,at 801-802 ("[A] physician who withdraws, or honors a patient's
refusal to begin, life-sustaining medical treatment purposefully intends,
or may so intend, only to respect his patient's wishes ....
The same is
true when a doctor provides aggressive palliative care;... the physician's
purpose and intent is, or may be, only to ease his patient's pain" (emphasis
added)). In the absence of omniscience, however, the State is entitled to
act on the reasonableness of the distinction.

indifference, prejudice, and psychological and financial pressure to end their lives; and avoiding a possible slide towards
euthanasia-are discussed in greater detail in our opinion in
Glucksberg, ante. These valid and important public interests easily satisfy the constitutional requirement that a legislative classification bear a rational relation to some legiti13
mate end.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
It is so ordered.

concurring in the judgmeit.
Even though I do not conclude that assisted suicide is
a fundamental right entitled to recognition at this time, I
accord the claims raised by the patients and physicians in
this case and Washington v. Glucksberg a high degree of
importance, requiring a commensurate justification. See
Washington v. Glucksberg, ante, at 782 (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment). The reasons that lead me to conclude in
Glucksberg that the prohibition on assisted suicide is not arbitrary under the due process standard also support the distinction between assistance to suicide, which is banned, and
JUSTICE SOUTER,

'3 JUSTICE STEVENS observes that our holding today "does not foreclose

the possibility that some applications of the New York statute may impose
an intolerable intrusion on the patient's freedom." Ante, at 751-752 (opinion concurring in judgments). This is true, but, as we observe in Glucksberg, ante, at 735, n. 24, a particular plaintiff hoping to show that New
York's assisted-suicide ban was unconstitutional in his particular case
would need to present different and considerably stronger arguments than
those advanced by respondents here.
