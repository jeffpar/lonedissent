COHEN v. DE LA CRUZ ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 96-1923.

Argued January 20, 1998-Decided March 24, 1998

After the local rent control administrator ordered petitioner to refund
$31,382.50 in excessive rents he had charged respondent tenants, he
sought to discharge his debts under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code
(Code). The tenants filed an adversary proceeding, arguing that the
debt owed to them was nondischargeable under 11 U. S. C. § 523(a)(2)(A)
of the Code, which excepts from discharge "any debt ... for money,
property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to
the extent obtained by... actual fraud." They also sought treble damages, attorney's fees, and costs under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud
Act. The Bankruptcy Court ruled in their favor, finding that petitioner
had committed "actual fraud" within the meaning of § 523(a)(2)(A) and
that his conduct violated the New Jersey law. The court therefore
awarded the tenants treble damages totaling $94,147.50, plus attorney's
fees and costs. The District Court affirmed, as did the Third Circuit,
which held that debts resulting from fraud are nondischargeable in their
entirety under §523(a)(2)(A), and that the award of treble damages (plus
attorney's fees and costs) in this case was therefore nondischargeable.
Held Because §523(a)(2)(A) excepts from discharge all liability arising
from fraud, treble damages (plus attorney's fees and costs) awarded
on account of the debtor's fraud fall within the scope of the exception.
The most straightforward reading of § 523(a)(2)(A) is that it prevents
discharge of "any debt" respecting 'money, property, services, or...
credit" that the debtor has fraudulently obtained. See Field v. Mans,
516 U. S.59, 61, 64. First, an obligation to pay treble damages satisfies
the threshold condition that it constitute a "debt." That word is defined
as liability on a "claim," § 101(12), which in turn is defined as a 'right to
payment," § 101(5)(A), which this Court has said means an enforceable
obligation, Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495
U. S. 552, 559. An award of treble damages is an enforceable obligation
of the debtor, and the creditor has a corresponding right to payment.
Moreover, the phrase "to the extent obtained by" in §523(a)(2)(A) modifies 'money, property, services, or... credit"--not "any debt"--so that
the exception encompasses "any debt ...for money, property, [etc.], to
the extent [that the money, property, etc., is] obtained by" fraud. The
phrase thereby makes clear that the share of money, property, etc., so

COHEN

Opinion of the Court
obtained gives rise to a nondischargeable debt. Once it is established
that specific money or property has been obtained by fraud,'however,
"any debt" arising therefrom is excepted from discharge.
The Court rejects petitioner's argument that a "debt for" money,
property, etc., is necessarily limited to the value of the 'money, property,
services, or... credit" the debtor obtained by fraud, such that a restitutionary ceiling would be imposed on the extent to which a debtor's liability for fraud is nondischargeable. That argument is at odds with the
meaning of "debt for" in parallel exceptions to discharge set forth in
§523(a), which use "debt for" to mean "debt as a result of," "debt with
respect to," "debt by reason of," and the like. The Court's reading of
§523(a)(2)(A) is also reinforced by the fraud exception's history. Moreover, § 523(a)'s various exceptions from discharge reflect Congress' conclusion that the creditors' interest in recovering full payment of debts
in these categories outweighs the debtors' interest in a complete fresh
start, see Grogan v. Garner,498 U. S. 279, 287. But petitioner's construction of the fraud exception would leave creditors short of being
made whole whenever the loss to the creditor from the fraud exceeds
the value obtained by the debtor. Because, under New Jersey law, the
debt for fraudulently obtaining $31,382.50 in rent payments includes treble damages and attorney's fees and costs, petitioner's entire debt of
$94,147.50 (plus attorney's fees and costs) is nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Pp. 217-223.

property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing
of credit, to the extent obtained by... false pretenses, a false
representation, or actual fraud." 11 U. S. C. § 523(a)(2)(A).
The issue in this case is whether § 523(a)(2)(A) bars the discharge of treble damages awarded on account of the debtor's
fraudulent acquisition of "money, property, services, or...
credit," or whether the exception only encompasses the
value of the "money, property, services, or ... credit" the
debtor obtains through fraud. We hold that §523(a)(2)(A)
prevents the discharge of all liability arising from fraud, and
that an award of treble damages therefore falls within the
scope of the exception.
I
Petitioner owned several residential properties in and
around Hoboken, New Jersey, one of which was subject to
a local rent control ordinance. In 1989, the Hoboken Rent
Control Administrator determined that petitioner had been
charging rents above the levels permitted by the ordinance, and ordered him to refund to the affected tenants,
who are respondents in this Court, $31,382.50 in excess rents
charged. Petitioner did not comply with the order.
Petitioner subsequently filed for relief under Chapter 7
of the Bankruptcy Code, seeking to discharge his debts.
The tenants filed an adversary proceeding against petitioner
in the Bankruptcy Court, arguing that the debt owed to
them arose from rent payments obtained by "actual fraud"
and that the debt was therefore nondischargeable under 11
U. S. C. § 523(a)(2)(A). They also sought treble damages and
attorney's fees and costs pursuant to the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. See N. J. Stat. Ann. §§56:8-2, 56:8-19
(West 1989).
Following a bench trial, the Bankruptcy Court ruled in the
tenants' favor. In re Cohen, 185 B. R. 171 (1994); 185 B. R.
180 (1995). The court found that petitioner had committed
"actual fraud" within the meaning of 11 U. S. C. §523(a)(2)(A)
and that his conduct amounted to an "unconscionable corn-

mercial practice" under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud
Act. As a result, the court awarded the tenants treble damages totaling $94,147.50, plus reasonable attorney's fees and
costs. Noting that courts had reached conflicting conclusions on whether § 523(a)(2)(A) excepts from discharge punitive damages (such as the treble damages at issue here),
the Bankruptcy Court sided with those decisions holding
that §523(a)(2)(A) encompasses all obligations arising out of
fraudulent conduct, including both punitive and compensatory damages.* 185 B. R., at 188-189. The District Court
affirmed. 191 B. R. 599 (1996).
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in a
divided opinion. In re Cohen, 106 F. 3d 52 (1997). After
accepting the finding of the Bankruptcy Court that petitioner had committed fraud under § 523(a)(2)(A) and the New
Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, the Court of Appeals turned
to whether the treble damages portion of petitioner's liability represents a "debt ... for money, property, services,
or ... credit, to the extent obtained by ... actual fraud."

§523(a)(2)(A). The court observed that the term "debt,"
defined in the Code as a "right to payment," § 101(5)(A),
plainly encompasses all liability for fraud, whether in the
form of punitive or compensatory damages. And the phrase
"to the extent obtained by," the court reasoned, modifies
"money, property, services, or... credit," and therefore distinguishes not between compensatory and punitive damages
awarded for fraud but instead between money or property
obtained through fraudulent means and money or property
obtained through nonfraudulent means. Id., at 57. Here,
the court concluded, the entire award of $94,147.50 (plus
attorney's fees and costs) resulted from money obtained
*The Bankruptcy Court characterized an award of treble damages
under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act as punitive in nature, see 185
B. R., at 188, and the Court of Appeals assumed as much without deciding
the question, In re Cohen, 106 F. 3d 52, 55, n. 2 (CA3 1997). That issue
does not affect our analysis, and we have no occasion to revisit it here.

through fraud and is therefore nondischargeable. Id., at 59.
Judge Greenberg dissented, concluding that treble damages
are not encompassed by §523(a)(2)(A) because they "do not
reflect money, property, or services the debtor 'obtained."'
Id., at 60.
As the Court of Appeals recognized, id., at 56, its interpretation of § 523(a)(2)(A) is in accord with that of the Eleventh Circuit but in conflict with that of the Ninth Circuit.
Compare In re St. Laurent, 991 F. 2d 672, 677-681 (CAll
1993), with In re Levy, 951 F. 2d 196, 198-199 (CA9 1991).
Bankruptcy courts have likewise reached differing conclusions on whether §523(a)(2)(A) prevents the discharge in
bankruptcy of punitive damages awarded on account of
fraud. Compare In re George, 205 B. R. 679, 682 (Bkrtcy.
Ct. Conn. 1997) (punitive damages not dischargeable); In re
Spicer, 155 B. R. 795, 801 (Bkrtcy. Ct. DC) (same), aff 'd, 57
F. 3d 1152 (CADC 1995), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 1043 (1996);
In re Winters, 159 B. R. 789, 790 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Ky. 1993)
(same), with In re Bozzano, 173 B. R. 990, 997-999 (Bkrtcy.
Ct. MDNC 1994) (punitive damages dischargeable); In re
Sciscoe, 164 B. R. 86, 89 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Ind. 1993) (same);
In re Brady, 154 B. R. 82, 85 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Mo. 1993)
(same). We noted the issue without resolving it in Grogan
v. Garner,498 U. S.279, 282, n. 2 (1991). We granted certiorari to address the conflict in the lower courts, 521 U. S.
1152 (1997), and we now affirm.
II
The Bankruptcy Code has long prohibited debtors from
discharging liabilities incurred on account of their fraud,
embodying a basic policy animating the Code of affording
relief only to an "honest but unfortunate debtor." Grogan
v. Garner,498 U. S., at 287 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 290; Brown v. Felsen, 442 U. S. 127, 138
(1979). Section 523(a)(2)(A) continues the tradition, excepting from discharge "any debt.., for money, property, serv-

ices, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the
extent obtained by... false pretenses, a false representation,
or actual fraud."
The most straightforward reading of § 523(a)(2)(A) is that
it prevents discharge of "any debt" respecting "money, property, services, or ...credit" that the debtor has fraudulently obtained, including treble damages assessed on account of the fraud. See Field v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59, 61, 64
(1995) (describing § 523(a)(2)(A) as barring discharge of debts
"resulting from" or "traceable to" fraud). First, an obligation to pay treble damages satisfies the threshold condition that it constitute a "debt." A "debt" is defined in the
Code as "liability on a claim," § 101(12), a "claim" is defined
in turn as a "right to payment," § 101(5)(A), and a "right to
payment," we have said, "is nothing more nor less than
an enforceable obligation." Pennsylvania Dept. of Public
Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 559 (1990). Those
definitions "reflec[t] Congress' broad.., view of the class of
obligations that qualify as a 'claim' giving rise to a 'debt,"'
id., at 558, and they plainly encompass treble damages: An
award of treble damages is an "enforceable obligation" of
the debtor, and the creditor has a corresponding "right to
payment."
Moreover, the phrase "to the extent obtained by" in
§ 523(a)(2)(A), as the Court of Appeals recognized, does not
impose any limitation on the extent to which "any debt" arising from fraud is excepted from discharge. "[T]o the extent
obtained by" modifies "money, property, services, or .. .
credit"-not "any debt"-so that the exception encompasses
"any debt ...for money, property, services, or... credit, to
the extent [that the money, property, services, or ...credit

is] obtained by" fraud. The phrase thereby makes clear that
the share of money, property, etc., that is obtained by fraud
gives rise to a nondischargeable debt. Once it is established
that specific money or property has been obtained by fraud,
however, "any debt" arising therefrom is excepted from dis-

Opinion of the Court

charge. In this case, petitioner received rent payments
from respondents for a number of years, of which $31,382.50
was obtained by fraud. His full liability traceable to that
sum-$94,147.50 plus attorney's fees and costs-thus falls
within the exception.
Petitioner does not dispute that the term "debt" encompasses treble damages or that the phrase "to the extent
obtained by" modifies "money, property, services, or . . .
credit." He nonetheless contends that "any debt . . . for
money, property, services, or ... credit, to the extent obtained by" fraud does not include treble damages awarded
in a fraud action. Petitioner submits that § 523(a)(2)(A) excepts from discharge only the portion of the damages award
in a fraud action corresponding to the value of the "money,
property, services, or . . . credit" the debtor obtained by
fraud. The essential premise of petitioner's argument is
that a "debt for" money, property, or services obtained by
fraud is necessarily limited to the value of the money, property, or services received by the debtor. Petitioner, in this
sense, interprets "debt for"-or alternatively, "liability on a
claim for"--in §523(a)(2)(A) to mean "liability on a claim to
obtain," i. e., "liability on a claim to obtain the money, property, services, or credit obtained by fraud," thus imposing a
restitutionary ceiling on the extent to which a debtor's liability for fraud is nondischargeable.
Petitioner's reading of "debt for" in §523(a)(2)(A), however, is at odds with the meaning of the same phrase in parallel provisions. Section 523(a) defines several categories of
liabilities that are excepted from discharge, and the words
"debt for" introduce many of them, viz., "debt ... for a tax
or a customs duty.., with respect to which a return ... was
not ified," §523(a)(1)(B)(i), "debt... for fraud or defalcation
while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny," §523(a)(4), "debt ... for willful and malicious injury
by the debtor to another entity," §523(a)(6), and "debt ...
for death or personal injury caused by the debtor's op-

Opinion of the Court

eration of a motor vehicle if such operation was unlawful
because the debtor was intoxicated," § 523(a)(9). None of
these use "debt for" in the restitutionary sense of "liability
on a claim to obtain"; it makes little sense to speak of "liability on a claim to obtain willful and malicious injury" or
"liability on a claim to obtain fraud or defalcation." Instead,
"debt for" is used throughout to mean "debt as a result of,"
"debt with respect to," "debt by reason of," and the like, see
American Heritage Dictionary 709 (3d ed. 1992); Black's Law
Dictionary 644 (6th ed. 1990), connoting broadly any liability
arising from the specified object, see Davenport, supra, at
563 (characterizing §523(a)(7), which excepts from discharge
certain debts "for a fine, penalty, or forfeiture" as encompassing "debts arising from a 'fine, penalty, or forfeiture' ").
Because each use of "debt for" in § 523(a) serves the identical function of introducing a category of nondischargeable
debt, the presumption that equivalent words have equivalent
meaning when repeated in the same statute, e. g., Ratzlaf
v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 143 (1994), has particular
resonance here. And contrary to petitioner's submission,
it is of no moment that "debt for" in §523(a)(2)(A) has as its
immediate object a commodity (money, property, etc.), but in
some of the other exceptions has as its immediate object a
description of misconduct, e.g., §523(a)(4) ("debt for fraud
or defalcation [by a] fiduciary"). Section 523(a)(2)(A) also
describes misconduct ("false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud"), even if it first specifies the result of
that conduct (money, property, etc., obtained). The exception in §523(a)(9) is framed in the same way, initially specifying an outcome as the immediate object of "debt for" ("death
or personal injury"), and subsequently describing the misconduct giving rise to that outcome ("operation of a motor
vehicle [while] intoxicated"). It is clear that "debt for" in
that provision means "debt arising from" or "debt on account
of," and it follows that "debt for" has the same meaning in
§ 523(a)(2)(A). When construed in the context of the statute

Cite as: 523 U. S. 213 (1998)
Opinion of the Court

as a whole, then, § 523(a)(2)(A) is best read to prohibit the
discharge of any liability arising from a debtor's fraudulent
acquisition of money, property, etc., including an award of
treble damages for the fraud.
The history of the fraud exception reinforces our reading of § 523(a)(2)(A). The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 prohibited discharge of "judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations,"
§ 17, 30 Stat. 550, and an award of punitive damages for fraud
plainly fits in the category of "judgments in actions for
fraud." The exception was broadened in 1903 to include
all "liabilities for obtaining property by false pretenses or
false representations," § 5, 32 Stat. 798, language that, a
fortiori, encompasses liability for punitive damages. See
Brown, 442 U. S., at 138 (interpreting the provision as prohibiting discharge of "all debts arising out of conduct specified" therein); In re St. Laurent, 991 F. 2d, at 679 (noting
"practice of holding debts for punitive damages nondischargeable" under this exception "if the compensatory damages . . . were themselves nondischargeable"). And the
Bankruptcy Act of 1978 enacted a "substantially similar"
provision, Brown, supra, at 129, n. 1, barring discharge of
"any debt.., for obtaining money, property, services, or...
credit, by... false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud." 11 U. S. C. § 523(a)(2)(A) (1982 ed.).
As the result of a slight amendment to the language in
1984, referred to in the legislative history only as a "stylistic
change," see S. Rep. No. 98-65, p. 80 (1983), § 523(a)(2)(A)
now excepts from discharge "any debt... for money, property, services, or . . . credit, to the extent obtained by ...
false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud."
We, however, "will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode
past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure," Davenport, 495 U. S., at
563, and the change to the language of §523(a)(2)(A) in 1984
in no way signals an intention to narrow the established

Opinion of the Court

scope of the fraud exception along the lines suggested by
petitioner. If, as petitioner contends, Congress wished to
limit the exception to that portion of the debtor's liability
representing a restitutionary-as opposed to a compensatory
or punitive-recovery for fraud, one would expect Congress
to have made unmistakably clear its intent to distinguish
among theories of recovery in this manner. See, e. g.,
§523(a)(7) (barring discharge of debts "for a fine, penalty, or
forfeiture payable to ... a governmental unit," but only if

the debt "is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss").
The conclusion that § 523(a)(2)(A) bars the discharge of all
liability arising from fraud is further borne out by the implications of petitioner's alternative construction. The various
exceptions to discharge in §523(a) reflect a conclusion on the
part of Congress "that the creditors' interest in recovering
full payment of debts in these categories outweigh[s] the
debtors' interest in a complete fresh start." Grogan, 498
U. S., at 287. But if, as petitioner would have it, the fraud
exception only barred discharge of the value of any money,
property, etc., fraudulently obtained by the debtor, the objective of ensuring full recovery by the creditor would be ill
served. Limiting the exception to the value of the money
or property fraudulently obtained by the debtor could prevent even a compensatory recovery for losses occasioned by
fraud. For instance, if a debtor fraudulently represents that
he will use a certain grade of shingles to roof a house and is
paid accordingly, the cost of repairing any resulting water
damage to the house could far exceed the payment to the
debtor to install the shingles. See In re Church, 69 B. R.
425, 427 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Tex. 1987). The United States, as
amicus curiae, posits another example along these lines, involving "a debtor who fraudulently represents to aircraft
manufacturers that his steel bolts are aircraft quality [and]
obtains sales of $5,000" for the bolts, but "the fraud causes a
multi-million dollar airplane to crash." Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 21.

Cite as: 523 U. S. 213 (1998)
Opinion of the Court

As petitioner acknowledges, his gloss on § 523(a)(2)(A)
would allow the debtor in those situations to discharge any
liability for losses caused by his fraud in excess of the
amount he initially received, leaving the creditor far short of
being made whole. And the portion of a creditor's recovery
that exceeds the value of the money, property, etc., fraudulently obtained by the debtor-and that hence would be dischargeable under petitioner's view-might include compensation not only for losses brought about by fraud but also for
attorney's fees and costs of suit associated with establishing
fraud. But see §523(d) (allowing award of attorney's fees
and costs to the debtor where a creditor requests dischargeability determination under § 523(a)(2) for a consumer debt
that is ultimately found to be dischargeable). Those sorts
of results would not square with the intent of the fraud exception. As we have observed previously in addressing different issues surrounding the scope of that exception, it is
"unlikely that Congress ... would have favored the interest
in giving perpetrators of fraud a fresh start over the interest
in protecting victims of fraud." Grogan, supra, at 287.
In short, the text of § 523(a)(2)(A), the meaning of parallel
provisions in the statute, the historical pedigree of the fraud
exception, and the general policy underlying the exceptions
to discharge all support our conclusion that "any debt.., for
money, property, services, or ... credit, to the extent obtained by" fraud encompasses any liability arising from
money, property, etc., that is fraudulently obtained, including
treble damages, attorney's fees, and other relief that may
exceed the value obtained by the debtor. Under New Jersey law, the debt for fraudulently obtaining $31,382.50 in rent
payments includes treble damages and attorney's fees and
costs, and consequently, petitioner's entire debt of $94,147.50
(plus attorney's fees and costs) is nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeals.
It is so ordered.
