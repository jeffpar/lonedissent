GLENDORA v. PORZIO ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 97-7300.

Decided March 9, 1998

Held: Abusive filer's motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied; and
for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of

Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, she is barred from filing any further certiorari
petitions in noncriminal matters unless she first pays the required docketing fee and submits her petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.

Motion denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Glendora seeks leave to proceed informa
pauperis to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the
Second Circuit. The District Court dismissed petitioner's
claims alleging violation of her due process rights and a conspiracy to violate her due process rights under Rev. Stat.
ยง 1979, 42 U. S. C. ยง 1983, and 42 U. S. C. ยง 1985, respectively.
The claims, which arose out of a dispute with her landlord,
were based on purported "sewer service" used by her landlord's lawyers and acceptance of the affidavits of service by
the state-court trial judge. The Second Circuit denied petitioner's motion to proceed in forma pauperis and dismissed
her appeal as frivolous.
We deny petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis.
She is allowed until March 30, 1998, to pay the docketing fees
required by Rule 38 and to submit her petition in compliance
with Rule 33.1. For the reasons discussed below, we also
direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further petitions for certiorari in noncriminal matters from petitioner
unless she first pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38
and submits her petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.
Petitioner has filed 14 petitions with this Court since 1994.
All have been denied without recorded dissent. In 1997, we
invoked Rule 39.8 to deny petitioner in forma pauperis sta-

tus. Glendorav. DiPaola,522 U. S. 965. Petitioner nevertheless has filed another frivolous petition with this Court.
In her petition, Glendora asserts that the state trial court
judge who presided over her dispute with her landlord sanctioned "sewer service" by her landlord's lawyers, and that
the District Court and Court of Appeals sanctioned this conduct. She does not address the District Court's reasons for
dismissing her complaint.
Accordingly, we enter this order barring prospective in
forma pauperis filings by petitioner in noncriminal cases for
the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia
Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (percuriam).
It is so ordered.
dissenting.
For reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of
Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS,
J., dissenting), and cases cited, I respectfully dissent.
