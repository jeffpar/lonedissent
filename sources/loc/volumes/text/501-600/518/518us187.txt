LANE v. PENA, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION,
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
No. 95-365. Argued April 15, 1996-Decided June 20, 1996
Respondents terminated petitioner Lane's enrollment at the United States
Merchant Marine Academy on the ground that his recently diagnosed
diabetes mellitus rendered him ineligible to be commissioned for service
in the Navy/Merchant Marine Reserve Program or as a Naval Reserve
Officer. Alleging that his separation from the Academy violated
§504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973-which prohibits, among other
things, discrimination on the basis of disability "under any program or
activity conducted by any Executive agency"-Lane brought this suit
seeking reinstatement to the Academy, compensatory damages, and
other remedies. The District Court ordered him reinstated, but ultimately ruled that he must be denied compensatory damages because
Congress has not waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity
against monetary damages awards for §504(a) violations. The Court of
Appeals summarily affirmed.
Held: Congress has not waived the Government's sovereign immunity
against monetary damages awards for §504(a) violations. Pp. 191-200.
(a) The requisite "unequivocal expression" of congressional intent to
grant such a waiver, see, e. g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,
498 U. S. 89, 95, is lacking in the text of §505(a)(2), which decrees that
the remedies available for violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964-including monetary damages awards, see, e. g., Franklin v.
Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 70-apply also to §504(a)
violations "by any... Federal provider of [financial] assistance." This
provision makes no mention whatsoever of "program[s] or activit[ies]
conducted by any Executive agency," the plainly more far-reaching language Congress employed in §504(a) itself. The lack of the necessary
clarity of expression in §505(a)(2) is underscored by the precision with
which Congress has waived the Government's sovereign immunity in
§§ 501 and 505(a)(1) of the Act and in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
Lane's contention that the larger statutory scheme indicates congressional intent to "level the playing field" by subjecting the Government
to the same remedies as any and all other § 504(a) defendants is rejected.
Franklin,supra, at 69-71, distinguished. Pp. 191-197.

(b) The "equalization" provision of § 1003 of the 'Rehabilitation Act
Amendments of 1986-which, after waiving the States' Eleventh
Amendment immunity from federal-court suit for violations of §504 and
other civil rights statutes, specifies that legal and equitable remedies
are available in such a suit "to the same extent as... in the suit against
any public or private entity other than a State"--does not reveal congressional intent to equalize the remedies available against all defendants for §504(a) violations, such that federal agencies, like private entities, must be subject to monetary damages. Although Lane's argument
to this effect is not without force, it is ultimately defeated by the existence of at least two other conceivable, if not entirely satisfactory, interpretations of the equalization provision: (1) that "public ... entit[ies]"
refers to the nonfederal public entities receiving federal financial assistance that are covered by each of the. referenced federal statutes; and (2)
that "public or private entit[ies]" is meant only to subject the States to
the scope of remedies available against either public or private §504
defendants, whatever the lesser (or perhaps the greater) of those remedies might be. Pp. 197-200.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR

I

The United States Merchant Marine Academy is a federal
service academy that trains students to serve as commercial
merchant marine officers and as commissioned officers in the
United States Armed Forces. The Academy is administered
by the Maritime Administration, an organization within the
Department of Transportation. Petitioner James Griffin
Lane entered the Academy as a first-year student in July
1991 after meeting the Academy's requirements for appointment, including passing a physical examination conducted by
the Department of Defense. During his first year at the
Academy, however, Lane was diagnosed by a private physician as having diabetes mellitus. Lane reported the diagnosis to the Academy's Chief Medical Officer. The Academy's
Physical Examination Review Board conducted a hearing
in September 1992 to determine Lane's "medical suitability"
to continue at the Academy, following which the Board
reported to the Superintendent of the Academy that Lane
suffered from insulin-dependent diabetes.
In December 1992, Lane was separated from the Academy
on the ground that his diabetes was a "disqualifying condition," rendering him ineligible to be commissioned for service in the Navy/Merchant Marine Reserve Program or as a
Naval Reserve Officer. After unsuccessfully challenging his
separation before the Maritime Administrator, Lane brought

LANE v. PENA
Opinion of the Court

suit in Federal District Court against the Secretary of the
Department of Transportation and other defendants, alleging that his separation from the Academy violated § 504(a) of
the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U. S. C. § 794(a). He sought reinstatement to the Academy, compensatory damages, attorney's fees, and costs.
The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of
Lane,. concluding that his separation from the Academy
solely on the basis of his diabetes violated the Act. The
court ordered Lane reinstated to the Academy, and the Government did not dispute the propriety of this injunctive relief. The Government did, however, dispute the propriety
of a compensatory damages award, claiming that the United
States was protected against a damages suit by the doctrine
of sovereign immunity. The District Court disagreed; it
ruled that Lane was entitled to a compensatory damages
award against the Government for its violation of §504(a),
but deferred resolution of the specific amount of damages
due. 867 F. Supp. 1050 (DC 1994).
Shortly thereafter, however, the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit ruled in Dorsey v. United States
Dept. of Labor, 41 F. 3d 1551 (1994), that the Act did not
waive the Federal Government's sovereign immunity against
monetary damages for violations of § 504(a). The court denied compensatory damages based on the absence, in any
statutory text, of an "unequivocal expression" of congressional intent to waive the Government's immunity as to monetary damages, and this Court's instruction that waivers of
sovereign immunity may not be implied, see, e. g., Irwin v.
Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990).
In light of Dorsey, the District Court vacated its prior
order to the extent that it awarded damages to Lane and
held that Lane was not entitled to a compensatory damages
award against the Federal Government. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 5a-6a. Lane appealed. The Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit first rejected Lane's request for
initial en banc review to reconsider Dorsey, then granted the

Cite as: 518 U. S. 187 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

Government's motion for summary affirmance. App. to Pet.
for Cert. la. We granted certiorari, 516 U. S. 1036 (1996),
to resolve the disagreement in the Courts of Appeals on the
important question whether Congress has waived the Federal Government's immunity against monetary damages
awards for violations of § 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act.
Compare, e. g., Dorsey, supra, at 1554-1555, with J L. v.
Social Security Admin., 971 F. 2d 260 (CA9 1992), and Doe
v. Attorney General, 941 F. 2d 780 (CA9 1991).

Section 504(a) of the Act provides that
"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in
the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or
his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States
Postal Service." 29 U. S. C. § 794(a).
Section 505(a)(2) of the Act describes the remedies available
for a violation of § 504(a): "The remedies, procedures, and
rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
shall be available to any person aggrieved by any act or
failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance or Federal provider of such assistance under [§ 504]." § 794a(a)(2).
Because Title VI provides for monetary damages awards,
see Franklinv. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S.
60, 70 (1992) (noting that "a clear majority" of the Court confirmed in GuardiansAssn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New
York City, 463 U. S.582 (1983), that damages are available
under Title VI for intentional violations thereof), Lane reads
§§ 504(a) and 505(a)(2) together to establish a waiver of the
Federal Government's sovereign immunity against monetary
damages awards for violations of §504(a) committed by Executive agencies.

LANE v. PENA
Opinion of the Court

While Lane's analysis has superficial appeal, it overlooks
one critical requirement firmly grounded in our precedents:
A waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity
must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text, see, e. g.,
United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 33-34, 37
(1992), and will not be implied, Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, supra, at 95. Moreover, a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in
terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign. See, e.g.,
United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995) (when
confronted with a purported waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity, the Court will "constru[e] ambiguities in favor of immunity"); Library of Congress v. Shaw,
478 U. S. 310, 318 (1986); Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156,
161 (1981) ("[L]imitations and conditions upon which the
Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed
and exceptions thereto are not to be implied"). To sustain
a claim that the Government is liable for awards of monetary
damages, the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims. Nordic Village, 503
U. S., at 34. A statute's legislative history cannot supply a
waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text;
"the 'unequivocal expression' of elimination of sovereign
immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutory
text." Id., at 37.
The clarity of expression, necessary to establish a waiver
of the Government's sovereign immunity against monetary
damages for violations of § 504 is lacking in the text of the
relevant provisions. The language of §505(a)(2), the remedies provision, is telling. In that section, Congress decreed
that the remedies available for violations of Title VI would
be similarly available for violations of § 504(a) "by any recipient of Federal assistance or Federal provider of such assistance." 29 U. S. C. § 794a(a)(2). This provision makes no
mention whatsoever of "program[s] or activit[ies] conducted
by any Executive agency," the plainly more far-reaching

Cite as: 518 U. S. 187 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

language Congress employed in §504(a) itself. Whatever
might be said about the somewhat curious structure of the
liability and remedy provisions, it cannot be disputed that a
reference to "Federal provider[s]" of financial assistance in
§ 505(a)(2) does not, without more, establish that Congress
has waived the Federal Government's immunity against
monetary damages awards beyond the narrow category of
§ 504(a) violations committed by federal funding agencies
acting as such-that is, by "Federal provider[s]."
The lack of clarity in § 505(a)(2)'s "Federal provider" provision is underscored by the precision with which Congress
has waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity
from compensatory damages claims for violations of § 501
of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U. S. C. § 791, which prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability in employment decisions by the Federal Government. In § 505(a)(1), Congress
expressly waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity against certain remedies for violations of §501:
"The remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [which allows
monetary damages] ...

shall be available, with respect

to any complaint under section 501 of this Act, to any
employee or applicant for employment aggrieved by the
final disposition of such complaint, or by the failure
to take final action on such complaint." 29 U.S. C.
§794a(a)(1).
Section 505(a)(1)'s broad language-"any complaint under
section 501"--suggests by comparison with §505(a)(2) that
Congress did not intend to treat all § 504(a) defendants alike
with regard to remedies. Had Congress wished to make
Title VI remedies available broadly for all § 504(a) violations,
it could easily have used language in § 505(a)(2) that is
as sweeping as the "any complaint" language contained in
§ 505(a)(1).

LANE v. PENA

Opinion of the Court

But our analysis need not end there. In the Civil Rights
Act of 1991, Congress made perfectly plain that compensatory damages would be available for certain violations
of § 501 by the Federal Government (as well as other § 501
defendants), subject to express limitations:
"In an action brought by a complaining party under the
powers, remedies, and procedures set forth in... section
794a(a)(1) of title 29 [which applies to violations of §501
by the Federal Government] ...

against a respondent

who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination (not
an employment practice that is unlawful because of its
disparate impact) under section 791 of title 29 and the
regulations implementing section 791 of title 29, or who
violated the requirements of section 791 of title 29 or
the regulations implementing section 791 of title 29 concerning the provision of a reasonable accommodation,...
the complaining party may recover compensatory and
punitive damages as allowed in subsection (b) of this
section ... from the respondent." Rev. Stat. § 1977A,
as added, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 U. S. C. § 1981a(a)(2).
The Act's attorney's fee provision makes a similar point.
Section 505(b) provides that, "[i]n any action or proceeding
to enforce or charge a violation of a provision of this title,
the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party,
other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as
part of the costs." 29 U. S. C. §794a(b). This provision
likewise illustrates Congress' ability to craft a clear waiver
of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity against
particular remedies for violations of the Act. The clarity of
these provisions is in sharp contrast to the waiver Lane
seeks to tease out of §8 504 and 505(a)(2) of the Act.
Lane insists nonetheless that §505(a)(2) compels a result
in his favor, arguing that the Department of Transportation
is a "Federal provider" within the meaning of § 505(a)(2) and
thus is liable for a compensatory damages award regardless

Cite as: 518 U. S. 187 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

of our resolution of the broader sovereign immunity question. Reply Brief for Petitioner 8-9. We disagree. The
Department of Transportation, whatever its other activities,
is not a "Federal provider" of financial assistance with respect to the Merchant Marine Academy, which the Department itself administers through the Maritime Administration. At oral argument, Lane's counsel effectively conceded
as much. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (acknowledging that the
Department of Transportation is not a federal provider with
respect to the Academy "because of this Court's decision in
[Department of Transp. v. Paralyzed Veterans of America,
477 U. S. 597, 612 (1986)], which indicates that funds that
are actually provided to an entity that the Federal Government manages itself, which is what DOT does here.., for
the Merchant Marine Academy," do not render the agency a
"Federal provider"). Lane argues that §505(a)(2)'s reference to "Federal provider[s]" is not limited by the text of the
provision itself to the funding activities of those providers, but instead reaches "any act" of an agency that serves
as a "Federal provider" in any context. Reply Brief for
Petitioner 9, and n. 11. In light of our established practice
of construing waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly in
favor of the sovereign, however, we decline Lane's invitation
to read the statutory language so broadly.
Lane next encourages us to look not only at the language
of the liability and remedies provisions but at the larger statutory scheme, from which he would discern congressional
intent to "level the playing field" by subjecting the Federal
Government to the same remedies as any and all other
§504(a) defendants. A statutory scheme that would subject
the Federal Government to awards of injunctive relief, attorney's fees, and monetary damages when it acts as a "Federal
provider," but would not subject it to monetary damages
awards when, and only when, a federal Executive agency
itself commits a violation of § 504(a), Lane posits, is so illogi-

LANE v. PENA

Opinion of the Court

cal as to foreclose the conclusion that Congress intended to
create such a scheme.
The statutory scheme on which Lane hinges his argument
is admittedly somewhat bewildering. But the lack of perfect correlation in the various provisions does not indicate,
as Lane suggests, that the reading proposed by the Government is entirely irrational. It is plain that Congress is free
to waive the Federal Government's sovereign immunity
against liability without waiving its immunity from monetary damages awards. The Administrative Procedure Act
(APA) illustrates this nicely. Under the provisions of the
APA, "[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency
action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action
within the meaning of a relevant statute," is expressly authorized to bring "[a]n action in a court of the United States
seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim
that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or
failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal
authority." 5 U. S. C. § 702 (emphasis added).
In any event, Lane's "equal treatment" argument largely
misses the crucial point that, when it comes to an award of
money damages, sovereign immunity places the Federal GoVernment on an entirely different footing than private parties.
Petitioner's reliance on Franklinv. Gwinnett County Public
Schools, 503 U. S.60 (1992), then, is misplaced. In Franktin, we held only that the implied private right of action
under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 supports a claim for monetary damages. "[A]bsent clear direction to the contrary by Congress," we stated, "the federal
courts have the power to award any appropriate relief in a
cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute." Id., at 70-71. Franklin,however, involved an action
against nonfederal defendants under Title IX. Although the
Government does not contest the propriety of the injunctive
relief Lane obtained, the Federal Government's sovereign
immunity prohibits wholesale application of Franklinto ac-

Cite as: 518 U. S. 187 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

tions against the Government to enforce § 504(a). As the
Government puts it, "[w]here a cause of action is authorized
against the federal government, the available remedies are
not those that are 'appropriate,' but only those for which
sovereign immunity has been expressly waived." Brief for
Respondents 28.
And Lane's "equal treatment" argument falters as well on
a point previously discussed: Section 505(a)(2) itself indicates
congressional intent to treat federal Executive agencies differently from other § 504(a) defendants for purposes of remedies. See supra, at 192-193. The existence of the § 505(a)
(2) remedies provision brings this case outside the "general
rule" we discussed in Franklin:This is not a case in which "a
right of action exists to enforce a federal right and Congress
is silent on the question of remedies." 503 U. S., at 69. Title
IX, the statute at issue in Franklin, made no mention of
available remedies. Id., at 71. The Rehabilitation Act, by
sharp contrast, contains a provision labeled "Remedies and
attorney fees," §505. Congress has thus spoken to the question of remedies in § 505(a)(2), the only "remedies" provision
directly addressed to § 504 violations, and has done so in a
way that suggests that it did not in fact intend to waive the
Federal Government's sovereign immunity against monetary
damages awards for Executive agencies' violations of §504(a).
Given the existence of a statutory provision that is directed
precisely to the remedies available for violations of § 504, it
would be a curious application of our sovereign immunity
jurisprudence to conclude, as the dissent appears to do, see
post, at 209-210, that the lack of clear reference to Executive
agencies in any express remedies provision indicates congressional intent to subject the Federal Government to monetary damages.
III
Even if §§ 504(a) and 505(a)(2) together do not establish
the requisite unequivocal waiver of immunity, Lane insists,
the "equalization" provision contained in § 1003 of the Reha-

LANE v. PENA

Opinion of the Court

bilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U. S. C.
§2000d-7, reveals congressional intent to equalize the remedies available against all defendants for § 504(a) violations.
Section 1003 was enacted in response to our decision in Atascadero State Hospitalv. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234 (1985), where
we held that Congress had not unmistakably expressed its
intent to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity in the Rehabilitation Act, and that the States accordingly were not "subject to suit in federal court by litigants
seeking retroactive monetary relief under §504." Id., at
235. By enacting § 1003, Congress sought to provide the
sort of unequivocal waiver that our precedents demand.
That section provides:
"(1) A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh
Amendment... from suit in Federal court for a violation
of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX
of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, or the provisions of any other Federal statute
prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal
financial assistance.
"(2) In a suit against a State for a violation of a statute referred to in paragraph (1), remedies (including
remedies both at law and in equity) are available for
such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are
available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State." 42 U. S. C.
§ 2000d-7(a).
The "public entities" to which § 1003 refers, Lane concludes,
must include the federal Executive agencies named in
§ 504(a), and those agencies must be subject to the same
remedies under §504(a), including monetary damages, as are
private entities.
Although Lane's argument is not without some force,
§ 1003 ultimately cannot bear the weight Lane would assign

Cite as: 518 U. S. 187 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

it. The equalization provision is susceptible of at least two
interpretations other than the across-the-board leveling of
liability and remedies that Lane proposes. Under the first
such interpretation, as proposed by the Government, the
"public ... entit[ies]" to which the statute refers are "the
non-federal public entities receiving federal financial assistance that are covered by" each of the statutes to which
§ 1003(a)(1) refers: The Rehabilitation Act, Title VI, Title
IX, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. Brief for Respondents 22. The Government's suggestion is a plausible
one: that § 1003(a)(2) refers to municipal hospitals, local
school districts, and the like, which are unquestionably subject to each of the Acts listed in § 1003(a)(1). Section 504
alone among the listed Acts, however, extends its coverage
to "program[s] or activit[ies] conducted by any Executive
agency."
Section 1003 is also open to a second interpretation, one
similar to the "leveling" interpretation suggested by petitioner: By reference to "public or private entit[ies]," Congress meant only to subject the States to the scope of
remedies available against either public or private §504
defendants, whatever the lesser (or perhaps the greater) of
those remedies might be. Lane's reading of the statuteone that would suggest that all § 504(a) defendants, including
the States, are subject to precisely the same remedies for
violations of that provision-would effectively read out of
the statute the very language on which he seeks to rely.
That is, if the same remedies are available against all governmental and nongovernmental defendants under §504(a), the
"public or private" language is entirely superfluous. Congress could have achieved the result Lane suggests simply
by subjecting States to the same remedies available against
"every other entity," without further elaboration. The fact
that § 1003(a)(2) itself separately mentions public and private
entities suggests that there is a distinction to be made in

LANE v. PENA
STEVENS, J., dissenting

terms of the remedies available against the two classes of
defendants.
Although neither of these conceivable readings of
§ 1003(a)(2) is entirely satisfactory, their existence points up
a fact fatal to Lane's argument: Section 1003(a) is not so free
from ambiguity that we can comfortably conclude, based
thereon, that Congress intended to subject the Federal Government to awards of monetary damages for violations of
§ 504(a) of the Act. Given the care with which Congress responded to our decision in Atascadero by crafting an unambiguous waiver of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity in § 1003, it would be ironic indeed to conclude that that
same provision "unequivocally" establishes a waiver of the
Federal Government's sovereign immunity against monetary
damages awards by means of an admittedly ambiguous reference to "public . . . entit[ies]" in the remedies provision

attached to the unambiguous waiver of the States' sovereign immunity.
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS,

with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,

dissenting.
The Court relies on an amalgam of judge-made rules to
defeat the clear intent of Congress to authorize an award of
damages against a federal Executive agency that violates
§504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U. S. C. § 794. To
reach this unfortunate result, the majority ignores the Act's
purpose, text, and legislative history, relying instead on an
interpretation of the structure of §§ 504 and 505 that the
Court admits is "curious," ante, at 193, and "somewhat bewildering," ante, at 196.
The relevant facts are undisputed. The Department of
Transportation violated § 504 by separating petitioner Lane

from the Merchant Marine Academy because he has diabetes.
Lane was injured by that violation, and he is therefore entitled to maintain an action against the agency under § 504.
The parties and the Court agree that damages are an appropriate form of relief for most violations of § 504, including
wrongful conduct by private recipients of federal funding,
by state actors, and by federal agencies acting in a funding
capacity. The only issue in the case is whether Congress
carved out a special immunity from damages liability for federal agencies acting in a nonfunding capacity, as the Department of Transportation was acting in this instance. I think
it plain that Congress did not.
I
Congress passed the Rehabilitation Act to "develop and
implement, through research, training, services, and the
guarantee of equal opportunity, comprehensive and coordinated programs of vocational rehabilitation and independent
living" for the disabled. 29 U. S. C. §701, as amended by
Pub. L. 95-602, Title I, § 122(a)(1), 92 Stat. 2984. As originally enacted in 1973, § 504 of the Act provided:
"No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the
United States... shall, solely by reason of his handicap,
be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."
Pub. L. 93-112, 87 Stat. 394.
Althbugh the Court pays scant attention to the principle, we
have previously held that congressional intent with respect
to a statutory provision must be interpreted in the light
of the contemporary legal context. Franklin v. Gwinnett
County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 71 (1992). A review of
the relevant authorities convinces me that §504 created a
private cause of action with a damages remedy.
The text of § 504 was modeled on the language of § 601
of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits

discrimination by any recipient of federal funds on the basis
of race, color, or national origin.' Following passage of Title
VI, federal courts unanimously held that § 601 created a private cause of action. See Cannon v. University of Chicago,
441 U. S. 677, 696 (1979). Although we have never expressly
ruled on the question, our opinion in Cannon implicitly ratified that judgment. Id., at 703.
Our explicit holding in Cannon was that Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972, which was also patterned on
Title VI, created a private cause of action.2 This conclusion
stemmed, in part, from our understanding that Congress
meant Title IX to be interpreted and applied in the same
manner as Title VI. Id., at 696. We presumed, consistent
with well-established principles of statutory interpretation,
that Congress was aware of the relevant legal context when
it passed Title IX. Id., at 696-697. We also noted that between the enactment of Title VI in 1964 and the enactment
of Title IX in 1972 we had consistently found implied remedies in less clear statutory text. Id., at 698.
Congress passed § 504 in 1973, just one year after
enacting Title IX. Relying on analysis like that set
forth in Cannon, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly
held that Congress intended § 504 to provide a private
3
right of action for victims of prohibited discrimination.

I The precise language of § 601 is as follows: "No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 42 U. S. C. §2000d.
2 Section 901 of Title IX provides: "No person in the United States shall,
on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or
activity receiving Federal financial assistance ....
" 86 Stat. 873, as
amended, 20 U. S. C. § 1681(a).

In my opinion the Courts of Appeals are undoubtedly
4
correct.
Our decision in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public
Schools, 503 U. S.60 (1992), makes it equally clear that all
traditional forms of relief, including damages, are available
in a private action to enforce § 504. In Franklin we held
that a plaintiff could seek monetary damages against a school
system accused of violating her rights under Title IX. We
canvassed the long history of the principle that "where legal
rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for
a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may
use any available remedy to make good the wrong done."
Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.678, 684 (1946). See Franklin,503
U. S., at 65-71. Applying this rule to the implied cause of
action in Title IX, we rejected the government's contention
that "whatever the traditional presumption may have been
when the Court decided Bell v. Hood, it has disappeared in
succeeding decades." Id., at 68. From Franklinit follows
izieluctably that the original version of § 504-enacted, it
bears repeating, one year after Title IX-authorized a damages remedy for persons aggrieved by violations of the provision's discrimination ban.

1978 to extend § 504's prohibition against discrimination on

the basis of handicap to cover the actions of federal Executive agencies. The amendment was part of a lengthy piece
of legislation intended to strengthen the protections embodied in the original Act. See Rehabilitation, Comprehensive
Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments ' of
1978, Pub. L. 95-602, 92 Stat. 2955 (statement of purpose).
The legislation evidenced Congress' continued commitment
to the broad goals of the earlier Act by, for example, adding
provisions aimed at improving accountability and enforcement, see, e. g., Pub. L. 95-602, Title I, §§ 122(a)(1O), 106,
109(4), 29 U. S. C. §§ 711-715, 751, 761b; expanding federal
support for research programs, see, e. g., Pub. L. 95-602,
Title I, §§ 109(4), 104(c)(1), 29 U. S. C. §§ 761a, 762a; augmenting funding for projects such as job training and the removal
of physical barriers in public places, see, e. g., Pub. L. 95-602,
Title I, §§ 116(2), 120(a), 29 U. S. C. § 777 et seq., §794b; and
creating local rehabilitation centers across the Nation, see
Pub. L. 95-602, Title 1, § 115(a), 29 U. S. C. §775. Together,
the amendments represented a substantial financial "ftivestment in the future of the disabled in this country.
As part of this general expansion of the original Act, Congress amended §504 to forbid discrimination against the
handicapped "under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity
conducted by-any Executive agency or by the United States
Postal Service." 5 29 U. S. C. §794(a). The question we ad5

dress here is whether this unambiguous extension of §504
to federal agencies was meant to waive the Government's
sovereign immunity to damages liability. The answer is
surely "yes." Section 504 as originally enacted was understood to create a private right of action for aggrieved individuals and to authorize a damages remedy. Congress, acting in 1978, had no reason to expect the courts to require a
clearer statement respecting the remedies available against
a federal defendant than those available against any other
§ 504 defendant. And the text of the amendment-which
simply inserted the phrase extending coverage to federal
agencies into the existing sentence prohibiting discrimination by federal grantees-gives no indication whatsoever
that Congress intended to create a different remedial scheme
for the agencies.
The Court rejects this conclusion, however, because it
reads another part of the 1978 amendment, § 505(a)(2), as a
limitation on the remedies available against Executive agencies under § 504. In my judgment, the Court errs by misinterpreting the language and structure of § 505 and ignoring
its legislative history.
Congress' intent to strengthen the Act's protections is
clearly evident in § 505. The inclusion of an attorney's fees
provision in § 505(b) fortified the Act's enforcement mechanisms. This assistance to plaintiffs was necessary, according
to the Senate Report accompanying the amendments, because "the rights extended to handicapped individuals under
title V ... are, and will remain, in need of constant vigilance by handicapped individuals to assure compliance ...
S. Rep. No. 95-890, p. 19 (1978).6
The remedies provision, § 505(a), was also meant to ensure
compliance with the 1973 Act, not to restrict remedies that
Congress had made available under § 504, as the majority

would have it. The section's legislative history demonstrates Congress' intent.
Between the enactment of § 504 in 1973 and the passage of
§505(a)(2) in 1978, 7 the Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare promulgated model regulations for federal agencies to use in implementing the antidiscrimination principle
announced in §504. See 43 Fed. Reg. 2132 (1978).8 Because of the common understanding that § 504 was patterned
on §601 of Title VI, 42 U. S. C. § 2000d, and intended to be
enforced in the same manner,9 the Department simply directed the agencies to follow the procedures they used to
enforce Title VI. See 43 Fed. Reg. 2137, § 85.5 (1978). This
directive resulted in uniform enforcement mechanisms for
allegations of discrimination by federal grantees on the basis
of handicap, race, color, or national origin.10 Moreover, it
avoided needless duplication of effort. Section 601 is accompanied by additional provisions explaining Congress' in'The fall text of §505(a)(2) reads as follows: "The remedies, procedures,
and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be
available to any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance or Federal provider of such assistance under
section 504 of this Act." 29 U. S. C. §794a(a)(2).
8The Department acted pursuant to a directive from President Ford.
See Exec. Order No. 11914, "Nondiscrimination With Respect to the Handicapped in Federally Assisted Programs," issued on April 28, 1976; 41 Fed.
Reg. 17871. Congress had encouraged the President to take this step.
See Conference Report on 1974 Amendments, at 28 ("The Secretary of the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, because of that Department's experience in dealing with handicapped persons and with the elimination of discrimination in other areas, should assume responsibility for
The conferees ...
coordinating the section 504 enforcement effort ....
urge ... delegation of responsibility to the Secretary [through an Executive Order]").
9See id., at 27 (the "language of section 504, in following [Title VI and
Title IX],... envisions the implementation of a compliance program which
is similar to those Acts").
10 Congress plainly intended this result. See ibid. ("This approach to
implementation of section 504 . . . would ... provide for administrative
due process").

tentions with respect to implementation of the provision's
mandate. See 42 U. S. C. § 2000d-1 et seq. As originally
enacted, § 504 stood alone. It therefore made sense to allow
federal agencies to take advantage of the details included
in Title VI and the regulations promulgated to enforce
§ 601.
In enacting § 505(a)(2), Congress explicitly recognized and
approved the application of Title VI's enforcement procedures to § 504. Thus, despite the Court's narrow focus on
the incorporation of the remedies provided by Title VI,
§ 505(a)(2) provides that the "remedies, procedures, and
rights" set forth in Title VI are available to an individual
aggrieved by the conduct of a federal grant recipient. 29
U. S. C. § 794a(a)(2) (emphasis added). As the Senate Report explained:
"It is the committee's understanding that the regulations promulgated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare with respect to procedures, remedies,
and rights under section 504 conform with those promulgated under title VI. Thus, this amendment codifies
existing practice as a specific statutory requirement."
S. Rep. No. 95-890, at 19.
Viewed in this context, the reference in § 505(a)(2) to "Federal provider[s]" that the Court finds so puzzling is easily
understood: The compliance mechanisms defined in Title VI
include remedies, procedures, and rights applicable to the
providers of federal financial assistance as well as to the recipients of such assistance. See 29 U. S. C. §2000d-1 et seq.;
see, e.g., 34 CFR §§ 100.6-100.10 (1995) and Part 101 (Department of Education regulations implementing Title VI);
45 CFR §§80.6-80.10 (1995) and Part 81 (same for Department of Health and Human Services); id., §§611.6-611.10
(same for National Science Foundation).

employment, has a similar history." The provision was intended to "aid in attaining" the goals of §501 "by providing
for individuals aggrieved on the basis of their handicap the
same rights, procedures, and remedies provided [to] individuals aggrieved on the basis of race, creed, color, or national
origin." S. Rep. No. 95-890, at 18-19. Like § 504, § 501 is
not accompanied by any provisions concerning implementation. Section 505(a)(1) directs the executive to look to Title
VII for appropriate "remedies, procedures, and rights." 29
U. S. C. § 794a(a)(1) (emphasis added).
Unlike §501 and the clause of § 504 relating to recipients
of federal financial assistance, the prohibition on handicap
discrimination in programs or activities conducted by federal
Executive agencies had no simple statutory analogue. The
Court opines that if "Congress [had] wished to make Title
VI remedies available broadly for all § 504(a) violations, it
could easily have used language in § 505(a)(2) that is as
sweeping as the 'any complaint' language contained in
§ 505(a)(1)." Ante, at 193. I agree. Congress did not so
intend, however, because, in the words of the United States,
"[i]t would have been odd for Congress to have provided that
Title VI remedies applied in Section 504 cases involving discrimination by executive agencies because Title VI [unlike
§ 504] does not prohibit discrimination in programs or activi" Section 505(a)(1) provides: "The remedies, procedures, and rights set
forth in section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U. S. C. § 2000e-16),
including the application of sections 706(f) through 706(k) (42 U. S. C.
§2000e-5(f) through (k)), shall be available, with respect to any complaint
under section 501 of this Act, to any employee or applicant for employment
aggrieved by the final disposition of such complaint, or by the failure to
take final action on such complaint. In fashioning an equitable or affirmative action remedy under such section, a court may take into account the
reasonableness of the cost of any necessary work place accommodation,
and the availability of alternatives therefor or other appropriate relief
in order to achieve an equitable and appropriate remedy." 29 U. S. C.

ties conducted by executive agencies," Brief for Respondents
16, n. 8.
The oddity extends beyond the nomenclature used to describe §504 defendants. There are at least two substantive
differences between federal Executive agencies and federal
grantees as defendants under the provision. First, Title VI
provides remedies that are appropriate against recipients of
federal financial assistance, such as the withdrawal of funding for continuing violations, see 42 U. S. C. §2000d-1, but
that make no sense if applied against an agency defendant.
Secoidd, some violations that an agency might commit concern discrimination more closely analogous to statutory provisions outside of Title VI. Thus, the standard enforcement
procedures adopted for alleged violations of §504 involving
employment discrimination by federal agencies require the
agency to follow §501 enforcement procedures. See, e. g., 7
CFR § 15e.170(b) (1995) (Department of Agriculture regulations implementing § 504's mandate to federal agencies); 15
CFR § 8c.70 (1995) (same for Department of Commerce); 45
CFR §85.61 (1995) (same .for Department of Health and
Human Services).
Viewed in its historical context, §505(a)(2) simply has
no application to violations of § 504 committed by federal
agencies acting in a nonfunding capacity. Section 505(a)(2)
delineates the remedies, procedures, and rights available to
persons aggrieved by the ponduct of federal grantees and
federal funding agencies. It is silent on the'remedies, pros
cedures and rights available for transgressions of § 504 by
federal Executive agencies acting in a nonfunding capacity.
The relief to which petitioner is entitled is rooted in §504
itself.
In my opinion, § 504 is amply sufficient to meet petitioner's
needs. By failing to dictate explicitly the remedies available against federal agencies, Congress left in place the remedies that accompany § 504's implied cause of action. As
Congress understood in both 1973 and 1978, these remedies

LANE v. PENA
STEVENS,

J., dissenting

include monetary damages.' 2 Thus, as of 1978, the Rehabilitation Act provided the relief sought by petitioner in this
case.
Under the Court's current jurisprudence, however, § 504
apparently must be read in a vacuum. Since the advent of
United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S.30 (1992), the
Court not only requires the traditional clear statement of
a waiver of sovereign immunity but steadfastly refuses to
consider the legislative history of a statute, no matter how
13
opaque the statutory language or crystalline the history.
I shall not review my objections to that holding here. See
id., at 39-46 (dissenting opinion). Suffice it to say that Congress had no reason to suspect in 1978 that 14 years later
this Court would adopt (and apply retroactively) a radically
new and unforgiving approach to waivers of sovereign
immunity.
III

Not surprisingly, given its lack of fidelity to the statutory
text and history, the Court's reasoning leads to two implausible conclusions. To credit the Court's analysis, one must believe that Congress intended a damages remedy against a
federal Executive agency acting indirectly in the provision
12Aware that procedures were also needed, Congress added language in
§ 504 directing federal agencies to promulgate appropriate procedures.
29 U. S. C. § 794(a) ("The head of each such agency shall promulgate such
regulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendments to this section made by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Act of 1978").
11The Court distinguishes Franklinv. Gwinnett County PublicSchools,
503 U. S. 60 (1992), on the ground that Franklin involved a nonfederal
defendant whereas this case concerns a federal defendant. Ante, at 196197. This argument cannot be reconciled with the reasoning of our opinion. Franklin relied on cases in which pecuniary awards against the
United States had been upheld. See 503 U. S., at 67 (citing Kendall v.
United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524 (1838), and Dooley v. United
States, 182 U. S.222 (1901)). That being so, there is no basis for restricting application of the rule to the facts of that case.

of funding to nonfederal entities, but not against an agency
acting directly in the conduct of its own programs and activities. 14 Surely such an unexpected result would have merited comment in a committee report or on the floor of the
House or Senate. Yet there is not a scintilla of evidence in
the purpose or legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act or
its amendments supporting this interpretation of the statute.
In addition, the majority's holding necessarily presumes
that Congress intended to impose harsher remedies on the
States (which come under the § 504 provision prohibiting
handicap discrimination by federal grantees) than on federal
agencies for comparable misconduct. Given the special respect owed to the States-a respect that provided the ratio
decidendi for our decision in Atascadero State Hospital v.
Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985)-this suggestion is wholly
unconvincing. And once again, the legislative history of the
Rehabilitation Act contains no mention of such an intent and
no hint of a policy justification for this distinction.
The Court's strict approach to statutory waivers of sovereign immunity leads it to concentrate so carefully on textual
details that it has lost sight of the primary purpose of judicial
construction of Acts of Congress. We appropriately rely on
canons of construction as tie breakers to help us discern Congress' intent when its message is not entirely clear. The
presumption against waivers of sovereign immunity serves
that neutral purpose in doubtful cases. A rule that refuses
to honor such a waiver because it could have been expressed
with even greater clarity, or a rule that refuses to accept
guidance from relevant and reliable legislative history, does
not facilitate-indeed, actually obstructs-the neutral performance of the Court's task of carrying out the will of
Congress.
14

Even under the majority's interpretation, "Federal provider" must
refer exclusively to Executive agencies. Otherwise §505(a)(2) would create remedies against entities that may not be held liable under §504.

LANE v. PENA
STEVENS,

J., dissenting

The prompt congressional reaction to our decision in Atascadero illustrates the lack of wisdom of the Court's rigid approach to waivers of sovereign immunity.15 It was true in
that case, as it is in this, that Congress could have drafted a
clearer statement of its intent. Our task, however, is not to
educate busy legislators in the niceties and details of scholarly draftsmanship, but rather to do our best to determine
what message they intended to convey. When judge-made
rules require Congress to use its valuable time enacting and
reenacting provisions whose original intent was clear to all
but the most skeptical and hostile reader, those rules should
be discarded.
I respectfully dissent.

The Court decided Atascadero in 1985. Congress passed legislation
to override the decision in 1986. See Rehabilitation Act Amendments of
1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U. S. C. § 2000d-7; see also ante, at 198. In recent
years Congress has enacted numerous pieces of legislation designed to
override statutory opinions of this Court. See Landgraf v. USI Film
Products,511 U. S. 244, 250-251 (1994) (listing eight decisions legislatively
overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1991). Additional examples are cited
