GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 95-719. Argued April 16, 1996-Decided June 24, 1996
Under the law of New York, appellate courts are empowered to review
the size of jury verdicts and to order new trials when the jury's award
"deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation."
N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules (CPLR) § 5501(c). Under the Seventh
Amendment, which governs proceedings in federal court, but not in
state court, "the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact
tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the
United States, than according to the rules of the common law." The
compatibility of these provisions, in an action based on New York law
but tried in federal court by reason of the parties' diverse citizenship,
is the issue the Court confronts in this case.
Petitioner Gasperini, a journalist and occasional photographer, loaned
300 original slide transparencies to respondent Center for Humanities,
Inc. When the Center lost the transparencies, Gasperini commenced
suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, invoking the court's diversity jurisdiction. The Center
conceded liability. After a trial on damages, a jury awarded Gasperii
$1,500 per transparency, the asserted "industry standard" of compensation for a lost transparency. Contending, inter alia, that the verdict
was excessive, the Center moved for a new trial. The District Court,
without comment, denied the motion.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, observing that New
York law governed the controversy, endeavored to apply CPLR § 5501(c)
to evaluate the Center's contention that the verdict was excessive.
Guided by New York Appellate Division decisions reviewing damage
awards for lost transparencies, the Second Circuit held that the $450,000
verdict "materially deviates from what is reasonable compensation."
The court vacated the judgment entered on the jury verdict and ordered
a new trial, unless Gasperini agreed to an award of $100,000.
Held: New York's law controlling compensation awards for excessiveness
or inadequacy can be given effect, without detriment to the Seventh
Amendment, if the review standard set out in CPLR § 5501(c) is applied
by the federal trial court judge, with appellate control of the trial court's
ruling confined to "abuse of discretion." Pp. 422-439.

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.
Syllabus

(a) To heighten the judicial chdck on "the size of jury awards, New
York codified the "deviates materially" standard of review, replacing the
judge-made "shock the conscience" formulation previously used in New
York courts. In design and operation, § 5501(c) influences outcomes by
tightening the range of tolerable awards. Although phrased as a direction to New York's intermediate appellate courts, §5501(c)'s "deviates
materially" standard, as construed by New York's courts, instructs state
trial judges as well. Pp. 422-425.
(b) In cases like Gasperini's, in which New York law governs the
claims for relief, the Court must determine whether New York'law also
supplies the test for federal-court review of the size of the verdict.
Federal diversity jurisdiction provides an alternative forum for the adjudication of state-created rights, but it does not carry with it generation of rules of substantive law. Under the doctrine of Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, federal courts sitting in diversity apply state
substantive law and federal procedural law. Classification of a law as
"substantive" or "procedural" for Erie purposes is sometimes a challenging endeavor. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, an early
interpretation of Erie, propounded an "outcome-determination" test:
"[D]oes it significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court
to disregard a law of a State that would be controlling in an action upon
the same claim by the same parties in a State court?" 326 U. S., at 109.
A later pathmarking case, qualifying Guaranty Trust, explained that
the "outcome-determination" test must not be applied mechanically to
sweep in all manner of variations; instead, its application must be guided
by "the twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forum-shopping
and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws." Hanna v.
Plumer,380 U. S. 460, 468.
Informed by these decisions, the Court concludes that, although
§5501(c) contains a procedural instruction assigning decisionmaking
authority to the New York Appellate Division, the State's objective is
manifestly substantive. More rigorous comparative evaluations attend
application of § 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard than the
common-law "shock the conscience" test. If federal courts ignore the
change in the New York standard and persist in applying the "shock the
conscience" test to damage awards on claims governed by New York
law, "'substantial' variations between state and federal [money judgments]" may be expected. See id., at 467-468. The Court therefore
agrees with the Second Circuit that New York's check on excessive damages warrants application in federal court, for Erie's doctrine precludes
a recovery in federal court significantly larger than the recovery that
would have been tolerated in state court. Pp. 426-431.

Syllabus
(c) Nonetheless, when the Second Circuit used § 5501(c) as the standard for federal appellate review, it did not attend to "[aln essential characteristic of [the federal court] system." Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural
Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525,.537. The Seventh Amendment,
which governs proceedings in federal court, but not in state court, bears
not only on the allocation of trial functions between judge and jury, the
issue in Byrd; it also controls the allocation of authority to review verdicts, the issue of concern here. In keeping ' ith the historic understanding, the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause does not inhibit the authority of trial judges to grant new trials 'or any of the
reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at
law in the courts of the United States." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a). In
contrast, appellate review of a federal trial court's denial of a motion to
set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a relatively late, and less secure,
development. Such review, once deemed inconsonant with the Seventh
Amendment's Reexamination Clause, has not been expressly approved
by this Court before today. See, e. g., Browning-FerrisIndustries of
Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279, n. 25. Circuit decisions uinanimously recognize, however, that appellate review, confined
to abuse of discretion, is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment as
a control necessary and proper to the fair administration ofjustice. The
Court now approves this line of decisions. Pp. 431-436.
(d) In this case, the principal state and federal interests can be accommodated. New York's dominant interest in having its substantive law
guide the allowable damages arising out of a state-law claim for relief
can be respected, without disrupting the federal system, once it is recognized that the federal district court is capable of applying the State's
"deviates materially" standard. The Court recalls, in this regard, that
the "deviates materially" standard serves as the guide to be applied in
trial as well as appellate courts in New York. Within the federal system, practical reasons combine with Seventh Amendment constraints to
lodge in the district court, not the court of appeals, primary responsibility for application of §5501(c)'s check. District court applications of the
"deviates materially" standard would be subject to appellate review
under the standard the Circuits now employ when inadequacy or excessiveness is asserted on appeal: abuse of discretion. Pp. 436-439.
(e) It does not appear that the District Court checked the jury's verdict against the relevant New York decisions. Accordingly, the Court
vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals and instructs that court
to remand the case to the District Court so that the trial judge, revisiting his ruling on the new trial motion, may test the jury's verdict
against CPLR §5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard. P. 439.
66 F. 3d 427, vacated and remanded.

Opinion of the Court

The compatibility of these provisions, in an action based on
New York law but tried in federal court by reason of the
parties' diverse citizenship, is the issue we confront in this
case. We hold that New York's law controlling compensation awards for excessiveness or inadequacy can be given
effect, without detriment to the Seventh Amendment, if the
review standard set out in CPLR § 5501(c) is applied by the
federal trial court judge, with appellate control of the trial
court's ruling limited to review for "abuse of discretion."
I
Petitioner William Gasperini, a journalist for CBS News
and the Christian Science Monitor, began reporting on
events in Central America in 1984. He earned his living
primarily in radio and print media and only occasionally sold
his photographic work. During the course of his seven-year
stint in Central America, Gasperini took over 5,000 slide
transparencies, depicting active war zones, political leaders,
and scenes from daily life. In 1990, Gasperini agreed to
supply his original color transparencies to The Center for
Humanities, Inc. (Center) for use in an educational videotape,
Conflict in Central America. Gasperini selected 300 of his
slides for the Center; its videotape included 110 of them.
The Center agreed to return the original transparencies, but
upon the completion of the project, it could not find them.
Gasperini commenced suit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, invoking the
court's diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1332.1
He alleged several state-law claims for relief, including
breach of contract, conversion, and negligence. See App.
5-6. The Center conceded liability for the lost transparencies and the issue of damages was tried before a jury.
1

Plaintiff Gasperini, petitioner here, is a citizen of California; defendant
Center, respondent here, is incorporated, and has its principal place of
business, in New York.

420

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

At trial, Gasperini's expert witness testified that the "industry standard" within the photographic publishing community valued a lost transparency at $1,500. See id., at 227.
This industry standard, the expert explained, represented
the average license fee a commercial photograph could earn
over the full course of the photographer's copyright, i. e., in
Gasperini's case, his lifetime plus 50 years. See id., at 228;
see also 17 U. S. C. § 302(a). Gasperini estimated that his
earnings from photography totaled just over $10,000 for the
period from 1984 through 1993. He also testified that he
intended to produce a book containing his best photographs
from Central America. See App. 175.
After a three-day trial, the jury awarded Gasperini
$450,000 in compensatory damages. This sum, the jury foreperson announced, "is [$11500 each, for 800 slides." Id., at
313. Moving for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 59, the Center attacked the verdict on various
grounds, including excessiveness. Without comment, the
District Court denied the motion. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. 12a.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the
judgment entered on the jury's verdict. 66 F. 3d 427 (1995).
Mindful that New York law governed the controversy, the
Court of Appeals endeavored to apply CPLR § 5501(c), which
instructs that, when a jury returns an itemized verdict, as
the jury did in this case, the New York Appellate Division
"shall determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if
it deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation." The Second Circuit's application of § 5501(c) as
a check on the size of the jury's verdict followed Circuit precedent elaborated two weeks earlier in Consortiv. Armstrong
World Industries, Inc., 64 F. 3d 781, superseded, 72 F. 3d
1003 (1995). Surveying Appellate Division decisions that
reviewed damage awards for lost transparencies, the Second
Circuit concluded that testimony on industry standard alone
was insufficient to justify a verdict; prime among other fac-

Cite as: 518 U. S. 415 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

tors warranting consideration were the uniqueness of the2
slidep' subject matter and the photographer's earning level.
Guided-by Appellate Division rulings, the Second Circuit
held that the $450,000 verdict "materially deviates from
what is reasonable compensation." 66 F. 3d, at 431. Some
of Gasperini's transparencies, the Second Circuit recognized,
were unique, notably those capturing combat situations in
which Gasperini was the only photographer present. Id., at
429. But others "depicted either generic scenes or events
at which other professional photojournalists were present."
Id., at 431. No more than 50 slides merited a $1,500 award,
the court concluded, after "[gliving Gasperini every benefit
of the doubt." Ibid. Absent evidence showing significant
earnings from photographic endeavors or concrete plans to
publish a book, the court further determined, any damage
award above $100 each for the remaining slides would be
excessive. Remittiturs "presen[t] difficult problems for appellate courts," the Second Circuit acknowledged, for court
of appeals judges review the evidence from "a cold paper
record." Ibid. Nevertheless, the Second Circuit set aside
the $450,000 verdict and ordered a new trial, unless Gasperini agreed to an award of $100,000.

422

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

This case presents an important question regarding the
standard a federal court uses to measure the alleged excessiveness of a jury's verdict in an action for damages based
on state law. We therefore granted certiorari. 516 U. S.
1086 (1996).
Before 1986, state and federal courts in New York generally invoked the same judge-made formulation in responding
to excessiveness attacks on jury verdicts: courts would not
disturb an award unless the amount was so exorbitant that
it "shocked the conscience of the court." See Consorti, 72
F. 3d, at 1012-1013 (collecting cases). As described by the
Second Circuit:
"The standard for determining excessiveness and the
appropriateness of remittitur in New York is somewhat
ambiguous. Prior to 1986, New York law employed the
same standard as the federal courts, see Matthews v.
CTI Container TransportInt'l Inc., 871 F. 2d 270, 278
(2d Cir. 1989), which authorized remittitur only if the
jury's verdict was so excessive that it 'shocked the conscience of the court."' Id., at 1012.
See also D. Siegel, Practice Commentaries C5501:10, reprinted in 7B McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York
Ann., p. 25 (1995) ("conventional standard for altering the
verdict was that its sum was so great or so small that it
'shocked the conscience' of the court").
In both state and federal courts, trial judges made the
excessiveness assessment in the first instance, and appellate
judges ordinarily deferred to the trial court's judgment.
See, e. g., McAllister v. Adam Packing Corp., 66 App. Div.
2d 975, 976, 412 N. Y. S. 2d 50, 52 (3d Dept. 1978) ("The trial
court's determination as to the adequacy of the jury verdict
will only be disturbed by an appellate court where it can
be said that the trial court's exercise of discretion was not
reasonably grounded."); Martell v. Boardwalk Enterprises,

Cite as: 518 U. S. 415 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

Inc., 748 F. 2d 740, 750 (CA2 1984) ("The trial court's refusal
to set aside or reduce a jury award will be overturned only

for abuse of discretion.").
In 1986, as part of a series of tort reform measures, 3
New York codified a standard for judicial review of the size

of jury awards.

Placed in CPLR § 5501(c), the prescription

reads:

"In reviewing a money judgment.., in which it is contended that the award is excessive or inadequate and

that a new trial should have been granted unless a stipulation is entered to a different award, the appellate division shall determine that an award is excessive or in-

from what would be
adequate if it deviates materially
4
reasonable compensation."

As stated in Legislative Findings and Declarations accompanying New York's adoption of the "deviates materially"
formulation, the lawmakers found the "shock the conscience"
test an insufficient check on damage awards; the legislature

therefore installed a standard "invit[ing] more careful appellate scrutiny." Ch. 266, 1986 N. Y. Laws 470 (McKinney).
At the same time, the legislature instructed the Appellate

Division, in amended § 5522, to state the reasons for the
court's rulings on the size of verdicts, and the factors the
3

The legislature sought, particularly, to curtail medical and dental malpractice, and to contain "already high malpractice premiums." Legislative Findings and Declaration, Ch. 266, 1986 N. Y. Laws 470 (McKinney).
4 In full, CPLR § 5501(c) provides:
"The appellate division shall review questions of law and questions of
fact on an appeal from a judgment or order of a court of original instance
and on an appeal from an order of the supreme court, a county court or
an appellate term determining an appeal. In reviewing a money judgment in an action in which an itemized verdict is required by rule fortyone hundred eleven of this chapter in which it is contended that the award
is excessive or inadequate and that a new trial should have been granted
unless a stipulation is entered to a different award, the appellate division
shall determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if it deviates
materially from what would be reasonable compensation."

Opinion of the Court

court considered in complying with § 5501(c).6 In his signing
statement, then-Governor Mario Cuomo emphasized that the
CPLR amendments were meant to rachet up the review
standard: "This will assure greater scrutiny of the amount
of verdicts and promote greater stability in the tort system and greater fairness for similarly situated defendants
throughout the State." Memorandum on Approving L.
1986, Ch. 682, 1986 N. Y. Laws, at 3184; see also Newman &

Ahmuty, Appellate Review of Punitive Damage Awards, in
Insurance, Excess, and Reinsurance Coverage Disputes 1990,
p. 409 (B. Ostrager & T. Newman eds. 1990) (review standard
prescribed in § 5501(c) "was intended to ... encourage Appellate Division modification of excessive awards").
New York state-court opinions confirm that § 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard calls for closer surveillance than
"shock the conscience" oversight. See, e. g., O'Connor v.
Graziosi, 131 App. Div. 2d 553, 554, 516 N. Y. S. 2d 276, 277
(2d Dept. 1987) ("apparent intent" of 1986 legislation was "to
facilitate appellate changes in verdicts"); Harvey v. Mazal
American Partners,79 N. Y. 2d 218, 225, 590 N. E. 2d 224,
228 (1992) (instructing Appellate Division to use, in setting
remittitur, only the "deviates materially" standard, and not
the "shock the conscience" test); see also Consorti, 72 F. 3d,
at 1013 ("Material deviation from reasonableness is less than
that deviation required to find an award so excessive as to
'shock the conscience.'"); 7 J. Weinstein, H. Korn, & A.
Miller, New York Civil Practice 5501.21, p. 55-64 (1995)
("Under [§ 5501(c)'s] new standard, the reviewing court is
given greater power to review the size of a jury award than
had heretofore been afforded ...
5 CPLR § 5522(b) provides:

"In an appeal from a money judgment in an action... in which it is
contended that the award is excessive or inadequate, the appellate division
shall set forth in its decision the reasons therefor, including the factors it

considered in complying with subdivision (c) of section fifty-five hundred
one of this chapter."

Cite as: 518 U. S. 415 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

Although phrased as a direction to New York's intermediate appellate courts, §5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard, aS construed by New York's courts, instructs state trial
judges as well. See, e. g., Inya v. Ide Hyundai, Inc., 209
App. Div. 2d 1015, 619 N. Y. S. 2d 440 (4th Dept. 1994) (error
for trial court to apply "shock the conscience" test to motion
to 'set aside damages; proper standard ig whether award
"materially deviates from what would be reasonable compensation"); Cochetti v. Gralow, 192 App. Div. 2d 974, 975, 597
N. Y. S. 2d 234, 235 (3d Dept. 1993) ("settled law" that trial
courts .conduct "materially deviates" inquiry); Shurgan v.
Tedesco, 179 App. Div. 2d 805, 806, 578 N. Y. S. 2d 658, 659 (2d
Dept. 1992) (approving trial court's application of "materially
deviates" standard); see also Lightfoot v. Union Carbide
Corp., 901 F. Supp. 166, 169 (SDNY 1995) (CPLR 5501(c)'s
"materially deviates" standard "is pretty well established as
applicable to [state] trial and appellate courts."). Application of § 5501(c) at the trial level is key to this case.
To determine whether an award "deviates materially from
what would be reasonable compensation," New York state
courts look to awards approved in similar cases. See, e. g.,
Leon v. J & M Peppe Realty Corp., 190 App. Div. 2d 400,
416, 596 N. Y. S. 2d 380, 389 (1st Dept. 1993) ("These awards
... are not out of line with recent awards sustained by appel-

late courts."); Johnston v. Joyce, 192 App, Div. 2d 1124, 1125,
596 N. Y. S. 2d 625, 626 (4th Dept. 1993) (reducing award to
maximum amount previously allowed for similar type of
harm). Under New York's former "shock the conscience"
test, courts also referred to analogous cases. See, e. g.,
Senko v. Fonda, 53 App. Div. 2d 638, 639, 384 N. Y. S. 2d
849, 851 (2d Dept. 1976). The "deviates materially" standard, however, in design and operation, influences outcomes
by tightening the range of tolerable awards. See, e.g.,
Consorti, 72 F. 3d, at 1013, and n. 10, 1014-1015, and
n. 14.

426

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

III

In cases like Gasperini's, in whi6h New York law governs
the claims for relief, does New York law also supply the test
for federal-court review of the size of the verdict? The Center answers yes. The "deviates materially" standard, it argues, is a substantive standard that must be applied by federal appellate courts in diversity cases. The Second Circuit
agreed. See 66 F. 3d, at 430; see also Consorti, 72 F. 3d,
at 1011 ("[CPLR § 5501(c)] is the substantive rule provided
by New York law."). Gasperini, emphasizing that § 5501(c)
trains on the New York Appellate Division, characterizes the
provision as procedural, an allocation of decisionmaking authority regarding damages, not a hard cap on the amount
recoverable. Correctly comprehended, Gasperini urges,
§5501(c)'s direction to the Appellate Division cannot be given
effect by federal appellate courts without violating the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause.
As the parties' arguments suggest, CPLR § 5501(c), appraised under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938),
and decisions in Erie's path, is both "substantive" and "procedural": "substantive" in that § 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard controls how much a plaintiff can be awarded;
"procedural" in that §5501(c) assigns decisionmaking authority to New York's Appellate Division. Parallel application
of §5501(c) at the federal appellate level would be out of sync
with the federal system's division of trial and appellate court
functions, an allocation weighted by the Seventh Amendment. The dispositive question, therefore, is whether federal courts can give effect to the substantive thrust of
§5501(c) without untoward alteration of the federal scheme
for the trial and decision of civil cases.
A
Federal diversity jurisdiction provides an alternative
forum for the adjudication of state-created rights, but it does
not carry with it generation of rules of substantive law. As

Cite as: 518 U. S. 415 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

Erie read the Rules of Decision Act: 6 "Except in matters
governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the
State." 304 U. S., at 78. Under the Erie doctrine, federal
courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and
federal procedural law.
Classification of a law as "substantive" or "procedural"
for Erie purposes is sometimes a challenging endeavor.7
Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99 (1945), an

Originally §34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Rules of Decision Act,
now contained in 28 U. S. C. §1652, reads: "The laws of the several states,
except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of
Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where
they apply."
7Concerning matters covered by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
the characterization question is usually unproblematic: It is settled that if
the Rule in point is consonant with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C.
§ 2072, and the Constitution, the Federal Rule applies regardless of contrary state law. See Hannav. Plumer,380 U. S. 460, 469-474 (1965); Burlington NorthernR. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1987). Federal courts
have interpreted the Federal Rules, however, with sensitivity to important state interests and regulatory policies. See, e. g., Walker v. Armco
Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 750-752 (1980) (reaffirming decision in Ragan v.
Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949), that state law
rather than Rule 3 determines when a diversity action commences for the
purposes of tolling the state statute of limitations; Rule 3 makes no reference to the tolling of state limitations, the Court observed, and accordingly
found no "direct conflict"); S. A Healy Co. i7.Milwaukee Metropolitan
Sewerage Dist., 60 F. 3d 305, 310-312 (CA7 1995) (state provision for offers

Opinion of the Court

anty Trust: "[Wihere a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should
be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the
outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State
court." Ibid.; see also Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &
Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530, 533 (1949) (when local law that
creates the cause of action qualifies it, "federal court must
follow suit," for "a different measure of the cause of action
in one court than in the other [would transgress] the principle of Erie"). A later pathmarking case, qualifying Guaranty Trust, explained that the "outcome-determination" test
must not be applied mechanically to sweep in all manner of
variations; instead, its application must be guided by "the
twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forumshopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the
laws." Hanna v. Plumer,380 U. S.460, 468 (1965).
Informed by these decisions, we address the question
whether New York's "deviates materially" standard, codified
in CPLR § 5501(c), is outcome affective in this sense: Would
"application of the [standard] ...have so important an effect

upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that failure
to [apply] it would [unfairly discriminate against citizens of
the forum State, or] be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose
8
the federal court"? Id., at 468, n. 9.
We start from a point the parties do not debate. Gasperini acknowledges that a statutory cap on damages would'supply substantive law for Erie purposes. See Reply Brief for
8

Hanna keyed the question to Erie's "twin aims"; in full, Hanna instructed federal courts to ask "whether application of the [State's] rule
would make so important a difference to the character or result of the

litigation that failure to enforce it would unfairly discriminate against citizens of the forum State, or whether application of the rule would have so
important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that
failure to enforce it would be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose the federal
court." 380 U. S., at 468, n. 9.

Petitioner 2 ("[T]he state as a matter of its substantive law
may, among other things, eliminate the availability of damages for a particular claim entirely, limit the factors a jury
may consider in determining damages, or place an absolute
cap on the amount of damages available, and such substantive law would be applicable in a federal court sitting in diversity."); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5, 25; Consorti,72 F.
3d, at 1011. 9 Although CPLR §5501(c) is less readily classified, it was designed to provide an analogous control.
New York's Legislature codified in §5501(c) a new standard, one that requires closer court review than the commonlaw "shock the conscience" test. See -supra, at 422-423.
More rigorous comparative evaluations attend application
of § 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard. See supra, at
423-425. To foster predictability, the legislature required
the reviewing court, when overturning a verdict under
§ 5501(c), to state its reasons, including the factors it considered relevant. See CPLR § 5522(b); supra, at 423-424. We
think it a fair conclusion that CPLR § 5501(c) differs from
a statutory cap principally "in that the maXimum amount
recoverable is not set forth by statute, but rather is determined by case law." Brief for City of New York as Amicus
Curiae 11. In sum, §5501(c) contains a procedural instruction, see supra,at 426, but the Stateds objective is manifestly
substantive. Cf. S. A. Healy Co. v. Milwaukee Metropolitan

It thus appears that if federal courts ignore the change in
the New York standard and persist in applying the "shock

Hanna,380 U. S., at 467-468.11 We therefore agree with the
Second Circuit that New York's check on excessive damages
implicates what we have called Erie's "twin aims." See

York "actually appl[y]".or "ought" to apply the "shock the conscience" test
in assessing a jury's award for excessiveness. Post, at 465-466 (collecting
various formulations of review standard). If there is a federal district
court standard, it must come from the Court of Appeals, not from the over
40 district court judges in the Southern District of New York, each of
whom sits alone and renders decisions not binding on the others. Indeed,
in Ismail v. Cohen, 899 F. 2d 183 (1990), the authority upon which JUSTICE
SCALIA relies, the Second Circuit stated that district courts test damage
awards for excessiveness under the "shock the conscience" standard. See
id., at 186 ("A remittitur, in effect, is a statement by the court that it is
shocked by the jury's award of damages."); see also Scala v. Moore McCormack Lines, Inc., 985 F. 2d 680, 683 (CA2 1993) ("[I]n the federal courts,
a judgment cannot stand where the damages awarded are so excessive as
to shock the judicial conscience.") (internal quotation marks and citation

" JUSTICE SCALIA questions whether application of CPLR § 5501(c), in
lieu of the standard generally used by federal courts within the Second
Circuit, see supra, at 422, will in fact yield consistent outcome differentials, see post, at 465, 466. The numbers, as the Second Circuit believed,
are revealing. See 66 F. 3d 427, 430 (1995). Is the difference between
an award of $450,000 and $100,000, see supra, at 421, or between $1,500
per transparency and $500, see supra, at 421, n. 2, fairly described as
insubstantial? We do not see how that can be so.
1 For rights that are state created, state law governs the amount properly awarded as punitive damages, subject to an ultimate federal constitutional check for exorbitancy. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,

Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S.257, 278-279 (1989). An evenhanded approach
would require federal-court deference to endeavors like New York's to
control compensatory damages for excessiveness. See infra,at 435, n. 18.

337 U. S., at 533-534, so Erie precludes a recovery in federal
court significantly larger than the recovery that would have
been tolerated in state court.
B
CPLR § 5501(c), as earlier noted, see supra, at 425, 426, is
phrased as a direction to the New York Appellate Division.
Acting essentially as a surrogate for a New York appellate
forum, the Court of Appeals reviewed Gasperini's award to
determine if it "deviate[d] materially" from damage awards
the Appellate Division permitted in similar circumstances.
The Court of Appeals performed this task without benefit of
an opinion from the District Court, which had denied "without comment" the Center's Rule 59 motion. 66 F. 3d, at 428.
Concentrating on the authority § 5501(c) gives to the Appellate Division, Gasperini urges that the provision shifts factfinding responsibility from the jury and the trial judge to the
appellate court. Assigning such responsibility to an appellate court, he maintains, is incompatible with the Seventh
Amendment's Reexamination Clause, and therefore, Gasperini concludes, § 5501(c) cannot be given effect in federal court.
Brief for Petitioner 19-20. Although we reach a different
conclusion than Gasperini, we agree that the Second Circuit
did not attend to "[a]n essential characteristic of [the federal
court] system," Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,
Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), when it used §5501(c) as "the
standard for [federal] appellate review," Consorti, 72 F. 3d,
at 1013; see also 66 F. 3d, at 430.
That "essential characteristic" was described in Byrd, a
diversity suit for negligence in which a pivotal issue of fact
would have been tried by a judge were the case in state
court. The Byrd Court held that, despite the state practice,' 3 the plaintiff was entitled to a jury trial in federal court.
13 The defendant argued in Byrd that although the personal injury plaintiff was employed by an independent contractor, the work plaintiff was
engaged to perform was the same as work done by defendant's own em-

432

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

In so ruling, the Court said that the Guaranty Trust
"outcome-determination" test was an insufficient guide in
cases presenting countervailing federal interests. See
Byrd, 356 U. S., at 537. The Court described the countervailing federal interests present in Byrd this way:
"The federal system is an independent system for administering justice to litigants who properly invoke its
jurisdiction. An essential characteristic of that system
is the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it
distributes trial functions between judge and jury and,
under the influence-if not the command-of the Seventh Amendment, assigns the decisions of disputed
questions of fact to the jury." Ibid. (footnote omitted).
The Seventh Amendment, which governs proceedings in
federal court, but not in state court,14 bears not only on the
allocation of trial functions between judge and jury, the issue
in Byrd; it also controls the allocation of authority to review
verdicts, the issue of concern here. The Amendment reads:
"In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy
shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury
shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be
otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United
States, than according to the rules of the common law."
U. S. Const., Amdt. 7.
Byrd involved the first Clause of the Amendment, the
"trial by jury" Clause. This case involves the second, the
"re-examination" Clause. In keeping with the historic unployees. Therefore, defendant maintained, the plaintiff ranked as a "statutory employee" whose sole remedy was under the State's workers' compensation law. The sameness of the work plaintiff and defendant's own

employees performed presented a fact question, but in state court, a jury
trial would not have been available to resolve it.

establishment of our Government."); see also Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Yeatts, 122 F. 2d 350, 353 (CA4 1941)
("The exercise of [the trial court's power to set aside the
jury's verdict and grant a new trial] is not in derogation of
the right of trial by jury but is one of the historic safeguards of that right."); Blunt v. Little, 3 F. Cas. 760, 761-762
(No. 1,578) (CC Mass. 1822) (Story, J.) ("[I]f it should clearly

any other case."). "The trial judge in the federal system,"
we have reaffirmed, "has . .. discretion to grant a new trial
if the verdict appears to [the judge] to be against the weight
of. the evidence." Byrd, 356 U. S., at 540. This discretion
includes overturning verdicts for excessiveness and ordering
a new trial without qualification, or conditioned on the verdict winner's refusal to agree to a reduction (remittitur).
See Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 486-487 (1935) (recognizing that remittitur withstands Seventh Amendment

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

In contrast, appellate review of a federal trial court's denial of a motion to set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a
relatively late, and less secure, development. Such review
was once deemed inconsonant with the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause. See, e. g., Lincoln v. Power,
151 U. S. 436, 437-438 (1894); Williamson v. Osenton, 220 F.
653, 655 (CA4 1915); see also 6A Moore's Federal Practice
59.08[6], at 59-167 (collecting cases). We subsequently
recognized that, even in cases in which the Erie doctrine
was not in play-cases arising wholly under federal lawthe question was not settled; we twice granted certiorari to
decide the unsettled issue, but ultimately resolved the cases
on other grounds. See Grunenthal v. Long Island R. Co.,
156, 158 (1968); Neese v. Southern R. Co., 350 U. S.
393 U. S. 17
77 (1955).

Before today, we have not "expressly [held] that the Seventh Amendment allows appellate review of a district court's
denial of a motion to set aside an award as excessive."
Browning-FerrisIndustries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,
Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279, n. 25 (1989). But in successive reminders that the question was worthy of this Court's attention, we noted, without disapproval, that courts of appeals
engage in review of district court excessiveness determinaing the "incongruous position" that "a federal trial court may deny a motion for a new trial where the plaintiff consents to decrease the judgment
to a proper amount," but may not condition denial of the motion on "the
defendant's consent to a comparable increase in the recovery." Dimick v.
Schiedt, 298 U. S., at 495.
17 Dissenting from the Court's professed refusal to answer the question
presented in Grunenthalv. Long Island R. Co., Justices Harlan and Stewart observed that in Grunenthatitself, this Court indeed had reviewed
the refusal of the District Court to set aside a jury verdict for excessiveness. 393 U. S., at 163 (Harlan, J., dissenting); id., at 164-165 (Stewart,
J., dissenting). Justice Harlan commented: "Like my Brother STEwART,
I am at an utter loss to understand how the Court manages to review the
District Court's decision and find it proper while at the same time proclaiming that it has avoided decision of the issue whether appellate courts
ever may review such actions." Id., at 168.

tions, applying "abuse of discretion" as their standard. See
Grunenthal,393 U. S., at 159. We noted the Circuit decisions in point, id., at 157, n. 3, and, in Browning-Ferris,we
again referred to appellate court abuse-of-discretion review:
"[T]he role of the district court is to determine whether
the jury's verdict is within the confines set by state law,
and to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a new trial or remittitur
should be ordered. The court of appeals should then
review the district court's determination under an
abuse-of-discretion standard." 492 U. S., at 279.18
As the Second Circuit explained, appellate review for
abuse of discretion is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment as a control necessary and proper to the fair administration of justice: "We must give the benefit of every doubt
to the judgment of the trial judge; but surely there must be
an upper limit, and whether that has been surpassed is not
a question of fact with respect to which reasonable men may
differ, but a question of law." Dagnello v. Long Island R.
Co., 289 F. 2d 797, 806 (CA2 1961) (quoted in Grunenthal,393
U. S., at 159). All other Circuits agree. See, e. g., Holmes
v. Elgin, Joliet & Eastern R. Co., 18 F. 3d 1393, 1396 (CA7
1994); 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2820, p. 209 (2d ed. 1995) ("[E]very circuit has said that there are circumstances in which it can
reverse the denial of a new trial if the size of the verdict
seems to be too far out of line."); 6A Moore's Federal Practice
18 Browning-Ferris concerned punitive damages. We agree with the
Second Circuit, however, that "[f]or purposes of deciding whether state or
federal law is applicable, the question whether an award of compensatory
damages exceeds what is permitted by law is not materially different from
the question whether an award of punitive damages exceeds what is permitted by law." Consorti v. Armstrong World Industries,Inc., 72 F. 3d

19 JusTICE SCALIA disagrees. Ready to "destroy the uniformity of federal practice" in this regard, cf. post, at 467, he would render a judgment
described as "astonishing" by the very authority upon which he relies.
Compare post, at 460, with 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal
Practice and Procedure §2820, p. 212 (2d ed. 1995) ("it would be astonishing if the Court, which has passed up three opportunities to do so, should
ultimately reject" the unanimously held view of the courts of appeals).
2 If the meaning of the Seventh Amendment were fixed at 1791, our
civil juries would remain, as they unquestionably were at common law,
"twelve good men and true," 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *349; see
Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 13 (1899) ("'Trial by jury,' in the
primary and usual sense of the term at the common law and in the Ameri-

can constitutions ...

is a trial by a jury of twelve men.").

But see Col-

grove v. Battin, 413 U. S. 149, 160 (1973) (six-member jury for civil trials
satisfies Seventh Amendment's guarantee). Procedures we have regarded as compatible with the Seventh Amendment, although not in conformity with practice at common law when the Amendment was adopted,
include new trials restricted to the determination of damages, Gasoline
Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U. S. 494 (1931), and Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b)'s motion for judgment as a matter of law,

order is not required, for the principal state and federal interests can be accommodated. The Second Circuit correctly
recognized that when New York substantive law governs a
claim for relief, New York law and decisions guide the allowable damages. See 66 F. 3d, at 430; see also Consorti,72 F.
3d, at 1011. But that court did not take into account the
characteristic of the federal court system that caused us to
reaffirm: "The proper role of the trial and appellate courts
in the federal system in reviewing the size of jury verdicts
is... a matter of federal law." Donovan v. Penn Shipping
Co., 429 U.S. 648, 649 (1977) (per curiam); see also
Browning-Ferris,492 U. S., at 279 ("Ihe role of the district
court is to determine whether the jury's verdict is within the
confines set by state law ....
The court of appeals should
then review the district court's determination under an
abuse-of-discretion standard.").
New York's dominant interest can be respected, without
disrupting the federal system,-onee it is recognized that the
federal district 6ourt is capable of performing the checking
function, i. e., that court can apply the Stafe's "deviates materially" standard in line with New York case law evolving
under CPLR §,5501(c). 22 We rbcall, in this regard, that the
Elec. Cooperative,Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958). We discern no disagreement on such examples amofig the many federal judges who have considered this case.
22JusTIcE ScALiA finds in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 a "federal
standard" for new trial motions in "'direct collision" with, and "'leaving
no room for the operation of,"' a state law like CPLR §5501(c). Post, at
468 (quoting Burlington NorthernR. Co., 480 U. S., at 4-5). The relevant
prescription, Rule 59(a), has remained unchanged since the adoption of the
Federal Rules by this Court in 1937. .302 U. S. 783. Rule 59(a) is as
encompassing.as it is uncontroversial. It is indeed "Hornbook" -law that
a most usual ground for a Rule 59 motion is that "the: damages are excessive." See C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 676-677 (5th ed. 1994).
Whether damages are excessive for the claim-in-suit must be governed by
some law. And there is no candidate for that governance other than the
law that gives rise to the claim for relief-here, the law of New York.

438

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.
Opinion of the Court

"deviates materially" standard serves as the guide to be
applied in trial as well as appellate courts in New York.
See supra, at 425.
Within the federal system, practical reasons combine with
Seventh Amendment constraints to lodge in the district
court, not the court of appeals, primary responsibility for
application of § 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" check. Trial
judges have the "unique opportunity to consider the evidence
in the living courtroom context," Taylor v. Washington Terminal Co., 409 F. 2d 145, 148 (CADC 1969), while appellate
judges see only the "cold paper record," 66 F. 3d, at 431.
District court applications of the "deviates materially"
standard would be subject to appellate review under the
standard the Circuits now employ when inadequacy or excessiveness is asserted on appeal: abuse of discretion. See 11
Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §2820, at
212-214, and n. 24 (collecting cases); see 6A Moore's Federal
Practice 59.08[6], at 59-177 to 59-185 (same). In light of
Erie's doctrine, the federal appeals court must be guided by
the damage-control standard state law supplies,2 but as the
Second Circuit itself has said: "If we reverse, it must be because of an abuse of discretion .... The very nature of the
problem counsels restraint .... We must give the benefit of
enlarge or modify any substantive right"); Browning-Ferris,492 U. S., at
279 ("standard of excessiveness" is a "matte[r] of state, and not federal,
common law"); see also R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and
Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 729-730 (4th ed.
1996) (observing that Court "has continued since [Hanna v. Plimer,880
U. S. 460 (1965),] to interpret the federal rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory policies," citing Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446
U. S. 740 (1980)).
2 If liability and damage-control rules are split apart here, as JUSTICE
SCALIA says they must be to save the Seventh Amendment, then Gasperini's claim and others like it would be governed by a most curious "law."
The sphinx-like, damage-determining law he would apply to this controversy has a state forepart, but a federal hindquarter. The beast may not
be brutish, but there is little judgment in its creation.

Dagnello,

It does not appear that the District Court checked the
jury's verdict against the relevant New York decisions demanding more than "industry standard" testimony to support an award of the size the jury returned in this case. As
the Court of Appeals recognized, see 66 F. 3d, at 429, the
uniqueness of the photographs and the plaintiff's earnings
as photographer-past and reasonably projected-are factors relevant to appraisal of the award. See, e. g., Blackman
v. Michael FriedmanPublishing Group, Inc., 201 App. Div.
2d 328, 607 N. Y. S. 2d 43, 44 (1st Dept. 1994); Nierenberg v.
Wursteria, Inc., 189 App. Div. 2d 571, 571-572, 592 N. Y. S.
2d 27, 27-28 (1st Dept. 1993). Accordingly, we vacate the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and instruct that court to
remand the case to the District Court so that the trial judge,
revisiting his ruling on the new trial motion, may test the
jury's verdict against CPLR § 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS,

dissenting.

While I agree with most of the reasoning in the Court's
opinion, I disagree with its disposition of the case. I would
affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I would also
reject the suggestion that the Seventh Amendment limits
the power of a federal appellate court sitting in diversity to
decide whether a jury's award of damages exceeds a limit
established by state law.

I

The Court correctly explains why the 1986 enactment of
§ 5501(c) of the N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules (McKinney
1995) changed the substantive law of the State. A state-law
ceiling on allowable damages, whether fixed by a dollar limit
or by a standard that forbids any award that "deviates mate-

rially from what would be reasonable compensation," ibid.,
is a substantive rule of decision that federal courts must
apply in diversity cases governed by New York law.
I recognize that state rules of appellate procedure do not
necessarily bind federal appellate courts. The majority persuasively shows, however, that New York has not merely
adopted a new procedure for allocating the decisionmaking
function between trial and appellate courts. Ante, at 422425. Instead, New iYork courts have held that all jury
awards, not only those reviewed on appeal, must conform
to the requirement that they not "deviat[e] materially" from
amounts awarded in like cases. Ante, at 425. That New
York has chosen to tie its damages ceiling to awards traditionally recovered in similar cases, rather than to a legislatively determined but inflexible monetary sum, is none of
our concern.
Given the nature of the state-law command, the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit correctly concluded in Consorti v. Armstrong World Industries,Inc., 64 F. 3d 781, superseded, 72 F. 3d 1003 (1995), that New York's excessiveness standard applies in federal court in diversity cases
controlled by New York law. Consorti erred in basing that
conclusion in part on the fact that a New York statute requires that State's appellate division to apply the standard,
but it was nevertheless faithful to the Rules of Decision Act,
as construed in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938),
in holding that a state-law limitation on the size of a judgment could not be ignored.' Similarly, the Court of Appeals

Because there is no conceivable conflict between Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 59 and the application of the New York damages limit, this case
is controlled by Erie and the Rules of Decision Act, rather than by the
Rules Enabling Act's limitation on federal procedural rules that conflict

with state substantive rights. See Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie,
87 Harv. L. Rev. 693, 698 (1974); see also Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312
U. S. 1 (1941). The Rule does state that new trials may be granted "for
any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in
actions at law in the courts of the United States," but that hardly consti-

correctly followed Consorti in this case and considered
whether the damages awarded materially deviated from
damages awarded in similar cases. 66 F. 3d 427, 431 (CA2
1995). I endorse both opinions in these rdspects.
Although the majority agrees with the Court of Appeals
that New York law establishes the size of the damages that
may be awarded, it chooses to vacate and remand. The majority holds that a federal court of appeals should review for
abuse of discretion a district court's decision to deny a motion
for new trial based on a jury's excessive award. As a result,
it concludes that the District Court should be given the opportunity to apply in the first instance the "deviates materially" standard that New York law imposes. Ante, at 439.
The District Court had its opportunity to consider the propriety of the jury's award, and it erred. The Court of Appeals has now corrected that error after "drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of" petitioner. 66 F. 3d, at 431. As
there is no reason to suppose that the Court of Appeals has
reached a conclusion with which the ,District Court could
permissibly disagree on remand, I would not require the District Court to repeat a task that has already been well performed by the reviewing court. I therefore would affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
II
Although I have addressed the question presented as if
our decision in Erie alone controlled its outcome, petitioner
argues that the second clause of the Seventh Amendment,
which states that "no fact tried by jury, shall be otherwise
re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law," U. S. Const., Amdt. 7,
tutes a command that federal courts must always substitute federal limits
on the size of judgments for those set by the several States in cases
founded upon state-law causes of action. Even at the time of the Rule's
adoption, federal courts were bound to apply state statutory law in such
cases.

442

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.
STEVENS, J.,

dissenting

bars the procedure followed by the Court of Appeals. There
is no merit to that position.
Early cases do state that the Reexamination Clause prohibits appellate review of excessive jury awards, but they
do not foreclose the practice altogether. See, e. g., Southern
Railway-CarolinaDiv. v. Bennett, 233 U. S. 80, 87 (1914) ("It
may be admitted that if it were true that the excess appeared as [a] matter of law; that if, for instance, the statute
fixed a maximum and the verdict exceeded it, a question
might arise for this court"); 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &
M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2820, pp. 207-209
(2d ed. 1995). Indeed, for the last 30 years, we have consistently reserved the question whether the Constitution permits such review, ante, at 434-435, and, in the meantime,
every Court of Appeals has agreed that the Seventh Amendment establishes no bar. 11 Wright & Miller §2820, at 209.
Taking the question to be an open one, I start with certain
basic principles. It is well settled that jury verdicts are not
binding on either trial judges or appellate courts if they are
unauthorized by law. A verdict may be insupportable as a
matter of law either because of deficiencies in the evidence
or because an award of damages is larger than permitted by
law. If an award is excessive as a matter of law-in a diversity case if it is larger than applicable state law permits-a
trial judge has a duty to set it aside. A failure to do so is
an error of law that the court of appeals has a duty to correct
on appeal.
These principles are sufficiently well established that no
Seventh Amendment issue would arise if an appellate court
ordered a new trial because a jury award exceeded a monetary cap on allowable damages. That New York has chosen
to define its legal limit in less mathematical terms does not
require a different constitutional conclusion.
New York's limitation requires a legal inquiry that cannot
be wholly divorced from the facts, but that quality does not
necessarily make the question one for the factfinder rather

Cite as: 518 U. S. 415 (1996)
STEVENS,

J., dissenting

than the reviewing court. Three times this Term we have
assigned appellate courts the task of independently reviewing similarly mixed questions of law and fact. See Ornelas
v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696-697 (1996); Markman v.
Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S.370, 388-390 (1996);
Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 90, 112-116 (1995). Such
appellate review is proper because mixed questions require
courts to construe all record inferences in favor of the factfinder's decision and then to determine whether, on the facts
as found below, the legal standard has been met. See Ornelas, 517 U. S., at 696-697 (quoting Pullman-Standardv.
Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 289, n. 19 (1982)). In following that
procedure here, the Court of Appeals did not reexamine any
fact determined by a jury. 66 F. 3d, at 431. It merely identified that portion of the judgment that constitutes "unlawful
excess." See Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S.474, 486 (1935).2
Even if review by the Court of Appeals implicates the
Reexamination Clause, it was "according to the rules of the
common law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. At common law, the
trial judge sitting nisi prius recommended whether a judicial panel sitting en banc at Westminster should accept the
jury's award. The en banc court then ruled on the motion
for new trial and entered judgment. 11 Wright & Miller
§2819, at 203.
Petitioner correctly points out that under this procedure
motions for new trial based on excessiveness were not technically subject to appellate review. Riddell, New Trial at
the Common Law, 26 Yale L. J. 49, 57 (1916) ("It seems clear
that in criminal as in civil cases, the trial Judge had not the
thus disagree with JUSTICE SCAIUAS view that there is a separate
federal standard to "determine whether the award exceeds what is lawful
to such degree that it may be set aside by order for new trial or remittitur." Post, at 464. In my view, if an award "exceeds what is lawful,"
ibid., legal error has occurred and may be corrected. Certainly Dimick
does not premise a court's power to overturn an award that exceeds lawful
limits on the degree of the excess.
21

power to grant a new trial, but that recourse must be had to

'the Court above'"); id., at 60. However, because the nisi
prius judge often did not serve on the en bane court, the
"court above" was in essentially the same position as a modern court of appeals. It considered the legality of the jury's
award in light of the trial judge's opinion, but without any
firsthand knowledge of what had transpired below. See
Blume, Review of Facts in Jury Cases-The Seventh Amendment, 20 J. Am. Jud. Soc. 130, 131 (1936).3
Petitioner also contends that at common law the en banc
court could only grant a new trial if the trial judge so recommended. That contention is undermined by numerous cases
in which the "court above" granted new trials without making any reference to the trial judge's view of the damages.
See, e. g., Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U. S. 415, 422-425
(1994) (citing cases). 4 Moreover, early English cases repeatedly state that the power to order a new trial when the jury
returned an excessive award rested with "the Court," rather
than the judge below,5 and Blackstone identifies excessive
3

For that reason, JUSTICE SCAUIA is wrong to contend that the court at
Westminster acted in no more of an appellate fashion when it entertained
motions for new trials in causes tried at bar than when it entertained
them in causes tried at nisi prius. Post, at 456. In the former cases,
the en bane court would entertain a motion for new trial after having
heard the evidence itself. In the latter, it would sometimes entertain the
motion only after having heard the report on the evidence of the nisi
prius judge.
4 Although Honda itself involved review of punitive damages awards,
we expressly noted that there was no basis for suggesting "that different
standards of judicial review were applied for punitive and compensatory
damages before the 20th century," 512 U. S., at 422, n. 2. Indeed, many
of the decisions we relied upon in Honda involved compensatory damages,
and there is some authority to suggest that judicial review of the former
has a more secure historical pedigree than does judicial review of the
latter.
5See, e. g., Bright v. Eynon, 1 Burr. 390, 97 Eng. Rep. 365, 368 (K. B.
1757) (Denison, J., concurring) ("[T]he granting a new trial, or refusing it,

J., dissenting

damages as an independent basis on which the "court above"
may grant a new trial but makes no mention of a requirement that the trial judge must so recommend. 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *387.
Even when read most favorably to petitioner, therefore, no
meaningful distinction exists between the common-law practice by which the "court above" considered a new trial motion in the first instance, and the practice challenged here,
by which an appellate court reviews a district court's ruling
on a new trial motion. See Riddell, 26 Yale L. J., at 57. As
Justice Stone explained, in a dissenting opinion joined by
Chief Justice Hughes, Justice Brandeis, and Justice Cardozo:
"[The Seventh Amendment], intended to endure for unnumbered generations, is concerned with substance and
not with form. There is nothing in its history or language to suggest that the Amendment had any purpose
but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial as it was
known to the common law before the adoption of the
Constitution. For that reason this Court has often refused to construe it as intended to perpetuate in changeless form the minutiae of trial practice as it existed in
the English courts in 1791. From the beginning, its
language has been regarded as but subservient to the
single purpose of the Amendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury trial in actions at law, serving to
distinguish them from suits in equity and admiralty, see
Parsonsv. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 446, and to safeguard the
jury's function from any encroachment which the common law did not permit.
and circumstances of the particular case, and directed with a view to the
attainment of justice"); Wood v. Gunston, Sty. 466, 82 Eng. Rep. 867 (K. B.
1655) ("It is in the discretion of the Court in some cases to grant a new
tryal, but this must be a judicial, and not an arbitrary discretion, and it is
frequent in our books for the Court to take notice of miscarriages of juries,
and to grant new tryals upon them...").

"Thus interpreted, the Seventh Amendment guarantees that suitors in actions at law shall have the benefits
of trial of issues of fact by a jury, but it does not prescribe any particular procedure by which these benefits
shall be obtained, or forbid any which does not curtail
the function of the jury to decide questions of fact as it
did before the adoption of the Amendment. It does not
restrict the court's control of the jury's verdict, as it had
previously been exercised, and it does not confine the
trial judge, in determining what issues are for the jury
and what for the court, to the particular forms of trial
practice in vogue in 1791."
U. S., at 490-491.

Dimick v. Schiedt, 293

Because the Framers of the Seventh Amendment evinced
no interest in subscribing to every procedural nicety of the
notoriously complicated English system, see Henderson, The
Background of the Seventh Amendment, 80 Harv. L. Rev.
289, 290 (1966), the common-law practice certainly does not
demonstrate that the Reexamination Clause prohibits federal appellate courts from ensuring compliance with statelaw limits on jury awards.
Nor does early and intricate English history justify the
more limited assertion that federal appellate courts must be
limited to a particular, highly deferential standard of excessiveness review. Common-law courts were hesitant to disturb jury awards, but less so in cases in which "a reasonably
certain measure of damages is afforded." 1 D. Graham, Law
of New Trials in Cases Civil and Criminal 452 (2d ed. 1855);
Washington, Damages in Contract at Common Law, 47 L. Q.
Rev. 345, 363-364 (1931).
Here, New York has prescribed an objective, legal limitation on damages. If an appellate court may reverse a jury's
damages award when its own conscience has been shocked,
66 F. 3d, at 430, or its sense of justice outraged, Dagnello v.
Long Island R. Co., 289 F. 2d 797, 802 (CA2 1961); cf. Honda
Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U. S., at 422-424 (citing English

cases), it may surely follow a sovereign's command that it do

so when a jury has materially deviated from awards granted
by other juries. If anything, the New York standard,
though less deferential, is more certain. 6
III
For the reasons set forth above, I agree with the majority
that the Reexamination Clause does not bar federal appellate
courts from reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. I confess to some surprise, however, at its conclusion that "'the
influence-if not the command-of the Seventh Amendment,' ante, at 432 (quoting Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec.
Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958) (footnote omitted)), requires federal courts of appeals to review district
court applications of state-law excessiveness standards for
an "abuse of discretion." Ante, at 438.
The majority's persuasive demonstration that New York
law sets forth a substantive limitation on the size of jury
awards seems to refute the contention that New York has
merely asked appellate courts to reexamine facts. The majority's analysis would thus seem to undermine the conclusion that the Reexamination Clause is relevant to this case.
Certainly, our decision in Byrd does not make the Clause
relevant. There, we considered only whether the Seventh
Amendment's first clause should influence our decision to
give effect to a state-law rule denying the right to a jury
6Our per curiam decision in Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., 429 U. S.

648 (1977), provides no support for the proposition that federal appellate
courts are confined to a federal standard of excessiveness. That case held
only that a plaintiff who had consented to a remittitur could not challenge
its adequacy on appeal. Id., at 649. Although we stated in dicta that
"[tihe proper role of the trial and appellate courts in the federal system in
reviewing the size of jury verdicts is, however, a matter of federal law,"
ibid., that broad statement was supported by citation to two cases, Hanna
v. Plumer,380 U. S. 460 (1965), and Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525 (1958), which did not involve the review of
jury awards.

448

SCAA, J., dissenting

altogether. 356 U. S., at 537. That holding in no way requires us to consult the Amendment's second clause to determine the standard of review for a district court's application
of state substantive law.
My disagreement is tempered, however, because the
majority carefully avoids defining too strictly the abuse-ofdiscretion standard it, announces. To the extent that the
majority relies only on "practical reasons" for its conclusion
that the' Court of Appeals sh6uld give some weight to the
District Court's assessment in determining whether state
substantive law has been properly applied, ante, at 438, I do
not disagree with its analysis.
As a matter' of federal-court administration, we have
recognized in other contexts the need for according some
deference to the lower court's resolution of legal, yet factintensive, :questions. See Ornelas v. United States, 517
U. S., at 699; Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558, n. 1
(1988). Indeed, it is a familiar, if somewhat circular, maxim
that deems an error of law an abuse of discretion.
In the end, therefore, my disagreement with the label that
the majority attaches to the standard of appellate review
should not obscure the far more fundamental point on which
we agree. Whatever influence the Seventh Amendment
may be said to exert, Erie requires federal appellate courts
sitting in diversity to apply "the damage-control standard
state law supplies." Ante, at 438.

eral appellate courts from reviewing refusals by district
courts to set aside civil jury awards as contrary to the weight
of the evidence. One reason is given for overruling these
cases: that the Courts of Appeals have, for some time now,
decided to ignore them. Such unreasoned capitulation to
the nullification of what was long regarded as a core component of the Bill of Rights-the Seventh Amendment's
prohibition on appellate reexamination of civil jury awardsis wrong. It is not for us, much less for the Courts of Appeals, to decide that the Seventh Amendment's restriction
on federal-court review of jury findings has outlived its
usefulness.
The Court also holds today that a state practice that relates to the division of duties between state judges and juries
must be, followed by federal courts in diversity cases. On
this issue, too, our prior cases are directly to the contrary.
As I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals,
I respectfully dissent.
I
Because the Court and I disagree as to the character of
the review that is before us, I recount briefly the nature of
the New York practice rule at issue. Section 5501(c) of the
N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules (CPLR) (McKinney 1995)
directs New York intermediate appellate courts faced with a
claim "that the award is excessive or inadequate and that a
new trial should have been granted" to determine whether
the jury's award "deviates materially from what would be
reasonable compensation." In granting respondent a new
trial under this standard, the Court of Appeals necessarily
engaged in a two-step process. As it has explained the application of § 5501(c), that provision "requires the reviewing
court to determine the range it regards as reasonable, and
to determine whether the particular jury award deviates
materially from that range." Consorti v. Armstrong World
Industries, Inc., 72 F. 3d 1003, 1013 (CA2 1995) (amended).
The first of these two steps-the determination as, to "rea-

450

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.
SCALIA, J., dissenting

sonable" damages-plainly requires the reviewing court to
reexamine a factual matter tried by the jury: the appropriate
measure of damages, on the evidence presented, under New
York law. The second step-the determination as to the degree of difference between "reasonable" damages and the
damages found by the jury (whether the latter "deviates
materially" from the former)-establishes the degree of
judicial tolerance for awards found not to be reasonable,
whether at the trial level or by the appellate court. No part
of this exercise is appropriate for a federal court of appeals, whether or not it is sitting in a diversity case.
A
Granting appellate courts authority to decide whether an
award is "excessive or inadequate" in the manner of CPLR
§5501(c) may reflect a sound understanding of the capacities
of modern juries and trial judges. That is to say, the people
of the State of New York may well be correct that such a rule
contributes to a more just legal system. But the practice of
federal appellate reexamination of facts found by a jury is
precisely what the People of the several States considered
not to be good legal policy in 1791. Indeed, so fearful were
they of such a practice that they constitutionally prohibited
it by means of the Seventh Amendment.
That Amendment was Congress's response to one of the
principal objections to the proposed Constitution raised by
the Anti-Federalists during the ratification debates: its failure to ensure the right to trial by jury in civil actions in
federal court. The desire for an explicit constitutional guarantee against reexamination of jury findings was explained
by Justice Story, sitting as Circuit Justice in 1812, as having
been specifically prompted by Article III's conferral of "appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact" upon the Supreme Court. "[O]ne of the most powerful objections urged
against [the Constitution]," he recounted, was that this au-

Cite as:. 518 U. S. 415 (1996)
ScALiA, J., dissenting

thority "would enable that court, with or without a new jury,
to re-examine the Whole facts, which had been settled by a
previous jury." United States v. Wonson, 28 F. Cas. 745, 750
(No. 16,750) (CC Mass.).'
The second clause of the Amendment responded to that
concern by providing that "[i]n [s]uits at common law.., no
fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any
Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the
common law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. The Reexamination
Clause put to rest "apprehensions" of "new trials by the appellate courts," Wonson, 28 F. Cas., at 750, by adopting, in
broad fashion, "the rules of the common law" to govern
federal-court interference with jury determinations. 2 The
'This objection was repeatedly made following the Constitutional Convention, see, e. g., Martin, Genuine Information, in 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 172, 221-222 (M. Farrand ed. 1911); Gerry,
Reply to a Landholder, id., at 298, 299, and at the ratifying conventions in
the States, see, e. g., 3 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 525,
540-541, 544-546 (1863) (Virginia Convention, statements of Mr. Mason
and Mr. Henry); 4 id., at 151, 154 (North Carolina Convention, statements
of Mr. Bloodworth and Mr. Spencer).
Prior to adoption of the Amendment, these concerns were addressed by
Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, which expressly directed,
in providing for "reexamin[ation]" of civil judgments "upon a writ of
error," that "there shall be no reversal in either [the Circuit or Supreme
Court] ... for any error of fact." §22, 1 Stat. 84-85. That restriction
remained in place until the 1948 revisions of the Judicial Code. See 62
963, 28 U. S. C. §2105 (1946 ed., Supp. II).

The Amendment was relied upon at least twice to prevent actual new
trials. In Wonson itself, Justice Story rejected the United States' claim
of right to retry, on appeal, a matter unsuccessfully put before a jury in
the District Court-notwithstanding acceptance of such a practice under
local law. The court based its ruling on statutory grounds, but its interpretation of its statutory jurisdiction was dictated by its view that a
contrary interpretation would contravene the Seventh Amendment. 28
F. Cas., at 750. And in Justices v. Murray, 9 Wall. 274, 281 (1870), this
Court relied on Wonson in invalidating under the Seventh Amendment a
federal habeas statute that provided for removal of certain judgments
from state courts for purposes of retrial in federal court.

452

content of that law was familiar and fixed. See, e. g., ibid.
("[T]he common law here alluded to is not the common law
of any individual state, (for it probably differs in all), but it
is the common law of England, the grand reservoir of all our
jurisprudence"); Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 487 (1935)
(Seventh Amendment "in effect adopted the rules of the
common law, in respect of trial by jury, as these rules existed
in 1791"). It quite plainly barred reviewing courts from entertaining claims that the jury's verdict was contrary to the
evidence.
At common law, review of judgments was had only on writ
of error, limited to questions of law. See, e. g., Wonson,
supra, at 748; 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws
of England 405 (1768) ("The writ of error only lies upon matter of law arising upon the face of the proceedings; so that
no evidence is required to substantiate or support it"); 1 W.
Holdsworth, History of English Law 213-214 (7th ed. 1956);
cf. Ross v. Rittenhouse, 2 Dall. 160, 163 (Pa. 1792) (MicKean,
C. J.). That principle was expressly acknowledged by this
Court as governing federal practice in Parsonsv. Bedford, 3
Pet. 433 (1830) (Story, J.). There, the Court held that no
error could be assigned to a district court's refusal to allow
transcription of witness testimony "to serve as a statement
of facts in case of appeal," notwithstanding the right to such
transcription under state practices made applicable to federal courts by Congress. Id., at 443 (emphasis deleted).
This was so, the Court explained, because "[tihe whole object" of the transcription was "to present the evidence here
in order to establish the error of the verdict in matters of
fact," id., at 445-a mode of review simply unavailable on
writ of error, see id., at 446, 448. The Court concluded that
Congress had not directed federal courts to follow state practices that would change "the effect or conclusiveness of the
verdict of the jury upon the facts litigated at the trial," id.,
at 449, because it had "the most serious doubts whether

[that] would not be unconstitutional" under the Seventh
Amendment, id., at 448.
"This is a prohibition to the courts of the United States
to re-examine any facts tried by a jury in any other manner. The only modes known to the common law to reexamine such facts, are the granting of a new trial by
the court where the issue was tried, or to which the
record was properly returnable; or the award of a venire
facias de novo, by an appellate court, for some error of
law which intervened in the proceedings.
"[I]f the evidence were now before us, it would not be
competent for this court to reverse the judgment for any
error in the verdict of the jury at the trial . . " Id.,
at 447-449.
Nor was the common-law proscription on reexamination
limited to review of the correctness of the jury's determination of liability on the facts. No less than the existence of
liability, the proper measure of damages "involves only a
question of fact," St. Louis, I.M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237
U. S.648, 661 (1915), as does a "motio[n] for a new trial based
on the ground that the damages ... are excessive," Metropolitan R. Co. v. Moore, 121 U. S.558, 574 (1887). As appeals from denial "of such motions necessarily pose a factual
question, courts of the United States are constitutionally forbidden to entertain them.
"No error of law appearing upon the record, this court
cannot reverse the judgment because, upon examination
of the evidence, we may be of the opinion that the jury
should have returned a verdict for a less amount. If
the jury acted upon a gross mistake of facts, or were
governed by some improper influence or bias, the remedy therefore rested with the court below, under its gen-

Respondent's principal response to these cases, which is
endorsed by JUSTICE STEVENS, see ante, at 443-445, is that
our forebears were simply wrong about the English common law. The rules of the common-law practice incorporated in the Seventh Amendment, it is claimed, did not prevent judges sitting in an appellate capacity from granting a
new trial on the ground that an award was contrary to the
weight of the evidence. This claim simply does not withstand examination of the actual practices of the courts at
common law. The weight of the historical record strongly
supports the view of the common law taken in our early
cases.
At common law, all major civil actions were initiated before panels of judges sitting at the courts of Westminster.
Trial was not always held at the bar of the court, however.
The inconvenience of having jurors and witnesses travel to
Westminster had given rise to the practice of allowing trials
to be held in the countryside, before a single itinerant judge.
This nisi prius trial, as it was called, was limited to the
jury's deciding a matter of fact in dispute; once that was accomplished, the verdict was entered on the record whichalong with any exceptions to the instructions or rulings of
the nisipriusjudge-was then returned to the en banc court
at Westminster. See generally 1 Holdsworth, History of
English Law, at 223-224, 278-282; G. Radcliffe & G. Cross,
The English Legal System 90-91, 183-186 (3d ed. 1954).
Requests for new trials were made not to the nisi prius
judge, but to the en banc court, prior to further proceedings
and entry of judgment. See 1 Holdsworth, supra, at 282;
Riddell, New Trial at the Common Law, 26 Yale L. J. 49,
53, 57 (1916). Such motions were altogether separate from
appeal on writ of error, which followed the entry of judgawarded by the jury were excessive or were inadequate" (footnotes

ment. 1 Holdsworth,
supra, at 213-214; Radcliffe & Cross,
4
supra, at 210-212.
Nonetheless, respondent argues, the role of the en banc
court at Westminster was essentially that of an appellate
body, reviewing the proceedings below; and those appellate
judges were capable of examining the evidence, and of granting a new trial when, in their view, the verdict was contrary
to the weight of the evidence. See Blume, Review of Facts
in Jury Cases-The Seventh Amendment, 20 J. Am. Jud. Soc.
130, 131 (1936); Riddell, supra, at 55-57, 60. There are two
difficulties with this argument. The first is the characterization of the court at Westminster as an appellate body.
The court's role with respect to the initiation of the action,
the entertaining of motions for new trial, and the entry of
judgment was the same in all cases-whether the cause was
tried at the bar or at nisi prius. To regard its actions in
deciding a motion for a new trial as "appellate" in the latter
instance supposes a functional distinction where none existed. The second difficulty is that when the trial had been
held at nisi prius,the judges of the en banc court apparently
would order a new trial only if the nisi priusjudge certified
that he was dissatisfied with the verdict. To be sure, there
are many cases where no mention is made of the judge's certificate, but there are many indications that it was a required
predicate to setting aside a verdict rendered at nisi prius,
and respondent has been unable to identify a single case
where a new trial was granted in the absence of such certification. In short, it would seem that a new trial could not

The grounds for granting a new trial were "want of notice of trial; or

any flagrant misbehavior of the party prevailing towards the jury, which
may have influenced their verdict; or any gross misbehavior of the jury
among themselves: also if it appears by the judge's report, certified to the
court, that the jury have brought in a verdict without or contrary to evidence, so that he is reasonably dissatisfied therewith; or if they have given
exorbitant damages; or if the judge himself has misdirected the jury, so
that they found an unjustifiable verdict." 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
on the Laws of England 387 (1768) (footnotes omitted; emphases deleted).

be had except upon the approval of the judge who presided
over the trial and heard the evidence.5
I am persuaded that our prior cases were correct that, at
common law, "reexamination" of the facts found by a jury
could be undertaken only by the trial court, and that appellate review was restricted to writ of error which could challenge the judgment only upon matters of law. Even if there
were some doubt on the point, we should be hesitant to advance our view of the common law over that of our forbears,
who were far better acquainted with the subject than we are.
But in any event, the question of how to apply the "rules of
the common law" to federal appellate consideration of mo5See ibid. (new trial would be granted "if it appears by the judge's
report, certified to the court, that the jury have brought in a verdict without or contrary to evidence, so that he is reasonably dissatisfied therewith"). See, e.g., Berks v. Mason, Say. 264,265,96 Eng. Rep. 874,874-875
(K. B. 1756); Bright v. Eynon, 1 Burr. 390, 97 Eng. Rep. 365 (K. B. 1757);
see also Note, Limitations on Trial by Jury in Illinois, 19 Chi.-Kent L.
Rev. 91, 92 (1940) ("An exhaustive examination of the early English cases
has revealed not a single~case where an English court at common law ever
granted a new trial, as being agaist the evidence, unless the judge or
judges who sat with the jury stated in open court, or certified, that the
verdict was against the evidence and he was dissatisfied with the verdict").
JUSTICE STEVENS understands Blackstone to say that new trials were
granted for excessiveness even where the nisiprius judge was not dissatisfied with, the damages awarded, see ante, at 444-445.. Blackstone's
phrasing certainly allows for this reading, see n. 4, supra,but what indications we have suggest that the dissatisfaction of the presiding judge
played the same role where the motion for new trial was based on a claim
of excessive damages as where based on a claim of an erroneous verdict.
See, e. g., Boulsworth v. Pilkington, Jones, T. 200, 84 Eng. Rep. 1216
(K. B. 1685); Redshaw v. Brook, 2 Wils. K. B. 405, 95 Eng. Rep. 887 (C. P.
1769); Sharpe v. Brice, 2 Black. W. 942, 96 Eng. Rep. 557 (C. P. 1774). The
cases cited by JUsTicE STEVENS, ante, at 444-445, n. 5, are not at all to
the contrary: In one, the case was tried at the bar of the court, so that
there was no nisi prius judge, see Wood v. Gunston, Sty. 466, 82 Eng.
Rep. 867 (K. B. 1655); in the other, the judge who had presided at trial
was on the panel that ruled on the new trial motion, and recommended a
new trial, see Bright v. Eynon, supra,at 390-391, 396-397, 97 Eng. Rep.,

tions :for new trials is one that has already been clearly and
categorically answered, by our precedents. As we said in
Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474 (1935), in discussing the
status of remittitur under "the rules of the common law," a
doctrine that "has been accepted as the law for more than a
hundred years and uniformly applied in the federal courts
during that time" and "finds some support in the practice of
the English courts prior to the adoption of the Constitution"
will not lightly "be reconsidered or disturbed," id., at 484485. The time to question whether orders on motions for a
new trial were in fact reviewable at common law has long
since passed. Cases of this Court reaching back into the
early 19th century establish that the Constitution forbids
federal appellate courts to "reexamine" a fact found by the
jury at trial; and that this prohibition encompasses review
of a district court's refusal to set aside a verdict as contrary
to the weight of the evidence.
C
The Court, as is its wont of late, all but ignores the relevant history. It acknowledges that federal appellate review
of district-court refusals to set aside jury awards as against
the weight of the evidence was "once deemed inconsonant
with the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause,"
ante, at 434, but gives no indication of why ever we held that
view; and its citation of only one of our cases subscribing to
that proposition fails to convey how long and how clearly it
was a fixture of federal practice, see ibid. (citing only Lincoln
v. Power, 151 U. S. 436 (1894)). That our earlier cases are so
poorly recounted is not surprising, however, given the scant
analysis devoted to the conclusion that "appellate review for
abuse of discretion is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment," ante, at 435.
No precedent of this Court affirmatively supports that
proposition. The cases upon which the Court relies neither

affirmed nor rejected the practice of appellate weight-ofthe-evidence review that has been adopted by the courts of
appeals-a development that, in light of our past cases,
amounts to studied waywardness by the intermediate appellate bench. Our unaccountable reluctance, in Grunenthalv.
Long Island R. Co., 393 U. S. 156, 158 (1968), and Neese v.
Southern R. Co., 350 U. S. 77 (1955), to stand by our precedents, and the undeniable illogic of our disposition of those
two cases-approving ourselves a district-court denial of a
new trial motion, so as not to have to confront the lawfulness
of reversal by the court of appeals-is authority of only the
weakest and most negative sort. Nor can any weight be
assigned to our statement in Browning-FerrisIndustries of
Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279 (1989),
seemingly approving appellate abuse-of-discretion review of
denials of new trials where punitive damages are claimed to
be excessive. Browning-Ferris,like Grunenthaland Neese,
explicitly avoided the question that is before us today, see
492 U. S., at 279, n. 25. Even more significantly, BrowningFerrisinvolved review of a jury's punitive damages award.
Unlike the measure of actual damages suffered, which presents a question of historical or predictive fact, see, e. g.,
Craft, 237 U. S., at 661, the level of punitive damages is not
really a "fact" "tried" by the jury. In none of our cases holding that the Reexamination Clause prevents federal appellate review of claims of excessive damages does it appear
that the damages had a truly "punitive" component.
In any event, it is not this Court's statements that the
Court puts forward as the basis for dispensing with our prior
cases. Rather, it is the Courts of Appeals' unanimous
"agree[ment]" that they may review trial-court refusals to
set aside jury awards claimed to be against the weight of the
evidence. Ante, at 435. This current unanimity is deemed
controlling, notwithstanding the "relatively late" origin of
the practice, ante, at 434, and without any inquiry into the

460

reasoning set forth in those Court of Appeals decisions.
The Court contents itself with citations of two federal appellate cases and the assurances of two leading treatises that
the view (however meager its intellectual provenance might
be) is universally held. See ante, at 435-436. To its credit,
one of those treatises describes the "dramatic change in doctrine" represented by appellate abuse-of-discretion review of
denials of new trial orders generally as having been "accomplished by a blizzard of dicta" that, through repetition alone,
has "given legitimacy to a doctrine of doubtful constitutionality." 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice
and Procedure § 2819, pp. 200, 204 (2d ed. 1995).7

The Court's only suggestion as to what rationale might
underlie approval of abuse-of-discretion review is to be found
in a quotation from Dagnellov. Long Island R. Co., 289 F. 2d
797 (CA2 1961), to the effect that review of denial of a new
trial motion, if conducted under a sufficiently deferential
standard, poses only "'a question of law."' Ante, at 435
(quoting Dagnello, supra, at 806). But that is not the test
that the Seventh Amendment sets forth. Whether or not it
6

The Second Circuit, notwithstanding its practice with respect to excessiveness claims, will not review a district court's determination that the
jury's liability ruling was supported by the weight of the evidence, see
Stonewall Ins. Co. v. Asbestos Claims Management, 73 F. 3d 1178, 1199

(1995) (such a decision is "one of those few rulings that is simply unavailable for appellate review"), and the Eighth Circuit has questioned whether
the Seventh Amendment permits appellate review of such determinations,
see Thongvanh v. Thalacker, 17 F. 3d 256, 259-260 (1994); see also White
v. Pence, 961 F. 2d 776, 782 (1992).

7 am at a loss to understand the Court's charge that keeping faith with
our precedents-and requiring that the courts of appeals do likewisewould "'destroy the uniformity of federal practice,"' ante, at 436, n. 19.
I had thought our decisions established uniformity. And as for commentators' observations that it would be "'astonishing"' for us actually to heed
our precedents, see ibid., quoting 11 Wright, Miller, & Kane, §2820, at

212, they are no more than a prediction of inconstancy-which the Court
today fufills.

is possible to characterize an appeal of a denial of new trial
as raising a "legal question," it is not possible to review such
a claim without engaging in a "reexamin[ation]" of the "fact§
tried by the jury" in a manner "otherwise" than allowed at
common law. Determining whether a particular award is
excessive requires that one first determine the nature and
extent of the harm-which undeniably requires reviewing
the facts of the case. That the court's review also entails
application of a legal standard (whether "shocks the conscience," "deviates materially," or some other) makes no
difference, for what is necessarily also required is reexamination offacts found by the jury.
In the last analysis, the Court frankly abandons any pretense at faithfulness to the common law, suggesting that "the
meaning" of the Reexamination Clause was not "fixed at
1791," ante, at 436, n. 20, contrary to the view that all our
prior discussions of the Reexamination Clause have adopted,
see supra, at 451-454. The Court believes we can ignore
the very explicit command that "no fact tried by a jury shall
be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States,
than according to the rules of the common law" because,
after all, we have not insisted that juries be all male, or consist of 12 jurors, as they were at common law. Ante, at 436,
n. 20. This is a desperate analogy, since there is of course
no comparison between the specificity of the command of the
Reexamination Clause and the specificity of the command
that there be a "jury." The footnote abandonment of our
traditional view of the Reexamination Clause is a major
step indeed. 8
8Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U. S. 494 (1931),
is the only case cited in the Court's footnote that arguably involved the
slightest departure from common-law practices regarding review of jury
findings. It held, to be sure, that a new trial could be ordered on damages
alone, even though at common law there was no practice of setting a verdict aside in part. But it did so only after satisfying itself that the change

The Court's holding that federal courts of appeals may review district-court denials of motions for new trials for error
of fact is not the only novel aspect of today's decision. The
Court also directs that the case be remanded to the District
Court, so that it may "test the jury's verdict against CPLR
§5501(c)'s 'deviates materially' standard." Ante, at 439.
This disposition contradicts the principle that "[t]he proper
role of the trial and appellate courts in the federal system in
reviewing the size of jury verdicts is ...a matter of federal

law." Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., 429 U. S. 648, 649
(1977) (percuriam).
The Court acknowledges that state procedural rules cannot, as a general matter, be permitted to interfere with the
allocation of functions in the federal court system, see ante,
at 436-437. Indeed, it is at least partly for this reason that
the Court rejects direct application of § 5501(c) at the appellate level as inconsistent with an "'essential characteristic"'
of the federal court system-by which the Court presumably
means abuse-of-discretion review of denials of motions for
new trials. See ante, at 431, 437-438. But the scope of the
Court's concern is oddly circumscribed. The "essential
characteristic" of the federal jury, and, more specifically, the
role of the federal trial court in reviewing jury judgments,
apparently counts for little. The Court approves the "acwas one of "form" rather than "substance," quoting Lord Mansfield to the
effect that "'for form's sake, we must set aside the whole verdict."' Id.,
at 498 (quoting Edie v. East India Co., 1 Black W. 295, 298, 96 Eng. Rep.
166, 167 (K. B. 1761)). It can hardly be maintained that whether or not a
jury's damages award may be set aside on appeal is a matter of form.
The footnote also cites 9A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and
Procedure §2522 (2d ed. 1995), for its discussion of Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 50(b), which permits post-trial motion for judgment as a matter
of law. The Court neglects to mention that that discussion states: "The
Supreme Court held that reservation of the decision in this fashion had
been recognized at common law...." Id., §2522, at 245.

commodat[ion]" achieved by having district courts review
jury verdicts under the "deviates materially" standard, because it regards that as a means of giving effect to the State's
purposes "without disrupting the federal system," ante, at
437. But changing the standard by which trial judges review jury verdicts does disrupt the federal system, and is
plainly inconsistent with the "strong federal policy against
allowing state rules to disrupt the judge-jury relationship in
the federal court." Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525,538 (1958). 9 The Court's opinion does
not even acknowledge, let alone address, this dislocation.
We discussed precisely the point at issue here in
Browning-FerrisIndustries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,
Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989), and gave an answer altogether contrary to the one provided today. Browning-Ferrisrejected
a request to fashion a federal common-law rule limiting the
size of punitive damages awards in federal courts, reaffirming the principle of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S.
64 (1938), that "[i]n a diversity action, or in any other lawsuit
where state law provides the basis of decision, the propriety
of an award of punitive damages... and the factors the jury
may consider in determining their amount, are questions of
state law." 492 U. S., at 278. But the opinion expressly
stated that "[f]ederal law ... will control on those issues
involving the proper review of the jury award by a federal
district court and court of appeals." Id., at 278-279. "In
reviewing an award of punitive damages," it said, "the role
of the district court is to determine whether the jury's verdict is within the confines set by state law, and to determine,
by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59,
whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered." Id.,
at 279. The same distinction necessarily applies where the

judgment under review is for compensatory damages: State
substantive law controls what injuries are compensable and
in what amount; but federal standards determine whether
the award exceeds what is lawful to such degree that it may
be set aside by order for new trial or remittitur. 10
The Court does not disavow those statements in
Browning-Ferris(indeed, it does not even discuss them), but
it presumably overrules them, at least where the state rule
that governs "whether a new trial or remittitur should be
ordered" is characterized as "substantive" in nature. That,
at any rate, is the reason the Court asserts for giving
§ 5501(c) dispositive effect. The objective of that provision,
the Court states, "is manifestly substantive," ante, at 429,
since it operates to "contro[l] how much a plaintiff can be
awarded" by "tightening the range of tolerable awards," ante,
at 425,426. Although "less readily classified" as substantive
than "a statutory cap on damages," it nonetheless "was
designed to provide an analogous control," ante, at 428, 429,
by making a new trial mandatory when the award "deviat[es]
materially" from what is reasonable, see ante, at 428-429.
I do not see how this can be so. It seems to me quite
wrong to regard this provision as a "substantive" rule for
Erie purposes. The "analog[y]" to "a statutory cap on damages," ante, at 428, 429, fails utterly. There is an absolutely
fundamental distinction between a rule of law such as that,
which would ordinarily be imposed upon the jury in the trial
court's instructions, and a rule of review, which simply determines how closely the jury verdict will be scrutinized for
10 JUSTICE STEVENS thinks that if an award "'exceeds what is lawful,"'
the result is "legal error" that "may be corrected" by the appellate court.
Ante, at 443, n. 2. But the sort of "legal error" involved here is the imposition of legal consequences (in this case, damages) in light of facts that,
under the law, may not warrant them. To suggest that every fact may
be reviewed, because what may ensue from an erroneous factual determination is a "legal error," is to destroy the notion that there is a factfinding
function reserved to the jury.

ScAMA, J., dissenting

compliance with the instructions. A tighter standard for reviewing jury determinations can no more plausibly be called
a "substantive" disposition than can a tighter appellate
standard for reviewing trial-court determinations. The one,
like the other, provides additional assurance that the law has
been complied with; but the other, like the one, leaves the
law unchanged.
The Court commits the classic Erie mistake of regarding
whatever changes the outcome as substantive, see ante, at
428-431. That is not the only factor to be considered. See
Byrd, supra, at 537 ("[W]ere 'outcome' the only consideration, a strong case might appear for saying that the federal
court should follow the state practice. But there are affirmative countervailing considerations at work here").
Outcome determination "was never intended to serve as a
talisman," Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 466-467 (1965),
and does not have the power to convert the most classic elements of the process of assuring that the law is observed into
the substantive law itself. The right to have a jury make
the findings of fact, for example, is generally thought to favor
plaintiffs, and that advantage is often thought significant
enough to be the basis for forum selection. But no one
would argue that Erie confers a right to a jury in federal
court wherever state courts would provide it; or that, were it
not for the Seventh Amendment, Erie would require federal
courts to dispense with the jury whenever state courts do so.
In any event, the Court exaggerates the difference that
the state standard will make. It concludes that different
outcomes are likely to ensue depending on whether the law
being applied is the state "deviates materially" standard of
§ 5501(c) or the "shocks the conscience" standard. See ante,
at 429-430. Of course it is not the federal appellate standard but the federal district-courtstandard for granting new
trials that must be compared with the New York standard
to determine whether substantially different results will obtain-and it is far from clear that the district-court standard

SCALU, J., dissenting

ought to be "shocks the conscience."" Indeed, it is not even
clear (as the Court asserts) that "shocks the conscience" is
the standard (erroneous or not) actually applied by the district courts of the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit's test
for reversing a grant of a new trial for an excessive verdict
is whether the award was "clearlywithin the maximum limit
of a reasonable range," Ismail v. Cohen, 899 F. 2d 183, 186

(CA2 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), so any district court that uses that standard will be affirmed. And
while many district-court decisions express the "shocks the
conscience" criterion, see, e. g., Koerner v. Club Mediterranee, S. A., 833 F. Supp. 327, 333 (SDNY 1993), some have
used a standard of "indisputably egregious," Banff v. Express, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 1065, 1069 (SDNY 1995), or have
adopted the inverse of the Second Circuit's test for reversing
a grant of new trial, namely, "clearly outside the maximum
limit of a reasonable range," Paper Corp.v. Schoeller Technical Papers, Inc., 807 F. Supp. 337, 350-351 (SDNY 1992).
Moreover, some decisions that say "shocks the conscience"
in fact apply a rule much less stringent. One case, for example, says that any award that would not be sustained under
the New York "deviates materially" rule "shocks the conscience." See In re Joint Eastern & S. Dist. Asbestos Litigation, 798 F. Supp. 925, 937 (E&SDNY 1992), rev'd on other
grounds, 995 F. 2d 343, 346 (CA2 1993). In sum, it is at least
highly questionable whether the consistent outcome differential claimed by the Court even exists. What seems to me
far more likely to produce forum shopping is the consistent
difference between the state and federal appellate standards, which the Court leaves untouched. Under the Court's
" 1That the "shocks the conscience" standard was not the traditional one
would seem clear from the opinion of Justice Story, quoted approvingly by
the Court, ante, at 433, to the effect that remittitur should be granted "if
it should clearly appear that the jury... have given damages excessive
in relation to the person or the injury." Blunt v. Little, 3 F. Cas. 760,
761-762 (No. 1,578) (CC Mass. 1822).

disposition, the Second Circuit reviews only for abuse of discretion, whereas New York's appellate courts engage in a
de novo review for material deviation, giving the defendant
a double shot at getting the damages award set aside. The
only result that would produce the conformity the Court erroneously believes Erie requires is the one adopted by the
Second Circuit and rejected by the Court: de novo federal
appellate review under the § 5501(c) standard.
To say that application of §5501(c) in place of the federal
standard will not consistently produce disparate results is
not to suggest that the decision the Court has made today is
not a momentous one. The principle that the state standard
governs is of great importance, since it bears the potential
to destroy the uniformity of federal practice and the integrity of the federal court system. Under the Court's view, a
state rule that directed courts "to determine that an award
is excessive or inadequate if it deviates in any degree from
the proper measure of compensation" would have to be applied in federal courts, effectively requiring federal judges
to determine the amount of damages de novo, and effectively
taking the matter away from the jury entirely. Cf. Byrd,
356 U. S., at 537-538. Or consider a state rule that allowed
the defendant a second trial on damages, with judgment ultimately in the amount of the lesser of two jury awards. Cf.
United States v. Wonson, .28 F. Cas., at 747-748 (describing
Massachusetts practice by which a second jury trial could be
had on appeal). Under the reasoning of the Court's opinion,
even such a rule as that would have to be applied in the
federal courts.
The foregoing describes why I think the Court's Erie analysis is flawed. But in my view, one does not even reach the
Erie question in this case. The standard to be applied by a
district court in ruling on a motion for a new trial is set forth
in Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which
provides that "[a] new trial may be granted... for any of the
reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in

468

actions at law in the courts of the United States." (Emphasis added.) That is undeniably a federal standard. 12 Federal District Courts in the Second Circuit have interpreted
that standard to permit the granting of new trials where "'it
is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous
result"' and letting the verdict stand would result in a "'miscarriage of justice."' Koerner v. Club Mediterranee,S. A.,
supra, at 331 (quoting Bevevino v. Saydjari, 574 F. 2d 676,
684 (CA2 1978)). Assuming (as we have no reason to question) that this is a correct interpretation of what Rule 59
requires, it is undeniable that the Federal Rule is "'sufficiently broad' to cause a 'direct collision' with the state law
or, implicitly, to 'control the issue' before the court, thereby
leaving no room for the operation of that law." Burlington
Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1987).

It is sim-

ply not possible to give controlling effect both to the federal
standard and the state standard in reviewing the jury's
award. That being so, the court has no choice but to apply
the Federal Rule, which is an exercise of what we have called
Congress's "power to regulate matters which, though falling
within the uncertain area between substance and procedure,
are rationally capable of classification as either," Hanna,380
U. S., at 472.
There is no small irony in the Court's declaration today
that appellate review of refusals to grant new trials for error
of fact is "a control necessary and proper to the fair adminis121 agree with the Court's entire progression of reasoning in its footnote
22, ante, at 437, leading to the conclusion that state law must determine

"[w]hether damages are excessive." But the question whether damages
are excessive is quite separate from the question of when a jury award
may be set aside for excessiveness. See supra, at 465. It is the latter
that is governed by Rule 59; as Browning-Ferrissaid, district courts are
"to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule
59, whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered," 492 U. S., at 279
(emphasis added).

tration of justice," ante, at 435. It is objection to pr'ecisely
that sort of "control" by federal appellate judges that gave
birth to the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment. Alas, those who drew the Amendment, and the citizens who approved it, did not envision an age in which the
Constitution means whatever this Court thinks it ought to
mean-or indeed, whatever the courts of appeals have recently thought it ought to mean.
When there is added to the revision of the Seventh
Amendment the Court's precedent-setting disregard of Congress's instructions in Rule 59, one must conclude that this
is a bad day for the Constitution's distinctive, Article III
courts in general, and for the role of the jury in those courts
in particular. I respectfully dissent.
