MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR ET VIR
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 95-754. Argued April 23, 1996-Decided June 26, 1996*
Enacted "to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices
intended for human use," the Medical Device Amendments of 1976
(MDA or Act) classifies such devices based on the risk that they pose to
the public. Class III devices pose the greatest risk and, thus, are subject to a rigorous premarket approval (PMA) process. However, most
Class III devices on the market have not been through the PMA process
due to two statutory exceptions. Realizing that existing devices could
not be withdrawn from the market while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed PMA analyses, Congress included a provision
allowing pre-1976 devices to remain on the market without FDA approval until the requisite PMA is completed. The Act also permits devices that are "substantially equivalent" to pre-existing devices to avoid
the PMA process until the FDA initiates the process for the underlying
device. The FDA uses a "premarket notification" submitted by all
manufacturers (§ 510(k) process) to determine substantial equivalence
for Class III devices. Petitioner Medtronic, Inc.'s pacemaker is a Class
III device found substantially equivalent under the §510(k) process.
Cross-petitioners, Lora Lohr and her spouse, filed a Florida state-court
suit alleging both negligence and strict-liability claims in the failure of
her Medtronic pacemaker, but Medtronic removed the case to the Federal District Court. That court ultimately dismissed the complaint as
having been pre-empted by 21 U. S. C. § 360k(a), which provides that
"no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in
effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement
(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable
under [the MDA] to the device, and (2) which relates to the safety or
effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under [the Act]." The Court of Appeals
reversed in part and affirmed in part, concluding that the Lohrs' negligent design claims were not pre-empted, but that their negligent manufacturing and failure to warn claims were.

56 F. 3d 1335, reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.
JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, III, V, and VII, concluding that the MDA does not pre-empt
the Lohrs' common-law claims. Pp. 484-486; 492-502; 503.
(a) While the Court need not go beyond § 360k(a)'s pre-emptive language to determine whether Congress intended the MDA to pre-empt
at least some state law, see Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S.
504, 517, "the domain expressly pre-empted" by that language must be
identified, ibid. Interpretation of the text is informed by the assumptions that the States' historic police powers cannot be superseded
by a Federal Act unless that is Congress' clear and manifest purpose,
Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230, and that any understanding of a pre-emption statute's scope rests primarily on "a fair
understanding of congressionalpurpose," Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 530,
n. 27. Pp. 484-486.
(b) The Lohrs' negligent design claims are not pre-empted. The
FDA's "substantially equivalent" determination as well as its continuing
authority to exclude a device from the market do not amount to a specific, federally enforceable design requirement that would be affected
by state-law pressures such as those imposed here. Since the § 510(k)
process is focused on equivalence, not safety, substantial equivalence
determinations provide little protection to the public. Neither the statutory scheme nor legislative history suggests that the § 510(k) process
was intended to do anything other than maintain the status quo, which
included the possibility that a device's manufacturer would have to defend itself against state-law negligent design claims. Pp. 492-494.
(c) Section 360k(a) does not pre-empt state rules that merely duplicate the FDA's rules regulating manufacturing practices and labeling.
That the state requirements may be narrower than the federal rules
does not make them "different" under §360k. Nor does the presence of
a damages remedy amount to an additional or different "requirement";
it merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with
identical existing federal law "requirements." This view is supported
by the regulations of the FDA, to which Congress has delegated authority to implement the MDA. Pp. 494-497.
(d)The Lohrs' manufacturing and labeling claims are not pre-empted.
Although the statutory and regulatory language may not preclude "general" federal requirements from ever pre-empting state requirements,
or "general" state requirements from ever being pre-empted, it is impossible to ignore its overarching concern that pre-emption occur only

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Syllabus
where a particular state requirement threatens to interfere with a specific federal interest. State requirements must be "With respect to"
medical devices and "different from, or in addition to," federal requirements. They must also relate "to the safety or effectiveness of the
device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the
device," and the regulations provide that state requirements of general
applicability are pre-empted only where they have "the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device." Federal requirements must be "applicable to the device" in question, and, according to the regulations, pre-empt state law only if they are "specific
counterpart regulations" or "specific" to a "particular device." The federal manufacturing and labeling requirements at issue reflect important
but entirely generic concerns about device regulation generally, not the
sort of concerns regarding a specific device or field of device regulation
which the statute or regulations were designed to protect from potentially contradictory state requirements. Similarly, Florida's commonlaw requirements were not specifically developed "with respect to" medical devices and, thus, are not the kinds of requirements that Congress
and the FDA feared would impede implementation and enforcement of
specific federal requirements. Pp. 497-502.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY, JUSTICE SOUTER,
and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded in Part IV that Medtronic's argument that any common-law cause of action is a "requirement" under
§ 360k(a) is implausible, for it would grant complete immunity from
design defect liability to an entire industry that, in Congress' judgment,
needed more stringent regulation. It would take language much
plainer than §360k's text to do that. The word "requirement," which
appears to presume that the State is imposing a specific duty upon the
manufacturer, would be an odd term to use to indicate the sweeping
pre-emption Medtronic urges here. Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 521-522,
distinguished. The legislation's basic purpose and history entirely support the rejection of such an extreme position. Pp. 486-491.
JUSTICE BREYER concluded that, although the MDA will sometimes
pre-empt a state-law tort suit, it does not pre-empt the claims at issue
here. First, since the MDA's pre-emption provision is highly ambiguous, Congress must have intended that courts look elsewhere for help
as to just which federal requirements pre-empt just which state requirements, as well as just how they might do so. Second, in the absence of
a clear congressional command as to pre-emption, courts may infer that
the relevant administrative agency possesses a degree of leeway to determine which rules, regulations, or other administrative actions will
have pre-emptive effect. See HillsboroughCounty v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U S. 707, 721. Third, the FDA's regula-

tions indicate that the FDA does not consider that its requirements
pre-empt the state requirements at issue here. Fourth, ordinary principles of "conflict" and 'feld" pre-emption support the conclusion that
plaintiffs' tort claims are not pre-empted. Pp. 503-508.

and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts
I, II, III, V, and VII, and an opinion with respect to Parts
IV and VI, in which JUSTICE KENNEDY, JUSTICE SOUTER,

Congress enacted the Medical Device Amendments of
1976, in the words of the statute's preamble, "to provide for
the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended
for human use." 90 Stat. 539. The question presented is
whether that statute pre-empts a state common-law negligence action against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective medical device. Specifically, we must consider whether
Lora Lohr, who was injured when her pacemaker failed, may

rely on Florida common law to recover damages from Medtronic, Inc., the manufacturer of the device.

Opinion of the Court

I
Throughout our history the several- States have exercised
their police powers to protect the health and safety of their
citizens. Because these are "primarily, and historically,...
matter[s] of local concern," Hilisborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories,Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 719 (1985),
the "States traditionally have had great latitude under their
police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives,
limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons," Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756 (1985)
(internal quotation marks omitted).
Despite the prominence of the States in matters of public
health and safety, in recent decades the Federal Government
has played an increasingly significant role in the protection
of the health of our people. Congress' first significant enactment in the field of public health was the Food and Drug
Act of 1906, a broad prohibition against the manufacture or
shipment in interstate commerce of any adulterated or misbranded food or drug. See 34 Stat. 768; Regier, The Struggle for Federal Food and Drugs Legislation, 1 Law &
Contemp. Prob. 1 (1933). Partly in response to an ongoing
concern about radio and newspaper advertising making false
therapeutic claims for both "quack machines" and legitimate
devices such as surgical instruments and orthopedic shoes,
in 1938 Congress broadened the coverage of the 1906 Act to
include misbranded or adulterated medical devices and cosmetics. See Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938
(FDCA), §§ 501, 502, 52 Stat. 1049-1051; Cavers, The Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938: Its Legislative History and
Its Substantive Provisions, 6 Law & Contemp. Prob. 2 (1939);
H. R. Rep. No. 94-853, p. 6 (1976).
While the FDCA provided for premarket approval of new
drugs, Cavers, 6 Law & Contemp. Prob., at 40, it did not
authorize any control over the introduction of new medical
devices, see S. Rep. No. 93-670, pp. 1-2 (1974); H. R. Rep.
No. 94-853, at 6. As technologies advanced and medicine

Opinion of the Court

relied to an increasing degree on a vast array of medical
equipment "[f]rom bedpans to brainscans," I including kidney
2
dialysis units, artificial heart valves, and heart pacemakers,
policymakers and the public became concerned about the
increasingly severe injuries that resulted from the failure
of such devices. See generally Finck, The Effectiveness of
FDA Medical Device Regulation, 7 U. C. D. L. Rev. 293, 297301 (1974); H. R. Rep. No. 94-853, at 7.
In 1970, for example, the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine
contraceptive device, was introduced to the American public
and throughout the world. Touted as a safe and effective
contraceptive, the Dalkon Shield resulted in a disturbingly
high percentage of inadvertent pregnancies, serious infections, and even, in a few cases, death. Id., at 8; Regulation
of Medical Devices (Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices),
Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee
on Government Operations, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973). In
the early 1970's, several other devices, including catheters,
artificial heart valves, defibrillators, and pacemakers (including pacemakers manufactured by petitioner Medtronic), attracted the attention of consumers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Congress as possible health risks.
See Medical Device Amendments, 1973, Hearings before the
Subcommittee on Health of the Senate Committee on Labor
and Public Welfare, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 270-361 (1973).
In response to the mounting consumer and regulatory concern, Congress enacted the statute at issue here: the Medical
Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA or Act), 90 Stat. 539.
The Act classifies medical devices in three categories based
on the risk that they pose to the public. Devices that pre1

Opinion of the Court

sent no unreasonable risk of illness or injury are designated
Class I and are subject only to minimal regulation by "general controls." 21 U. S. C. § 360c(a)(1)(A). Devices that are
potentially more harmful are designated Class II; although
they may be marketed without advance approval, manufacturers of such devices must comply with federal performance
regulations known as "special controls." §360c(a)(1)(B).
Finally, devices that either "presen[t] a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury," or which are "purported or
represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining
human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in
preventing impairment of human health," are designated
Class III. §360c(a)(1)(C). Pacemakers are Class III devices. See 21 CFR § 870.3610 (1995).
Before a new Class III device may be introduced to the
market, the manufacturer must provide the FDA with a
"reasonable assurance" that the device is both safe and effective. See 21 U. S. C. §360e(d)(2). Despite its relatively
innocuous phrasing, the process of establishing this "reasonable assurance," which is knoym as the "premarket approval," or "PMA" process, is a rigorous one. Manufacturers must submit detailed information regarding the safety
and efficacy of their devices, which the FDA then reviews,
spending an average of 1,200 hours on each submission.
Hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee on Energy & Commerce,
100th Cong., 1st Sess. (Ser. No. 100-34), p. 384 (1987) (hereinafter 1987 Hearings); see generally Kahan, Premarket Approval Versus Premarket Notification: Different Routes to
the Same Market, 39 Food Drug Cosm. L. J. 510, 512-514
(1984).
Not all, nor even most, Class III devices on the market
today have received premarket approval because of two important exceptions to the PMA requirement. First, Congress realized that existing medical devices could not be

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Opinion of the Court

withdrawn from the market while the FDA completed its
PMA analysis for those devices. The statute therefore includes a "grandfathering" provision which allows pre-1976
devices to remain on the market without FDA approval until
such time as the FDA initiates and completes the requisite
PMA. See 21 U. S. C. § 360e(b)(1)(A); 21 CFR § 814.1(c)(1)
(1995). 3

Second, to prevent manufacturers of grandfathered

devices from monopolizing the market while new devices
clear the PMA hurdle, and to ensure that improvements to
existing devices can be rapidly introduced into the market,
the Act also permits devices that are "substantially equivalent" to pre-existing devices to avoid the PMA process. See
21 U. S. C. § 360e(b)(1)(B).
Although "substantially equivalent" Class III devices may
be marketed without the rigorous PMA review, such new
devices, as well as all new Class I and Class II devices, are
subject to the requirements of §360(k). That section imposes a limited form of review on every manufacturer intending to market a new device by requiring it to submit a "premarket notification" to the FDA (the process is also known
as a "§ 510(k) process," after the number of the section in the
original Act). If the FDA concludes on the basis of the
§ 510(k) notification that the device is "substantially equivalent" to a pre-existing device, it can be marketed without
further regulatory analysis (at least until the FDA initiates
the PMA process for the underlying pre-1976 device to which
the new device is "substantially equivalent"). The § 510(k)
notification process is by no means comparable to the PMA
3The FDA has not yet initiated nor suggested the initiation of a PMA
process for pacemakers or most other grandfathered devices. But see 60
Fed. Reg. 41984, 41986 (1995) (pursuant to Safe Medical Devices Act of
1990, 104 Stat. 4511, calling for submission of information by February
1997 which may lead the FDA to reclassify or initiate PMA process at
some time in the future for implantable pacemaker pulse generators and
lead adapters).

Opinion of the Court

process; in contrast to the 1,200 hours necessary to complete
a PMA review, the § 510(k) review is completed in an average
of only 20 hours. See 1987 Hearings, at 384. As one commentator noted: "The attraction of substantial equivalence
to manufacturers is clear. [Section] 510(k) notification requires little information, rarely elicits a negative response
from the FDA, and gets processed very quickly." Adler,

Direction Needs Another Step in the Right Direction, 43
Food Drug Cosm. L. J. 511, 516 (1988); see also Kahan, 39
Food Drug Cosm. L. J., at 514-519.
Congress anticipated that the FDA would complete the
PMA process for Class III devices relatively swiftly. But
because of the substantial investment of time and energy
necessary for the resolution of each PMA application, the
ever-increasing numbers of medical devices, and internal administrative and resource difficulties, the FDA simply could
not keep up with the rigorous PMA process. As a result,
the § 510(k) premarket notification process became the means
by which most new medical devices-including Class III devices-were approved for the market. In 1983, for instance,
a House Report concluded that nearly 1,000 of approximately
1,100 Class III devices that had been introduced to the market since 1976 were admitted as "substantial equivalents"
and without any PMA review. See Medical Device Regulation: The FDA's Neglected Child (Committee Print compiled
for the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the
House Committee on Energy and Commerce), Comm. Print
98-F, p. 34 (1983). This lopsidedness has apparently not
evened out; despite an increasing effort by the FDA to consider the safety and efficacy of substantially equivalent devices, the House reported in 1990 that 80% of new Class III
devices were being introduced to the market through the
§ 510(k) process and without PMA review. H. R. Rep.
No. 101-808, p. 14 (1990); see also D. Kessler, S. Pape, &

II
As have so many other medical device manufacturers,
petitioner Medtronic took advantage of § 510(k)'s expedited
process in October 1982, when it notified the FDA that
it intended to market its Model 4011 pacemaker lead as a
device that was "substantially equivalent" to devices already
on the market. (The lead is the portion of a pacemaker that
transmits the heartbeat-steadying, electrical signal from
the "pulse generator" to the heart itself.) On November
30, 1982, the FDA found that the model was "substantially
equivalent to devices introduced into interstate commerce"
prior to the effective date of the Act, and advised Medtronic
that it could therefore market its device subject only to the
general control provisions of the Act, which could be found
in the Code of Federal Regulations. See Respondent's
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment
in No. 93-482 (MD Fla., Nov. 1, 1993), Exh. A to Exh. 1 (Declaration of Charles H. Swanson) (hereinafter FDA Substantial Equivalence Letter). The agency emphasized, however,
that this determination should not be construed as an endorsement of the pacemaker lead's safety. Ibid.
Cross-petitioner Lora Lohr is dependent on pacemaker
technology for the proper functioning of her heart.. In 1987
she was implanted with a Medtronic pacemaker equipped
with one of the company's Model 4011 pacemaker leads. On

See Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990.

Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

December 30, 1990, the pacemaker failed, allegedly resulting
in a "complete heart block" that required emergency stirgery.
According to her physician, a defect in the lead was the likely
cause of the failure.
In 1993 Lohr and her husband filed this action in a Florida
state court. Their complaint contained both a negligence
count and a strict-liability count. The negligence count alleged a breach of Medtronic's "duty to use reasonable care
in the design, manufacture, assembly, and sale of the subject
pacemaker" in several respects, including the use of defective materials in the lead and a failure to warn or properly
instruct the plaintiff or her physicians of the tendency of the
pacemaker to fail, despite knowledge of other earlier failures.
Complaint 5. The strict-liability count alleged that the device was in a defective condition and unreasonably dangerous
to foreseeable users at the time of its sale. Id., 11. (A
third count alleging breach of warranty was dismissed for
failure to state a claim under Florida law.)
Medtronic removed the case to Federal District Court,
where it filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that
both the negligence and strict-liability claims were preempted by 21 U. S. C. § 360k(a). That section, which is at
the core of the dispute between the parties in this suit,
provides:
"§ 360k. State and local requirements respecting
devices
"(a) General rule
"Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section,
no State or political subdivision of a State may establish
or continue in effect with respect to a device intended
for human use any requirement"(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,
and

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Opinion of the Court

"(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the
device or to any other matter included in a requirement
applicable to the device under this chapter." 5
The District Court initially denied Medtronic's motion,
finding nothing in the statute to support the company's argument that the MDA entirely exempted from liability a manufacturer who had allegedly violated the FDA's regulations.

See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5d. Not long after that decision,
however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit concluded that §360k required pre-emption of

at least some common-law claims brought against the manu5

Subsection (b) of the statute authorizes the FDA to grant exemptions
to state requirements that would otherwise be pre-empted by subsection
(a). Section 360k(b) provides:
"(b) Exempt requirements
"Upon application of a State or a political subdivision thereof, the Secretary may, by regulation promulgated after notice and opportunity for an
oral hearing, exempt from subsection (a) of this section, under such conditions as may be prescribed in such regulation, a requirement of such State
or political subdivision applicable to a device intended for human use if"(1) the requirement is more stringent than a requirement under this
chapter which would be applicable to the device if an exemption were not
in effect under this subsection; or
"(2) the requirement"(A) is required by compelling local conditions, and
"(B) compliance with the requirement would not cause the device to be
in violation of any applicable requirement under this chapter."
To carry out this grant of authority, the FDA has issued regulations
under the statute which both construe the scope of §360k(a) and address
the instances in which the FDA will grant exemptions to its pre-emptive
effect. See 21 CFR §808.1 (1995); n. 18, infra.
We note that although it is the FDA that exercises this authority, the
Act gives that authority directly to the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, who subsequently delegated her authority to the FDA. See,
e.g., 21 U. S. C. §360k(b) ("the Secretary may" exempt state requirements), §321(d) ("Secretary" defined as "the Secretary of Health and
Human Services"). Under the FDCA, the Secretary is vested with "[tihe
authority to promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of" the
Act. 21 U. S. C. § 371(a).

Opinion of the Court

facturer of a medical device. See Duncan v. lolab Corp., 12
F. 3d 194 (1994). After reconsidering its ruling in light of
Duncan, the District Court reversed its earlier decision and
-dismissed the Lohrs' entire complaint.
The Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in
part. 56 F. 3d 1335 (CAll 1995). Rejecting the Lohrs'
broadest submission, it first decided that "common law
actions are state requirements within the meaning of
§360k(a)." Id., at 1342. It next held that pre-emption
could not be avoided by merely alleging that the negligence
flowed from a violation of federal standards. Id., at 1343.
Then, after concluding that the term "requirements" in
§360k(a) was unclear, it sought guidance from FDA's regulations regarding pre-emption. Those regulations provide
that a state requirement is not pre-empted unless the FDA
has established "'specific r~quirements applicable to a particular device."' Id., at 1344 (citing 21 CFR §808.1(d) (1995)).
Under these regulations, the court concluded, it was not necessary that the federal regulation specifically deal with pacemakers, but only that the federal requirement "should, in
some way, be 'restricted by nature' to a particular process,
procedure, or device and should not be completely openended," 56 F. 3d, at 1346 (footnote omitted), and that the
specific device at issue should be subject to its requirements.
Under this approach, the' court concluded that the Lohrs'
negligent design claims were not pre-empted. It rejected
Medtronic's argument that the FDA's finding of "substantial
equivalence" had any significance with respect to the pacemaker's safety, or that the FDA's continued surveillance of
the device constituted a federal "requirement" that its design
be maintained. Id., at 1347-1349. On the other hand, it
concluded that the negligent manufacturing and failure to
warn claims were pre-empted by FDA's general "good manufacturing practices" regulations, which establish general requirements for most steps in every device's manufacture, see
id., at 1350; 21 CFR §§ 820.20-820.198 (1995), and by the

Opinion of the Court

FDA labeling regulations, which require devices to bear various warnings, see 56 F. 3d, at 1350-1351; 21 CFR §801.109
(1995). The court made a parallel disposition of the'strictliability claims, holding that there was no pre-emption insofar as plaintiffs alleged an unreasonably dangerous design,
but they could not revive the negligent manufacturing or
failure to warn claims under a strict-liability theory. 56
F. 3d, at 1351-1352.
Medtronic filed a petition for certiorari seeking review of
the Court of Appeals' decision insofar as it affirmed the District Court and the Lohrs filed a cross-petition seeking review of the judgment insofar as it upheld the pre-emption
defense. Because the Courts of Appeals are divided over
the extent to which state common-law claims are pre-empted
by the MDA,6 we granted both petitions. 516 U. S. 1087
(1996).
III

As in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992),
we are presented with the task of interpreting a statutory
provision that expressly pre-empts state law. While the
pre-emptive language of §360k(a) means that we need not go
beyond that language to determine whether Congress intended the MDA to pre-empt at least some state law, see id.,
at 517, we must nonetheless "identify the domain expressly
pre-empted" by that language, ibid. Although our analysis
of the scope of the pre-emption statute must begin with its
text, see Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn.,
6See, e.g., English v. Mentor Corp., 67 F. 3d 477 (CA3 1995) (§510(k)
process creates pre-emptive "requirements"); Feldt v. Mentor Corp., 61
F. 3d 431 (CA5 1995) (0510(k) process does not create pre-emptive "requirements"); Michael v. Shiley, Inc., 46 F. 3d 1316 (GA3 1995) (claim alleging violation of federal requirement not pre-empted); 56 F. 3d 1335 (CAll
1995) (case below) (claim alleging violation of federal requirement may
be pre-empted; §510(k) process may create pre-emptive requirements;
common-law claims covered by §360k(a)); Kennedy v. Collagen Corp., 67
F. 3d 1453 (CA9 1995) (common-law claims not covered at all by §360k(a)).

Opinion of the Court

505 U. S. 88, 111 (1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), our interpretation of that language
does not occur in a contextual vacuum. Rather, that interpretation is informed by two presumptions about the nature
of pre-emption. See ibid.
First, because the States are independent sovereigns in
our federal system, we have long presumed that Congress
does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action. In
all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has "legislated ... in a field which the States have
traditionally occupied," Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331
U. S. 218, 230 (1947), we "start with the assumption that the
historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Ibid.; Hillsborough Cry., 471
U. S., at 715-716; cf. Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482
U. S. 1, 22 (1987). Although dissenting Justices have argued
that this assumption should apply only to the question
whether Congress intended any pre-emption at all, as opposed to questions concerning the scope of its intended invalidation of state law, see Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 545-546
(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in
part), we used a "presumption against the pre-emption of
state police power regulations" to support a narrow interpretation of such an express command in Cipollone. Id., at
518, 523. That approach is consistent with both federalism
concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety.
Second, our analysis of the scope of the statute's preemption is guided by our oft-repeated comment, initially
made in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U. S. 96, 103
(1963), that "[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone" in every pre-emption case. See, e. g., Cipollone, 505
U. S., at 516; Gade, 505 U. S., at 96; Malone v. White Motor
Corp., 435 U. S. 497, 504 (1978). As a result, any understanding of the scope of a pre-emption statute must rest pri-

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

marily on "a fair understanding of congressionalpurpose."
Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 530, n. 27 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).
Congress' intent, of course, primarily is discerned from the
language of the pre-emption statute and the "statutory
framework" surrounding it. Gade, 505 U. S., at 111 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
Also relevant, however, is the "structure and purpose of the
statute as a whole," id., at 98 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), as
revealed not only in the text, but through the reviewing
court's reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress
intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme
to affect business, consumers, and the law.
With these considerations in mind, we turn first to a consideration of petitioner Medtronic's claim that the Court of
Appeals should have found the entire action pre-empted and
then to the merits of the Lohrs' cross-petition.
IV
In its petition, Medtronic argues that the Court of Appeals
erred by concluding that the Lohrs' claims alleging negligent
design were not pre-empted by 21 U. S. C. §360k(a). That
section provides that "no State or political subdivision of a
State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a
device intended for human use any requirement (1) which is
different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable
under this chapter to the device, and (2) which relates to the
safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter
included in a requirement applicable to the device under this
chapter." Medtronic suggests that any common-law cause
of action is a "requirement" which alters incentives and imposes duties "different from, or in addition to," the generic
federal standards that the FDA has promulgated in response
to mandates under the MDA. In essence, the company argues that the plain language of the statute pre-empts any
and all common-law claims brought by an injured plaintiff
against a manufacturer of medical devices.

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

Medtronic's argument is not only unpersuasive, it is implausible. Under Medtronic's view of the statute, Congress
effectively precluded state courts from affording state consumers any protection from injuries resulting from a defective medical device. Moreover, because there is no explicit
private cause of action against manufacturers contained in
the MDA, and no suggestion that the Act created an implied
private right of action, Congress would have barred most, if
not all, relief for persons injured by defective medical devices. 7 Medtronic's construction of § 360k would therefore
have the perverse effect of granting complete immunity from
design defect liability to an entire industry that, in the judgment of Congress, needed more stringent regulation in order
"to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use," 90 Stat. 539 (preamble to
Act). It is, to say the least, "difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial
recourse for those injured by illegal conduct," Silkwood v.
Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984), and it would
take language much plainer than the text of §360k to convince us that Congress intended that result.
Furthermore, if Congress intended to preclude all
common-law causes of action, it chose a singularly odd word
with which to do it. The statute would have achieved an
identical result, for instance, if it had precluded any "remedy" under state law relating to medical devices. "Requirement" appears to presume that the State is imposing a specific duty upon the manufacturer, and although we have on
prior occasions concluded that a statute pre-empting certain
7

rThe FDA's authority to require manufacturers to recall, replace, or
refund defective devices is of little use to injured plaintiffs, since there is
no indication that the right is available to private parties, the remedy
would not extend to recovery for compensatory damages, and the authority is rarely invoked, if at all. See Adler, The 1976 Medical Device
Amendments: A Step in the Right Direction Needs Another Step in the
Right Direction, 43 Food Drug Cosm. L. J. 511, 526-527 (1988).

state "requirements" could also pre-empt common-law damages claims, see Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 521-522 (opinion of
STEVENS, J.), that statute did not sweep nearly as broadly
as Medtronic would have us believe that this statute does.
. The pre-emptive statute in Cipollone8 was targeted at a
limited set of state requirements-those "based on smoking
and health"-and then only at a limited subset of the possible
applications of those requirements-those involving the "advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of
which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of" the
federal statute. See id., at 515. In that context, giving the
term "requirement" its widest reasonable meaning did not
have nearly the pre-emptive scope nor the effect on potential
remedies that Medtronic's broad reading of the term would
have in this suit. The Court in Cipollone held that the petitioner in that case was able to maintain some common-law
actions using theories of the case that did not run afoul of the
pre-emption statute. See id., at 524-530. Here, however,
Medtronic's sweeping interpretation of the statute would
require far greater interference with state legal remedies,
producing a serious intrusion into state sovereignty while
simultaneously wiping out the possibility of remedy for the
8

There were actually two pre-emptive statutes at issue: The first,
enacted in 1965, provided that "[n]o statement relating to smoking and
health... shall be required" on any cigarette package or in any cigarette
advertising. See Cipollone v. Liggett Group,Inc., 505 U. S.,.at 514. That

provision, the Court concluded, did not pre-empt any of the petitioner's
common-law claims. Id., at 518-520. In 1969, Congress superseded the
1965 pre-emption statute with part of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, which provided that "[n]o requirement or prohibition
based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of
which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act." Id., at
515. The bulk of Cipollone's analysis involved this later statute; unless
otherwise stated, it is this statute to which we refer in subsequent references to the pre-emptive statute in Cipollone.

Lohrs' alleged injuries. 9 Given the ambiguities in the statute and the scope of the preclusion that would occur otherwise, we cannot accept Medtronic's argument that by using
the term "requirement," Congress clearly signaled its intent
to deprive States of any role in protecting consumers from
the dangers inlerent in many medical devices.
Other differences between this statute and the one in
Cipollone further convince us that when Congress enacted
§ 360k, it was primarily concerned with the problem of specific, Conflicting state statutes and regulations rather. than
the general duties enforced by common-law actions. Unlike
the statute at issue in Cipollone, §360k refers to "requirements" many times throughout its text. In each instance,
the word is linked with language suggesting that its focus is
device-specific enactments of positive law by legislative or
administrative bodies, not the application of general rules of
common law by judges and juries. For instance, subsections
(a)(2) and (b) of'the statute 10 also refer to "requirements"but those "requirements" refer only to statutory and regulatory law that exists pursuant to the MDA itself, suggesting
that the pre-empted "requirements" established or continued
by States also refer primarily to positive enactments of'state
law. Moreover, in subsection (b) the FDA is given authority
to exlude certain "requirements" from the scope of the preefmption statute. Of the limited number of "exemptions"
9Unlike § 360k, the pre-emptive effect of the statute in Cipollone was
not dependent on the issuance of any agency regulations. The territory
exclusively occupied by federal law was defined in the text of the statute
itself; that text specified the precise warning to smokers that Congress
deemed both necessary and sufficient. In the MDA, no such specifics exist
until the FDA provides them. See also infra, at 495-496 (reliance on the
FDA's interpretation of § 360k warranted, interalia,because of the FDA's
role in the administration of §360k). Moreover, the statute in Cipollone
was clearly intended to have a broader pre-emptive effect than its 1965
predecessor.

from pre-emption that the FDA has granted, none even remotely resemble common-law claims."
An examination of the basic purpose of the legislation as
well as its history entirely supports our rejection of Medtronic's extreme position. The MDA was enacted "to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use." 90 Stat. 539. Medtronic asserts
that the Act was also intended, however, to "protect innovations in device technology from being 'stifled by unnecessary
restrictions,"' Brief for Petitioner in No. 95-754, p. 3 (citing
H. R. Rep. No. 94-853, at 12), and that this interest extended
to the pre-emption of common-law claims. While the Act
certainly reflects some of these concerns, 12 the legislative
history indicates that any fears regarding regulatory burdens were related more to the risk of additionalfederal and
state regulation rather than the danger of pre-existing duties
under common law. See, e. g., 122 Cong. Rec. 5850 (1976)
(statement of Rep. Collins) (opposing further "redundant and
burdensome Federal requirements"); id., at 5855 (discussing
efforts taken in MDA to protect small businesses from the
additional requirements of the Act). Indeed, nowhere in the
materials relating to the Act's history have we discovered a
reference to a fear that product liability actions would hamper the development of medical devices. To the extent that
Congress was concerned about protecting the industry, that
intent was manifested primarily through fewer substantive
requirements under the Act, not the pre-emption provision;
furthermore, any such concern was far outweighed by con"All 22 exemptions at 21 CFR §§ 808.53-808.101 (1995) are exemptions
for state statutes and regulations regarding the sale of hearing aids.

12 Special statutory exemptions, for example, permit the FDA (with various oversight provisions) to allow investigative, experimental devices to
be used in commerce without either PMA review or "substantial equivalence." See 21 U. S. C. §360j(g); 21 CFR pt. 813 (1995). Moreover, the
very existence of the pre-emption statute demonstrates some concern that
competing state requirements may unduly interfere with the market for
medical devices.

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

cerns about the primary issue motivating the MDA!s enactment: the safety of those who use medical devices.
The legislative history also confirms our understanding
that §360(k) simply was not intended to pre-empt most, let
alone all, general common-law duties enforced by damages
actions. There is, to the best of our knowledge, nothing in
the hearings, the Committee Reports, or the debates suggesting that any proponent of the legislation intended a
sweeping pre-emption of traditional common-law remedies
against manufacturers and distributors of defective devices.
If Congress intended such a result, its failure even to hint
at it is spectacularly odd, particularly since Members of
both Houses were acutely aware of ongoing product liability
litigation."3 Along with the less-than-precise language of
§360k(a), that silence surely indicates that at least some
common-law claims against medical device manufacturers
may be maintained after the enactment of the MDA.
13

Furthermore, if Congress had intended the MDA to work this dramatic change in the availability of state-law remedies, one would expect
some reference to that change in the extensive contemporary reviews of
the legislation. We have been able to find no such reference. See, e.g.,
Lesparre, Industry Spokesman Comments on Medical Device Amendments of 1976, 50 Hospitals 99, 103 (Sept. 16, 1976); A. Levine, Device
Failure and the Plaintiff's Lawyer, in Proceedings of the Second Annual
AAMI/FDA Conference on Medical Device Regulation 54 (1975); Medical
Device Amendments of 1975, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Health
and the Environment of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, Ser. No. 94-39, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 271 (1975) (statement of
Anita Johnson, Public Citizen's Health Research Group) (arguing that the
pre-emption provision should not be included, but making no mention of
common law, and specifically discussing only a positive California enactment regarding the safety of intrauterine contraceptive devices); Medical

1977) (comprehensive 2-volume, 600-page review of published medical device product liability cases from 1910 to 1976, suggesting nowhere that

seek and receive damages awards under state law).

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR
Opinion of the Court

V

Medtronic asserts several specific reasons why, even if
§ 360k does not pre-empt all common-law claims, it at least
pre-empts the Lohrs' claims in this suit. In contrast, the
Lohrs argue that their entire complaint should survive a reasonable evaluation of the pre-emptive scope of §360k(a).
First, the Lohrs claim that the Court of Appeals correctly
held that their negligent design claims were not pre-empted
because the § 510(k) premarket notification process imposes
no "requirement" on the design of Medtronic's pacemaker.
Second, they suggest that even if the FDA's general rules
regulating manufacturing practices and labeling are "requirements" that pre-empt different'state requirements,
§360k(a) does not pre-empt state rules that merely duplicate
some or all of those federal requirements. Finally, they
argue that because the State's general rules -imposing
common-law duties upon Medtronic do not impose a requirement "with respect to a device," they do not conflict with the
FDA's general rules relating to manufacturing and labeling
and are therefore not pre-empted.
Design Claim
The Court of Appeals concluded that the Lohrs' defective design claims were not pre-empted because the requirements with which the company had to comply were not
sufficiently concrete to constitute a pre-empting federal requirement. Medtronic counters by pointing to the. FDA's
determination that Model 4011 is "substantially equivalent"
to an earlier device as well as the agency's continuing authority to exclude the device from the market if its design is
changed. These factors, Medtronic argues, amount to a specific, federally enforceable design requirement that cannot
be affected by state-law pressures such as those imposed on
manufacturers subject to product liability suits.
The company's defense exaggerates the importance of the
§ 510(k) process and the FDA letter to the company. regard-

Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

ing the pacemaker's substantial equivalence to a grandfathered device. As the court below noted, "[t]he 510(k)
process is focused on equivalence, not safety." 56 F. 3d, at
1348. As a result, "substantial equivalence determinations
provide little protection to the public. These determinations simply compare a post-1976 device to a pre-1976 device
to ascertain whether the later device is no more dangerous
and no less effective than the earlier device. If the earlier
device poses a severe risk or is ineffective, then the later
device may also be risky or ineffective." Adler, 43 Food
Drug Cosm. L. J., at 516. The design of the Model 4011, as
with the design of pre-1976 and other "substantially equivalent" devices, has never been formally reviewed under the
MDA for safety or efficacy.
The FDA stressed this basic conclusion in its letter to
Medtronic finding the 4011 lead "substantially equivalent" to
devices already on the market. That letter only required
Medtronic to comply with "general standards"-the lowest
level of protection "applicable to all medical devices,"- and
including "listing of devices, good manufacturing practices,
labeling, and the misbranding and adulteration provisions of
the Act." It explicitly warned Medtronic that the letter did
"not in any way denote official FDA approval of your device," and that "[a]ny representation that creates an impression of official approval of this device because of compliance
with the premarket notification regulations is misleading and
constitutes misbranding." FDA Substantial Equivalence
Letter.
Thus, even though the FDA may well examine. § 510(k)
applications for Class III devices (as it examines the entire
medical device industry) with a concern for the safety and
effectiveness of the device, see Brief for Petitioner in
No. 95-754, at 22-26, it did not "require" Medtronics' pacemaker to take any particular form for any particular reason;
the agency simply allowed the pacemaker, as a device substantially equivalent to one that existed before 1976, to be

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR
Opinion of the Court

marketed without running the gauntlet of the PMA process.
In providing for this exemption to PMA review, Congress
intended merely to give manufacturers the freedom to compete, to a limited degree, with and on the same terms as
manufacturers of medical devices that existed prior to 1976.14
There is no suggestion in either the statutory scheme or
the legislative history that the § 510(k) exemption process
was intended to do anything other than maintain the status
quo with respect to the marketing of existing medical devices and their substantial equivalents. That status quo
included the possibility that the manufacturer of the device
would have to defend itself against state-law claims of negligent design. Given this background behind the "substantial
equivalence" exemption, the fact that "[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone" in every pre-emption
case, 505 U. S., at 516 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and the presumption against pre-emption, the
Court of Appeals properly concluded that the "substantial
equivalence" provision did not pre-empt the Lohrs' design
claims.
Identity of Requirements Claims
The Lohrs next suggest that even if "requirements" exist
with respect to the manufacturing and labeling of the pace14 As the FDA Commissioner put it in 1982: "[T]he 510(k) provision of

the law is a procompetition mechanism that permits firms to make and
quickly market me-too versions of pre-1976 devices. The Congress apparently believed that a firm whose device happened to be on the market

before enactment of the amendments and was never subject to preclearance by FDA should not enjoy a lengthy monopoly at the expense of other
firms and ultimately the consumer."

maker, and even if we can also consider state law to impose
a "requirement" under the Act, the state requirement is not
pre-empted unless it is "different from, or in addition to,"
the federal requirement. § 360k(a)(1). Although the precise contours of their theory of recovery have not yet been
defined (the pre-emption issue was decided on the basis of
the pleadings), it is clear that the Lohrs' allegations may include claims that Medtronic has, to the extent that they
exist, violated FDA regulations. At least these claims, they
suggest, can be maintained without being pre-empted by
§ 360k, and we agree.
Nothing in § 360k denies Florida the right to provide a
traditional damages remedy for violations of common-law duties when those duties parallel federal requirements. Even
if it may be necessary as a matter of Florida law to prove
that those violations were the result of negligent conduct,
or that they created an unreasonable hazard for users of
the product, such additional elements of the state-law cause
of action would make the state requirements narrower, not
broader, than the federal requirement. While such a narrower requirement might be "different from" the federal
rules in a literal sense, such a difference would surely provide a strange reason for finding pre-emption of a state rule
insofar as it duplicates the federal rule. The presence of
a damages remedy does not amount to the additional or different "requirement" that is necessary under the statute;
rather, it merely provides another reason for manufacturers
to comply with identical existing "requirements" under federal law.
The FDA regulations interpreting the scope of §360k's
pre-emptive effect support the Lohrs' view, and our interpretation of the pre-emption statute is substantially informed
by those regulations. The different views expressed by the
Courts of Appeals regarding the appropriate scope of federal
pre-emption under §360k demonstrate that the language of
that section is not entirely clear. In addition, Congress has

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR
Opinion of the Court

given the FDA a unique role in determining the scope of
§360k's pre-emptive effect. Unlike the statute construed in
Cipollone, for instance, pre-emption under the MDA does
not arise directly as a result of the enactment of the statute;
rather, in most cases a state law will be pre-empted only to
the extent that the FDA has promulgated a relevant federal
"requirement." Because the FDA is the federal agency to
which Congress has delegated its authority to implement the
provisions of the Act, 5 the agency is uniquely qualified to
determine whether a particular form of state law "stands
as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the
full purposes and objectives of Congress," Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941), and, therefore, whether it should
be pre-empted. For example, Congress explicitly delegated
to the FDA the authority to exempt state regulations from
the pre-emptive effect of the MDA-an authority that necessarily requires the FDA to assess the pre-emptive effect that
the Act and its own regulations will have on state laws. See
§360k(b). FDA regulations implementing that grant of authority establish a process by which States or other individuals may request an advisory opinion from the FDA regarding whether a particular state requirement is pre-empted by
the statute. See 21 CFR §808.5 (1995). The ambiguity in
the statute-and the congressional grant of authority to the
agency on the matter contained within it-provide a "sound
basis," post, at 509 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part), for giving substantial weight to the
agency's view of the statute. See Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v.
NaturalResources Defense Council,Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984);
Hillsborough Cty., 471 U. S., at 714 (considering FDA understanding of pre-emptive effect of its regulations "dispositive").
The regulations promulgated by the FDA expressly support the conclusion that § 360k "does not preempt State or
local requirements that are equal to, or substantially identi5

See n. 5, supra;21 U.S. C. § 371(a).

Opinion of the Court

cal to, requirements imposed by or under the act." 21 CFR
§808.1(d)(2) (1995); see also §808.5(b)(1)(i).' 6 At this early
stage in the litigation, there was no reason for the Court of
Appeals to preclude altogether the Lohrs' manufacturing
and labeling claims to the extent that they rest on claims
that Medtronic negligently failed to comply with duties
"equal to, or substantially identical to, requirements imposed" under federal law.
Manufacturingand Labeling Claims
Finally, the Lohrs suggest that with respect to the manufacturing and labeling claims, the Court of Appeals should
have rejected Medtronic's pre-emption defense in full. The
Court of Appeals believed that these claims would interfere
with the consistent application of general federal regulations
governing the labeling and manufacture of all medical devices, and therefore concluded that the claims were preempted altogether.
The requirements identified by the Court of Appeals include labeling regulations that require manufacturers of
every medical device, with a few limited exceptions, to include with the device a label containing "information for
use,... and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions." 21 CFR §§801.109(b) and (c) (1995).
Similarly, manufacturers are required to comply with "Good
Manufacturing Practices," or "GMP's," which are set forth
in 32 sections and less than 10 pages in the Code of Federal
Regulations. 17 In certain circumstances, the Court of Ap16

We also note that the agency permits manfacturers of devices that
have received PMA to make certain labeling, quality control, and manufacturing changes which would "enhanc[e] the safety of the device or the
safety in the use of the device" without prior FDA approval. See 21 CFR
§§814.39(d)(1) and (2) (1995).
17Some GNP's include the duty to institute a "quality assurance program," §820.5, to have an "adequate organizational structure," §820.20,
to ensure that personnel in contact with a device are "clean, healthy, and
suitably attired" where such matters are relevant to the device's safety,

Opinion of the Court

peals recognized, the FDA will enforce these general requirements against manufacturers that violate them. See
56 F. 3d, at 1350-1351.
While admitting that these requirements exist, the Lohrs
suggest that their general nature simply does not pre-empt
claims alleging that the manufacturer failed to comply with
other duties under state common law. In support of their
claim, they note that § 360k(a)(1) expressly states that a federal requirement must be "applicable to the device" in question before it has any pre-emptive effect. Because the labeling and manufacturing requirements are applicable to a host
of different devices, they argue that they do not satisfy this
condition. They further argue that because only state requirements "with respect to a device" may be pre-empted,
and then only if the requirement "relates to the safety or
effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in
a requirement applicable to the device," § 360k(a) mandates
pre-emption only where there is a conflict between a specific
state requirement and a federal requirement "applicable to"
the same device.
The Lohrs' theory is supported by the FDA regulations,
which provide that state requirements are pre-empted
"only" when the FDA has established "specific counterpart
regulations or... other specific requirements applicable toa
particular device." 21 CFR §808.1(d) (1995).18 They fur§820.25, and to have buildings, environmental controls, and equipment
of a quality adequate to produce a safe product, see §§820A0, 820.46,
820.60.
18 FDA's narrow understanding of the scope of §360k(a) is obvious from
the full text of the regulation, which provides, in relevant part:
"(d) State or local requirements are preempted only when the Food and
Drug Administration has established specific counterpart regulations or
there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device
under the act, thereby making any existing divergent State or local requirements applicable to the device different from, or in addition to, the
specific Food and Drug Administration requirements. There are other
State or local requirements that affect devices that are not preempted by

Opinion of the Court

ther note that the statute is not intended to pre-empt "State
or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in
addition to devices.., or to unfair trade practices in which
the requirements are not limited to devices." §808.1(d)(1).
The regulations specifically provide, as examples of permissible general requirements, that general electrical codes and
the Uniform Commercial Code warranty of fitness would not
be pre-empted. See ibid. The regulations even go so far
as to state that §360k(a) generally "does not preempt a state
or local requirement prohibiting the manufacture of adulterated or misbranded devices" unless "such a prohibition
has the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for
a specific device." §808.1(d)(6)(ii). Furthermore, under its
authority to grant exemptions to the pre-emptive effect of
§ 360k(a), the FDA has never granted, nor, to the best of our
section 521(a) of the act because they are not 'requirements applicable to
a device' within the meaning of section 521(a) of the act. The following
are examples of State or local requirements that are not regarded as preempted by section 521 of the act:
"(1) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to
other products in addition to devices (e. g., requirements such as general
electrical codes, and the Uniform Commercial Code (warranty of fitness)),
or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited
to devices.
"(2) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local requirements that
are equal to, or substantially identical to, requirements imposed by or
under the act.
"(6)(i) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local requirements respecting general enforcement, e. g., requirements that State inspection be
permitted of factory records concerning all devices.....
"(ii) Generally, section 521(a) does not preempt a State or local requirement prohibiting the manufacture of adulterated or misbranded devices.
Where, however, such a prohibition has the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device, e. g., a specific labeling requirement, then the prohibition [may] be preempted." 21 CFR §808.1(d)
(1995).

Opinion of the Court

knowledge, even been asked to consider granting, an exemption for a state law of general applicability; all 22
existing exemptions apply to excruciatingly specific state
requirements regarding the sale of hearing aids. See
§§ 808.53-808.101.
Although we do not believe that this statutory and regulatory language necessarily precludes "general" federal requirements from ever pre-empting state requirements, or
"general" state requirements from ever being pre-empted,
see Part VI, infra, it is impossible to ignore its overarching
concern that pre-emption occur only where a particular state
requirement threatens to interfere with a specific federal interest. State requirements must be "with respect to" medical devices and "different from, or in addition to," federal
requirements. State requirements must also relate "to the
safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter
included in a requirement applicable to the device," and the
regulations provide that state requirements of "general applicability" are not pre-empted except where they have "the
effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific
device." Moreover, federal requirements must be "applicable to the device" in question, and, according to the regulations, pre-empt state law only if they are "specific counterpart regulations" or "specific" to a "particular device." The
statute and regulations, therefore, require a careful comparison between the allegedly pre-empting federal requirement
and the allegedly pre-empted state requirement to determine whether they fall within the intended pre-emptive
scope of the statute and regulations. 19
19A plurality of this Court concluded in Cipollone that a similar analysis
was required under the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969.
That Act pre-empted requirements and prohibitions based on smoking and
health "imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion" of cigarettes in packages that were labeled in conformity with that
Act. 505 U. S., at 515. We held that the petitioner's fraudulent misrepresentation claims, including those based on allegedly false statements made
in advertisements, were not pre-empted because they were "predicated
not on a duty 'based on smoking and health' but rather on a more general

Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

Such a comparison mandates a conclusion that the Lohrs'
common-law claims are not pre-empted by the federal labeling and manufacturing requirements. The generality of
those requirements make this quite unlike a case in which
the Federal Government has weighed the competing interests relevant to the particular requirement in question,
reached an unambiguous conclusion about how those competing considerations should be resolved in a particular case or
set of cases, and implemented that conclusion via a specific
mandate on manufacturers or producers. Rather, the federal requirements reflect important but entirely generic concerns about device regulation generally, not the sort of concerns regarding a specific device or field of device regulation
that the statute or regulations were designed to protect from
potentially contradictory state requirements.
Similarly, the general state common-law requirements in
this suit were n6t specifically developed "with respect to"
medical devices. Accordingly, they are not the kinds of requirements that Congress and the FDA feared would impede
the ability of federal regulators to implement and enforce
specific federal .requirements.' The legal duty that is the
predicate for the Lohrs' negligept manufacturing claim is the
general duty of every manufacturer to use due care to avoid
foreseeable dangers in its products. Similarly, the predicate
for the failure to warn claim is the general duty to inform
users and purchasers of potentially dangerous items of the
risks involved in their use. These general' obligations are
no more a threat to federal requirements than would be a
state-law duty to comply with local fire prevention regulaobligation-the duty not to" deceive." Id., at 528-529. The general
common-law duty "not to make fraudulent statements" was not within the
specific category of requirements or prohibitions based on smoldng and
health imposed under state law "with respect to the advertising or promotion" of cigarettes that were pre-empted by the 1969 statute. Id., at 529.
If anything, the language of the MDA's pre-emption statute and its counterpart regulations require an even more searching inquiry into the relationship between the federal requirement and the state requirement at
issue than was true under the statute in Cipollone.

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

tions and zoning codes, or to use due care in the training
and supervision of a work force. These state requirements
therefore escape pre-emption, not because the source of the
duty is a judge-made common-law rule, but rather because
their generality leaves them outside the category of requirements that §360k envisioned to be "with respect to" specific
devices such as pacemakers. As a result, none of the Lohrs'
claims based on allegedly defective manufacturing or labeling are pre-empted by the MDA.
VI
In their cross-petition, the Lohrs present a final argument,
suggesting that common-law duties are never "requirements" within the meaning of §360k and that the statute
therefore never pre-empts common-law actions. The Lohrs
point out that our holding in Cipollone is not dispositive of
this issue, for as Part IV, supra, suggests, there are significant textual and historical differences between the Cipollone
statute and §360k, and the meaning of words must always be
informed by the environment within which they are situated.
We do not think that the issue is resolved by the FDA regulation suggesting that § 360k is applicable to those requirements "having the force and effect of law" that are "established by ...

court decision," 21 CFR § 808.1(b) (1995); that

reference, it appears, was intended to refer to court decisions
construing state statutes or regulations. See 42 Fed. Reg.
30383, 30385 (1977); Brief for Petitioners in No. 95-886,
p. 26, n. 7.
Nevertheless, we do not respond directly to this argument

for two reasons.

First, since none of the Lohrs' claims is

pre-empted in this suit, we need not resolve hypothetical
cases that may arise in the future. Second, given the critical importance of device specificity in our (and the FDA's)
construction of § 360k, it is apparent that few, if any,
common-law duties have been pre-empted by this statute.
It will be rare indeed for a court hearing a common-law

Opinion of BREYER, J.

cause of action to issue a decree that has "the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device." 21
CFR § 808.1(d)(6)(ii) (1995). Until such a case arises, we see
no need to determine whether the statute explicitly preempts such a claim. Even then, the issue may not need to be
resolved if the claim would also be pre-empted under conflict
pre-emption analysis, see FreightlinerCorp. v. Myrick, 514
U. S. 280, 287 (1995).
VII
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed insofar as it held that any of the claims were preempted and affirmed insofar as it rejected the pre-emption
defense. The cases are remanded for further proceedings.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and concurring in

the judgment.
This action raises two questions. First, do the Medical
Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) to the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act ever pre-empt a state-law tort action? Second, if so, does the MDA pre-empt the particular
state-law tort claims at issue here?
I
My answer to the first question is that the MDA will sometimes pre-empt a state-law tort suit. I basically agree with
JUSTICE O'CONNOR's discussion of this point and with her

conclusion.

See post, at 510-512.

The statute's language,
It says:

read literally, supports that conclusion.
"[N]o State .

.

. may establish .

.

. with respect to a

device.., any [state] requirement... which is different
from, or in addition to, any [federal] requirement...
21 U. S. C. § 360k(a) (emphasis added).

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR
Opinion of BREYER, J.

One can reasonably read the word "requirement" as including the legal requirements that grow out of the application,
in particular circumstances, of a State's tort law.
Moreover, in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S.
504 (1992), the Court made clear that similar language "easily" encompassed tort actions because "[state] regulation can
be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as
through some form of preventive relief." Id., at 521 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at
548-549 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Accord, CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood,
507 U. S. 658, 664 (1993). This rationale would seem applicable to the quite similar circumstances at issue here.
Finally, a contrary holding would have anomalous consequences. Imagine that, in respect to a particular hearing
aid component, a federal MDA regulation requires a 2-inch
wire, but a state agency regulation requires a 1-inch wire.
If the federal law, embodied in the "2-inch" MDA regulation,
pre-empts the state "1-inch" agency regulation, why would it
not similarly pre-empt a state-law tort action that premises
liability upon the defendant manufacturer's failure to use a
1-inch wire (say, an award by a jury persuaded by expert
testimony that use of a more than 1-inch wire is negligent)?
The effects of the state agency regulation and the state tort
suit are identical. To distinguish between them for preemption purposes would grant greater power (to set state
standards "different from, or in addition to," federal standards) to a single state jury than to state officials acting
through state administrative or legislative lawmaking processes. Where Congress likely did not focus specifically upon
the matter, see ante, at 486-491, I would not take it to have
intended this anomalous result.
Consequently, I believe that ordinarily, insofar as the MDA
pre-empts a state requirement embodied in a state statute,
rule, regulation, or other administrative action, it would also
pre-empt a similar requirement that takes the form of a

Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of BREYER, J.

standard of care or behavior imposed by a state-law tort
action. It is possible that the plurality also agrees on this
point, although it does not say so explicitly.
II
The answer to the second question turns on Congress' intent. See, e. g., Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. v. Nelson, 517 U. S. 25, 30 (1996); Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck,
471 U. S. 202, 208 (1985); ante, at 485-486. Although Congress has not stated whether the MDA does, or does not,
pre-empt the tort claims here at issue, several considerations
lead me to conclude that it does not.
First, the MDA's pre-emption provision is highly ambiguous. That provision makes clear that federal requirements
may pre-empt state requirements, but it says next to nothing
about just when, where, or how they may do so. The words
"any [state] requirement" and "any [federal] requirement,"
for example, do not tell us which requirements are at issue,
for every state requirement that is not identical to even one
federal requirement is "different from, or in addition to,"
that single federal requirement; yet, Congress could not have
intended that the existence of one single federal rule, say,
about a 2-inch hearing aid wire, would pre-empt every state
law hearing aid rule, even a set of rules related only to the
packaging or shipping of hearing aids. Thus, Congress must
have intended that courts look elsewhere for help as to just
which federal requirements pre-empt just which state requirements, as well as just how they might do so.
• Second, this Court has previously suggested that, in the
absence of a clear congressional command as to pre-emption,
courts may infer that the relevant administrative agency
possesses a degree of leeway to determine which rules, regulations, or other administrative actions will have pre-emptive
effect. See Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical
Laboratories,Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 721 (1985); cf. Smiley v.
Citibank (South Dakota), N. A:, 517 U.S. 735, 739-741

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR
Opinion of BREYER, J.

(1996); Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood School Dist.
No. 40-1, 469 U. S. 256, 261-262 (1985); Chevron U.S. A. Inc.
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,
842-845 (1984). To draw a similar inference here makes
sense, and not simply because of the statutory ambiguity.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is fully responsible for administering the MDA. See 21 U.S. C. §393.
That responsibility means informed agency involvement and,
therefore, special understanding of the likely impact of both
state and federal requirements, as well as an understanding
of whether (or the extent to which) state requirements may
interfere with federal objectives. See Hillsborough, 471
U. S., at 721. The FDA can translate these understandings
into particularized pre-emptive intentions accompanying its
various rules and regulations. See id., at 718. It can communicate those intentions, for example, through statements
in "regulations, preambles, interpretive statements, and responses to comments," ibid., as well as through the exercise
of its explicitly designated power to exempt state requirements from pre-emption, see 21 U. S. C. § 360k(b); see also
ante, at 496 (noting that FDA's authority to exempt state
requirements from pre-emption necessarily requires FDA to
assess federal laws' pre-emptive effect).
Third, the FDA has promulgated a specific regulation
designed to help. That regulation says:
"State... requirements are preempted only when...
there are ... specific [federal] requirements applicable
to a particular device ... thereby making any existing

divergent State... requirements applicable to the device different from, or in addition to, the specific [federal] requirements." 21 CFR §808.1(d) (1995) (emphasis added).
The regulation does not fill all the statutory gaps, for its
word "divergent" does not explain, any more than did the
statute, just when different device-related federal and state

Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)

Opinion of BREYER, J.

requirements are closely enough related to trigger preemption analysis. But the regulations word "specific" does
narrow the universe of federal requirements that the agency
intends to displace at least some state law.
Insofar as there are any applicable FDA requirements
here, those requirements, even if numerous, are not "specific" in any relevant sense. See ante, at 497-498, 501.
Hence, as the FDA's above-quoted pre-emption rule tells us,
the FDA does not intend these requirements to pre-empt
the state requirements at issue here. At least in present
circumstances, no law forces the FDA to make its requirements pre-emptive if it does not think it appropriate.
I cannot infer a contrary intent from JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S
characterization of the federal standards applicable here as
"comprehensive" and "extensive," post, at 513, 514, both because that characterization is questionable, see ante, at 497498, 501, and because this Court has previously said that it
would "seldom infer, solely from the comprehensiveness of
federal regulations, an intent to pre-empt in its entirety a
field related to health and safety." Hillsborough,supra, at
718. It therefore seems to me that the better indicator of
the FDA's intent is its pre-emption-related regulation. And
that regulation's word "specific" would seem a reasonable
exercise of the leeway that statutory language and practical
administrative circumstance suggest Congress intended to
grant to the agency.
Fourth, ordinary principles of "conflict" and "field" preemption point in the same direction. Those principles make
clear that a federal requirement pre-empts a state requirement if (1) the state requirement actually conflicts with the
federal requirement-either because compliance with both
is impossible, Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v.
Paul,373 U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963), or because the state requirement "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and
execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,"
Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)-or (2) the

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Opinion of BREYER, J.

scheme of federal regulation is "so pervasive as to make
reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the
States to supplement it," Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,
331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947). See, e.g., Barnett Bank, 517
U. S., at 31; Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management
Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 98 (1992) (opinion of O'CONNOR, J); Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597, 604-605
(1991); English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79 (1990).
It makes sense, in the absence of any, indication of a contrary congressional (or agency) intent, to read the preemption statute (and the pre-emption regulation) in light of
these basic pre-emption principles. The statutory terms
"different from" and "in addition to" readily lend themselves
to such a reading, for their language parallels pre-emption
laws basic concerns. Without any contrary indication from
the agency, one might also interpret the regulations word
"divergent" in light of these same basic pre-emption
principles.
Insofar as these basic principles inform a court's interpretation of the statute and regulation, they support the conclusion that there is no pre-emption here. I can find no actual
conflict between any federal requirement and any of the
liability-creating premises of the plaintiffs' state-law tort
suit; nor, for the reasons discussed above, can I find any
indication that either Congress or the FDA intended the
relevant FDA regulations to occupy entirely any relevant
field.
For these reasons, I concur in the Court's judgment. I
also join the Court's opinion, but for Parts IV and VI. I do
not join Part IV, which emphasizes the differences between
the MDA and the pre-emption statute at issue in Cipollone,
because those differences are not, in my view, relevant in
this action. I do not join Part VI, because I am not
convinced that future incidents of MDA pre-emption of
common-law claims will be "few" or "rare," ante, at 502.

Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)

Opinion of O'CoNNOR, J.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, concurring in

part and dissenting in part.
Section 360k(a), the pre-emption provision of the Medical
Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA), provides that no State
may establish or continue in effect "any requirement" "which
is different from, or in addition to," any requirement applicable under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938
(FDCA) to the device. As the Court points out, because
Congress has expressly provided a pre-emption provision,
"we need not go beyond that language to determine whether
Congress intended the MDA to pre-empt" state law. Ante,
at 484. We agree, then, on the task before us: to interpret
Congress' intent by reading the statute in accordance with
its terms. This, however, the Court has failed to do.
The cases require us to determine whether the Lohrs'
state common-law claims survive pre-emption under § 360k.
I conclude that state common-law damages actions do impose "requirements" and are therefore pre-empted where
such requirements would differ from those imposed by the
FDCA. The plurality acknowledges that a common-law action might impose a "requirement," but suggests that such a
pre-emption would be "rare indeed." Ante, at 502. To
reach that determination, the opinion-without explicitly relying on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations
and without offering any sound basis for why deference
would be warranted-imports the FDA regulations interpreting § 360k to "inform" the Court's reading. Accordingly,
the principal opinion states that pre-emption occurs only
"where a particular state requirement threatens to interfere
with a specific federal interest," ante, at 500, and for that
reason, concludes that common-law claims are almost never
pre-empted, ante, at 502-503, and that the Lohrs' claims here
are not pre-empted. This decision is bewildering and seemingly without guiding principle.

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

The language of §360k demonstrates congressional intent
that the MDA pre-empt "any requirement" by a State that
is "different from, or in addition to," that applicable to the
device under the FDCA. The Lohrs have raised various
state common-law claims in connection with Medtronic's
pacemaker lead. Analysis, therefore, must begin with the
question whether state common-law actions can constitute
"requirements" within the meaning of §360k(a).
We recently addressed a similar question in Cipollone,
where we examined the meaning of the phrase "no requirement or prohibition" under the Public Health Cigarette
Smoking Act of 1969. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505
U. S. 504 (1992). A majority of the Court agreed that state
common-law damages actions do impose "requirements."
Id., at 521-522 (plurality opinion); id., at 548-549 (SCALIA, J.,
joined by THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part). As the plurality explained:
"The phrase, '[n]o requirement or prohibition' sweeps
broadly and suggests no distinction between positive enactments and common law; to the contrary, those words
easily encompass obligations that take the form of
common-law rules. As we noted in another context,
'[state] regulation can be as effectively exerted through
an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief. The obligation to pay compensation can be,
indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing
conduct and controlling policy.' San Diego Building
Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959)."
Id., at 521.
That rationale is equally applicable in the present context.
Whether relating to the labeling of cigarettes or the manufacture of medical devices, state common-law damages
actions operate to require manufacturers to comply with
common-law duties. As Cipollone declared, in answer to
the same argument raised here that common-law actions

Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

do not impose requirements, "such an analysis is at odds
both with the plain words" of the statute and "with the general understanding of common-law damages actions." Ibid.
If § 360k's language is given its ordinary meaning, it clearly
pre-empts any state common-law action that would impose
a requirement different from, or in addition to, that applicable under the FDCA-just as it would pre-empt a state
statute or regulation that had that effect. JUSTICE BREYER
reaches the same conclusion. Ante, at 503-505 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
The plurality's reasons for departing from this reading are
neither clear nor persuasive. It fails to refute the applicability of the reasoning of Cipollone. Instead, in Part IV,
the plurality .essentially makes the case that the statute's
language, purpose, and legislative history, as well as the consequences of a different interpretation, indicate that Congress did not intend "requirement" to include state commonlaw claims at all. The principal opinion proceeds to disclaim
this position, however, in Parts V and VI and concludes,
rather, that a state common-law action might constitute a
requirement, but that such a case would be "rare indeed."
Ante, at 502. The Court holds that an FDCA "requirement"
triggers pre-emption only when a conflict exists between a
specific state requirement and a specific FDCA requirement
applicable to the particular device. See ante, at 498-502.
But see ante, at 500 ("[W]e do not believe that this statutory
and regulatory language necessarily precludes 'general' federal requirements from ever pre-empting state requirements, or 'general' state requirements from ever being
pre-empted . . ."). The plurality emphasizes the "critical
importance of device specificity" in its understanding of
the pre-emption scheme. Ante, at 502.
To reach its particularized reading of the statute, the
Court imports the interpretation put forth by the FDA's
regulations. JUSTICE BREYER similarly relies on the FDA
regulations to arrive at an understanding of §360(k). Ante,

'MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

at 505-507. Apparently recognizing that Chevron deference
is unwarranted here, the Court does not admit to deferring
to these regulations, but merely permits them to "infor[m]"
the Court's interpretation. Ante, at 495. It is not certain
that an agency regulation determining the pre-emptive effect of any federal statute is entitled to deference, cf. Smiley
v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 743-744
(1996), but one pertaining to the clear statute at issue here is
surely not. "If the statute contains an express pre-emption
clause, the task of statutory construction must in the first
instance focus on the plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress' pre-emptive
intent." CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664
(1993). Where the language of the statute is clear, resort
to the agency's interpretation is improper. See Chevron
U S. A. Inc. v. NaturalResources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U.S. 837, 842-843 (1984). Title 21 U. S. C. §360k(a)(1) directs the pre-emption of "any [state] requirement" "which is
different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable
under [the FDCA] to the device." As explained above, and
as JUSTICE BREYER agrees, ante, at 503-505, the term "requirement" encompasses state common-law causes of action.
The Court errs when it employs an agency's narrowing construction of a statute where no such deference is warranted.
The statute makes no mention of a requirement of specificity,
and there is no sound basis for determining that such a restriction on "any requirement" exists.
I conclude that a fair reading of § 360k indicates that state
common-law claims are pre-empted, as the statute itself
states, to the extent that their recognition would impose
"any requirement" different from, or in addition to, FDCA
requirements applicable to the device. From that premise,
I proceed to the question whether FDCA requirements
applicable to the device exist here to pre-empt the Lohrs'
state-law claims.

Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

I agree with the Court that the Lohrs' defective design
claim is not pre-empted by the FDCA's §510(k) "substantial
equivalency" process. The §510(k) process merely evaluates whether the Class III device at issue is substantially
equivalent to a device that was on the market before 1976,
the effective date of the MDA; if so, the later device may
be also be marketed. Because the §510(k) process seeks
merely to establish whether a pre-1976 device and a post1976 device are equivalent, and places no "requirements" on
a device, the Lohrs' defective design claim is not pre-empted.
I also agree that the Lohrs' claims are not pre-empted by
§ 360k to the extent that they seek damages for Medtronic's
alleged violation of federal requirements. Where a state
cause of action seeks to enforce an FDCA requirement, that
claim does not impose a requirement that is "different from,
or in addition to," requirements under' federal law. To be
sure, the threat of a damages remedy will give manufacturers an additional cause to comply, but the requirements imposed on them under state and federal law do not differ.
Section 360k does not preclude States from imposing different or additional remedies, but only different or additional
requirements.
I disagree, however, with the Court's conclusion that the
Lohrs' claims survive pre-emption insofar as they would
compel Medtronic to comply with requirements different
from those imposed by the FDCA. Because I do not subscribe to the Court's reading into §360k the additional requisite of "specificity," my determination of what claims
are pre-empted is broader. Some, if not all, of the Lohrs'
common-law claims regarding the manufacturing and labeling of Medtronic's device would compel Medtronic to comply
with requirements different from, or in addition to, those required by the FDA. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations impose comprehensive requirements
relating to every aspect of the device-manufacturing process,

Opinion of O'CONNOR, J.

including a manufacturer's organization and personnel, buildings, equipment, component controls, production and process
controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding, distribution, installation, device evaluation, and recordkeeping. See
21 CFR §§ 820.20-820.198 (1995). The Lohrs' common-law
claims regarding manufacture would, if successful, impose
state requirements "different from, or in addition to," the
GMP requirements, and are therefore pre-empted. In similar fashion, the Lohrs' failure to warn claim is pre-empted
by the extensive labeling requirements imposed by the FDA.
See, e. g., 21 CFR §801.109 (1995) (requiring labels to include
such information as indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of administration, relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions). These extensive federal manufacturing and labeling requirements are
certainly applicable to the device manufactured by Medtronic. Section 360k(a) requires no more specificity than
that for pre-emption of state common-law claims.
To summarize, I conclude that § 360k(a)'s term "requirement" encompasses state common-law claims. Because the
statutory language does not indicate that a "requirement"
must be "specific," either to pre-empt or be pre-empted, I
conclude that a state common-law claim is pre-empted if it
would impose "any requirement" "which is different from, or
in addition to," any requirement applicable to the device
under the FDCA. I would affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeals that the Lohrs' design claim is not pre-empted by
the MDA, and that the manufacture and failure to warn
claims are pre-empted; I would reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals that the MDA pre-empts a common-law
claim alleging violation of federal requirements.
