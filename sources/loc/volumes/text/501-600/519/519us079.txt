O'GILVIE ET AL., MINORS v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE TENTH CIRCUIT
No. 95-966. Argued October 9, 1996-Decided December 10, 1996*
Petitioners, the husband and two children of a woman who died of toxic
shock syndrome, received a jury award of $1,525,000 actual damages and
$10 million punitive damages in a tort suit based on Kansas law against
the maker of the product that caused decedent's death. They paid federal income tax insofar as the award's proceeds represented punitive
damages, but immediately sought a refund. Procedurally speaking, this
litigation represents the consolidation of two cases brought in the same
Federal District Court: the husband's suit against the Government for
a refund, and the Government's suit against the children to recover the
refund that the Government had made to the children earlier. The District Court found for petitioners under 26 U. S. C. § 104(a)(2), which, as
it read in 1988, excluded from "gross income" the "amount of any damages received.., on account of personal injuries or sickness." (Emphasis added.) The court held on the merits that the italicized language
includes punitive damages, thereby excluding such damages from gross
income. The Tenth Circuit reversed, holding that the exclusionary
provision does not cover punitive damages.
Held:
1. Petitioners' punitive damages were not received "on account of"
personal injuries; hence the gross-income-exclusion provision does not
apply and the damages are taxable. Pp. 82-90.
(a) Although the phrase "on account of" does not unambiguously
define itself, several factors prompt this Court to agree with the Government when it interprets the exclusionary provision to apply to those
personal injury lawsuit damages that were awarded by reason of, or
because of, the personal injuries, and not to punitive damages that do
not compensate injury, but are private fines levied by civil juries to
punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its future occurrence. For
one thing, the Government's interpretation gives the phrase "on account
of" a meaning consistent with the dictionary definition. More important, in Commissioner v. Schleier, 515 U. S. 323, this Court came close
to resolving the statute's ambiguity in the Government's favor when it
*Together with No. 95-977, O'Gilvie v. United States, also on certiorari
to the same court.

said that the statute covers pain and suffering damages, medical expenses, and lost wages in an ordinary tort case because they are "designed to compensate... victims," id., at 332, n. 5, but does not apply
to elements of damages that are 'punitive in nature," id., at 332. The
Government's reading also is more faithful to the statutory provisions
history and basic tax-related purpose of excluding compensatory damages that restore a victim's lost, nontaxable "capital." Petitioners suggest no very good reason why Congress might have wanted the exclusion to have covered these punitive damages, which are not a substitute
for any normally untaxed personal (or financial) quality, good, or "asset"
and do not compensate for any kind of loss. Pp. 82-87.
(b) Petitioners' three arguments to the contrary-that certain
words or phrases in the original, or current, version of the statute work
in their favor; that the exclusion of punitive damages from gross income
may be justified by Congress' desire to be generous to tort victims and
to avoid such administrative problems as separating punitive from compensatory portions of a global settlement or determining the extent to
which a punitive damages award is itself intended to compensate; and
that their position is supported by a 1989 statutory amendment that
specifically says that the gross income exclusion does not apply to any
punitive damages in connection with a case not involving physical injury
or sickness-are not sufficiently persuasive to overcome the Government's interpretation. Pp. 87-90.
2. Petitioners' two case-specific procedural arguments-that the Government's lawsuit was untimely and that its original notice of appeal
was filed a few days late-are rejected. Pp. 90-92.

Opinion of the Court

Argrett, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace, Kenneth L.
Greene, and Kenneth W. Rosenberg.JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Internal Revenue Code § 104(a)(2), as it read in 1988,
excluded from "gross income" the
"amount of any damages received (whether by suit or
agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic
payments) on account of personalinjuriesor sickness."
26 U. S. C. § 104(a)(2) (emphasis added).
The issue before us is whether this provision applies to (and
thereby makes nontaxable) punitive damages received by a
plaintiff in a tort suit for personal injuries. We conclude
that the punitive damages received here were not received
"on account of" personal injuries; hence the provision does
not apply, -and the damages are taxable.
I
Petitioners in this litigation are the husband and two children of Betty O'Gilvie, who died in 1983 of toxic shock syndrome. Her husband, Kelly, brought a tort suit (on his own
behalf and that of her estate) based on Kansas law against
the maker of the product that caused Betty O'Gilvie's death.
Eventually, he and the two children received the net proceeds of a jury award of $1,525,000 actual damages and $10
million punitive damages. Insofar as the proceeds represented punitive damages, petitioners paid income tax on the
proceeds but immediately sought a refund.
The litigation before us concerns petitioners' legal entitlement to that refund. Procedurally speaking, the litigation
represents the consolidation of two cases brought in the
same Federal District Court: Kelly's suit against the Government for a refund, and the Government's suit against the
children to recover the refund that the Government had
made to the children earlier. 26 U. S. C. § 7405(b) (authoriz-

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

ing suits by the United States to recover refunds erroneously
made). The Federal District Court held on the merits that
the statutory phrase "damages ... on account of personal

injury or sickness" includes punitive damages, thereby excluding punitive damages from gross income and entitling
Kelly to obtain, and the children to keep, their refund. The
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, however, reversed
the District Court. Along with the Fourth, Ninth, and Federal Circuits, it held that the exclusionary provision does not
cover punitive damages. 66 F. 3d 1550 (1995). Because the
Sixth Circuit has held the contrary, the Circuits are divided
about the proper interpretation of the provision. We
granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.
II
Petitioners received the punitive damages at issue here
"by suit"-indeed "by" an ordinary "suit" for "personal injuries." Contrast United States v. Burke, 504 U. S.229 (1992)
(§ 104(a)(2) exclusion not applicable to backpay awarded
under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because the
claim was not based upon "'tort or tort type rights,"' id., at
233); Commissionerv. Schleier, 515 U. S.323 (1995) (alternative holding) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
(ADEA) claim is similar to Title VII claim in Burke in this
respect). These legal circumstances bring those damages
within the gross-income-exclusion provision, however, only
if petitioners also "received" those damages "on account of"
the "personal injuries." And the phrase "on account of"
does not unambiguously define itself.
On one linguistic interpretation of those words, that of
petitioners, they require no more than a "but-for" connection
between "any" damages and a lawsuit for personal injuries.
They would thereby bring virtually all personal injury lawsuit damages within the scope of the provision, since: "but
for the personal injury, there would be no lawsuit, and but
for the lawsuit, there would be no damages."

Cite as: 519 U. S. 79 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

On the Government's alternative interpretation, however,
those words impose a stronger causal connection, making the
provision applicable only to those personal injury lawsuit
damages that were awarded by reason of, or because of, the
personal injuries. To put the matter more specifically, they
would make the section inapplicable to punitive damages,
where those damages
"'are not compensation for injury [but] [i]nstead... are
private fines levied by civil juries to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its future occurrence."' Electrical Workers v. Foust, 442 U. S. 42, 48 (1979), quoting
Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974)
(footnote omitted).
The Government says that such damages were not "received
S.. on account of" the personal injuries, but rather were
awarded "on account of" a defendant's reprehensible conduct
and the jury's need to punish and to deter it. Hence, despite
some historical uncertainty about the matter, see Rev. Rul.
75-45, 1975-1 Cunm. Bull. 47, revoked by Rev. Rul. 84-108,
1984-2 Cum. Bull. 32, the Government now concludes that
these punitive damages fall outside the statute's coverage.
We agree with the Government's interpretation of the
statute. For one thing, its interpretation gives the phrase
"on account of" a meaning consistent with the dictionary
definition. See, e. g., Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 13 (1981) ("for the sake of: by reason of: because
of").
More important, in Schleier, supra, we came close to resolving the statute's ambiguity in the Government's favor.
That case did not involve damages received in an ordinary
tort suit; it involved liquidated damages and backpay received in a settlement of a lawsuit charging a violation of
the ADEA. Nonetheless, in deciding one of the issues there
presented (whether the provision now before us covered
ADEA liquidated damages), we contrasted the elements of

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

an ordinary tort recovery with ADEA liquidated damages.
We said that pain and suffering damages, medical expenses,
and lost wages in an ordinary tort case are covered by the
statute and hence excluded from income
"not simply because the taxpayer received a tort settlement, but rather because each element ... satisfies the
requirement . . . that the damages were received 'on

account of personal injuries or sickness."'

Id., at 330.

In holding that ADEA liquidated damages are not covered,
we said that they are not "designed to compensate ADEA
victims," id., at 332, n. 5; instead, they are "'punitive in
nature,"' id., at 332, quoting Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.
Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125 (1985).
Applying the same reasoning here would lead to the conclusion that the punitive damages are not covered because
they are an element of damages not "designed to compensate
...

victims," Schleier, 515 U. S., at 332; rather they are "'pu-

nitive in nature,"' ibid. Although we gave other reasons
for our holding in Schleier as well, we explicitly labeled this
reason an "independent" ground in support of our decision,
id., at 334. We cannot accept petitioners' claim that it was
simply a dictum.
We also find the Government's reading more faithful to
the history of the statutory provision as well as the basic
tax-related purpose that the history reveals. That history
begins in approximately 1918. At that time, this Court had
recently decided several cases based on the principle that a
restoration of capital was not income; hence it fell outside
the definition of "income" upon which the law imposed a tax.
E.g., Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., 247 U.S. 179, 187
(1918); Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330, 335
(1918). The Attorney General then advised the Secretary
of the Treasury that proceeds of an accident insurance policy
should be treated as nontaxable because they primarily

Cite as: 519 U. S. 79 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

"substitute ...capital which is the source of future periodical income ...merely tak[ing] the place of capital
in human ability which was destroyed by the accident.
They are therefore [nontaxable] 'capital' as distinguished
from 'income' receipts." 31 Op. Atty. Gen. 304, 308
(1918).
The Treasury Department added that
"upon similar principles ... an amount received by an
individual as the result of a suit or compromise for personal injuries sustained by him through accident is not
income [that is] taxable...." T. D. 2747, 20 Treas. Dec.
Int. Rev. 457 (1918).
Soon thereafter, Congress enacted the first predecessor
of the provision before us. That provision excluded from
income
"[a]mounts received, through accident or health insurance or under workmen's compensation acts, as compensation for personal injuries or sickness, plus the amount
of any damages received whether by suit or agreement
on account of such injuries or sickness." Revenue Act
of 1918, ch. 18, §213(b)(6), 40 Stat. 1066.
The provision is similar to the cited materials from the
Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury in language and structure, all of which suggests that Congress
sought, in enacting the statute, to codify the Treasury's basic
approach. A contemporaneous House Report, insofar as relevant, confirms this similarity of approach, for it says:
"Under the present law it is doubtful whether amounts
received through accident or health insurance, or under
workmen's compensation acts, as compensation for personal injury or sickness, and damages received on account of such injuries or sickness, are required to be
included in gross income. The proposed bill provides

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

that such amounts shall not be included in gross income." H. R. Rep. No. 767, pp. 9-10 (1918).
This history and the approach it reflects suggest there is
no strong reason for trying to interpret the statute's language to reach beyond those damages that, making up for a
loss, seek to make a victim whole, or, speaking very loosely,
"return the victim's personal or financial capital."
We concede that the original provision's language does go
beyond what one might expect a purely tax-policy-related
"human capital" rationale to justify. That is because the
language excludes from taxation not only those damages that
aim to substitute for a victim's physical or personal wellbeing-personal assets that the Government does not tax
and would not have taxed had the victim not lost them. It
also excludes from taxation those damages that substitute,
say, for lost wages, which would have been taxed had the
victim earned them. To that extent, the provision can make
the compensated taxpayer better off from a tax perspective
than had the personal injury not taken place.
But to say this is not to support cutting the statute totally
free from its original moorings in victim loss. The statute's
failure to separate those compensatory elements of damages
(or accident insurance proceeds) one from the other does not
change its original focus upon damages that restore a loss,
that seek to make a victim whole, with a tax-equality objective providing an important part of, even if not the entirety
of, the statute's rationale. All this is to say that the Government's interpretation of the current provision (the wording
of which has not changed significantly from the original) is
more consistent than is petitioners' with the statute's original focus.
Finally, we have asked why Congress might have wanted
the exclusion to have covered these punitive damages, and
we have found no very good answer. Those damages are
not a substitute for any normally untaxed personal (or financial) quality, good, or "asset." They do not compensate for

Cite as: 519 U. S. 79 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

any kind of loss. The statute's language does not require,
or strongly suggest, their exclusion from income. And we
can find no evidence that congressional generosity or concern
for administrative convenience stretched beyond the bounds
of an interpretation that would distinguish compensatory
from noncompensatory damages.
Of course, as we have just said, from the perspective of
tax policy one might argue that noncompensatory punitive
damages and, for example, compensatory lost wages are
much the same thing. That is, in both instances, exclusion
from gross income provides the taxpayer with a windfall.
This circumstance alone, however, does not argue strongly
for an interpretation that covers punitive damages, for coverage of compensatory damages has both language and history in its favor to a degree that coverage of noncompensatory punitive damages does not. Moreover, this policy
argument assumes that coverage of lost wages is something
of an anomaly; if so, that circumstance would not justify the
extension of the anomaly or the creation of another. See
Wolfman, Current Issues of Federal Tax Policy, 16 U. Ark.
Little Rock L. J. 543, 549-550 (1994) ("[T]o build upon" what
is, from a tax policy perspective, the less easily explained
portion "of the otherwise rational exemption for personal
injury," simply "does not make sense").
Petitioners make three sorts of arguments to the contrary.
First, they emphasize certain words or phrases in the original, or current, provision that work in their favor. For example, they stress the word "any" in the phrase "any damages." And they note that in both original and current
versions Congress referred to certain amounts of money
received (from workmen's compensation, for example) as
"amounts received . . . as compensation," while here they

refer only to "damages received" without adding the limiting
phrase "as compensation." 26 U. S. C. § 104(a); Revenue Act
of 1918, § 213(b)(6), 40 Stat. 1066. They add that in the original version, the words "on account of personal injuries"

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES
Opinion of the Court

might have referred to, and modified, the kind of lawsuit, not
the kind of damages. And they find support for this view
in the second sentence of the Treasury Regulation first
adopted in 1958 which says:
"The term 'damages received (whether by suit or agreement)' means an amount received (other than workmen's
compensation) through prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort or tort type rights, or through a
settlement agreement entered into in lieu of such prosecution." 26 CFR § 1.104-1(c) (1996).
These arguments, however, show only that one can reasonably read the statute's language in different ways-the very
assumption upon which our analysis rests. They do not
overcome our interpretation of the provision in Schleier, nor
do they change the provision's history. The help that the
Treasury Regulation's second sentence gives the petitioners
is offset by its first sentence, which says that the exclusion
applies to damages received "on account of personal injuries
or sickness," and which we have held sets forth an independent requirement. Schleier, 515 U. S., at 336. See Appendix, infra, at 92.
Second, petitioners argue that to some extent the purposes
that might have led Congress to exclude, say, lost wages
from income would also have led Congress to exclude punitive damages, for doing so is both generous to victims and.
avoids such administrative problems as separating punitive
from compensatory portions of a global settlement or determining the extent to which a punitive damages award is itself intended to compensate.
Our problem with these arguments is one of degree. Tax
generosity presumably has its limits. The administrative
problem of distinguishing punitive from compensatory elements is likely to be less serious than, say, distinguishing
among the compensatory elements of a settlement (which difficulty might account for the statute's treatment of, say, lost

Cite as: 519 U. S. 79 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

wages). And, of course, the problem of identifying the elements of an ostensibly punitive award does not exist where,
as here, relevant state law makes clear that the damages
at issue are not at all compensatory, but entirely punitive.
Brewer v. Home-Stake ProductionCo., 200 Kan. 96, 100, 434
P. 2d 828, 831 (1967) ("[E]xemplary damages are not regarded as compensatory in any degree"); accord, Smith v.
Printup,254 Kan. 315, 866 P. 2d 985 (1993); Folks v. Kansas
Power & Light Co., 243 Kan. 57, 755 P. 2d 1319 (1988); Nordstrom v. Miller, 227 Kan. 59, 605 P. 2d 545 (1980).
Third, petitioners rely upon a later enacted law. In 1989,
Congress amended the law so that it now specifically says
the personal injury exclusion from gross income
"shall not apply to any punitive damages in connection
with a case not involving physical injury or physical
sickness." 26 U. S. C. § 104(a).
Why, petitioners ask, would Congress have enacted this
amendment removing punitive damages (in nonphysical injury cases) unless Congress believed that, in the amendment's absence, punitive damages did fall within the provision's coverage?
The short answer to this question is that Congress might
simply have thought that the then-current law about the provision's treatment of punitive damages-in cases of physical
and nonphysical injuries-was unclear, that it wanted to clarify the matter in respect to nonphysical injuries, but it
wanted to leave the law where it found it in respect to physical injuries. The fact that the law was indeed uncertain at
the time supports this view. Compare Rev. Rul. 84-108,
1984-2 Cum. Bull. 32, with, e. g., Roemer v. Commissioner,
716 F. 2d 693 (CA9 1983); Miller v. Commissioner, 93 T. C.
330 (1989), rev'd 914 F. 2d 586 (CA4 1990).
The 1989 amendment's legislative history, insofar as relevant, offers further support. The amendment grew out of
the Senate's refusal to agree to a House bill that would have

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

made all damages in nonphysical personal injury cases taxable. The Senate was willing to specify only that the Government could tax punitive damages in such cases. Compare H. R. Rep. No. 101-247, p. 1355 (1989), with H. R. Conf.
Rep. No. 101-386, pp. 622-623 (1989). Congress' primary
focus, in other words, was upon what to do about nonphysical
personal injuries, not upon the provision's coverage of punitive damages under pre-existing law.
We add that, in any event, the view of a later Congress
cannot control the interpretation of an earlier enacted statute. United States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304 (1960); Higgins v.
Smith, 308 U. S. 473 (1940). But cf. Burke, 504 U. S., at 235,
n. 6 (including a passing reference to the 1989 amendment,
in dicta, as support for a view somewhat like that of
petitioners).
(Although neither party has argued that it is relevant, we
note in passing that § 1605 of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-188, 110 Stat. 1838, explicitly
excepts most punitive damages from the exclusion provided
by § 104(a)(2). Because it is of prospective application, the
section does not apply here. The Conference Report on the
new law says that "[n]o inference is intended" as to the
proper interpretation of § 104(a)(2) prior to amendment.
H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-737, p. 301 (1996).)
The upshot is that we do not find petitioners' arguments
sufficiently persuasive. And, for the reasons set out supra,
at 83-87, we agree with the Government's interpretation
of the statute.
III

Petitioners have raised two further issues, specific to the
procedural posture of this litigation. First, the O'Gilvie
children point out that the Government had initially accepted
their claim for a refund and wrote those checks on July 6,
1990. The Government later changed its mind and, on July
9, 1992, two years plus three days later, filed suit against
them seeking the return of a refund erroneously made. 26
U. S. C. § 7405(b) (authorizing a "civil action brought in the

Cite as: 519 U. S. 79 (1996)
Opinion of the Court

name of the United States" to recover any "portion of a tax
...

which has been erroneously refunded").

They add that

the relevant statute of limitations specifies that recovery of
the refund "shall be allowed only if such suit is begun within
2 years after the making of such refund." § 6532(b).
The children concede that they received the refund checks
on July 9, 1990, and they agree that if the limitation period
runs from the date of receipt-if, as the Government argues,
that is the date of the "making of" the refund-the Government's suit was timely. But the children say that the refund
was made on, and the limitations period runs from, the date
the Government mailed the checks (presumably July 6, 7, or
8), in which case the Government brought this suit one or
two or three days too late.
In our view, the Government is correct in its claim that its
lawsuit was timely. The language of the statute admits of
both interpretations. But the law ordinarily provides that
an action to recover mistaken payments of money "accrues
upon the receipt of payment," New Bedford v. Lloyd Investment Associates, Inc., 363 Mass. 112, 119, 292 N. E. 2d 688,
692 (1973); accord, Sizemore v. E. T Barwick Industries,
Inc., 225 Tenn. 226, 233, 465 S. W. 2d 873, 876 (1971) (" '[TIhe
time of making the... payment... was the date of actual
receipt'"), unless, as in some States and in some cases, it
accrues upon the still later date of the mistake's discovery,
see Allen & Lamkin, When Statute of Limitations Begins to
Run Against Action to Recover Money Paid By Mistake, 79
A. L. R. 3d 754, 766-769 (1977). We are not aware of any
good reason why Congress would have intended a different
result where the nature of the claim is so similar to a traditional action for money paid by mistake-an action the roots
of which can be found in the old common-law claim of
"assumpsit" or "money had and received." New Bedford,
supra, at 118, 292 N. E. 2d, at 691-692. The lower courts
and commentators have reached a similar conclusion.
United States v. Carter,906 F. 2d 1375 (CA9 1990); Akers v.
United States, 541 F. Supp. 65, 67 (MD Tenn. 1981); United

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES
Appendix to opinion of the Court

States v. Woodmansee, 388 F. Supp. 36, 46 (ND Cal. 1975),
rev'd on other grounds, 578 F. 2d 1302 (CA9 1978); 14
J. Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation § 54A.69 (1995);
Kafka & Cavanagh, Litigation of Federal Civil Tax Controversies §20.03, p. 20-15 (2d ed. 1995). That conclusion is
consistent with dicta in an earlier case from this Court,
United States v. Wurts, 303 U. S. 414, 417-418 (1938), as well
as with this Court's normal practice of construing ambiguous
statutes of limitations in Government action in the Government's favor. E. g., Badaracco v. Commissioner, 464 U. S.
386, 391 (1984).
We concede the children's argument that a "date of mailing" interpretation produces marginally greater certainty,
for such a rule normally would refer the court to the postmark to establish the date. But there is no indication that
a "date of receipt" rule has proved difficult to administer in
ordinary state or common-law actions for money paid erroneously. The date the check clears, after all, sets an outer
bound.
Second, Kelly O'Gilvie says that the Court of Appeals
should not have considered the Government's original appeal
from the District Court's judgment in his favor because, in
his view, the Government filed its notice of appeal a few days
too late. The Court of Appeals describes the circumstances
underlying this case-specific issue in its opinion. We agree
with its determination of the matter for the reasons it has
there set forth.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.

engaged in the performance of his official duties outside
the United States." 26 U. S. C. § 104 (1988 ed.).
In 1989, § 104(a) was amended, adding, among other things,
the following language:
"Paragraph (2) shall not apply to any punitive damages
in connection with a case not involving physical injury
or physical sickness." 26 U. S. C. § 104(a).

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES

SCALIA, J., dissenting

Treasury Regulation § 1.104-1(c) provides:
"Section 104(a)(2) excludes from gross income the
amount of any damages received (whether by suit or
agreement) on account of personal injuries or sickness.
The term 'damages received (whether by suit or agreement)' means an amount received (other than workmen's
compensation) through prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort or tort type rights, or through a
settlement agreement entered into in lieu of such prosecution." 26 CFR § 1.104-1(c) (1996).
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR
JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.

and

Section 104(a)(2), as it stood at the time relevant to these
cases, provided an exclusion from income for "any damages
received... on account of personal injuries or sickness." 26
U. S. C. § 104(a)(2) (1988 ed.). The Court is of the view that
this phrase, in isolation, is just as susceptible of a meaning
that includes only compensatory damages as it is of a broader
meaning that includes punitive damages as well. Ante, at
82-83. I do not agree. The Court greatly understates the
connection between an award of punitive damages and the personal injury complained of, describing it as nothing more than
"but-for" causality, ante, at 82. It seems to me that the
personal injury is as proximate a cause of the punitive damages as it is of the compensatory damages; in both cases it is
the reason the damages are awarded. That is why punitive
damages are called damages. To be sure, punitive damages
require intentional, blameworthy conduct, which can be said
to be a coequal reason they are awarded. But negligent (or
intentional) conduct occupies the same role of coequal causality with regard to compensatory damages. Both types of
damages are "received on account of" the personal injury.
The nub of the matter, it seems to me, is this: If one were
to be asked, by a lawyer from another legal system, "What
damages can be received on account of personal injuries in

SCALIA,

J., dissenting

the United States?" surely the correct answer would be
"Compensatory damages and punitive damages-the former
to compensate for the inflicting of the personal injuries, and
the latter to punish for the inflicting of them." If, as the
Court asserts, the phrase "damages received on account of
personal injuries" can be used to refer only to the former
category, that is only because people sometimes can be imprecise. The notion that Congress carefully and precisely
used the phrase "damages received on account of personal
injuries" to segregate out compensatory damages seems to
me entirely fanciful. That is neither the exact nor the ordinary meaning of the phrase, and hence not the one that the
statute should be understood to intend.
What I think to be the fair meaning of the phrase in isolation becomes even clearer when the phrase is considered in
its statutory context. The Court proceeds too quickly from
its erroneous premise of ambiguity to analysis of the history
and policy behind § 104(a)(2). Ante, at 84-87. Ambiguity
in isolation, even if it existed, would not end the textual inquiry. Statutory construction, we have said, is a "holistic
endeavor." United Say. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood
Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S.865, 371 (1988). "A provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified
by the remainder of the statutory scheme." Ibid.
Section 104(a)(2) appears immediately after another provision, § 104(a)(1), which parallels § 104(a)(2) in several respects
but does not use the critical phrase "on account of":
"(a) [G]ross income does not include"(1) amounts received under workmen's compensation
acts as compensationfor personal injuries or sickness;
"(2) the amount of any damages received.., on account
of personal injuries or sickness." (Emphasis added.)
Although § 104(a)(1) excludes amounts received "as compensation for" personal injuries or sickness, while § 104(a)(2) excludes amounts received "on account of" personal injuries or

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA,

sickness, the Court reads the two phrases to mean precisely
the same thing. That is not sound textual interpretation.
"[W]hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of
the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended." 2A N. Singer,
Sutherland on Statutory Construction §46.07 (5th ed. 1992
and Supp. 1996). See, e. g., Russello v. United States, 464
U. S.16, 23 (1983). This principle of construction has its limits, of course: Use of different terminology in differing contexts might have little significance. But here the contrasting phrases appear in adjoining provisions that address
precisely the same subject matter and that even have identical grammatical structure.
The contrast between the two usages is even more strikiig
in the original statute that enacted them. The Revenue Act
of 1918 combined subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of § 104, together with (a)(3) (which provides an exclusion from income
for amounts received through accident or health insurance
for personal injuries or sickness), into a single subsection,
which provided:
"'Gross income'... [dloes not include...:

"(6) Amounts received, through accident or health insurance or under workmen's compensation acts, as compensationfor personal injuries or sickness, plus the amount
of any damages received.., on account of such injuries
or sickness." §213(b)(6) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40
Stat. 1065-1066 (emphasis added).
The contrast between the first exclusion and the second
could not be more clear. Had Congress intended the latter
provision to cover only damages received "as compensation
for" personal injuries or sickness, it could have written
"amounts received, through accident or health insurance,
under workmen's compensation acts, or in damages, as compensation for personal injuries or sickness." Instead, it
tacked on an additional phrase "plus the amount of[, etc.]"

with no apparent purpose except to make clear that not only
compensatory damages were covered by the exclusion.
The Court maintains, however, that the Government's
reading of § 104(a)(2) is "more faithful to [its] history."
Ante, at 84. The "history" to which the Court refers is not
statutory history of the sort just discussed-prior enactments approved by earlier Congresses and revised or
amended by later ones to produce the current text. Indeed,
it is not "history" from within even a small portion of Congress, since the House Committee Report the Court cites,
standing by itself, is uninformative, saying only that "[u]nder
the present law it is doubtful whether.., damages received
on account of [personal] injuries or sickness are required to
be included in gross income." H. R. Rep. No. 767, 65th
Cong., 2d Sess., 9-10 (1918). The Court makes this snippet
of legislative history relevant by citing as pertinent an antecedent Treasury Department decision, which concludes on
the basis of recent judicial decisions that amounts received
from prosecution or compromise of a personal-injury suit are
not taxable because they are a return of capital. Ante, at
85 (citing T. D. 2747, 20 Treas. Dec. Int. Rev. 457 (1918)).
One might expect the Court to conclude from this that the
Members of Congress (on the unrealistic assumption that
they knew about the Executive Branch opinion) meant the
statutory language to cover only return of capital, the source
of the "doubt" to which the Committee Report referred.
But of course the Court cannot draw that logical conclusion,
since even if it is applied only to compensatory damages the
statute obviously and undeniably covers more than mere return of "human capital," namely, reimbursement for lost income, which would be a large proportion (indeed perhaps the
majority) of any damages award. The Court concedes this
is so, but asserts that this inconsistency is not enough "to
support cutting the statute totally free from its original
moorings," ante, at 86, by which I assume it means the
Treasury Decision, however erroneous it might have been as

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES
ScALA, J., dissenting

to the "capital" nature of compensatory damages. But the
Treasury Decision was no more explicitly limited to compensatory damages than is the statute before us. It exempted
from taxation "an amount received by an individual as the
result of a suit or compromise for personal injuries." T. D.
2747, supra, at 457. The Court's entire thesis of taxability
rests upon the proposition that this Treasury Decision, which
overlooked the obvious fact that "an amount received.., as
the result of a suit or compromise for personal injuries" almost always includes compensation for lost future income,
did not overlook the obvious fact that such an amount sometimes includes "smart money."
So, to trace the Court's reasoning: The statute must exclude punitive damages because the Committee Report must
have had in mind a 1918 Treasury Decision, whose text no
more supports exclusion of punitive damages than does the
text of the statute itself, but which must have meant to exclude punitive damages since it was based on the "return-ofcapital" theory, though, inconsistently with that theory, it did
not exclude the much more common category of compensation for lost income. Congress supposedly knew all of this,
and a reasonably diligent lawyer could figure it out by mistrusting the inclusive language of the statute, consulting the
Committee Report, surmising that the Treasury Decision of
1918 underlay that Report, mistrusting the inclusive language of the Treasury Decision, and discerning that Treasury could have overlooked lost-income compensatories, but
could not have overlooked punitives. I think not. The sure
and proper guide, it seems to me, is the language of the statute, inclusive by nature and doubly inclusive by contrast with
surrounding provisions.
The Court poses the question, ante, at 86, "why Congress
might have wanted the exclusion [in § 104(a)(2)] to have covered ...

punitive damages."

If an answer is needed (and

the text being as clear as it is, I think it is not), surely it
suffices to surmise that Congress was following the Treasury

Cite as: 519 U. S. 79 (1996)
SCAUA, J., dissenting

Decision, which had inadvertently embraced punitive damages just as it had inadvertently embraced future-income
compensatory damages. Or if some reason free of human
error must be found, I see nothing wrong with what the
Court itself suggests but rejects out of hand: Excluding punitive as well as compensatory damages from gross income
"avoids such administrative problems as separating punitive
from compensatory portions of a global settlement." Ante,
at 88. How substantial that particular problem is is suggested by the statistics which show that 73 percent of tort
cases in state court are disposed of by settlement, and between 92 and 99 percent of tort cases in federal court are
disposed of by either settlement or some other means (such
as summary judgment) prior to trial. See B. Ostrom & N.
Kauder, Examining the Work of State Courts, 1994, p. 34
(1996); Administrative Office of the United States Courts, L.
Mecham, Judicial Business of the United States Courts: 1995
Report of the Director 162-164. What is at issue, of course,
is not just imposing on the parties the necessity of allocating
the settlement between compensatory and punitive damages
(with the concomitant suggestion of intentional wrongdoing
that any allocation to punitive damages entails), but also imposing on the Internal Revenue Service the necessity of reviewing that allocation, since there would always be strong
incentive to inflate the tax-free compensatory portion. The
Court's only response to the suggestion that this is an adequate reason (if one is required) for including punitive damages in the exemption is that "[t]he administrative problem
of distinguishing punitive from compensatory elements is
likely to be less serious than, say, distinguishing among the
compensatory elements of a settlement." Ante, at 88. Perhaps so; and it may also be more simple than splitting the
atom; but that in no way refutes the point that it is complicated enough to explain the inclusion of punitive damages in
an exemption that has already abandoned the purity of a
"return-of-capital" rationale.

O'GILVIE v. UNITED STATES
SCALIA, J., dissenting

The remaining argument offered by the Court is that our
decision in Commissioner v. Schleier, 515 U. S. 323 (1995),
came "close to resolving"-in the Government's favor-the
question whether §104(a)(2) permits the exclusion of punitive damages. Ante, at 83. I disagree. In Schleier we
were faced with the question whether backpay and liquidated damages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) were "damages received ... on

account of personal injuries or sickness" for purposes of
§ 104(a)(2)'s exclusion. As the dissent accurately observed,
515 U. S., at 342 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), "the key to the

Court's analysis" was the determination that an ADEA
cause of action did not necessarily entail "personal injury or
sickness," so that the damages awarded for that cause of action could hardly be awarded "on account of personal injuries
or sickness." See id., at 330. In the case at hand, we said,
"respondent's unlawful termination may have caused some
psychological or 'personal' injury comparable to the intangible pain and suffering caused by an automobile accident," but
"it is clear that no part of respondent's recovery of back
wages is attributable to that injury." Ibid. The respondent countered that at least "the liquidated damages portion
of his settlement" could be linked to that psychological injury. Id., at 331. And it was in response to that argument
that we made the statement which the Court seeks to press
into service for today's opinion. ADEA liquidated damages,
we said, were punitive in nature, rather than compensatory.
Id., at 331-332, and n. 5.
The Court recites this statement as though the point of it
was that punitive damages could not be received "on account
of" personal injuries, whereas in fact the point was quite
different: Since the damages were punishment for the conduct that gave rise to the (non-personal-injury) cause of
action, they could not be "linked to" the incidental psychological injury. In the present cases, of course, there is no
question that a personal injury occurred and that this per-

Cite as: 519U. S. 79 (1996)
SCALIA, J., dissenting

sonal injury is what entitled petitioners to compensatory and
punitive damages. We neither decided nor intimated in
Schleier whether punitive damages that are indisputably
"linked to" personal injuries or sickness are received "on account of" such injuries or sickness. Indeed, it would have
been odd for us to resolve that question (or even come "close
to resolving" it) without any discussion of the numerous considerations of text, history, and policy highlighted by today's
opinion. If one were to search our opinions for a dictum
bearing upon the present issue, much closer is the statement
in United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229 (1992), that a statute
confers "tort or tort type rights" (qualifying a plaintiff's recovery for the § 104(a)(2) exemption) if it entitles the plaintiff
to "a jury trial at which 'both equitable and legal relief,
including compensatory and, under certain circumstances,
punitive damages' may be awarded." Id., at 240 (quoting
Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454,
460 (1975)).
But all of this is really by the way. Because the statutory
text unambiguously covers punitive damages that are
awarded on account of personal injuries, I conclude that petitioners were entitled to deduct the amounts at issue here.
This makes it unnecessary for me to reach the question, discussed ante, at 90-92, whether the Government's refund action against the O'Gilvie children was commenced within the
2-year period specified by 26 U. S. C. §6532(b). I note, however, that the Court's resolution of these cases also does not
demand that this issue be addressed, except to the extent of
rejecting the proposition that the statutory period begins to
run with the mailing of a refund check. So long as that is
not the trigger, there is no need to decide whether the proper
trigger is receipt of the check or some later event, such as
the check's clearance.
For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent from the
judgment of the Court.
