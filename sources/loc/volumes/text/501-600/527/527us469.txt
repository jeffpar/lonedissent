OCTOBER TERM, 1998
Per Curiam

FERTEL-RUST v. MILWAUKEE COUNTY MENTAL
HEALTH CENTER ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS

No. 98-8952.

Decided June 21, 1999

Pro se petitioner seeks leave to proceed informa pauperis on her certiorari petition. The instant petition brings her total number of frivolous
filings to eight.
Held: Petitioner's motion to proceed informa pauperisis denied. She is
barred from filing any further certiorari petitions in noncriminal cases
unless she first pays the docketing fee and submits her petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. See Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1.
Motion denied.

PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Fertel-Rust seeks leave to proceed in
forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this
request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Fertel-Rust is allowed until
July 12, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and to submit her petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk
not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from
Fertel-Rust in noncriminal matters unless she pays the
docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits her petition
in compliance with Rule 33.1.
Fertel-Rust has abused this Court's certiorari process.
Four times in the last five years, we invoked Rule 39.8 to
deny Fertel-Rust in forma pauperis status. See FertelRust v. Dane County Social Servs., 513 U. S. 1145 (1995);
Fertel-Rust v. Ambassador Hotel, 513 U.S. 1013 (1994);
Fertel-Rust v. Milwaukee Police Dept., 513 U. S. 1013 (1994);
Fertel-Rust v. Milwaukee Police Dept., 513 U. S. 945 (1994).
Before these four denials, Fertel-Rust had filed three petitions for certiorari, all of which were both patently frivolous
and denied without recorded dissent. The instant petition

FERTEL-RUST v. MILWAUKEE COUNTY MENTAL
HEALTH CENTER
STEVENS, J., dissenting

for certiorari thus brings Fertel-Rust's total number of frivolous filings to eight.
We enter the order barring prospective filings for the
reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court
of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Fertel-Rust's
abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases,
and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not prevent Fertel-Rust from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on her,
nor will it prevent her from filing appropriate petitions for
an extraordinary writ. The order, however, will allow this
Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our process.
It is so ordered.
dissenting.
For reasons previously stated, see Cross v. Pelican Bay
State Prison, 526 U. S. 811, 812 (1999) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals,
506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), and cases cited,
I respectfully dissent.
JUSTICE STEVENS,
