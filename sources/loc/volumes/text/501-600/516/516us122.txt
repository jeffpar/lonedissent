OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Syllabus

THINGS REMEMBERED, INC. v. PETRARCA
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 94-1530. Argued October 2, 1995-Decided December 5, 1995
Respondent commenced this action in Ohio state court to collect rent
allegedly owed by Child World, Inc., under two commercial leases and
to enforce Cole National Corporation's guarantee of Child World's performance under the leases. After Child World filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, Cole's successor in interest, petitioner here, removed
the action to federal court under the bankruptcy removal statute, 28
U. S. C. § 1452(a), and the general federal removal statute, §1441(a).
The Bankruptcy Court held that the removal was timely and proper,
and that it had jurisdiction. The District Court reversed and, in effect,
remanded the case to state court, holding that the removal was untimely
under §§ 1441(a) and 1452(a) and that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction. The Sixth Circuit dismissed petitioner's appeal for lack of
jurisdiction, holding that §§ 1447(d) and 1452(b) barred appellate review
of the District Court's remand order.
Held: If an order remands a removed bankruptcy case to state court because of a timely raised defect in removal procedure or lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction, a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to review the
order under § 1447(d). That section, a provision of the general removal
statute, bars appellate review of any "order remanding a case to the
State court from which it was removed." Under Thermtron Products,
Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,423 U. S. 336, 345-346, §1447(d) must be read in
pari materiawith §1447(c), so that only remands based on the grounds
recognized by § 1447(c), i. e., a timely raised defect in removal procedure
or lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, are immune from review under
§ 1447(d). Section 1447(d) bars review here, since the District Court's
order remanded the case to "the State court from which it was removed," and untimely removal is precisely the type of removal defect
contemplated by § 1447(c). The same conclusion pertains regardless of
whether the case was removed under § 1441(a) or § 1452(a). Section
1447(d) applies "not only to remand[s] ... under [the general removal
statute], but to orders of remand made in cases removed under any
other statutes." United States v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742, 752 (emphasis
added). Moreover, there is no indication that Congress intended §1452
to be the exclusive provision governing removals and remands in bankruptcy or to exclude bankruptcy cases from §1447(d)'s coverage. Al-
