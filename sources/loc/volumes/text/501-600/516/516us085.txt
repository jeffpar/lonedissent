NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v. TOWN &
COUNTRY ELECTRIC, INC., ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
No. 94-947. Argued October 10, 1995-Decided November 28, 1995
In the course of holding that respondent company committed "unfair labor
practices" when it refused to interview or retain 11 job applicants because of their union membership, the National Labor Relations Board
determined that all of the applicants were protected "employee[s]" as
that word is defined in the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C.
§ 152(3), even though they intended to try to organize the company if
they were hired and would have been paid by the union while they set
about their organizing. The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the
statutory word "employee" does not cover (and therefore the Act does
not protect from antiunion discrimination) those who work for a company while a union simultaneously pays them to organize that company.
Held. A worker may be a company's "employee," within the terms of the
National Labor Relations Act, even if, at the same time, a union pays
that worker to help the union organize the company. Pp. 88-98.
(a) The Board may lawfully interpret § 152(3)'s language-i. e., "[t]he
term 'employee' shall include any employee, and shall not be limited to
the employees of a particular employer, unless this subchapter explicitly
states otherwise"-to include company workers who are also paid union
organizers. The Board's broad, literal reading of "employee" is entitled
to considerable deference as the interpretation of the agency created by
Congress to administer the Act. See, e. g., Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467
U. S. 883, 891. Moreover, several strong general arguments favor the
Board's position. First, the Board's decision is consistent with the Act's
language, particularly the "any employee" phrase, which is broad
enough to include, under the ordinary dictionary definitions of "employee," those company workers whom a union also pays for organizing.
Second, the Board's interpretation is consistent with several of the Act's
purposes-such as protecting employees' right to organize for mutual
aid without employer interference and encouraging and protecting the
collective-bargaining process-and with the legislative history. Third,
the Board's reading is consistent with this Court's decisions. See, e. g.,
ibid. Finally, § 186(c)(1) also seems specifically to contemplate the
possibility that a company's employee might also work for a union.
Pp. 88-92.

Syllabus
(b) Respondent company's agency law argument-that a paid union
organizer is controlled by the union and therefore must be considered
the servant (i. e., the "employee") of the union alone-fails because the
Board's interpretation of "employee" is consistent with the common law
of agency, which recognizes that a person may be the servant of two
masters at one time as to one act. The company's practical argumentthat Congress could not have meant to include paid union organizers
as "employees" under the Act in light of the potential for harm to an
employer that such workers might pose-suffers from several serious
problems and is thus unconvincing. Pp. 92-98.

Opinion of the Court

delivered the opinion of the Court.
Can a worker be a company's "employee," within the
terms of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. § 151
et seq., if, at the same time, a union pays that worker to
help the union organize the company? We agree with the
National Labor Relations Board that the answer is "yes."y
JUSTICE BREYER

I
The relevant background is the following: Town & Country
Electric, Inc., a nonunion electrical contractor, wanted to
hire several licensed Minnesota electricians for construction
work in Minnesota. Town & Country (through an employment agency) advertised for job applicants, but it refused to
interview 10 of 11 union applicants (including two professional union staff) who responded to the advertisement. Its
employment agency hired the one union applicant whom
Town & Country interviewed, but he was dismissed after
only a few days on the job.
The members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Locals 292 and 343 (Union), filed a complaint
with the National Labor Relations Board claiming that
Town & Country and the employment agency had refused to
interview (or retain) them because of their union membership. See National Labor Relations Act (Act) §8 8(a)(1) and
(3), 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §§ 158(a)(1) and (3)
(1988 ed.). An Administrative Law Judge ruled in favor
of the Union members, and the Board affirmed that ruling. Town & Country Elec., Inc., 309 N. L. R. B. 1250, 1258
(1992).
In the course of its decision, the Board determined that all
11 job applicants (including the two Union officials and the
one member briefly hired) were "employees" as the Act defines that word. Ibid. The Board recognized that under
well-established law, it made no difference that the 10 members who were simply applicants were never hired. See

NLRB v. TOWN & COUNTRY ELEC., INC.
Opinion of the Court

Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U. S. 177, 185-186 (1941)
(statutory word "employee" includes job applicants, for otherwise the Act's prohibition of "'discrimination in regard to
hire"' would "serve no function"). Neither, in the Board's
view, did it matter (with respect to the meaning of the word
"employee") that the Union members intended to try to organize the company if they secured the advertised jobs, nor
that the Union would pay them while they set about their
organizing. The Board then rejected the company's factbased explanations for its refusals to interview or to retain
these 11 "employees" and held that the company had committed "unfair labor practices" by discriminating on the
basis of union membership. Town & Country Elec., supra,
at 1250, n. 3, 1256, 1258.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
reversed the Board. It held that the Board had incorrectly
interpreted the statutory word "employee." In the court's
view, that key word does not cover (and therefore the Act
does not protect from antiunion discrimination) those who
work for a company while a union simultaneously pays them
to organize that company. 34 F. 3d 625, 629 (1994). See
also H. B. Zachry Co. v. NLRB, 886 F. 2d 70, 75 (CA4 1989).
For this threshold reason the court refused to enforce the
Board's order.
Because other Circuits have interpreted the word "employee" differently, see, e. g., Willmar Elec. Service, Inc. v.
NLRB, 968 F. 2d 1327, 1330-1331 (CADC 1992) (paid union
organizers can be "employees" protected by the Act), cert.
denied, 507 U. S. 909 (1993); NLRB v. Henlopen Mfg. Co., 599
F. 2d 26, 30 (CA2 1979) (same), we granted certiorari. We
now resolve the conflict in the Board's favor.
II
The Act seeks to improve labor relations ("eliminate the
causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of
commerce," 29 U. S. C. § 151 (1988 ed.)) in large part by
granting specific sets of rights to employers and to employ-

Cite as: 516 U. S. 85 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

ees. This case grows out of a controversy about rights that
the Act grants to "employees," namely, rights "to selforganization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to
bargain collectively . . . and to engage in other concerted
activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other
mutual aid or protection." § 157. We granted certiorari to
decide only that part of the controversy that focuses upon
the meaning of the word "employee," a key term in the statute, since these rights belong only to those workers who
qualify as "employees" as that term is defined in the Act.
See, e. g., § 158(a)(1) ("unfair labor practice" to "interfere
with.., employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed
in section 157 of this title") (emphasis added).
The relevant statutory language is the following:
"The term 'employee' shall include any employee, and
shall not be limited to the employees of a particular
employer, unless this subchapterexplicitly states otherwise, and shall include any individual whose work has
ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any
current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor
practice, and who has not obtained any other regular
and substantially equivalent employment, but shall not
include any individual employed as an agricultural laborer, or in the domestic service of any family or person
at his home, or any individual employed by his parent
or spouse, or any individual having the status of an independent contractor, or any individual employed as a
supervisor, or any individual employed by an employer
subject to the Railway Labor Act, as amended from time
to time, or by any other person who is not an employer
as herein defined." § 152(3) (emphasis added).
We must specifically decide whether the Board may lawfully
interpret this language to include company workers who are
also paid union organizers.
We put the question in terms of the Board's lawful authority because this Court's decisions recognize that the Board

NLRB v. TOWN & COUNTRY ELEC., INC.
Opinion of the Court

often possesses a degree of legal leeway when it interprets
its governing statute, particularly where Congress likely intended an understanding of labor relations to guide the Act's
application. See, e. g., Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S.
883, 891 (1984) (interpretations of the Board, the agency that
Congress "'created ... to administer the Act,'" will be up-

held if "reasonably defensible") (internal citation omitted);
NLRB v. CurtinMatheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S. 775, 786
(1990) (Congress delegated to the Board "primary responsibility for developing and applying national labor policy");
ABF FreightSystem, Inc. v. NLRB, 510 U. S. 317, 324 (1994)
(the Board's views are entitled to "the greatest deference").
See also Chevron U S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984). We add, however, that the Board needs very little legal leeway here to
convince us of the correctness of its decision.
Several strong general arguments favor the Board's position. For one thing, the Board's decision is consistent with
the broad language of the Act itself-language that is broad
enough to include those company workers whom a union also
pays for organizing. The ordinary dictionary definition of
"employee" includes any "person who works for another in
return for financial or other compensation." American Heritage Dictionary 604 (3d ed. 1992). See also Black's Law
Dictionary 525 (6th ed. 1990) (an employee is a "person in
the service of another under any contract of hire, express or
implied, oral or written, where the employer has the power
or right to control and direct the employee in the material
details of how the work is to be performed"). The phrasing
of the Act seems to reiterate the breadth of the ordinary
dictionary definition, for it says "[t]he term 'employee' shall
include any employee." 29 U. S. C. § 152(3) (1988 ed.) (emphasis added). Of course, the Act's definition also contains
a list of exceptions, for example, for independent contractors,
agricultural laborers, domestic workers, and employees sub-

Cite as: 516 U. S. 85 (1995)

Opinion of the Court

ject to the Railway Labor Act, 45 U. S. C. § 151 et seq.; but
no exception applies here.
For another thing, the Board's broad, literal interpretation
of the word "employee" is consistent with several of the Act's
purposes, such as protecting "the right of employees to organize for mutual aid without employer interference," Republic
Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 793, 798 (1945); see
also 29 U. S. C. § 157 (1988 ed.); and "encouraging and protecting the collective-bargaining process." Sure-Tan,Inc. v.
NLRB, supra, at 892. And, insofar as one can infer purpose
from congressional reports and floor statements, those
sources too are consistent with the Board's broad interpretation of the word. It is fairly easy to find statements to the
effect that an "employee" simply "means someone who works
for another for hire," H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st
Sess., 18 (1947), and includes "every man on a payroll," 79
Cong. Rec. 9686 (1935) (colloquy between Reps. Taylor and
Connery). See also S. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 6
(1935) (referring to an employee as a "worker"); H. R. Rep.
No. 969, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1935) (same); H. R. Rep. No.
972, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1935) (same); H. R. Rep. No.
1147, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1935) (same). At the same
time, contrary statements, suggesting a narrow or qualified
view of the word, are scarce, or nonexistent-except, of
course, those made in respect to the specific' (here inapplicable) exclusions written into the statute.
Further, a broad, literal reading of the statute is consistent
with cases in this Court such as, say, Sure-Tan, Inc. v.
NLRB, supra (the Act covers undocumented aliens), where
the Court wrote that the "breadth of §2(3)'s definition is
striking: the Act squarely applies to 'any employee."' 467
U. S., at 891. See NLRB v. Hendricks County Rural Elec.
Membership Corp., 454 U. S. 170, 189-190 (1981) (certain
"confidential employees" fall within the definition of "employees"); Phelps Dodge Corp.v. NLRB, 313 U. S., at 185-186
(job applicants are "employees"). Cf. Chemical Workers v.

NLRB v. TOWN & COUNTRY ELEC., INC.
Opinion of the Court

PittsburghPlate Glass Co., 404 U. S. 157, 166 (1971) (retired
persons are not "employees" because they do not "work for
another for hire"). See also NLRB v. Hearst Publications,
Inc., 322 U. S. 111, 131-132 (1944) (independent contractorlike newsboys are "employees"); PackardMotor Car Co. v.
NLRB, 330 U. S. 485, 488-490 (1947) (company foremen are
"employees"). But see 61 Stat. 137-138, 29 U. S. C. § 152(3)
(1988 ed.) (amending Act to overrule Hearst and Packardby
explicitly excluding independent contractors and supervisory employees).
Finally, at least one other provision of the 1947 Labor
Management Relations Act seems specifically to contemplate
the possibility that a company's employee might also work
for a union. This provision forbids an employer (say, the
company) to make payments to a person employed by a
union, but simultaneously exempts from that ban wages paid
by the company to "any... employee of a labor organization,
who is also an employee" of the company. 29 U.S. C.
§ 186(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). If Town &
Country is right, there would not seem to be many (or any)
human beings to which this last phrase could apply.
III
Town & Country believes that it can overcome these general considerations, favoring a broad, literal interpretation
of the Act, through an argument that rests primarily upon
the common law of agency. It first argues that our prior
decisions resort to common-law principles in defining the
term "employee." See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden,
503 U. S. 318, 323 (1992) (using common-law test to distinguish between "employee" and "independent contractor"
under Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
29 U. S. C. § 1001 et seq.); Community for Creative NonViolence v. Reid, 490 U. S. 730, 739-740 (1989) (using
common-law test to distinguish between "employee" and
"independent contractor" under Copyright Act of 1976, 17

Cite as: 516 U. S. 85 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

U. S. C. § 101 et seq.); NLRB v. United Ins. Co. of America,
390 U. S. 254, 256 (1968) (using common-law test to distinguish between "employee" and "independent contractor"
under NLRA). And it also points out that the Board itself,
in its decision, found "no bar to applying common law agency
principles to the determination whether a paid union organizer is an 'employee,"' Town & Country Elec., Inc., 309
N. L. R. B., at 1254.
Town & Country goes on to argue that application of
common-law agency principles requires an interpretation of
"employee" that excludes paid union organizers. It points
to a section of the Restatement (Second) of Agency (dealing
with respondeat superiorliability for torts), which says:
"Since... the relation of master and servant is dependent upon the right of the master to control the conduct
of the servant in the performance of the service, giving
service to two masters at the same time normally involves a breach of duty by the servant to one or both of
them ....
[A person] cannot be a servant of two masters in doing an act as to which an intent to serve one
necessarily excludes an intent to serve the other." Restatement (Second) of Agency §226, Comment a, p. 499
(1957).
It argues that, when the paid union organizer serves the
union-at least at certain times in certain ways-the organizer is acting adversely to the company. Indeed, it says,
the organizer may stand ready to desert the company upon
request by the union, in which case, the union, not the company, would have "the right.., to control the conduct of the
servant." Ibid. Thus, it concludes, the worker must be the
servant (i. e., the "employee") of the union alone. See id.,
§ 1, and Comment a, p. 8 ("agent" is one who agrees to act
"subject to [a principal's] control").
As Town & Country correctly notes, in the context of reviewing lower courts' interpretations of statutory terms, we

NLRB v. TOWN & COUNTRY ELEC., INC.
Opinion of the Court

have said on several occasions that when Congress uses the
term "employee" in a statute that does not define the term,
courts interpreting the statute "'must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate
the established meaning of th[at] ter[m] .... In the past,
when Congress has used the term "employee" without defining it, we have concluded that Congress intended to describe
the conventional master-servant relationship as understood
by common-law agency doctrine."' Nationwide Mut. Ins.
Co. v. Darden, supra, at 322-323 (quoting Community for
Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, supra, at 739-740). At the
same time, when reviewing the Board's interpretation of
the term "employee" as it is used in the Act, we have repeatedly said that "[s]ince the task of defining the term 'employee' is one that 'has been assigned primarily to the agency
created by Congress to administer the Act,' .. . the Board's
construction of that term is entitled to considerable deference ...." Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S., at 891
(quoting NLRB v. Hearst Publications,Inc., supra, at 130);
NLRB v. Hendricks County Rural Elec. Membership Corp.,
454 U. S., at 177-190. In some cases, there may be a question about whether the Board's departure from the common
law of agency with respect to particular questions and in a
particular statutory context, renders its interpretation unreasonable. See NLRB v. United Ins. Co., supra, at 256
("independent contractor" exclusion). But no such question
is presented here since the Board's interpretation of the
term "employee" is consistent with the common law.
Town & Country's common-law argument fails, quite simply, because, in our view, the Board correctly found that it
lacks sufficient support in common law. The Restatement's
hornbook rule (to which the quoted commentary is appended) says that a
"person may be the servant of two masters ... at one
time as to one act, if the service to one does not involve

Cite as: 516 U. S. 85 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

abandonment of the service to the other." Restatement (Second) of Agency § 226, at 498 (emphasis added).
The Board, in quoting this rule, concluded that service to the
union for pay does not "involve abandonment of... service"
to the company. 309 N. L. R. B., at 1254.
And, that conclusion seems correct. Common sense suggests that as a worker goes about his or her ordinarytasks
during a working day, say, wiring sockets or laying cable, he
or she is subject to the control of the company employer,
whether or not the union also pays the worker. The company, the worker, the union, all would expect that to be'so.
And, that being so, that union and company interests or control might sometimes differ should make no difference. As
Prof. Seavey pointed out many years ago, "[o]ne can be a
servant of one person for some acts and the servant of another person for other acts, even when done at the same
time," for example, where "a city detective, in search of
clues, finds employment as a waiter and, while serving the
meals, searches the customer's pockets." W. Seavey, Handbook of the Law of Agency § 85, p. 146 (1964). The detective
is the servant both "of the restaurateur" (as to the table
waiting) and "of the city" (as to the pocket searching). Ibid.
How does it differ from Prof. Seavey's example for the company to pay the worker for electrical work, and the union to
pay him for organizing? Moreover, union organizers may
limit their organizing to nonwork hours. See, e. g., Republic
Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 (1945); Beth Israel
Hospital v. NLRB, 437 U. S. 483, 492-493 (1978). If so,
union organizing, when done for pay but during nonwork
hours, would seem equivalent to simple moonlighting, a practice wholly consistent with a company's control over its
workers as to their assigned duties.
Town & Country's "abandonment" argument is yet weaker
insofar as the activity that constitutes an "abandonment,"
i.e., ordinary union organizing activity, is itself specifically
protected by the Act. See, e. g., ibid. (employer restrictions

NLRB v. TOWN & COUNTRY ELEC., INC.
Opinion of the Court

on union solicitation during nonworking time in nonworking
areas are presumptively invalid under the Act). This is true
even if a company perceives those protected activities as disloyal. After all, the employer has no legal right to require
that, as part of his or her service to the company, a worker
refrain from engaging in protected activity.
Neither are we convinced by the practical considerations
that Town & Country adds to its agency law argument. The
company refers to a Union resolution permitting members to
work for nonunion firms, which, the company says, reflects a
union effort to "salt' nonunion companies with union members seeking to organize them. Supported by amici curiae,
it argues that "salts" might try to harm the company, perhaps quitting when the company needs them, perhaps disparaging the company to others, perhaps even sabotaging the
firm or its products. Therefore, the company concludes,
Congress could not have meant paid union organizers to have
been included as "employees" under the Act.
This practical argument suffers from several serious problems. For one thing, nothing in this record suggests that
such acts of disloyalty were present, in kind or degree, to the
point where the company might lose control over the worker's
normal workplace tasks. Certainly the Union's resolution
contains nothing that suggests, requires, encourages, or condones impermissible or unlawful activity. App. 256-258.
For another thing, the argument proves too much. If a paid
union organizer might quit, leaving a company employer in
the lurch, so too might an unpaid organizer, or a worker who
has found a better job, or one whose family wants to move
elsewhere. And if an overly zealous union organizer might
hurt the company through unlawful acts, so might another
unpaid zealot (who may know less about the law), or a dissatisfied worker (who may lack an outlet for his or her grievances). This does not mean they are not "employees."
Further, the law offers alternative remedies for Town &
Country's concerns, short of excluding paid or unpaid union

Cite as: 516 U. S. 85 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

organizers from all protection under the Act. For example,
a company disturbed by legal but undesirable activity, such
as quitting without notice, can offer its employees fixed-term
contracts, rather than hiring them "at will" as in the case
before us; or it can negotiate with its workers for a notice
period. A company faced with unlawful (or possibly unlawful) activity can discipline or dismiss the worker, file a complaint with the Board, or notify law enforcement authorities.
See, e.g., NLRB v. Electrical Workers, 346 U. S. 464, 472-478
(1953); Willmar Elec. Service v. NLRB, 968 F. 2d, at 1330
(arsonist who is also union member is still an "employee,"
but may be discharged). See also Budd Mfg. Co. v. NLRB,
138 F. 2d 86, 89-90 (CA3 1943) (worker who was intoxicated
while on duty, "came to work when he chose and.., left the
plant and his shift as he pleased," and utterly failed to perform his assigned duties is still an "employee" protected
under the Act), cert. denied, 321 U. S. 778 (1944). And, of
course, an employer may as a rule limit the access of nonemployee union organizers to company property. Lechmere,
Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U. S. 527, 538 (1992); NLRB v. Babcock &
Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105, 112 (1956).
This is not to say that the law treats paid union organizers
like other company employees in every labor law context.
For instance, the Board states that, at least sometimes, a
paid organizer may not share a sufficient "community of interest" with other employees (as to wages, hours, and working conditions) to warrant inclusion in the same bargaining
unit. Brief for National Labor Relations Board 33, n. 14.
See, e. g., NLRB v. Hendricks County Rural Elec. Membership Corp., 454 U. S., at 190 (some confidential workers, although "employees," may be excluded from bargaining unit).
We need not decide this matter. Nor do we express any
view about any of the other matters Town & Country raised
before the Court of Appeals, such as whether or not Town &
Country's conduct (in refusing to interview, or to retain, "employees" who were on the union's payroll) amounted to an

98

NLRB v. TOWN & COUNTRY ELEC., INC.
Opinion of the Court

unfair labor practice. See 34 F. 3d, at 629. We hold only
that the Board's construction of the word "employee" is lawful; that term does not exclude paid union organizers.
IV
For these reasons the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
