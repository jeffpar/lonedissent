DELO, SUPERINTENDENT, POTOSI CORRECTIONAL
CENTER v. BLAIR
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE STAY OF EXECUTION

No. A-69.

Decided July 21, 1993

Held The Court of Appeals' stay of execution is vacated. It is an abuse
of discretion for a federal court to interfere with the orderly process of
a State's criminal justice system in a habeas case raising claims that are

for all relevant purposes indistinguishable from those that this Court
recently rejected in Herrerav. Collins, 506 U. S. 390.
PER CURIAM.

The application to vacate the stay of execution presented
to JUSTICE BLACKMUN has been referred to the Court.

Applying the prevailing legal standard, it is "particularly
egregious" to enter a stay on second or subsequent habeas
petitions unless "there are substantial grounds upon which
relief might be granted." Herrerav. Collins, 506 U. S. 390,
425, 426 (1993) (O'CONNOR, J., joined by KENNEDY, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted). No substantial
grounds were presented in the present case. The District
Court stated that the "facts in Herreramirror those in the
present case." No. 93-0674-CV-1 (WD Mo., July 19, 1993).
This assessment was not even questioned by the Court of
Appeals, and is obviously correct. There is therefore no
conceivable need for the Court of Appeals to engage in "more
detailed study" over the next five weeks to resolve this
claim. See 999 F. 2d 1219 (CA8 1993).
It is an abuse of discretion for a federal court to interfere
with the orderly process of a State's criminal justice system
in a case raising claims that are for all relevant purposes
indistinguishable from those we recently rejected in Herrera. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' stay must be
vacated.

DELO v. BLAIR
BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

JUSTICE SOUTER would deny the application to vacate

the stay.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS

joins,
dissenting.
The Court errs twice in granting the State's application to
vacate the Court of Appeals' stay of execution. First, it
errs by affording insufficient deference to the Court of Appeals' decision. Second, it errs by letting'stand the District
Court's decision, which was itself erroneous.
I
"The standard under which we consider motions to vacate
stays of execution is deferential, and properly so. Only
when the lower courts have clearly abused their discretion
in granting a stay should we take the extraordinary step of
overturning such a decision." Dugger v. Johnson, 485 U. S.
945, 947 (1988) (O'CONNOR, J., joined by REHNQUIST, C. J.,
dissenting). Accord, Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 896
(1983); Wainwright v. Spenkelink, 442 U. S. 901, 905 (1979)
(REHNQUIST, J., dissenting). In this case, the Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of execution to allow it time
properly to consider Blair's appeal. In my view, its decision
to do so does not constitute an abuse of discretion.
The State likens this case to Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320
(1990), in which this Court vacated a stay of execution because the prisoner's habeas petition "clearly constitute[d] an
abuse of the writ." Id., at 321. Although the habeas petition currently before the Court of Appeals is Blair's third,
the abuse of the writ doctrine cannot servo as the basis for
vacating this stay. Blair's principal contention in his federal
habeas petition is that he is actually innocent, and this Court
has recognized an exception to the abuse of the writ doctrine
where a habeas petitioner can show that he probably is innocent. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 495 (1991).

BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

II

The Court's second error is that it lets stand the District
Court's decision denying Blair's claim without an evidentiary
hearing. In Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390 (1993), this
Court assumed that "in a capital case a truly persuasive
demonstration of 'actual innocence' made after trial would
render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and
warrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenue
open to process such a claim." Id., at 417. The Court provided little guidance about what sort of showing would be
"truly persuasive." Yet despite the uncertain contours of
this constitutional right, federal courts have an obligation to
treat actual-innocence claims just as they would any other
constitutional claim brought pursuant to 28 U. S. C. ยง2254.
The rules governing federal habeas, not addressed by the
Herrera majority, provide that "[a] district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition only if 'it plainly appears
from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it
that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.' 28 U. S. C.
ยง2254 Rule 4." 506 U. S., at 445 (dissenting opinion). "If
the petition raises factual questions and the State has
failed to provide a full and fair hearing, the district court is
required to hold an evidentiary hearing." Id., at 441 (emphasis added), citing Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313
(1963).
In this case, Blair has submitted seven affidavits tending
to show that he is innocent of the crime for which he has
been sentenced to death. The State does not dispute that
no state court remains open to hear Blair's claim. Because
Blair's affidavits raise factual questions that cannot be dismissed summarily, the District Court erred in denying petitioner's claim without an evidentiary hearing.
