LOWE v. POGUE ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 98-7591.

Decided March 29, 1999*

Pro se petitioner seeks leave to proceed informa pauperis on his petitions

for certiorari. Including these petitions, he has had 31 frivolous filings
with this Court.
Held: Petitioner's motions to proceed in forma pauperis are denied. He
is barred from filing any further petitions for certiorari and for extraordinary writs in noncriminal cases unless he first pays the docketing fee
and submits his petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. See
Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1.

Motions denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Lowe seeks leave to proceed in forma
pauperisunder Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request
pursuant to Rule 39.8. Lowe is allowed until April 19, 1999,
within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38
and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's
Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari nor petitions for extraordinary
writs from Lowe in noncriminal matters unless he pays the
docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition
in compliance with Rule 33.1.
Lowe has abused this Court's certiorari and extraordinary
writ processes. In November of last year and earlier this
month, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Lowe in forma pauperis status. See Lowe v. Cantrell, 525 U. S. 1176 (1999);
In re Lowe, 525 U. S. 960 (1998) (three cases). Before these
4 denials, Lowe had ified 23 petitions, all of which were
both patently frivolous and had been denied without re*Together with No. 98-7952, Lowe v. Oklahoma Department of Corrections, No. 98-8073, Lowe v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, and

corded dissent. The 4 instant petitions for certiorari thus
bring Lowe's total number of frivolous filings to 31. He has
several additional filings- all of them patently frivolouscurrently pending before this Court.
We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Lowe's abuse of
the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has been
in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not prevent Lowe from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him. The order, however, will allow this Court to
devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who
have not abused our process.
It is so ordered.

For reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of
Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS,
J., dissenting), and cases cited, I respectfully dissent.
