Pro se patitioner seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis on her petitions for certiorari. These constitute her 34th and 35th frivolous filings

Held. Petitioner's motions to proceed informa pauperis are denied. She
is barred from filing any further certiorari petitions in noncriminal cases
unless she first pays the docketing fee and submits her petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. See Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1.
Motions denied.
PER '-CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Schwarz seeks leave to proceed informa
pauperisunder Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request
as frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Schwarz is allowed until
March 29, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and to submit her petitions in compliance
with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to
accept any further petitions for certiorari from Schwarz in
noncriminal matters unless she pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits her petition in compliance
with Rule 33.1.
Schwarz has repeatedly abused this Court's certiorari
process. On December 14, 1998, we invoked Rule 39.8 to
deny Schwarz informa pauperisstatus with respect to four
petitions for certiorari. See Schwarz v. Federal Bureau of
Investigation,525 U. S. 1053; Schwarz v. National Institute
of Corrections,525 U. S. 1053; Schwarz v. United States Parole Comm'n, 525 U. S. 1053; Schwarz v. National Archives
and Records Administration, 525 U. S. 1053. Before that
*Together with No. 98-7782, Schwarz v. Executive Office of the President et al., also on motion for leave to proceed informapauperis.

dissenting

time, Schwarz had filed 29 petitions for certiorari, all of
which were both patently frivolous and had been denied
without recorded dissent. The instant petitions for certiorari thus constitute Schwarz's 34th and 35th frivolous filings
with this Court.
We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Schwarz's abuse
of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and
we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will
not prevent Schwarz from petitioning to challenge criminal
sanctions which might be imposed on her. Similarly, because Schwarz has not abused this Court's extraordinary
writs procedures, the order will not prevent her from filing
nonfrivolous petitions for extraordinary writs. The order
will, however, allow this Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our
certiorari process.
It is so ordered.

For reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of
Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS,
J., dissenting), and cases cited, I respectfully dissent.
