OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE
IN CHAMBERS
MURDAUGH, SOLICITOR, 14TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
OF SOUTH CAROLINA, ET AL. v. LIVINGSTON
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE STAY
No. A-396.

Decided November 18, 1998

The State's application to vacate an October 20, 1998, temporary restraining order enjoining it from proceeding with indictments against respondent is denied without prejudice. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, such an order ordinarily cannot remain in effect for more
than 10 days. Here, the Magistrate Judge has recommended dismissal,
and the matter appears to be pending before the District Court.
Should that court issue a preliminary injunction or further stay the
proceedings, the State may renew its application.

Circuit Justice.
The District Court in this case entered a temporary restraining order on October 20, 1998, against the State, enjoining it from proceeding further with the indictments
against respondent. Pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, a temporary restraining order cannot remain in effect for more than 10 days unless extended
for good cause by the district court or consented to by the
adverse party. I am advised that the Magistrate Judge to
whom this case was assigned has recommended dismissal,
and, so far as I know, the matter is now pending before the
District Court. I therefore deny the State's application to
vacate the stay, without prejudice to its renewal should the
District Court issue a preliminary injunction or farther stay
the criminal proceedings.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST,
