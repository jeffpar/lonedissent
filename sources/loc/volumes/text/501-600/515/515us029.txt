NORTH STAR STEEL CO. v. THOMAS ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 94-834. Argued April 25, 1995-Decided May 30, 1995*
Respondents filed separate claims under the federal Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), which authorizes a civil enforcement action by aggrieved employees or their union against a covered employer who fails to give 60 days notice of a plant closing or
mass layoff, but provides no limitations period for such an action. In
rejecting petitioner employer's contention that the statute of limitations
had run, the District Court in Crown Cork held that the source of the
limitations period for WARN suits is state law and that respondent
union's suit was timely under any of the arguably applicable Pennsylvania statutes. In North Star, however, another District Court granted
summary judgment for petitioner employer, holding respondent employees' suit barred under a limitations period borrowed from the National
Labor Relations Act, which the court believed was "more analogous" to
WARN than any state law. The Third Circuit consolidated the cases
and held that a WARN limitations period should be borrowed from
state, not federal, law, reversing in North Star and affirming in Crown
Cork.
Held- State law is the proper source of the limitations period for civil
actions brought to enforce WARN. Pp. 33-37.
(a) Where a federal statute fails to provide any limitations period for
a new cause of action, this Court's longstanding and settled practice has
been to borrow the limitations period from the most closely analogous
state statute. A closely circumscribed and narrow exception to this
general rule allows borrowing from elsewhere in federal law when the
arguably relevant state limitations periods would frustrate or interfere
with the implementation of national policies or be at odds with the purpose or operation of federal substantive law. See, e. g., DelCostello v.
Teamsters,462 U. S. 151, 161, 172. Pp. 33-35.
(b) These cases fall squarely inside the general rule, not the exception. The presumption that state law will be the source of a missing

federal limitations period was already longstanding when WARN was
passed in 1988, justifying the assumption that Congress intended by its
silence that courts borrow state law. Agency Holding Corp. v. MalleyDuff& Associates, Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 147. Accordingly, since the complaints in both of these cases were timely even under the shortest of
the potentially-applicable Pennsylvania statutes of limitations, there is
no need to go beyond the Court of Appeals's decision to choose the best
of the four, and it is enough to say here that none of these statutes
would be at odds with WARN's purpose or operation, or frustrate or
interfere with the intent behind it. DelCostello, supra, at 166, distinguished. Although petitioners are right that the adoption of state limitations periods can result in variations from State to State and encourage forum shopping, these are just the costs of the general rule itself,
and nothing about WARN makes them exorbitant. Agency Holding
Corp., supra, at 149, 153-154, distinguished. Because a state counterpart provides a limitations period without frustrating consequences
here, it is simply beside the point that a perfectly good federal analogue
exists. Pp. 35-37.

delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
(WARN or Act), 102 Stat. 890, 29 U. S. C. § 2101 et seq.,
obliges covered employers to give employees or their union
60 days notice of a plant closing or mass layoff. These consolidated cases raise the issue of the proper source of the
limitations period for civil actions brought to enforce the Act.
For actions brought in Pennsylvania, and generally, we hold
it to be state law.
With some exceptions and conditions, WARN forbids an
employer of 100 or more employees to "order a plant closing
or mass layoff until the end of a 60-day period after the employer serves written notice of such an order." 29 U. S. C.
§2102(a). The employer is supposed to notify, among others,
"each affected employee" or "each representative
of the affected employees." 29 U. S. C. §2102(a)(1). An employer
who violates the notice provisions is liable for penalties by
way of a civil action that may be brought "in any district
court of the United States for any district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, or in which the employer
transacts business." § 2 104(a)(5). The class of plaintiffs
includes aggrieved employees (or their unions, as representatives), ibid., who may collect "back pay for each day of
violation," §2104(a)(1)(A), "up to a maximum of 60 days,"
§2104(a)(1). While the terms of the statute are specific on

other matters, WARN does not provide a limitations period
for the civil actions authorized by §2104.
In Crown Cork, respondent United Steelworkers of
America brought a WARN claim in Federal District Court
in Pennsylvania, charging Crown Cork & Seal Co., Inc., with
laying off 85 employees at its Perry, Georgia, plant in September 1991, without giving the required 60-day notice.
Crown Cork moved for summary judgment, claiming that the
statute of limitations had run. The District Court denied
the motion, holding the source of the limitations period for
WARN suits to be Pennsylvania state law and the union's
suit timely under any of the arguably applicable state statutes. 833 F. Supp. 467 (ED Pa. 1993). The District Court
nevertheless certified the question of the limitations period
for immediate interlocutory appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1292.
The North Star respondents are former, nonunion employees of petitioner North Star Steel Company who filed a
WARN claim against the company (also in a Federal District
Court in Pennsylvania) alleging that the company laid off 270
workers at a Pennsylvania plant without giving the 60-day
advance notice. Like Crown Cork, and for like reasons,
North Star also moved for summary judgment. But North
Star was successful, the District Court holding the suit
barred under the 6-month limitations period for unfair labor
practice claims borrowed from the National Labor Relations
Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. § 160(b), a statute believed by the court to be "more analogous" to WARN than
anything in state law. 838 F. Supp. 970, 974 (MD Pa. 1993).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
consolidated the cases and held that a period of limitations
for WARN should be borrowed from state, not federal, law,
reversing in North Star and affirming in Crown Cork. 32
F. 3d 53 (1994). Like the District Court in Crown Cork,
the Court of Appeals did not pick from among the several
Pennsylvania statutes of limitations that might apply to

Cite as: 515 U. S. 29 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

WARN, since none of them would have barred either of the
actions before it.
The Third Circuit's decision deepened a split among the
Courts of Appeals on the issue of WARN's limitations period.
See United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Specialty Paperboard, Inc., 999 F. 2d 51 (CA2 1993) (applying state-law limitations period); Halkias v. General Dynamics Corp., 31 F. 3d
224 (CA5) (applying NLRA limitations period), rehearing en
banc granted, 9 IER Cases 1754 (CA5 1994); United Mine
Workers of America v. Peabody Coal Co., 38 F. 3d 850 (CA6
1994) (same). We granted certiorari to resolve it, 513 U. S.
1072 (1995), and now affirm.
II
A
A look at this Court's docket in recent years will show how
often federal statutes fail to provide any limitations period
for the causes of action they create, leaving courts to borrow
a period, generally from state law, to limit these claims.
See, e. g., Reed v. TransportationUnion, 488 U. S. 319 (1989)
(claims under § 101(a)(2) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 522, 29 U. S. C.
§411(a)(2), governed by state personal injury statutes);
Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates,Inc., 483
U. S. 143 (1987) (civil actions under Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. § 1964, governed by 4-year statute of limitations of the Clayton Act, 69
Stat. 283, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 15b); Wilson v. Garcia,
471 U. S. 261 (1985) (civil rights claims under 42 U. S. C.
§ 1983 governed by state statutes of limitations for personal
injury actions); DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151 (1983)
(hybrid suit by employee against employer for breach of a
collective-bargaining agreement and against union for breach
of a duty of fair representation governed by NLRA limitations period). Although these examples show borrowing
from federal law as well as state, our practice has left no

NORTH STAR STEEL CO. v. THOMAS
Opinion of the Court

doubt about the lender of first resort. Since 1830, "state
statutes have repeatedly supplied the periods of limitations
for federal causes of action" when the federal legislation
made no provision, Automobile Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal
Corp., 383 U. S.696, 703-704 (1966), and in seeking the right
state rule to apply, courts look to the state statute "'most
closely analogous"' to the federal Act in need, Reed, supra,
at 323, quoting DelCostello, supra, at 158. Because this
penchant to borrow from analogous state law is not only
"longstanding," Agency Holding Corp., supra, at 147, but
"settled," Wilson, supra, at 266, "it is not only appropriate
but also realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly
familiar with [our] precedents . . .and that it expect[s] its
enactment[s] to be interpreted in conformity with them,"
Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S.677, 699 (1979).
See Agency Holding Corp., supra, at 147.*

be provided by analogous federal law, more in harmony with
the objectives of the immediate cause of action. See, e. g.,

153, 156; DelCostello, supra, at 171-172. But the reference
to federal law is the exception, and we decline to follow a
state limitations period "only 'when a rule from elsewhere
in federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes, and when the federal policies at stake
and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking."'
Reed, supra, at 324, quoting DelCostello, supra,at 172.
B
These cases fall squarely inside the rule, not the exception.
The presumption that state law will be the source of a missing federal limitations period was already "longstanding,"
Agency Holding Corp., 483 U. S., at 147, when WARN was
passed in 1988, justifying the assumption that Congress "intend[ed] by its silence that we borrow state law," ibid. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals identified four Pennsylvania
statutes of limitations that might apply to WARN claims: the
2-year period for enforcing civil penalties generally, Pa. Stat.
Ann., Tit. 42, § 5524(5) (Purdon 1981 and 1994 Supp.); the
3-year"period for claims under the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 43, §2 60.9a(g)
(Purdon 1992); the 4-year period for breach of an implied
contract, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 42, § 5525(4) (Purdon 1981); and
the six years under the residual statute of limitations, Pa.
Stat. Ann., Tit. 42, §5527 (Purdon 1981 and 1994 Supp.). See
32 F. 3d, at 61. Since the complaints in both Crown Cork
and North Star were timely even under the shortest of these,
there is no need to go beyond the decision of the Court of
Appeals to choose the best of four, and it is enough to say
here that none of these potentially applicable statutes would
be "at odds" with WARN's "purpose or operation," or "'frustrate or interfere with"' the intent behind it. DelCostello,
462 U. S., at 161.

29 U. S. C. §§2101(a)(2)-(3), and so, unlike RICO violations,
do not "commonly involve interstate transactions." Agency
Holding Corp., 483 U. S., at 153. WARN thus fails to share
the "multistate nature" of RICO, id., at 154, and is so relatively simple and narrow in its scope, see id., at 149 (listing
the many categories of crimes that can be predicate acts for
a RICO violation), that "no [comparable] practicalities of
litigation compel us to search beyond state law for a more
analogous statute of limitations," Reed, 488 U. S., at 327.
Since, then, a state counterpart provides a limitations period
without frustrating consequences, it is simply beside the
point that even a perfectly good federal analogue exists.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.
I remain of the view that when Congress has not prescribed a limitations period to govern a cause of action that
it has created, the Court should apply the appropriate state
statute of limitations, or, if doing so would frustrate the
purposes of the federal enactment, no limitations period at
all. See Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 157-170 (1987) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); see also Reed v. Transportation Union,
488 U. S. 319, 334 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).
The rule first announced in DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462
U. S. 151, 172 (1983), that a federal limitations period should
be selected when it presents a "closer analogy" to the federal
cause of action and is "significantly more appropriate," I find
to be not only erroneous but unworkable. If the "closer
analogy" part of this is to be taken seriously, the federal
statute would end up applying in some States but not in others; and the "significantly more appropriate" part is meaningless, since in all honesty a uniform nationwide limitations
period for a federal cause of action is always significantly
more appropriate.
