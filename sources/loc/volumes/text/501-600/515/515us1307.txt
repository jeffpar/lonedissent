Opinion in Chambers

RODRIGUEZ v. TEXAS
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE
OF DEATH
No. 95-5650 (A-202). Decided August 31, 1995
An application for a stay of execution pending disposition of a petition for
writ of certiorari seeking direct review of the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals' judgment is denied, without prejudice to its renewal at a later
date. There being no reason to believe that the certiorari petition will
not be disposed of well before the scheduled execution date, that date
is not likely to interfere with the petition's orderly processing. See
Cole v. Texas, 499 U. S. 1301.
JUSTICE SCALIA, Circuit Justice.

I have before me an application for a stay of execution
pending disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari to the
Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. Petitioner seeks direct
review of that court's judgment, entered May 17, 1995, affirming his conviction and death sentence. The petition was
timely filed on August 15, 1995, and petitioner's application
states that he is scheduled to be executed on November 8,
1995.
I have said that "I will.., in every capital case on direct
review, grant a stay of execution pending disposition by this
Court of the petition for certiorari." Cole v. Texas, 499 U. S.
1301 (1991). I have also made clear, however, that the purpose of such a stay is to prevent the execution date from
"interfer[ing] with the orderly processing of a petition on
direct review by this Court." Ibid. In the present case,
and at the present time, there is no reason to believe such
interference will occur. A petition for certiorari filed in this
Court on August 15 will ordinarily be disposed of well before
November 8.

RODRIGUEZ v. TEXAS
Opinion in Chambers

Staying the hand of state justice is no small matter, and
should not be considered when no need exists. Accordingly,
the application for stay is denied, without prejudice to its
renewal at a later date.
