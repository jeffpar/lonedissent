CITY OF MILWAUKEE v. CEMENT DIVISION,
NATIONAL GYPSUM CO., ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 94-788. Argued April 24, 1995-Decided June 12, 1995
After a ship owned by the Cement Division of National Gypsum Co.
and
insured by the other respondents sank in a winter storm while berthed
in a slip owned by petitioner Milwaukee (City), National Gypsum
brought this admiralty suit for damages, alleging that the City had
negligently breached its duty as a wharfinger. The City denied fault
and
filed a counterclaim for damage to its dock, alleging that National
Gypsum was negligent in leaving the ship virtually unmanned. During
the
course of the litigation, the District Court, inter alia,found that
both
parties were negligent and apportioned liability primarily to National
Gypsum; entered a partial judgment for the stipulated amount of
respondents' damages, excluding prejudgment interest; and denied
respondents' request for such interest, holding that the fact that National
Gypsum's loss was primarily attributable to its own negligence and
the
existence of a genuine dispute over the City's liability were special
circumstances justifying a departure from the general rule that prejudgment interest should be awarded in maritime collision cases.
The
Court of Appeals disagreed and reversed the latter ruling, holding,
among other things, that mutual fault cannot provide a basis for denying
prejudgment interest after this Court, in United States v. Reliable
Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397, announced a rule requiring that damages
be
assessed on the basis of proportionate fault when such an allocation
can
reasonably be made.
Held. Neither a good-faith dispute over liability nor the existence
of mutual fault justifies the denial of prejudgment interest in an admiralty
collision case. Throughout history, such cases have established a
general rule that prejudgment interest should be awarded, subject
to a
limited exception for "peculiar" or "exceptional" circumstances.
The
existence of a legitimate difference of opinion on the liability issue
is
not such a circumstance, but is merely a characteristic of most ordinary
lawsuits. Nor does the magnitude of the plaintiff's fault qualify
as a
"peculiar" feature. Although it might appear somewhat inequitable
to
award a large sum in prejudgment interest against a relatively innocent
party, any unfairness is illusory, because the relative fault of the parties

This is an admiralty case in which the plaintiff's loss was
primarily attributable to its own negligence. The question
presented is whether that fact, together with the existence of
a genuine dispute over liability, justified the District Court's
departure from the general rule that prejudgment interest
should be awarded in maritime collision cases.
JUSTICE STEVENS

I
Respondents are the owner and the insurers of the E. M.
Ford, a ship that sank in Milwaukee's outer harbor on Christmas Eve 1979. At the time of this disaster, the Ford was
berthed in a slip owned by the city of Milwaukee (City). In
the course of a severe storm, she broke loose from her moorings, battered against the headwall of the slip, took on water,
and sank. She was subsequently raised and repaired.
In 1980 the Ford's owner, the Cement Division of National
Gypsum Co. (National Gypsum), brought suit against the
City, invoking the District Court's admiralty and maritime

Opinion of the Court

jurisdiction.' The complaint alleged that the City had
breached its duty as a wharfinger by assigning the vessel to
a berthing slip known to be unsafe in heavy winds and by
failing to give adequate warning of hidden dangers in the
slip. The plaintiff sought damages of $4.5 million, later increased to $6.5 million. The City denied fault and filed a
$250,000 counterclaim for damage to its dock. The City alleged that National Gypsum was negligent in leaving the
ship virtually unmanned in winter, with no means aboard for
monitoring weather conditions or summoning help.
In 1986 the District Court conducted a 3-week trial on the
issue of liability. Finding that both National Gypsum and
the City had been negligent, the court determined that the
owner bore 96% of the responsibility for the disaster, while
the City bore 4% of the fault. Given the disparity in the
parties' damages, a final judgment giving effect to that allocation (and awarding the damages sought in the pleadings)
would have essentially left each party to bear its own losses.
Respondents took an interlocutory appeal from the District Court's ruling.2 The Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit agreed with the District Court's conclusion that both
parties were at fault, and that the owner's negligence was
"more egregious" than the City's, but it rejected the allocation of 96% of the responsibility to the owner as clearly erroneous. Cement Div., National Gypsum Co. v. Milwaukee,

than the exception in cases brought under a district court's

Gypsum] (who were planning to leave the FORD unmanned during the Christmas holidays) that a winter
storm could create conditions in the outer harbor at Milwaukee which could damage the ship. The trial court
and the court of appeals both found mutual fault for the
damage which ensued to the ship and to the [City's]
dock. The court of appeals ascribed two-thirds of the
negligence to [National Gypsum]. Thus, in this situation the court concludes that [National Gypsum's] contributory negligence was of such magnitude that an
award of prejudgment interest would be inequitable."
Id., at 22a.5
The Court of Appeals reversed. 31 F. 3d 581 (1994). It
noted that prior to this Court's announcement of the comparative fault rule in United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421
U. S. 397 (1975), some courts had denied prejudgment interest in order to mitigate the harsh effects of the earlier rule
commanding an equal division of damages whenever a collision resulted from the fault of both parties, even though one
party was only slightly negligent. In the court's view, however, after the divided damages rule was "thrown overboard" and replaced with comparative fault, mutual fault
could no longer provide a basis for denying prejudgment interest. 31 F. 3d, at 584-585. The Court of Appeals also
read our decision in West Virginia v. United States, 479 U. S.
305, 311, n. 3 (1987), as disapproving of a "balancing of the
equities" as a method of deciding whether to allow prejudgment interest. 31 F. 3d, at 585.
The Court of Appeals' decision deepened an existing Circuit split regarding the criteria for denying prejudgment interest in maritime collision cases. Compare, e. g., Inland

not pursue the argument in this Court.

Although Congress has enacted a statute governing the
award of postjudgment interest in federal court litigation,
see 28 U. S. C. § 1961, there is no comparable legislation regarding prejudgment interest. Far from indicating a legislative determination that prejudgment interest should not
be awarded, however, the absence of a statute merely indicates that the question is governed by traditional judgemade principles. Monessen Southwestern R. Co. v. Morgan,
486 U. S. 330, 336-337 (1988); Rodgers v. United States, 332
U. S. 371, 373 (1947). Those principles are well developed in
admiralty, where "the Judiciary has traditionally taken the
lead in formulating flexible and fair remedies." Reliable
Transfer,421 U. S., at 409.
Throughout our history, admiralty decrees have included
provisions for prejudgment interest. In Del Col v. Arnold,
3 Dall. 333, a prize case decided in 1796, we affirmed a decree
awarding the libellant interest from "the day of capture."
Id., at 334. In The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat. 546 (1818),
we considered a similar decree. In augmenting the damages
awarded by the lower court, we directed that the additional
funds should bear prejudgment interest, as had the damages
already awarded by the lower court. Id., at 562-563. The
Amiable Nancy arose out of the "gross and wanton" seizure
of a Haitian vessel near the island of Antigua by the Scourge,
an American privateer. Id., at 546-547, 558. In his opinion
for the Court, Justice Story explained that even though the
"loss of the supposed profits" of the Amiable Nancy's voyage
was not recoverable, "the prime cost, or value of the prop-

erty lost, at the time of the loss, and in case of injury,
the
diminution in value, by reason of the injury, with interest
upon such valuation, afforded the true measure for assessing damages." Id., at 560 (emphasis added). We applied
the same rule in The Umbria, 166 U. S. 404, 421 (1897),
explaining that "in cases of total loss by collision damages
are
limited to the value of the vessel, with interest thereon,
and
the net freight pending at the time of the collision."
(Em6
phasis added.)
The Courts of Appeals have consistently and correctly construed decisions such as these as establishing a general
rule
that prejudgment interest should be awarded in maritime
collision cases, subject to a limited exception for "peculiar"
or "exceptional" circumstances. See, e. g., Inland Oil
&
Transport Co., 696 F. 2d, at 327; Central Rivers Towing,
Inc.
v. Beardstown,750 F. 2d 565, 574 (CA7 1984); Ohio River
Co.
v. Peavey Co., 731 F. 2d 547, 549 (CA8 1984); Alkmeon
Naviera, 633 F. 2d, at 797; Parker Towing Co. v. Yazoo River
Towing, Inc., 794 F. 2d 591, 594 (CAll 1986).
The essential rationale for awarding prejudgment interest
is to ensure that an injured party is fully compensated
for
its loss.7 Full compensation has long been recognized
as a

(1817) (Marshall, C. J.)
(remanding with instructions to ascertain damages suffered
by the libellants, "in doing which, the value of the vessel, and the prime

The Manitoba,
122 U. S. 97, 101 (1887) (approving, in dicta, allowance of

7We have recognized the compensatory
nature of prejudgment interest
in a number of cases decided outside the admiralty context.

over its liability for respondents' loss. In our view, however, this fact carries little weight. If interest were
awarded as a penalty for bad-faith conduct of the litigation,
the City's argument would be well taken. But prejudgment
interest is not awarded as a penalty; it is merely an element
of just compensation.
The City's "good-faith" argument has some resonance with
the venerable common-law rule that prejudgment interest
is not awarded on unliquidated claims (those where the precise amount of damages at issue cannot be computed). If a
party contests liability in good faith, it will usually be the
case that the party's ultimate exposure is uncertain. But
the liquidated/unliquidated distinction has faced trenchant
criticism for a number of years. 9 Moreover, that distinction
"has never become so firmly entrenched in admiralty as it
has been at law." Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. Richardson, 295 F. 2d 583, 592 (CA2 1961).1o Any fixed rule
allowing prejudgment interest only on liquidated claims
would be difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with admiralty's traditional presumption. Yet unless we were willing
to adopt such a rule-which we are not-uncertainty about
the outcome of a case should not preclude an award of
interest.

198 MILWAUKEE v. CEMENT DIV., NATIONAL GYPSUM CO.
Opinion of the Court

In sum, the existence of a legitimate difference of opinion
on the issue of liability is merely a characteristic of most
ordinary lawsuits. It is not an extraordinary circumstance
that can justify denying prejudgment interest. See Alkmeon Naviera, 633 F. 2d, at 798.
The second purportedly "peculiar" feature of this case is
the magnitude of the plaintiff's fault. Leaving aside the empirical question whether such a division of fault is in fact an
aberration, it is true in this case that the owner of the E. M.
Ford was primarily responsible for the vessel's loss. As a
result, it might appear somewhat inequitable to award a
large sum in prejudgment interest against a relatively innocent party. But any unfairness is illusory, because the relative fault of the parties has already been taken into consideration in calculating the amount of the loss for which the City
is responsible.
In United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397
(1975), we "replaced the divided damages rule, which required an equal division of property damage whatever the
relative degree of fault may have been, with a rule requiring
that damages be assessed on the basis of proportionate fault
when such an allocation can reasonably be made." McDermott, Inc. v. AmClyde, 511 U. S. 202, 207 (1994). Thus, in
this case, before prejudgment interest even entered the picture, the total amount of respondents' recovery had already
been reduced by two-thirds because of National Gypsums
own negligence. The City's responsibility for the remaining
one-third is no different than if it had performed the same
negligent acts and the owner, instead of also being negligent,
had engaged in heroic maneuvers that avoided two-thirds of
the damages. The City is merely required to compensate
1
the owner for the loss for which the City is responsible. '
'Indeed, although the amount is relatively small in this case, the City's

counterclaim was resolved under the same principle. Notwithstanding

Opinion of the Court

In light of Reliable Transfer, we are unmoved by the
City's contention that an award of prejudgment interest is
inequitable in a mutual fault situation. Indeed, the converse
is true: a denial of prejudgment interest would be unfair.
As JUSTICE KENNEDY noted while he was sitting on the
Ninth Circuit, "under any rule allowing apportionment of liability, denying prejudgment interest on the basis of mutual
fault would seem to penalize a party twice for the same mistake." Alkmeon Naviera, 633 F. 2d, at 798, n. 12. Such a
double penalty is commended neither by logic nor by fairness; the rule giving rise to it is a relic of history that
has ceased to serve any purpose in the wake of Reliable
Transfer.
Accordingly, we hold that neither a good-faith dispute over
liability nor the existence of mutual fault justifies the denial
of prejudgment interest in an admiralty collision case. Questions related to the calculation of the prejudgment interest
award, including the rate to be applied, have not been raised
in this Court and remain open for consideration, in the first
instance, by the District Court.
