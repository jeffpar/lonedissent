WILTON ET AL. V. SEVEN FALLS CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 94-562. Argued March 27, 1995-Decided June 12, 1995
Petitioner underwriters refused to defend or indemnify respondents under
several commercial liability insurance policies in litigation between respondents and other parties over the ownership and operation of certain
Texas oil and gas properties. After a verdict was entered against respondents and they notified petitioners that they intended to file a state
court suit on the policies, petitioners sought a declaratory judgment
in federal court that their policies did not cover respondents' liability.
Respondents filed their state court suit and moved to dismiss or, in the
alternative, to stay petitioners' action. The District Court entered a
stay on the ground that the state suit encompassed the same coverage
issues raised in the federal action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Noting that a district court has broad discretion to grant or decline to
grant declaratory judgment, the court did not require application of the
test articulated in ColoradoRiver Water ConservationDist. v. United
States, 424 U. S. 800, and Moses H. Cone MemorialHospitalv. Mercury
Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, under which district courts must point to
"exceptional circumstances" to justify staying or dismissing federal proceedings. The court reviewed the District Court's decision for abuse
of discretion, and found none.
Held
1. The discretionary standard of Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of
America, 316 U. S. 491, governs a district court's decision to stay a declaratory judgment action during the pendency of parallel state court
proceedings. Pp. 282-288.
(a) In addressing circumstances virtually identical to those present
here, the Court in Brillhart made clear that district courts possess discretion in determining whether and when to entertain an action under
the Declaratory Judgment Act (Act), even when the suit otherwise satisfies subject matter jurisdiction. While Brillhartdid not set out an exclusive list of factors governing the exercise of this discretion, it did
provide some guidance, indicating that, at least where another suit involving the same parties and presenting opportunity for ventilation of
the same state law issues is pending in state court, a district court might
be indulging in gratuitous interference if it permitted the federal declaratory action to proceed. Pp. 282-283.

Syllabus
(b) The Act's distinct features justify a standard vesting district
courts with greater discretion in declaratory judgment actions than that
permitted under the "exceptional circumstances" test set forth in Colorado River and Moses H. Cone, neither of which dealt with declaratory
judgments. On its face, the Act makes a textual commitment to discretion by specifying that a court "may" declare litigants' rights, 28 U. S. C.
ยง2201(a) (emphasis added), and it has repeatedly been characterized as
an enabling Act, which confers a discretion on the courts rather than an
absolute right upon the litigant. Pp. 283-287.
(c) Petitioners' argument that, despite the unique breadth of this
discretion, district courts lack discretion to decline to hear a declaratory
judgment suit at the outset depends on the untenable proposition that
a court, knowing at the litigation's commencement that it will exercise
its discretion to decline declaratory relief, must nonetheless go through
the futile exercise of hearing a case on the merits first. Nothing in the
Act recommends this reading, and the Court is unwilling to impute to
Congress an intention to require such a wasteful expenditure of judicial
resources. Pp. 287-288.
2. District courts' decisions about the propriety of hearing declaratory judgment actions should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, not
de nova. It is more consistent with the Act to vest district courts with
discretion in the first instance, because facts bearing on the declaratory
judgment remedy's usefulness, and the case's fitness for resolution, are
particularly within their grasp. Proper application of the abuse of discretion standard on appeal can provide appropriate guidance to district
courts. Pp. 288-289.
3. The District Court acted within its bounds in staying the declaratory relief action in this case, since parallel proceedings, presenting opportunity for ventilation of the same state law issues, were underway
in state court. Pp. 289-290.
41 F. 3d 934, affirmed.

delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case asks whether the discretionary standard set
forth in Brilihartv. Excess Ins. Co. of America, 316 U. S.
491 (1942), or the "exceptional circumstances" test developed
in Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States, 424 U. S. 800 (1976), and Moses H. Cone Memorial
Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1 (1983), governs a district court's decision to stay a declaratory judgment action during the pendency of parallel state court proceedings, and under what standard of review a court of
appeals should evaluate the district court's decision to do so.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR

I
In early 1992, a dispute between respondents (the Hill
Group) and other parties over the ownership and operation
of oil and gas properties in Winkler County, Texas, appeared
likely to culminate in litigation. The Hill Group asked petitioners (London Underwriters) ' to provide them with cover-age under several commercial liability insurance policies.
London Underwriters refused to defend or indemnify the
Hill Group in a letter dated July 31, 1992. In September
1992, after a 3-week trial, a Winkler County jury entered a
verdict in excess of $100 million against the Hill Group on
various state law claims.
The Hill Group gave London Underwriters notice of the
verdict in late November 1992. On December 9, 1992, Lon*LauraA Foggan, Daniel E. Troy, and Thomas W. Brunner filed a
brief for the Insurance Environmental Litigation Association as amicus
curiaeurging reversal.
Edward F LeBreton III filed a brief for the Maritime Law Association
as amicus curiae.
I For the sake of clarity, we adopt the Court of Appeals' manner of referencing the parties.

WILTON v. SEVEN FALLS CO.
Opinion of the Court

don Underwriters filed suit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Texas, basing jurisdiction
upon diversity of citizenship under 28 U. S. C. ยง 1332. London Underwriters sought a declaration under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U. S. C. ยง2201(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V),
that their policies did not cover the Hill Group's liability for
the Winkler County judgment. After negotiations with the
Hill Group's counsel, London Underwriters voluntarily dismissed the action on January 22, 1993. London Underwriters did so, however, upon the express condition that the Hill
Group give London Underwriters two weeks' notice if they
decided to bring suit on the policy.
On February 23, 1993, the Hill Group notified London Underwriters of their intention to fie such a suit in Travis
County, Texas. London Underwriters reified their declaratory judgment action in the Southern District of Texas on
February 24, 1993. As promised, the Hill Group initiated an
action against London Underwriters on March 26, 1993, in
state court in Travis County. The Hill Group's codefendants
in the Winkler County litigation joined in this suit and asserted claims against certain Texas insurers, thus rendering
the parties nondiverse and the suit nonremovable.
On the same day that the Hill Group filed their Travis
County action, they moved to dismiss or, in the alternative,
to stay London Underwriters' federal declaratory judgment
action. After receiving submissions from the parties on the
issue, the District Court entered a stay on June 30, 1993.
The District Court observed that the state lawsuit pending
in Travis County encompassed the same coverage issues
raised in the declaratory judgment action and determined
that a stay was warranted in order to avoid piecemeal litigation and to bar London Underwriters' attempts at forum
shopping. London Underwriters filed a timely appeal. See
Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, supra, at 10 (a district
court's order staying federal proceedings in favor of pending

Opinion of the Court

state litigation is a "final decisio[n]" appealable under 28
U. S. C. ยง 1291).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
affirmed. 41 F. 3d 934 (1994). Noting that under Circuit
precedent, "[a] district court has broad discretion to grant
(or decline to grant) declaratory judgment," id., at 935, citing
Torch, Inc. v. LeBlanc, 947 F. 2d 193, 194 (CA5 1991), the
Court of Appeals did not require application of the test articulated in Colorado River, supra, and Moses H. Cone, supra,
under which district courts must point to "exceptional circumstances" to justify staying or dismissing federal proceedings. Citing the interests in avoiding duplicative proceedings and forum shopping, the Court of Appeals reviewed the
District Court's decision for abuse of discretion, and found
none. 41 F. 3d, at 935.
We granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 1013 (1994), to resolve Circuit conflicts concerning the standard governing a district
court's decision to stay a declaratory judgment action in
favor of parallel state litigation, compare, e. g., Employers
Ins. of Wausau v. MissouriElec. Works, 23 F. 3d 1372, 1374,
n. 3 (CA8 1994) (pursuant to Colorado River and Moses H.
Cone, a district court may not stay or dismiss a declaratory
judgment action absent "exceptional circumstances"); Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. v. Connecticut Bank & Trust,
806 F. 2d 411, 413 (CA2 1986) (same), with Travelers Ins. Co.
v. Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation,Inc., 996 F. 2d 774,
778, n. 12 (CA5 1993) (the "exceptional circumstances" test
of Colorado River and Moses H. Cone is inapplicable in declaratory judgment actions); Mitcheson v. Harris,955 F. 2d
235, 237-238 (CA4 1992) (same), and the applicable standard
for an appellate court's review of a district court's decision
to stay a declaratory judgment action, compare, e. g., United
States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc.,
21 F. 3d 259, 263, n. 5 (CA8 1994) (reviewing for abuse of
discretion); ChristopherP. v. Marcus, 915 F. 2d 794,802 (CA2
1990) (same), with Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 998

(same). We now affirm.
II
Over 50 years ago, in Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of
America, 316 U. S. 491 (1942), this Court addressed circumstances virtually identical to those present in the case before
us today. An insurer, anticipating a coercive suit, sought a
declaration in federal court of nonliability on an insurance
policy. The District Court dismissed the action in favor of
pending state garnishment proceedings, to which the insurer
had been added as a defendant. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding an abuse of discretion, and ordered the District Court to proceed to the merits. Reversing the Court
of Appeals and remanding to the District Court, this Court
held that, "[a]lthough the District Court had jurisdiction of
the suit under the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act, it
was under no compulsion to exercise that jurisdiction." Id.,
at 494. The Court explained that "[o]rdinarily it would be
uneconomical as well as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory judgment suit where another suit is
pending in a state court presenting the same issues, not governed by federal law, between the same parties." Id., at
495. The question for a district court presented with a suit
under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the Court found, is
"whether the questions in controversy between the parties
to the federal suit, and which are not foreclosed under the
applicable substantive law, can better be settled in the proceeding pending in the state court." Ibid.
Brillhart makes clear that district courts possess discretion in determining whether and when to entertain an action
under the Declaratory Judgment Act, even when the suit
otherwise satisfies subject matter jurisdictional prerequisites. Although Brillhartdid not set out an exclusive list of
factors governing the district court's exercise of this discretion, it did provide some useful guidance in that regard.

Cite as: 515 U. S. 277 (1995)

Opinion of the Court

The Court indicated, for example, that in deciding whether
to enter a stay, a district court should examine "the scope of
the pending state court proceeding and the nature of defenses open there." Ibid. This inquiry, in turn, entails consideration of "whether the claims of all parties in interest
can satisfactorily be adjudicated in that proceeding, whether
necessary parties have been joined, whether such parties are
amenable to process in that proceeding, etc." Ibid. Other
cases, the Court noted, might shed light on additional factors
governing a district court's decision to stay or to dismiss a
declaratory judgment action at the outset. See ibid. But
Brillhart indicated that, at least where another suit involving the same parties and presenting opportunity for ventilation of the same state law issues is pending in state court, a
district court might be indulging in "[g]ratuitous interference," ibid., if it permitted the federal declaratory action to
proceed.
Brillhart, without more, clearly supports the District
Court's decision in this case. (That the court here stayed,
rather than dismissed, the action is of little moment in this
regard, because the state court's decision will bind the parties under principles of res judicata.) Nonetheless, London
Underwriters argue, and several Courts of Appeals have
agreed, that intervening case law has supplanted Brillhart's
notions of broad discretion with a test under which district
courts may stay or dismiss actions properly within their
jurisdiction only in "exceptional circumstances." In London
Underwriters' view, recent cases have established that a district court must point to a compelling reason-which, they
say, is lacking here-in order to stay a declaratory judgment
action in favor of pending state proceedings. To evaluate
this argument, it is necessary to examine three cases handed
down several decades after Brillhart.
In Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States, 424 U. S. 800 (1976), the Government brought an action in Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C. ยง 1345 seek-

WILTON v. SEVEN FALLS CO.
Opinion of the Court

ing a declaration of its water rights, the appointment of a
water master, and an order enjoining all uses and diversions
of water by other parties. See Pet. for Cert. in Colorado
River Water ConservationDist. v. United States, 0. T. 1974,
No. 74-940, pp. 39a-40a. The District Court dismissed the
action in deference to ongoing state proceedings. The
Court of Appeals reversed, 504 F. 2d 115 (CA10 1974), on
the ground that the District Court had jurisdiction over the
Government's suit and that abstention was inappropriate.
This Court reversed again. Without discussing Brillhart,
the Court began with the premise that federal courts have a
"virtually unflagging obligation" to exercise the jurisdiction
conferred on them by Congress. Colorado River, supra, at
813, 817-818, citing Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404
(1821). The Court determined, however, that a district
court could nonetheless abstain from the assumption of jurisdiction over a suit in "exceptional" circumstances, and it
found such exceptional circumstances on the facts of the case.
424 U. S., at 818-820. Specifically, the Court deemed dispositive a clear federal policy against piecemeal adjudication of
water rights; the existence of an elaborate state scheme for
resolution of such claims; the absence of any proceedings in
the District Court, other than the filing of the complaint,
prior to the motion to dismiss; the extensive nature of the
suit; the 300-mile distance between the District Court and
the situs of the water district at issue; and the prior participation of the Federal Government in related state
proceedings.
Two years after Colorado River we decided Will v. Calvert Fire Ins. Co., 437 U. S. 655 (1978), in which a plurality
of the Court stated that, while "'the pendency of an action
in the state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the
same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction,"' id.,
at 662, quoting McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268, 282
(1910), a district court is "'under no compulsion to exercise
that jurisdiction,"' 437 U. S., at 662, quoting Brilihart,316

Cite as: 515 U. S. 277 (1995)
Opinion of the Court

U. S., at 494. Will concerned an action seeking damages for

an alleged violation of federal securities laws brought in federal court during the pendency of related state proceedings.
Although the case arose outside the declaratory judgment
context, the plurality invoked Brillhart as the appropriate
authority. Colorado River, according to the plurality, "in no
way undermine[d] the conclusion of Brillhart that the decision whether to defer to the concurrent jurisdiction of a state
court is, in the last analysis, a matter committed to the
district court's discretion." Will, supra, at 664. Justice
Blackmun, concurring in the judgment, criticized the plurality for not recognizing that Colorado River had undercut the
"sweeping language" of Brillhart. 437 U. S., at 667. Four
Justices in dissent urged that the Colorado River "exceptional circumstances" test supplied the governing standard.
The plurality's suggestion in Will that Brillhart might
have application beyond the context of declaratory judgments was rejected by the Court in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1 (1983).
In Moses H. Cone, the Court established that the Colorado
River "exceptional circumstances" test, rather than the more
permissive Brillhartanalysis, governs a district court's decision to stay a suit to compel arbitration under ยง 4 of the Arbitration Act in favor of pending state litigation. Noting that
the combination of Justice Blackmun and the four dissenting
Justices in Will had made five to require application of Colorado River, the Court rejected the argument that Will had
worked any substantive changes in the law. "'Abdication of
the obligation to decide cases,"' the Court reasoned, "'can
be justified ...

only in the exceptional circumstance where

the order to the parties to repair to the State court would
clearly serve an important countervailing interest."' 460
U. S., at 14, quoting Colorado River, supra, at 813. As it
had in Colorado River, the Court articulated nonexclusive
factors relevant to the existence of such exceptional circumstances, including the assumption by either court of jurisdic-

WILTON v. SEVEN FALLS CO.
Opinion of the Court

tion over a res, the relative convenience of the fora, avoidance of piecemeal litigation, the order in which jurisdiction
was obtained by the concurrent fora, whether and to what
extent federal law provides the rules of decision on the merits, and the adequacy of state proceedings. Evaluating each
of these factors, the Court concluded that the District
Court's stay of federal proceedings was, under the circumstances, inappropriate.
Relying on these post-Brillhart developments, London
Underwriters contend that the Brilihart regime, under
which district courts have substantial latitude in deciding
whether to stay or to dismiss a declaratory judgment suit
in light of pending state proceedings (and need not point to
"exceptional circumstances" to justify their actions), is an
outmoded relic of another era. We disagree. Neither Colorado River, which upheld the dismissal of federal proceedings, nor Moses H. Cone, which did not, dealt with actions
brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U. S. C.
ยง2201(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V). Distinct features of the Declaratory Judgment Act, we believe, justify a standard vesting district courts with greater discretion in declaratory
judgment actions than that permitted under the "exceptional
circumstances" test of Colorado River and Moses H. Cone.
No subsequent case, in our view, has called into question the
application of the Brillhart standard to the Brilihartfacts.
Since its inception, the Declaratory Judgment Act has
been understood to confer on federal courts unique and substantial discretion in deciding whether to declare the rights
of litigants. On its face, the statute provides that a court
"may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration," 28 U. S. C. ยง2201(a)
(1988 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See generally E.
Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 312-314 (2d ed. 1941);
Borchard, Discretion to Refuse Jurisdiction of Actions for
Declaratory Judgments, 26 Minn. L. Rev. 677 (1942). The
statute's textual commitment to discretion, and the breadth

Cite as: 515 U. S. 277 (1995)

Opinion of the Court

of leeway we have always understood it to suggest, distinguish the declaratory judgment context from other areas of
the law in which concepts of discretion surface. See generally Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60 N. Y. U. L. Rev.
543 (1985); cf. 0. Fiss & D. Rendleman, Injunctions 106-108
(2d ed. 1984) (describing courts' nonstatutory discretion,
through application of open-ended substantive standards like
"irreparable injury," in the injunction context). We have repeatedly characterized the Declaratory Judgment Act as "an
enabling Act, which confers a discretion on the courts rather
than an absolute right upon the litigant." Public Serv.
Comm'n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U. S. 237, 241 (1952); see
also Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 72 (1985); Cardinal
Chemical Co. v. Morton Int'l, Inc., 508 U. S. 83, 95, n. 17
(1993). When all is said and done, we have concluded, "the
propriety of declaratory relief in a particular case will depend upon a circumspect sense of its fitness informed by the
teachings and experience concerning the functions and extent of federal judicial power." Wycoff, supra, at 243.
Acknowledging, as they must, the unique breadth of this
discretion to decline to enter a declaratory judgment, London Underwriters nonetheless contend that, after Colorado
River and Moses H. Cone, district courts lack discretion to
decline to hear a declaratory judgment suit at the outset.
See Brief for Petitioners 22 ("District courts must hear declaratory judgment cases absent exceptional circumstances;
district courts may decline to enter the requested relief
following a full trial on the merits, if no beneficial purpose
is thereby served or if equity otherwise counsels"). We are
not persuaded by this distinction. London Underwriters'
argument depends on the untenable proposition that a district court, knowing at the commencement of litigation that
it will exercise its broad statutory discretion to decline declaratory relief, must nonetheless go through the futile exercise of hearing a case on the merits first. Nothing in the
language of the Declaratory Judgment Act recommends Lon-

WILTON v. SEVEN FALLS CO.
Opinion of the Court

don Underwriters' reading, and we are unwilling to impute
to Congress an intention to require such a wasteful expenditure of judicial resources. If a district court, in the sound
exercise of its judgment, determines after a complaint is filed
that a declaratory judgment will serve no useful purpose, it
cannot be incumbent upon that court to proceed to the merits
before staying or dismissing the action.
We agree, for all practical purposes, with Professor Borchard, who observed half a century ago that "[t]here is ...
nothing automatic or obligatory about the assumption of 'jurisdiction' by a federal court" to hear a declaratory judgment
action. Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, at 313. By the
Declaratory Judgment Act, Congress sought to place a remedial arrow in the district court's quiver; it created an opportunity, rather than a duty, to grant a new form of relief to
qualifying litigants. Consistent with the nonobligatory nature of the remedy, a district court is authorized, in the
sound exercise of its discretion, to stay or to dismiss an action seeking a declaratory judgment before trial or after all
2
arguments have drawn to a close. In the declaratory judgment context, the normal principle that federal courts should
adjudicate claims within their jurisdiction yields to considerations of practicality and wise judicial administration.
III
As Judge Friendly observed, the Declaratory Judgment
Act "does not speak," on its face, to the question whether
discretion to entertain declaratory judgment actions is
vested in district courts alone or in the entire judicial system. Friendly, Indiscretion about Discretion, 31 Emory L.
2

We note that where the basis for declining to proceed is the pendency
of a state proceeding, a stay will often be the preferable course, because
it assures that the federal action can proceed without risk of a time bar if
the state case, for any reason, fails to resolve the matter in controversy.
See, e. g., P. Bator, D.Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1451, n. 9 (3d ed. 1988).

Cite as: 515 U. S. 277 (1995)

Opinion of the Court

J. 747, 778 (1982). The Court of Appeals reviewed the District Court's decision to stay London Underwriters' action
for abuse of discretion, and found none. London Underwriters urge us to follow those other Courts of Appeals that review decisions to grant (or to refrain from granting) declaratory relief de novo. See, e. g., Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly &
Co., 998 F. 2d, at 936; Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Holbrook, 867
F. 2d, at 1333. We decline this invitation. We believe it
more consistent with the statute to-vest district courts with
discretion in the first instance, because facts bearing on the
usefulness of the declaratory judgment remedy, and the fitness of the case for resolution, are peculiarly within their
grasp. Cf. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514
U. S. 938, 948 (1995) ("[T]he reviewing attitude that a court
of appeals takes toward a district court decision should depend upon 'the respective institutional advantages of trial
and appellate courts'") (citation omitted); Miller v. Fenton,
474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985) ("[T]he fact/law distinction at times
has turned on a determination that, as a matter of the sound
administration of justice, one judicial, actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question"). While
it may be true that sound administration of the Declaratory
Judgment Act calls for the exercise of "judicial discretion,
hardened by experience into rule," Borchard, Declaratory
Judgments, at 293, proper application of the abuse of discretion standard on appellate review can, we think, provide appropriate guidance to district courts. In this regard, we reject London Underwriters' suggestion, Brief for Petitioners
14, that review for abuse of discretion "is tantamount to no
review" at all.
IV
In sum, we conclude that Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of
America, 316 U. S. 491 (1942), governs this declaratory judgment action and that district courts' decisions about the propriety of hearing declaratory judgment actions, which are
necessarily bound up with their decisions about the propri-

290

Opinion of the Court

ety of granting declaratory relief, should be reviewed for
abuse of discretion. We do not attempt at this time to delineate the outer boundaries of that discretion in other cases,
for example, cases raising issues of federal law or cases in
which there are no parallel state proceedings. Like the
Court of Appeals, we conclude only that the District Court
acted within its bounds in staying this action for declaratory
relief where parallel proceedings, presenting opportunity for
ventilation of the same state law issues, were underway in
state court. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit is
