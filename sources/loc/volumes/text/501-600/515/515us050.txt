RENO, ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL. v. KORAY
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 94-790. Argued April 24, 1995-Decided June 5, 1995
Under 18 U. S. C. §3585(b), a defendant generally must "be given credit
toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent
in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences." Before
respondent's federal sentence commenced, he was "released" on bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984 and ordered confined to a community treatment center. After his prison sentence began, the Bureau of
Prisons (BOP) relied on its established policy in refusing to credit toward his sentence the time he had spent at the treatment center. He
exhausted his administrative remedies and then filed a federal habeas
corpus petition. A District Court denied his petition on the ground
that his stay at the center was not "official detention" under §3585(b).
In reversing, the Court of Appeals declined to defer to BOP's view that
time spent under highly restrictive conditions while "released" on bail
is not "official detention" because a "released" defendant is not subject
to BOP's control. It reasoned instead that "official detention" includes
time spent under conditions of "jail-type confinement."
Held. The time respondent spent at the treatment center while "released"
on bail was not "official detention" within the meaning of §3585(b).
Pp. 55-65.
(a) Viewed in isolation, the phrase "official detention" could either
refer, as the Government contends, to a court order detaining a defendant and comnmitting him to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement, or, as respondent argues, to the restrictive conditions of his
release on bail under an "official" order that significantly curtailed his
liberty. Examination of the phrase in light of the context in which it is
used, however, reveals that the Government's interpretation is correct.
P. 56.
(b) The "official detention" language must be construed in conjunction
with the Bail Reform Act of 1984, since §3585(b) provides credit only
for presentence restraints on liberty and since it is the Bail Reform Act
that authorizes federal courts to place such restraints on a defendant's
liberty. That Act provides a court with only two choices: It may either
"release" a defendant on bail, 18 U. S. C. §3142(c), or order him "detained" without bail, §3142(e). A defendant suffers "detention" only
when committed to the Attorney General's custody, §3142(i)(2); a de-

Syllabus
fendant admitted to bail, even on restrictive conditions, as respondent
was, see §3142(c), is "released." Pp. 56-58.
(c) Section 3585(a) and related sentencing provisions confirm the view
that § 3585(b) is available only to those defendants who were detained
in a penal or correctional facility and subject to BOP's control. The
context and history of §3585(b) also support this reading. The provision reduces a defendant's "imprisonment" by the amount of time spent
in "official detention" before his sentence, strongly suggesting that the
presentence "detention" period must be equivalent to the "imprisonment" itself. And nothing suggests that when Congress replaced §3568
with § 3585(b), it substituted the phrase "official detention" for "in custody" because it disagreed with the Courts of Appeals' uniform rule that
§3568 denied credit to defendants released on bail. To the contrary,
Congress presumably made the change to conform the credit statute to
the nomenclature used in related sentencing provisions and in the Bail
Reform Act of 1984. Pp. 58-60.
(d) In an internal guideline, BOP likewise has interpreted the phrase
"official detention" to require credit only for a defendant's time
spent
under a §3142 "detention order." This is the most natural reading of
the phrase, and the internal guideline of the agency charged with administering the credit statute is entitled to some deference where it is a
permissible construction of the statute. Pp. 60-61.
(e) In contrast, respondent's reading of "official detention" is plausible
only if the phrase is read in isolation. But even then, it is not the only
plausible interpretation. Respondent correctly notes that a defendant
"released" to a treatment center could be subject to restraints that do
not materially differ from those imposed on a "detained" defendant who
is assigned to a treatment center as part of his sentence. However, that
fact does not undercut the important distinction between all defendants
"detained" and all defendants "released" on bail: The former always
remain completely subject to BOP's control. The Court of Appeals' alternative construction would require a fact-intensive inquiry into the
circumstances of confinement in each case to determine whether a defendant "released" on bail was subjected to "jail-type confinement." On
the other hand, the Government's construction provides both it and a
defendant with clear notice of the consequences of a "release" or "detention" order. Finally, the rule of lenity does not apply here. A statute
is not "ambiguous" for purposes of the rule merely because there is a
division of judicial authority over its proper construction. Rather, the
rule applies only if, after seizing everything from which aid can be derived, this Court can make no more than a guess as to what Congress
intended. That is not this case. Pp. 61-65.
21 F. 3d 558, reversed and remanded.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Title 18 U. S. C. §3585(b) provides that a defendant generally must "be given credit toward the service of a term of
imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention
prior to the date the sentence commences." Before the
commencement of respondents federal sentence, a Federal
Magistrate Judge "released" him on bail pursuant to the Bail
Reform Act of 1984 and ordered him confined to a community
treatment center. The question presented is whether respondent was in "official detention," and thus entitled to a
sentence credit under §3585(b), during the time he spent at
the treatment center. We hold that he was not.
On April 23, 1991, respondent Ziya Koray was arrested for
laundering monetary instruments in violation of 18 U. S. C.
§ 1956(a)(1). On June 18, 1991, he pleaded guilty to that
charge in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland. One week later, on June 25, 1991, a Federal
Magistrate Judge entered a "release order" pursuant to 18
U. S. C. §3142(c), ordering respondent released on bail, pending sentencing, into the custody of the Pretrial Services

Opinion of the Court

Agency. The order required that he be "confined to [the]
premises" of a Volunteers of America community treatment
center without "authoriz[ation] to leave for any reason unless
accompanied" by a Government special agent. On October
22, 1991, the District Court sentenced respondent to 41
months' imprisonment. Respondent remained at the Volunteers of America facility until November 25, 1991, the day he
reported to the Allenwood Federal Prison Camp to serve
his sentence.
Respondent requested the Bureau of Prisons (BOP or Bureau) to credit toward his sentence of imprisonment the approximately 150 days he spent at the Volunteers of America
community treatment center between June 25 and November
25, 1991. Relying on its established policy, BOP refused to
grant the requested credit. After exhausting his administrative remedies, respondent fied a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking credit under 18 U. S. C. § 3585
for the time he spent at the community treatment center.
The District Court denied the petition, finding that respondent's stay at the center did not constitute "official detention"
within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. §3585(b).
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 21
F. 3d 558 (1994). It acknowledged that the overwhelming
majority of the Courts of Appeals "have concluded that section 3585 ...does not require the Bureau to credit presentenced defendants whose bail conditions allowed them to
be confined outside of Bureau of Prison[s] facilities." Id., at
561. The court declined, however, to defer to the Bureau's
view-that time spent under highly restrictive conditions
while "released" on bail is not "'official detention"' under
§ 3585(b) because a "'released"' defendant is not subject to
the Bureau's control. Id., at 562-565. Instead, the court
reasoned that §3585(b)'s "'official detention"' language need
not be read "as if it provided 'official detention by the Attorney General or the Bureau of Prisons,"'since "there is noth-

Opinion of the Court

ing in the statute which requires or suggests that a defendant must be under the detention of the Bureau," and since
"[a] court may 'detain' a person as 'official[ly]' as the Attorney General." Id., at 563-564. Concluding that "'official
detention' for purposes of credit under 18 U. S. C. §3585 includes time spent under conditions of jail-type confinement,"
id., at 567, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for a
determination whether respondent was in "jail-type confinement" during his stay at the Volunteers of America community treatment center.
We granted the Government's petition for certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question
whether a federal prisoner is entitled to credit against his
sentence under §3585(b) for time when he was "released" on
bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984.1 513 U. S.
1106 (1995). We now reverse.

Opinion of the Court

Title 18 U. S. C. §3585 determines when a federal sentence
of imprisonment commences and whether credit against that
sentence must be granted for time spent in "official detention" before the sentence began. It states:
"Calculation of a term of imprisonment
"(a) COMMENCEMENT OF SENTENCE.-A

sentence to

a term of imprisonment commences on the date the defendant is received in custody awaiting transportation
to, or arrives voluntarily to commence service of sentence at, the official detention facility at which the sentence is to be served.
"(b) CREDIT FOR PRIOR CUSTODY.-A defendant shall
be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention
prior to the date the sentence commences"(1) as a result of the offense for which the sentence
was imposed; or
"(2) as a result of any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after the commission of the offense
for which the sentence was imposed;
"that has not been credited against another sentence."
18 U. S. C. § 3585 (emphasis added).
In United States v. Wilson, 503 U. S. 329, 337 (1992), we specifically noted Congress' use of the term "'official detention"'
in §3585(b), but we had no occasion to rule on the meaning
of that term. We must do so today.2

Our task is strictly one of statutory interpretation. Respondent argued in the District Court that §3585 violated equal protection principles
by treating pretrial defendants differently than postsentenced defendants.
App. 23. The District Court rejected this argument. App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-28. Respondent waived his equal protection argument in the
Third Circuit, see 21 F. 3d 558, 559, n. 1 (1994), and he has not renewed it
here. In an amicus curiae brief filed with this Court, University of
Southern California Law Center's Post-Conviction Justice Project raises
a similar equal protection argument, see Brief for USC Law Center's
Post-Conviction Justice Project as Amicus Curiae 20-23, but that argu-

RENO v. KORAY
Opinion of the Court

The Government contends that the phrase "official detention" in § 3585(b) refers to a court order detaining a defendant and committing him to the custody of the Attorney
General for confinement. Respondent, on the other hand,
argues that the phrase "official detention" includes the restrictive conditions of his release on bail because the Federal
Magistrate's bail order was "official" and significantly curtailed his liberty. Viewing the phrase in isolation, it may be
said that either reading is plausible. But it is a "fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in
which it is used." Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 182
(1993). After examining the phrase "official detention" in
this light, we believe the Government's interpretation is the
correct one.
Section 3585(b) provides credit for time "spent in official
detention prior to the date the sentence commences," 18
U. S. C. §3585(b) (emphasis added), thus making clear that
credit is awarded only for presentence restraints on liberty.
Because the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. §3141 et
seq., is the body of law that authorizes federal courts to place
presentence restraints on a defendant's liberty, see § 3142(a)
(authorizing courts to impose restraints on the defendant
"pending trial"); §3143(a) (authorizing courts to impose
restraints while the defendant "is waiting imposition or
execution of sentence"), the "official detention" language of
§ 3585(b) must be construed in conjunction with that Act.
This is especially so because the Bail Reform Act of 1984 was
enacted in the same statute as the Sentencing Reform Act of
ment is not properly before the Court. See United Parcel Service, Inc.
v. Mitchell, 451 U. S. 56, 60, n. 2 (1981) (noting that this Court does not
decide issues raised by amici that were not decided by the court of appeals
or argued by the interested party); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 531, n. 13
(1979) (same).

Opinion of the Court

1984, of which § 3585 is a part.3 See Gozlon-Peretz v. United
States, 498 U. S. 395, 407-408 (1991) ("It is not uncommon to
refer to other, related legislative enactments when interpreting specialized statutory terms," since Congress is presumed
to have "legislated with reference to" those terms).
The Bail Reform Act of 1984 provides a federal court with
two choices when dealing with a criminal defendant-who has
been "charged with an offense" and is awaiting trial, 18
U. S. C. § 3142(a), or who "has been found guilty of an offense
and . . . is awaiting imposition or execution of sentence,"

18 U. S. C. §3143(a)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The court may
either (1) "release" the defendant on bail or (2) order him
"detained" without bail. A court may "release" a defendant
subject to a variety of restrictive conditions, including
residence in a community treatment center. See §§ 3142(c)
(1)(B)(i), (x), and (xiv). If, however, the court "finds that no
condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure
the appearance of the person as required and the safety of
any other person and the community," §3142(e), the court
"shall order the detention of the person," ibid., by issuing
a
"detention order" "direct[ing] that the person be committed
to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement in a
corrections facility," § 3142(i)(2). Thus, under the language
of the Bail Reform Act of 1984, a defendant suffers "detention" only when committed to the custody of the Attorney
General; a defendant admitted to bail on restrictive conditions, as respondent was, is "released." See Dawson v.
Scott, 50 F. 3d 884, 889-890, and nn. 11-12 (CAll 1995);
Moreland v. United States, 968 F. 2d 655, 659-660 (CA8),

Opinion of the Court

(Loken, J., concurring); United States v. Becak, 954 F. 2d 386,
388 (CA6), cert. denied, 504 U. S. 945 (1992).
Section 3585(a) and related sentencing provisions confirm
this interpretation. Section 3585(a) provides that a federal
sentence "commences" when the defendant is received for
transportation to or arrives at "the official detention facility
at which the sentence is to be served." Title 18 U. S. C.
§ 3621, in turn, provides that the sentenced defendant "shall
be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons,"
§3621(a), which "may designate any availablepenal or correctionalfacility... whether maintained by the Federal
Government or otherwise ...

,

that the Bureau determines

to be appropriate and suitable," §3621(b) (emphasis added).
The phrase "official detention facility" in § 3585(a) therefore
must refer to a correctional facility designated by the Bureau
for the service of federal sentences, where the Bureau retains the discretion to "direct the transfer of a prisoner from
one penal or correctional facility to another." §3621(b).
This reading of § 3585(a) is reinforced by other provisions
governing the administration of federal sentences. For example, § 3622 gives the Bureau authority to release a prisoner from the place of his imprisonment for a limited period
to "participate in a training or educational program in the
community while continuing in official detention at the
prison facility," § 3622(b), or to "work at paid employment in
the community while continuing in official detention at the
penal or correctional facility," § 3622(c). Because the words
"official detention" should bear the same meaning in subsections (a) and (b) of § 3585 as they do in the above related
sentencing statutes, see Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 479 (1992) ("[T]he basic canon of statutory construction [is] that identical terms within an Act bear
the same meaning"), credit for time spent in "official detention" under §3585(b) is available only to those defendants
who were detained in a "penal or correctional facility,"
§3621(b), and who were subject to BOP's control.

Opinion of the Court

The context and history of § 3585(b) also support this view.
As for context, § 3585(b) reduces a defendant's "imprisonment" by the amount of time spent in "official detention"
before his sentence, strongly suggesting that the period of
presentence "detention" must be equivalent to the "imprisonment" itself. It would be anomalous to interpret §3585(b)
to require sentence credit for time spent confined in a community treatment center where the defendant is not subject
to BOP's control, since Congress generally views such a restriction on liberty as part of a sentence of "probation," see
18 U. S. C. §§ 3563(b)(10), (12), and (14), or "supervised release," see §3583(d), rather than part of a sentence of "imprisonment." See United States v. Zackular,945 F. 2d 423,
425 (CA1 1991).
With respect to history, § 3585(b)'s predecessor, 18 U. S. C.
§ 3568 (1982 ed.) (repealed), required the Attorney General
to award sentence credit for "any days spent in custody
in connection with the offense or acts for which sentence
was imposed." (Emphasis added.) The Courts of Appeals
uniformly held that the phrase "in custody" did not allow
sentence credit because of restrictions placed on a defendant's liberty as a condition of release on bail. See
Polakoff v. United States, 489 F. 2d 727, 730 (CA5
1974) (time spent on "highly restricted bond" not creditable as "'custody"'); United States v. Robles, 563 F. 2d
1308, 1309 (CA9 1977) ("[T]ime spent on bail or on bond pending appeal is not time served 'in custody"'), cert. denied,
435 U. S. 925 (1978); Ortega v. United States, 510 F. 2d 412,
413 (CA10 1975) ("'custody"' refers to "actual custodial
incarceration," not "the time a criminal defendant is free
on bond"); United States v. Peterson, 507 F. 2d 1191, 1192
(CADC 1974) ("'in custody"' does "not refer to the stipulations imposed when a defendant is at large on conditional
release"). In 1984, Congress enacted § 3585(b) and altered
§3568 by, inter alia,"replac[ing] the term 'custody' with the
term 'official detention."' Wilson, 503 U. S., at 337; see also

18 U. S. C. §3585(b). In thus rewording the credit statute,
however, nothing suggests that Congress disagreed with the

had been released on bail. To the contrary, Congress presumably made the change to conform the credit statute to

Opinion of the Court

Bureau's interpretation is the most natural and reasonable
reading of § 3585(b)'s "official detention" language. It is true
that the Bureau's interpretation appears only in a "Program
Statemen[t]"-an internal agency guideline-rather than in
"published regulations subject to the rigors of the Administrative Procedur[e] Act, including public notice and comment." 21 F. 3d, at 562. But BOP's internal agency guideline, which is akin to an "interpretive rule" that "do[es] not
require notice and comment," Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U. S. 87, 99 (1995), is still entitled to some
deference, cf. Martin v. OccupationalSafety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 157 (1991), since it is a "permissible construction of the statute," Chevron U S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843
(1984).
Respondent, as we have indicated, disagrees with the
above interpretation of §3585(b). He contends that the
"plain meaning" of the phrase "official detention" includes
the restrictive conditions of his confinement, even though he
from detention with a requirement of program participation and/or
residence.
"A defendant is not eligible for any credits while released from detention. Time spent in residence in a community corrections center as a
result of the PretrialServices Act of 1982 (18 U. S. C. §3152-3154), or as
a result of a condition of bail or bond (18 U. S. C. §3141-3143), is not creditable as presentence time. A condition of bail or bond which is 'highly
restrictive,' and that includes 'house arrest', 'electronic monitoring' or
'home confinement'; or such as requiring the defendant to report daily to
the U. S. Marshal, U. S. Probation Service, or other person; is not considered as time in official detention. Such a defendant is not subject to the
discretion of the U. S. Attorney General, the Bureau of Prisons, or the
U. S. Marshals Service, regarding participation, placement, or subsequent
return to a more secure environment, and therefore is not in a status
which would indicate an award of credit is appropriate (see Randall v.
Whelan, 938 F. 2d 522 (4th Cir. 1991) and U S. v. Insley, 927 F. 2d 185 (4th
Cir. 1991). Further, the government may not prosecute for escape in the
case of an unauthorized absence in such cases, as the person has been
lawfully released from 'official detention."' (Emphasis in original.)

RENO v. KORAY
Opinion of the Court

was released on bail. This contention is a plausible one if
the phrase is read in isolation: respondent was subjected to
restrictive conditions when released on bail, these conditions
were imposed by a court order, and his sojourn in the community treatment center therefore amounted to "official detention." But even without reference to the context of the
language and the history of the statute, respondents is not
the only plausible interpretation of the language; it would be
too much to say that the statute "cannot bear the interpretation adopted by" the Bureau. Sullivan v. Everhart, 494
U. S. 83, 91-92 (1990). And in light of the foregoing textual
and historical analysis, the initial plausibility of respondent's
reading simply does not carry the day.
Respondent also argues it is improper to focus on the
release/detention dichotomy of the Bail Reform Act of 1984
to construe §3585(b)'s "official detention" language because
a defendant "released" on bail may be subjected to conditions
(under 18 U. S. C. §3142(c)(1)(B)(xiv)) that are just as onerous
as those faced by "detained" defendants. In addition, he asserts that his confinement as a "released" defendant in the
Volunteers of America community treatment center constituted "official detention" because "sentenced" prisoners are
deemed to be in "official detention" when BOP authorizes
them to serve the last part of their sentences in a community
treatment center, see U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Prisons Program Statement No. 7310.02 (Oct. 19, 1993) (interpreting 18 U. S. C. § 3624(c) to allow BOP to place sentenced
prisoners in community corrections centers, since such centers meet 18 U. S. C. § 3621(b)'s definition of a "penal or correctional facility"), or to serve their sentences on educational
or work release, see 18 U. S. C. §§ 3622(b) and (c).
It is quite true that under the Government's theory a defendant "released" to a community treatment center could be
subject to restraints which do not materially differ from
those imposed on a "detained" defendant committed to the

to a
treatment center. But this fact does not undercut the
remaining distinction that exists between all defendants
committed to the custody of the Attorney General on the
one
hand, and all defendants released on bail on the other.
Unlike defendants "released" on bail, defendants who are
"detained" or "sentenced" always remain subject to the control
of the Bureau. See Randall v. Whelan, 938 F. 2d 522,
525
(CA4 1991). This is an important distinction, as the identity
of the custodian has both legal and practical significance.
A

he
cannot be summarily reassigned to a different place of
confinement unless a judicial officer revokes his release, see
18
U. S. C. §3148(b), or modifies the conditions of his release,
see § 3142(c)(3). A defendant who is "detained," however,
is
completely subject to BOP's control. And "[t]hat single
factor encompasses a wide variety of restrictions." Randall,
supra, at 525. "Detained" defendants are subject to BOP's
disciplinary procedures; they are subject to summary reassignment to any other penal or correctional facility within
the system, cf. Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 224-229
(1976); and, being in the legal custody of BOP, the Bureau
has full discretion to control many conditions of their
confinement. See Moody v. Daggett,429 U. S. 78, 88, n. 9 (1976);
Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 544-548 (1979). 5
In some cases, a defendant will be arrested, denied bail,
and

held in
custody pursuant to state law, being turned over later to the Federal
Government for prosecution. In these situations, BOP often grants
credit
under § 3585(b) for time spent in state custody, see, e.g., U.
S.
Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Operations Memorandum Dept. of
(Oct. 23,
1989); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Sentence
Computation Manual CCCA (1992 and Supp. 1994), even though the
defendant
was not subject to the control of BOP. These situations obviously
are
not governed by reference to a §3142 "release" or "detention"
order. But

We hold that the time respondent spent at the Volunteers
of America community treatment center while "released" on
bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984 was not "official
detention" within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. § 3585(b). Respondent therefore was not entitled to a credit against his
sentence of imprisonment. The judgment of the Court of

As-the Government reads 18 U. S. C. § 3585(b), Koray gains
credit against his sentence for the two months he spent in
jail, but not for the five months' close confinement he encountered at the halfway house. The Court cogently explains
why it adopts the Government's interpretation. I write separately to point out that Koray has not argued before us that
he did not elect bail intelligently, i. e., with comprehension
that time in the halfway house, unlike time in jail, would
yield no credit against his eventual sentence. The Court
thus does not foreclose the possibility that the .fundamental
fairness we describe as "due process" calls for notice and a
comprehension check. Cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11 (setting
out information a court is to convey to assure that a defendant who pleads guilty understands the consequences of the
plea).
JUSTICE GINSBURG,

RENO v. KORAY
STEVENS,

J., dissenting

dissenting.
Pursuant to an order entered by a federal judicial officer,
respondent was "confined to premises of [Volunteers of
America (VOA)]," a private halfway house. The order of
confinement-euphemistically styled a "release" order-provided that respondent "shall not be authorized to leave for
any reason unless accompanied by Special Agent Dennis
Bass." Brief for Respondent 3. While at VOA, respondent
"had to account for his presence five times a day, he was
subject to random breath and urine tests, his access to visitors was limited in both time and manner, and there was
a paucity of vocational, educational, and recreational services compared to a prison facility." Koray v. Sizer, 21 F. 3d
558, 566 (CA3 1994). Except for one off-site medical exam,
respondent remained at VOA 24 hours a day for 150 days.
In my opinion, respondent's confinement was unquestionably both "official" and "detention" within the meaning of 18
U. S. C. §3585(b).
Both the text and the purpose of § 3585(b) clearly contemplate that a person who is locked up for 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, pursuant to a court order, is in "official detention." Such a person is surely in custody, and that custody
is no less "official" for being ordered by a court rather than
the Attorney General. Indeed, even the majority acknowledges the force of this plain meaning argument. Ante, at
61-62.* Moreover, the manifest purpose of §3585(b) is to
give a convicted person credit for all time spent in official

custody as a result of the offense that gave rise to
his conviction. When that confinement is in a facility that
has all the
restraints of a typical prison, it should not matter
whether
that facility is operated by a State, a county, or
a private
custodian pursuant to a contract with the Government.
Purporting to establish the contrary conclusion, the
Court
labors to prove the rather obvious proposition that
all persons in the custody of the Attorney General pursuant
to a
detention order issued under 18 U. S. C. § 3142 (1988
ed. and
Supp. V), as well as all persons confined in an "official
detention facility" under § 3585(a), are also in "official
detention"
within the meaning of §3585(b). However, proof
that confinement under §3142 or § 3585(a) constitutes official
detention certainly is not proof that no other form of confinement
can constitute official detention. The majority thus
fails to
demonstrate that respondent should not receive
sentencing
credit for his court-ordered full-time confinement
in a jailtype facility.
Moreover, the Court's restrictive interpretation
creates
an anomalous result. Under the Court's view that
only a
person "committed to the custody of the Attorney
General"
can be in "official detention," §3585(b) does not authorize
any
credit for time spent in state custody, "no matter
how restrictive the conditions." Ante, at 60, 63-64, n.

least
one Court of Appeals (albeit after the passage of the
Bail
Reform Act) interpreted the word "custody" under §3568
as including "enforced residence under conditions approaching those of incarceration." Brown v. Rison, 895 F. 2d
533,
536 (CA9 1990). Thus, though I agree with the majority
that Congress intended to incorporate the understanding
of
"custody"' that existed under § 3568, I fail to see how
that
intention supports the majority's result.
Simply accepting the plain meaning of the statutory text
would avoid the anomalies created by the Court's opinion,
would effectuate the intent of Congress, and would provide
fair treatment for defendants who will otherwise spend
more
time in custody than Congress has deemed necessary or
appropriate. For these reasons, I agree with the persuasive opinion of the Court of Appeals and would affirm
its
judgment.
