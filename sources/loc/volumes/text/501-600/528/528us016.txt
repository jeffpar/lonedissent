IN RE BAUER
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 99-5440. Decided October 18, 1999
HeldL Abusive filer of frivolous petitions is denied leave to proceed in
forma pauperisunder this Court's Rule 39.8 and barred from filing further petitions in noncriminal matters unless he first pays the docketing
fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petitions in compliance with
Rule 33.1. See Martin v. Districtof Columbia Court of Appeals, 506
U.S. 1.
Motion denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Bauer seeks leave to proceed in forma
pauperisunder Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request
as frivolous pursuant to Rule 39.8. Bauer is allowed until
November 8, 1999, within which to pay the docketing fees
required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliance
with this Court's Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to
accept any further petitions for certiorari or petitions for
extraordinary writs from Bauer in noncriminal matters unless he first pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and
submits his petitions in compliance with Rule 33.1.
Bauer has repeatedly abused this Court's certiorari and
extraordinary writ processes. On October 4, 1993, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Bauer in forma pauperis status
with respect to a petition for an extraordinary writ. See
In re Bauer, 510 U. S. 807. Prior to the Rule 39.8 denial,
Bauer had filed three petitions for certiorari and five petitions for extraordinary writs, all of which were both frivolous and had been denied without recorded dissent. Since
the Rule 39.8 denial, Bauer has filed two petitions for certiorari, both of which were also frivolous and denied without
recorded dissent. The instant petition for mandamus thus
brings Bauer's total number of frivolous filings to 12.

STEVENS, J., dissenting

We enter the order barring prospective filings for the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam). Bauer's abuse of
the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has been
in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accordingly.
The order therefore will not prevent Bauer from petitioning
to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on
him. The order will, however, allow this Court to devote
its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have
not abused our processes.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS,

dissenting.

For reasons previously stated, see Martin v. District of
Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS,
J., dissenting), and cases cited, I respectfully dissent.
