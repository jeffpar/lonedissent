CASAROTTO ET UX.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA
No. 95-559. Argued April 16, 1996-Decided May 20, 1996
When a dispute arose between parties to a standard form franchise agreement for the operation of a Subway sandwich shop in Montana, respondent franchisee sued petitioners, franchisor Doctor's Associates, Inc.
(DAI), and its agent, Lombardi, in a Montana state court. The court
stayed the lawsuit pending arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause
set out in ordinary type on page nine of the franchise agreement. The
Montana Supreme Court reversed, holding that the arbitration clause
was unenforceable because it did not meet the state-law requirement
that "[niotice that a contract is subject to arbitration" be "typed in
underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract." Mont.
Code Ann. §27-5-114(4). DAI and Lombardi unsuccessfully argued
that §27-5-114(4) was preempted by § 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act
(FAA), which declares written provisions for arbitration "valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in
equity for the revocation of any contract." In arguing for preemption,
DAI and Lombardi dominantly relied on Southland Corp. v. Keating,
465 U.S. 1, and Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, in which this Court
established that "state law... is applicable if that law arose to govern
issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally," but not if the state-law principle "takes its meaning
precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue." Id.,
at 493, n. 9 (emphasis added). The Montana Supreme Court, however,
thought Volt InformationSciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, limited § 2's preemptive force and
correspondingly qualified Southland and Perry;the proper inquiry, the
Montana Supreme Court said, should focus not on the bare words of
§2 but on the question: Would the application of § 27-5-114(4)'s notice
requirement undermine the FAA's goals and policies. In the Montana
court's judgment, the notice requirement did not undermine these goals
and policies, for it did not preclude arbitration agreements altogether.
On remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of Allied-Bruce
Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, the Montana court adhered to
its original ruling.
Held. Montana's first-page notice requirement, which governs not "any
contract," but specifically and solely contracts "subject to arbitration,"

Opinion of the Court
conflicts with the FAA and is therefore displaced by the federal measure. Generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or
unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements
without contravening §2, see, e. g., Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 281, but
courts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions, see, e.g., ibid. By enacting § 2,
Congress precluded States from singling out arbitration provisions for
suspect status, requiring instead that such provisions be placed upon
the same footing as other contracts. Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417
U.S. 506, 511. Montana's §27-5-114(4) directly conflicts with §2 because the State's law conditions the enforceability of arbitration agreements on compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable
to contracts generally. The Montana Supreme Court misread Volt in
reaching a contrary conclusion. The state rule examined in Volt determined only the efficient order of proceedings; it did not affect the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself. Applying §27-5-114(4)
here, in contrast, would invalidate the arbitration clause. Pp. 686-688.

Opinion of the Court

When a dispute arose between parties to the agreement,
franchisee Paul Casarotto sued franchisor Doctor's Associates, Inc. (DAI), and DAI's Montana development agent,
Nick Lombardi, in a Montana state court. DAI and Lombardi sought to stop the litigation pending arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause set out on page nine of the
franchise agreement.
The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) declares written provisions for arbitration "valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity
for the revocation of any contract." 9 U. S. C. §2. Montana
law, however, declares an arbitration clause unenforceable
unless "[n]otice that [the] contract is subject to arbitration"
is "typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of
the contract." Mont. Code Ann. §27-5-114(4) (1995). The
question here presented is whether Montana's law is compatible with the federal Act. We hold that Montana's first-page
notice requirement, which governs not "any contract," but
specifically and solely contracts "subject to arbitration," conflicts with the FAA and is therefore displaced by the federal measure.
I
Petitioner DAI is the national franchisor of Subway sandwich shops. In April 1988, DAI entered a franchise agreement with respondent Paul Casarotto, which permitted
Casarotto to open a Subway shop in Great Falls, Montana.
The franchise agreement stated, on page nine and in ordinary type: "Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract or the breach thereof shall be settled by
Arbitration.... ." App. 75.
In October 1992, Casarotto sued DAI and its agent, Nick
Lombardi, in Montana state court, alleging state-law contract and tort claims relating to the franchise agreement.
DAI demanded arbitration of those claims, and successfully
moved in the Montana trial court to stay the lawsuit pending
arbitration. Id., at 10-11.

DOCTOR'S ASSOCIATES, INC. v. CASAROTTO
Opinion of the Court

The Montana Supreme Court reversed. Casarotto v.
Lombardi, 268 Mont. 369, 886 P. 2d 931 (1994). That court
left undisturbed the trial court's findings that the franchise
agreement fell within the scope of the FAA and covered the
claims Casarotto stated against DAI and Lombardi. The
Montana Supreme Court held, however, that Mont. Code
Ann. §27-5-114(4) rendered the agreement's arbitration
clause unenforceable. The Montana statute provides:
"Notice that a contract is subject to arbitration..
shall be typed in underlined capital letters on the first
page of the contract; and unless such notice is displayed
thereon, the contract may not be subject to arbitration."
Notice of the arbitration clause in the franchise agreement
did not appear on the first page of the contract. Nor was
anything relating to the clause typed in underlined capital
letters. Because the State's statutory notice requirement
had not been met, the Montana Supreme Court declared the
parties' dispute "not subject to arbitration." 268 Mont., at
382, 886 P. 2d, at 939.
DAI and Lombardi unsuccessfully argued before the Montana Supreme Court that §27-5-114(4) was preempted by §2
of the FAA.' DAI and Lombardi dominantly relied on our
decisions in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S.1 (1984),
and Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483 (1987). In Southland,
we held that § 2 of the FAA applies in state as well as federal
courts, see 465 U. S., at 12, and "withdr[aws] the power of
the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of
claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by
arbitration," id., at 10. We noted in the pathmarking South' Section 2 provides, in relevant part:
"A written provision in... a contract evidencing a transaction involving
commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of
such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any
part thereof,... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon
such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract." 9 U. S. C. §2.

Opinion of the Court

land decision that the FAA established a "broad principle of
enforceability," id., at 11, and that § 2 of the federal Act provided for revocation of arbitration agreements only upon
"grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any
contract." In Perry,we reiterated: "[S]tate law, whether of
legislative or judicial origin, is applicable if that law arose to
govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally. A state-law principle
that takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract
to arbitrate is at issue does not comport with [the text of
§2]." 482 U. S., at 493, n. 9.
The Montana Supreme Court, however, read our decision
in Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S.468 (1989), as limiting the preemptive force of §2 and correspondingly qualifying Southland and Perry. 268 Mont., at 378-381, 886 P. 2d,
at 937-939. As the Montana Supreme Court comprehended
Volt, the proper inquiry here should focus not on the bare
words of §2, but on this question: Would the application of
Montana's notice requirement, contained in §27-5-114(4),
"undermine the goals and policies of the FAA." 268 Mont.,
at 381, 886 P. 2d, at 938 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Section 27-5-114(4), in the Montana court's judgment, did
not undermine the goals and policies of the FAA, for the
notice requirement did not preclude arbitration agreements
altogether; it simply prescribed "that before arbitration
agreements are enforceable, they be entered knowingly."
Id., at 381, 886 P. 2d, at 939.
DAI and Lombardi petitioned for certiorari. Last Term,
we granted their petition, vacated the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court, and remanded for further consideration
in light of Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S.
265 (1995). See 515 U. S.1129 (1995). In Allied-Bruce, we
restated what our decisions in Southland and Perry had
established:

686

DOCTOR'S ASSOCIATES, INC. v. CASAROTTO
Opinion of the Court

"States may regulate contracts, including arbitration
clauses, under general contract law principles and they
may invalidate an arbitration clause 'upon such grounds
as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of
any contract.' 9 U. S. C. §2 (emphasis added). What
States may not do is decide that a contract is fair enough
to enforce all its basic terms (price, service, credit), but
not fair enough to enforce its arbitration clause. The
Act makes any such state policy unlawful, for that kind
of policy would place arbitration clauses on an unequal
Tooting,' directly contrary to the Act's language and
Congress's intent." 513 U. S., at 281.
On remand, without inviting or permitting further briefing
or oral argument, 2 the Montana Supreme Court adhered to
its original ruling. The court stated: "After careful review,
we can find nothing in the [Allied-Bruce] decision which
relates to the issues presented to this Court in this case."
Casarotto v. Lombardi, 274 Mont. 3, 7, 901 P. 2d 596, 598
(1995). Elaborating, the Montana court said it found "no
suggestion in [Allied-Bruce] that the principles from Volt on
which we relied [to uphold § 27-5-114(4)] have been modified
in any way." Id., at 8, 901 P. 2d, at 598-599. We again
granted certiorari, 516 U. S. 1036 (1996), and now reverse.
II
Section 2 of the FAA provides that written arbitration
agreements "shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save
upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract." 9 U. S. C. § 2 (emphasis added). Repeating our observation in Perry,the text of § 2 declares that
state law may be applied "if that law arose to govern issues
Justice Gray thought it "cavalier" of her colleagues to ignore the defendants' request for an "opportunity to brief the issues raised
by the ... remand and to present oral argument." Casarotto v. Lombardi, 274 Mont. 3, 9-10, 901 P. 2d 596, 599-600 (1995).

concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of
contracts generally." 482 U. S., at 493, n. 9. Thus, generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or
unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration
agreements without contravening §2. See Allied-Bruce,
513 U. S., at 281; Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American
Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 483-484 (1989); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226 (1987).
Courts may not, however, invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions. See Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 281; Perry, 482 U. S.,
at 493, n. 9. By enacting § 2, we have several times said,
Congress precluded States from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status, requiring instead that such provisions be placed "upon the same footing as other contracts."
Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S.506, 511 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted). Montana's § 27-5-114(4) directly conflicts with § 2 of the FAA because the State's law
conditions the enforceability of arbitration agreements on
compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable
to contracts generally. The FAA thus displaces the Montana statute with respect to arbitration agreements covered
by the Act. See 2 I. Macneil, R. Speidel, T. Stipanowich, &
G. Shell, Federal Arbitration Law § 19.1.1, pp. 19:4-19:5
(1995) (under Southland and Perry,"state legislation requiring greater information or choice in the making of agree3
ments to arbitrate than in other contracts is preempted").
3At oral argument, counsel for Casarotto urged a broader view, under
which §27-5-114(4) might be regarded as harmless surplus. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 29-32. Montana could have invalidated the arbitration clause
in the franchise agreement under general, informed consent principles,
counsel suggested. She asked us to regard §27-5-114(4) as but one illustration of a cross-the-board rule: Unexpected provisions in adhesion contracts must be conspicuous. See also Brief for Respondents 21-24. But
the Montana Supreme Court announced no such sweeping rule. The
court did not assert as a basis for its decision a generally applicable principle of "reasonable expectations" governing any standard form contract

688

DOCTOR'S ASSOCIATES, INC. v. CASAROTTO
Opinion of the Court

The Montana Supreme Court misread our Volt decision
and therefore reached a conclusion in this case at odds with
our rulings. Volt involved an arbitration agreement that incorporated state procedural rules, one of which, on the facts
of that case, called for arbitration to be stayed pending the
resolution of a related judicial proceeding. The state rule
examined in Volt determined only the efficient order of proceedings; it did not affect the enforceability of the arbitration
agreement itself. We held that applying the state rule
would not "undermine the goals and policies of the FAA,"
489 U. S., at 478, because the very purpose of the Act was to
"ensur[e] that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced
according to their terms," id., at 479.
Applying §27-5-114(4) here, in contrast, would not enforce
the arbitration clause in the contract between DAI and
Casarotto; instead, Montana's first-page notice requirement
would invalidate the clause. The "goals and policies" of the
FAA, this Court's precedent indicates, are antithetical to
threshold limitations placed specifically and solely on arbitration provisions. Section 2 "mandate[s] the enforcement of
arbitration agreements," Southland, 465 U. S., at 10, "save
upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract," 9 U. S. C. §2. Section 27-5-114(4) of
Montana's law places arbitration agreements in a class apart
from "any contract," and singularly limits their validity.
The State's prescription is thus inconsonant with, and is
therefore preempted by, the federal law.
term. Cf TransamericaIns. Co. v. Royle, 202 Mont. 173, 180, 656 P. 2d
820, 824 (1983) (invalidating provision in auto insurance policy that did not
"honor the reasonable expectations" of the insured). Montana's decision
trains on and upholds a particular statute, one setting out a precise,
arbitration-specific limitation. We review that disposition, and no other.
It bears reiteration, however, that a court may not "rely on the uniqueness
of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding that enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would enable the court to effect
what... the state legislature cannot." Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483,
493, n. 9 (1987).

For the reasons given in my dissent last Term in AlliedBruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265 (1995), I remain of the view that §2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
