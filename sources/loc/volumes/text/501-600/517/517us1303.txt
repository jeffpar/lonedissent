ABSTENTION.
Remand order.-An abstention-based remand order is appealable under
28 U. S. C. ยง 1291; because damages, rather than equitable or discretionary relief, were sought here, District Court's remand order was an unwarranted application of abstention doctrine of Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,
319 U. S. 315. Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., p. 706.
ACTUAL ENUMERATION.

See Constitutional Law, I.

ADMIRALTY.
1. Proximate causation requirement.-Doctrines of legal or "proximate" causation and "superseding cause" apply in admiralty tort and contract actions notwithstanding this Court's adoption of comparative fault
principle in United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397. Exxon
Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., p. 830.
2. Service of process-FederalRule of Civil Procedure4.-Rule 4 governs manner and timing of service in federal actions, which are nonjurisdictional matters of procedure, and thus it supersedes instruction in ยง2
of Suits in Admiralty Act that process be served "forthwith." Henderson
v. United States, p. 654.

New York, p. 1.
II. Due Process.
1. Criminaltrial--Presumptionof competence.-An Oklahoma statute
requiring that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed to be competent
to stand trial unless he proves his incompetence by clear and convincing
evidence violates due process. Cooper v. Oklahoma, p. 848.
2. Punitive damages-Excessive awards.-Where BMW failed to disclose that it had repainted a new car before Gore bought it, $2 million
in punitive damages awarded to Gore by an Alabama court was grossly
excessive in violation of Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.
BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, p. 559.
3. Res judicata-Partiesto case.-Petitioners were deprived of Fourteenth Amendment due process when Alabama Supreme Court held that
they were barred from challenging an allegedly unconstitutional county

Richards v. Jefferson County, p. 793.
III. Equal Protection of the Laws.
1. Redistrictingplan-Narrowtailoringof reapportionmentscheme.North Carolina's congressional redistricting plan violates Fourteenth
Amendment's Equal Protection Clause because State's reapportionment

Shaw v. Hunt, p. 899.
2. Redistricting plan-Racial gerrymanders.-Three-judge District
Court judgment that Texas' majority-minority congressional Districts
18, 29, and 30 constitute racial gerrymanders in violation of Fourteenth
Amendment is affirmed. Bush v. Vera, p. 952.
3.Repeal of laws banning discrimination on basis of sexual orientation.--"Amendment 2" to Colorado Constitution, which prohibits all
state governmental action designed to protect status of persons based
on their sexual orientation, violates Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Romer v. Evans, p. 620.
IV. Export Clause.

determine any disputed term of art on which expert testimony is offered.
Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., p. 370.
VII. Searches and Seizures.
Vehicle stops-Temporary detention of motorists.-Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures does not require police
to support temporary detention of motorists during stop of their vehicles
with anything more than probable cause to believe they committed traffic
violations. Whren v. United States, p. 806.
VIII. Separation of Powers.
Presidentialauthority-Promulgationof aggravatingfactorsfor sentencing of Armed Forces personnel.-Presidentdoes not lack authority,
under separation-of-powers doctrine, to promulgate aggravating factors

Forces member convicted of murder. Loving v. United States, p. 748.

Suit by union on behalf of its members.-Third prong of associational

STAYS.
1. Stay of execution-Habeas corpus petition.-Application to vacate
Eighth Circuit's stay of Williams' execution is granted, given District
