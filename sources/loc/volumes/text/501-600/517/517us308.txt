O'CONNOR v. CONSOLIDATED COIN CATERERS
CORP.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
No. 95-354. Argued February 27, 1996-Decided April 1, 1996
At age 56, petitioner was fired by respondent corporation and replaced by
a 40-year-old worker. He then filed this suit, alleging that his discharge
violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).
The District Court granted respondent's summary judgment motion,
and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner failed to make
out a prima facie case of age discrimination under McDonnell Douglas
Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, because he failed to show that he was
replaced by someone outside the age group protected by the ADEA.
Held: Assuming that Title VII's McDonnell Douglas framework is applicable to ADEA cases, there must be at least a logical connection
between each element of the prima facie case and the illegal discrimination. Replacement by someone under 40 fails this requirement.
Although the ADEA limits its protection to those who are 40 or older,
it prohibits discrimination against those protected employees on the
basis of age, not class membership. That one member of the protected
class lost out to another member is irrelevant, so long as he lost out
because of his age. The latter is more reliably indicated by the fact
that his replacement was substantially younger than by the fact that his
replacement was not a member of the protected class.
56 F. 3d 542, reversed and remanded.

delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether a plaintiff alleging that he was discharged in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as
amended, 29 U. S. C. § 621 et seq., must show that he was
replaced by someone outside the age group protected by the
ADEA to make out a prima facie case under the framework
established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S.
792 (1973).
Petitioner James O'Connor was employed by respondent
Consolidated Coin Caterers Corporation from 1978 until August 10, 1990, when, at age 56, he was fired. Claiming that
he had been dismissed because of his age in violation of the
ADEA, petitioner brought suit in the United States District
Court for the Western District of North Carolina. After
discovery, the District Court granted respondent's motion
for summary judgment, 829 F. Supp. 155 (1993), and petiJUSTICE SCALIA

O'CONNOR v. CONSOLIDATED COIN CATERERS CORP.
Opinion of the Court

tioner appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated that petitioner could establish a prima facie case
under McDonnell Douglas only if he could prove that (1) he
was in the age group protected by the ADEA; (2) he was
discharged or demoted; (3) at the time of his discharge or
demotion, he was performing his job at a level that met his
employer's legitimate expectations; and (4) following his discharge or demotion, he was replaced by someone of comparable qualifications outside the protected class. Since petitioner's replacement was 40 years old, the Court of Appeals
concluded that the last element of the prima facie case had
not been made out.' 56 F. 3d 542, 546 (1995). Finding that
petitioner's claim could not survive a motion for summary
judgment without benefit of the McDonnell Douglas presumption (i. e., "under the ordinary standards of proof used
in civil cases," 56 F. 3d, at 548), the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of dismissal. We granted O'Connor's
petition for certiorari. 516 U. S. 973 (1995).
In McDonnell Douglas, we "established an allocation of
the burden of production and an order for the presentation
of proof in Title VII discriminatory-treatment cases." St.
Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 506 (1993). We
held that a plaintiff alleging racial discrimination in violation
of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e
et seq., could establish a prima facie case by showing "(i) that
he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was
qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected;
and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open
and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons
of [the] complainant's qualifications." McDonnell Douglas,
'The court also concluded that even under a modified version of the
McDonnell Douglas prima facie standard which the Fourth Circuit applies
to reduction-in-force cases, see Mitchell v. Data General Corp., 12 F. 3d
1310, 1315 (1993), petitioner could not prevail. We limit our review to the
Fourth Circuit's treatment of this case as a non-reduction-in-force case.

Opinion of the Court

411 U. S., at 802. Once the plaintiff has met this initial burden, the burden of production shifts to the employer "to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the
employee's rejection." Ibid. If the trier of fact finds that

the elements of the prima facie case are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and the employer remains silent,

the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff. St. Mary's
Honor Center, supra, at 509-510, and n. 3; Texas Dept. of
Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 254 (1981).

In assessing claims of age discrimination brought under
the ADEA, the Fourth Circuit, like others, 2 has applied some

variant of the basic evidentiary framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas. We have never had occasion to decide
whether that application of the Title VII rule to the ADEA

context is correct, but since the parties do not contest that
point, we shall assume it. Cf. St. Mary's Honor Center,
supra, at 506, n. 1 (assuming that "the McDonnell Douglas

framework is fully applicable to racial-discrimination-inemployment claims under 42 U. S. C. § 1983").

On that as-

sumption, the question presented for our determination is
what elements must be shown in an ADEA case to establish
the prima facie case that triggers the employer's burden of
production.
As the very name "prima facie case" suggests, there must
be at least a logical connection between each element of the

prima facie case and the illegal discrimination for which it

O'CONNOR v. CONSOLIDATED COIN CATERERS CORP.

Opinion of the Court

establishes a "legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption,"
Burdine, supra, at 254, n. 7. The element of replacement
by someone under 40 fails this requirement. The discrimination prohibited by the ADEA is discrimination "because
of [an] individual's age," 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1), though the
prohibition is "limited to individuals who are at least 40
years of age," § 631(a). This language does not ban discrimination against employees because they are aged 40 or older;
it bans discrimination against employees because of their
age, but limits the protected class to those who are 40 or
older. The fact that one person in the protected class has
lost out to another person in the protected class is thus irrelevant, so long as he has lost out because of his age. Or to
put the point more concretely, there can be no greater inference of age discrimination (as opposed to "40 or over" discrimination) when a 40-year-old is replaced by a 39-year-old
than when a 56-year-old is replaced by a 40-year-old. Because it lacks probative value, the fact that an ADEA plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protected class
is not a proper element of the McDonnell Douglas prima
facie case.
Perhaps some courts have been induced to adopt the principle urged by respondent in order to avoid creating a prima
facie case on the basis of very thin evidence-for example,
the replacement of a 68-year-old by a 65-year-old. While
the respondent's principle theoretically permits such thin evidence (consider the example above of a 40-year-old replaced
by a 39-year-old), as a practical matter it will rarely do so,
since the vast majority of age-discrimination claims come
from older employees. In our view, however, the proper solution to the problem lies not in making an utterly irrelevant
factor an element of the prima facie case, but rather in recognizing that the prima facie case requires "evidence adequate
to create an inference that an employment decision was
based on a[n] [illegal] discriminatory criterion . . ."

sis added). In the age-discrimination context, such an inference cannot be drawn from the replacement of one worker
with another worker insignificantly younger. Because the
ADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age and not
class membership, the fact that a replacement is substantially younger than the plaintiff is a far more reliable indicator of age discrimination than is the fact that the plaintiff
was replaced by someone outside the protected class.
The judgment of the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and
the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
