OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Per Curiam

BOWERSOX, SUPERINTENDENT, POTOSI CORRECTIONAL CENTER v. WILLIAMS
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE STAY OF EXECUTION
No. A-828. Decided April 9, 1996
A Federal District Court denied respondent Williams' third habeas corpus
petition, finding all of his claims to be abusive, successive, or procedurally defaulted. The Eighth Circuit subsequently entered a summary
order staying Williams' pending execution, giving no explanation for its
conclusion that such a stay was appropriate.
Held The Eighth Circuit abused its discretion by entering a stay on this
record. Entry of a stay on a second or third habeas petition is particularly egregious absent substantial grounds for relief. Delo v. Blair,509
U. S. 823. No such grounds can be discerned here. The Magistrate's
report adopted by the District Court meticulously addresses and rejects
each of Williams' claims. To the extent that the Eighth Circuit discerned substantial grounds for relief, it failed to reveal them in its summary order. Entry of a stay without explanation is disfavored, cf. Netherland v. Tuggle, 515 U. S. 951 (per curiam), for this Court loses the
benefit of the court of appeals' views and must resort to other portions
of the record in evaluating whether to vacate the stay.
Application granted.
PER CURIAM.

Doyle J. Williams is scheduled to be executed by the State
of Missouri on April 10, 1996. On January 11, 1996, a Federal District Court denied Williams' third federal habeas
corpus petition, finding all of Williams' claims to be abusive,
successive, or procedurally defaulted. On March 8, 1996, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit entered a summary order staying Williams' execution. The
Court of Appeals scheduled oral argument for May 13, 1996,
and resolved that the stay would remain in effect pending
submission of the case and that court's further order. The
summary order gives no explanation for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that oral argument is necessary or that
entry of a stay was appropriate. The Court of Appeals

BOWERSOX v. WILLIAMS
Per Curiam

denied a petition for rehearing en banc, and we now have
before us an application to vacate the stay.
"A stay of execution pending disposition of a second or
successive federal habeas petition should be granted only
when there are 'substantial grounds upon which relief might
be granted."' Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320, 321 (1990) (per
curiam) (quoting Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 895
(1983)). Entry of a stay on a second or third habeas petition
is a drastic measure, and we have held that it is "'particularly egregious"' to enter a stay absent substantial grounds
for relief. Delo v. Blair, 509 U. S. 823 (1993) (citation omitted). On the record before us, we can discern no such
grounds. We are persuaded by the report prepared by Magistrate Judge Hays, which meticulously addresses each of
Williams' claims and finds each to be abusive, successive, procedurally defaulted, or meritless, and by the District Court's
order adopting that report, in which the District Court also
denied Williams' dilatory motion to amend the habeas petition. The Court of Appeals abused its discretion by entering a stay on this record.
To the extent the Court of Appeals discerned substantial
grounds for relief, it failed to reveal them in its summary
order granting the stay. Although we hesitate to say that a
court of appeals must, in every case, explain the basis for its
entry of a stay, we see fit to remind the lower courts that
entry of a stay without explanation is disfavored. Cf. Netherland v. Tuggle, 515 U. S. 951 (1995) (per curiam). When
a court of appeals fails to articulate its reasons for granting
a stay, we lose the benefit of that court's views and must
resort to other portions of the record in evaluating whether
to vacate the stay. In this case, the District Court's careful
treatment of Williams' claims and the surface implausibility
of those claims persuade us that the stay should not have
been granted, and the Court of Appeals' summary order does
not convince us otherwise.

GINSBURG, J.,

dissenting

Accordingly, the application to vacate the stay of execution
is granted.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.

I would deny the application to vacate the stay of Williams' execution. A diligent appellate court has granted a
certificate of probable cause and scheduled this case for argument on May 13. Those actions signal to me the existence
of reasons, not the absence of reasons, for granting a stay.
At the very least, before acting irretrievably, this Court
might have invited prompt clarification of the Court of Appeals' order. Appreciation of our own fallibility, and respect
for the judgment of an appellate tribunal closer to the scene
than we are, as I see it, demand as much.
