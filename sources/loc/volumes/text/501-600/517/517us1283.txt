AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RULES
OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Rule 32. Sentence and judgment.
(d) Judgment.
(2) Criminalforfeiture.-If a verdict contains a finding that property is subject to a criminal forfeiture, or
if a defendant enters a guilty plea subjecting property
to such forfeiture, the court may enter a preliminary
order of forfeiture after providing notice to the defendant and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on the timing and form of the order. The order of forfeiture shall
authorize the Attorney General to seize the property
subject to forfeiture, to conduct any discovery that the
court considers proper to help identify, locate, or dispose
of the property, and to begin proceedings consistent
with any statutory requirements pertaining to ancillary
hearings and the rights of third parties. At sentencing,
a final order of forfeiture shall be made part of the sentence and included in the judgment. The court may include in the final order such conditions as may be reasonably necessary to preserve the value of the property
pending any appeal.
