CITY OF CHICAGO ET AL. V. INTERNATIONAL
COLLEGE OF SURGEONS ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 96-910.

Argued October 14, 1997-Decided December 15, 1997

Following the preliminary determination of Chicago's Historical and Architectural Landmarks Commission (Commission) that two of respondent ICS' buildings qualified for protection under the city's Landmarks
Ordinance, the city enacted a Designation Ordinance creating a landmark district that included the buildings. ICS then applied to the Commission for permits to allow demolition of all but the facades of the
buildings. The Commission denied ICS' permit applications. ICS then
filed actions in state court under the Illinois Administrative Review
Law for judicial review of the Commission's decisions, alleging, among
other things, that the two ordinances and the manner in which the Commission conducted its proceedings violated the Federal and State Constitutions, and seeking on-the-record review of the Commission's decisions. Petitioners (collectively the City) removed the suits to Federal
District Court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction. The District Court consolidated the cases, exercised supplemental jurisdiction
over the state law claims, and granted summary judgment for the City,
ruling that the ordinances and the Commission's proceedings were consistent with the Federal and State Constitutions and that the Commission's findings were supported by the evidence and were not arbitrary
and capricious. The Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded to state
court, ruling that a federal district court lacks jurisdiction of a case
containing state law claims for on-the-record review of local administrative action.
Held. A case containing claims that local administrative action violates
federal law, but also containing state law claims for on-the-record review
of the administrative findings, can be removed to federal district court.
Pp. 163-174.
(a) The District Court properly exercised federal question jurisdiction over ICS' federal claims, and properly recognized that it could thus
also exercise supplemental jurisdiction over ICS' state law claims. Defendants generally may remove "any civil action brought in a State
court of which the [federal] district courts ...

have original jurisdic-

28 U. S. C. § 1441(a). The district courts' original jurisdiction

Syllabus
encompasses cases "arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of
the United States," § 1331, and an action satisfies this requirement when
the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint raises issues of federal law, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 63. ICS' state court complaints raised a number of such issues in the form of various federal
constitutional challenges to the Landmarks and Designation Ordinances,
and to the manner in which the Commission conducted its proceedings.
Once the case was removed, ICS' state law claims were properly before
the District Court under the supplemental jurisdiction statute. That
statute provides, "in any civil action of which the district courts have
original jurisdiction, thety] shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all
other claims that . . . form part of the same case or controversy."
§ 1367(a). Here, ICS' state law claims are legal "claims" in the sense
that that term is generally used to denote a judicially cognizable cause
of action, and they and the federal claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact, see Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 3883 U. S. 715, 725.
Pp. 163-166.
(b) ICS' argument that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because
its complaints contained state law claims requiring deferential, on-therecord review of the Commission's decisions stems from the erroneous
premise that those claims must be "civil actions" within the federal
courts' "original jurisdiction" under § 1441(a) for removal purposes.
Because this is a federal question case, the District Court's original
jurisdiction derives not from ICS' state law claims, but from its federal
claims, which satisfy § 1441(a)'s requirements. Having thus established
federal jurisdiction, the relevant inquiry respecting the accompanying
state claims is whether they fall within a district court's supplemental
jurisdiction, and that inquiry turns on whether they satisfy § 1367(a)'s
requirements. ICS' proposed approach would effectively read the supplemental jurisdiction statute out of the books: The whole point of supplemental jurisdiction is to allow the district courts to exercise pendent
jurisdiction over claims as to which original jurisdiction is lacking.
Pp. 166-168.
(c) This Court also disagrees with ICS' reasoning to the extent ICS
means to suggest that a claim involving deferential review of a local
administrative decision can never be "so related to claims... within...
original jurisdiction that [it] form[s] part of the same case or controversy" for purposes of supplemental jurisdiction under § 1367(a). While
Congress could establish an exception to supplemental jurisdiction for
such claims, the statute, as written, bears no such construction, as it
confers jurisdiction without reference to the nature of review. Nor do
Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Stude, 346 U. S. 574, 581, and Horton v.

158 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
Syllabus
Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 367 U. S. 348, 354-355, require that an equivalent
exception be read into the statute. To the extent that these cases
might be read to establish limits on the scope of federal jurisdiction,
they address only whether a cause of action for judicial review of a state
administrative decision is within the district courts' original jurisdiction
under the diversity statute, § 1332, not whether it is a claim within the
district courts' pendent jurisdiction in federal question cases. Even assuming, arguendo, that the decisions are relevant to the latter question,
both indicate that federal jurisdiction generally encompasses judicial review of state administrative decisions. See Stude, supra, at 578-579;
Horton, supra, at 352. Pp. 168-172.
(d) That § 1367(a) authorizes district courts to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over state law claims for on-the-record review of administrative decisions does not mean that the jurisdiction must be exercised
in all cases. The district courts can decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over such claims in the interests of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity. See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484
U. S. 343, 357; Gibbs, supra, at 726-727. The supplemental jurisdiction
statute enumerates situations in which district courts can refuse to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, § 1367(c), taking into account such factors as the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the state
law claims, the character of the governing state law, and the relationship
between the state and federal claims. District courts also may be obligated not to decide state law claims (or to stay their adjudication) where
one of the abstention doctrines applies. See, e. g., Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 716. Pp. 172-174.
(e) ICS' contentions that abstention principles required the District
Court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, and that the
court should have done so under § 1367(c), are left for the Seventh Circuit to address in the first instance. P. 174.

O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
The city of Chicago, like municipalities throughout the
country, has an ordinance that provides for the designation
and protection of historical landmarks. Chicago Municipal
Code, Art. XVII, §§2-120-580 through 2-120-920 (1990).
The city's Landmarks Ordinance is administered by the Commission on Chicago Historical and Architectural Landmarks
(Chicago Landmarks Commission or Commission). Pursuant to the Illinois Administrative Review Law, Ill. Comp.
Stat., ch. 735, §§ 5/3-103, 5/3-104 (Supp. 1997), judicial review
of final decisions of a municipal landmarks commission lies in
state circuit court. In this case, we are asked to consider
whether a lawsuit ified in the Circuit Court of Cook County
seeking judicial review of decisions of the Chicago Landmarks Commission may be removed to federal district court,
where the case contains both federal constitutional and state
administrative challenges to the Commission's decisions.
JUSTICE

I
Respondents International College of Surgeons and the
United States Section of the International College of Surgeons (jointly ICS) own two properties on North Lake Shore
Drive in the city of Chicago. In July 1988, the Chicago
Landmarks Commission made a preliminary determination
that seven buildings on Lake Shore Drive, including two
*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the State of Indiana by Jeffrey A. Modisett, Attorney General, and Geoffrey Slaughter
and Anthony Scott Chinn, Deputy Attorneys General; for Defenders of
Property Rights by Nancie G. Marzulla; and for the National Trust for

Opinion of the Court

mansions on ICS' properties, qualified for designation as a
landmark district under the city's Landmarks Ordinance. In
June 1989, the city council enacted an ordinance (the Designation Ordinance) designating the landmark district.
In February 1989, after the Commission's preliminary
determination, ICS executed a contract for the sale and
redevelopment of its properties. The contract called for the
developer, whose interest has since been acquired by respondent Robin Construction Company, to demolish all but
the facades of the two mansions and to construct a high-rise
condominium tower. In October 1990, ICS applied to the
Landmarks Commission for the necessary permits to allow
demolition of a designated landmark. The Commission denied the permit applications, finding that the proposed demolition would "adversely affect and destroy significant historical and architectural features of the [landmark] district."
App. 49. ICS then reapplied for the permits under a provision of the Landmarks Ordinance allowing for exceptions in
cases of economic hardship. The Commission again denied
the applications, finding that ICS did not qualify for the
hardship exception.
Following each of the Commission's decisions, ICS filed actions for judicial review in the Circuit Court of Cook County
pursuant to the Illinois Administrative Review Law. Both
of ICS' complaints raised a number of federal constitutional
claims, including that the Landmarks and Designation Ordinances, both on their face and as applied, violate the Due
Process and Equal Protection Clauses and effect a taking
of property without just compensation under the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments, and that the manner in which the
Commission conducted its administrative proceedings violated ICS' rights to due process and equal protection. The
complaints also sought relief under the Illinois Constitution
as well as administrative review of the Commission's decisions denying the permits.

Opinion of the Court

The defendants (collectively City), who are petitioners in
this Court, removed both lawsuits to the District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois on the basis of federal question jurisdiction. The District Court consolidated the cases.
After dismissing some of the constitutional claims and exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims,
the court granted summary judgment in favor of the City,
ruling that the Landmarks and Designation Ordinances and
the Commission's proceedings were consistent with the Federal and State Constitutions, and that the Commission's
findings were supported by the evidence in the record and
were not arbitrary and capricious.'
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and
remanded the case to state court, concluding that the District Court was without jurisdiction. 91 F. 3d 981 (1996).
The Seventh Circuit began its analysis by construing this
Court's decisions in Chicago, R. L & P. R. Co. v. Stude, 346
U. S. 574 (1954), and Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 367
U. S. 348 (1961), which it read to suggest that "the character
of the state judicial action" is significant when assessing
whether proceedings to review state and local administrative
decisions can be removed to federal court. 91 F. 3d, at 988.
The court reasoned that, while Stude and Horton establish
that proceedings to conduct de novo review of state agency
action are subject to removal, the propriety of removing proceedings involving deferential review is still an open question. Relying on decisions from other Courts of Appeals
that interpret the scope of a district court's diversity jurisdiction, the court determined that deferential review of state
agency action was an appellate function that was "inconsistIThe District Court also dismissed a third action filed by ICS,which is
not in issue here. That action sought review of ICS'unsuccessful efforts
to obtain approval for its proposed development under the Lake Michigan
and Chicago Lakefront Protection Ordinance, Chicago Municipal Code,
ch. 194B (1973), which, in addition to the Designation Ordinance, restricts
modification of ICS' properties.

Opinion of the Court

ent with the character of a court of original jurisdiction."
91 F. 3d, at 990 (citing Fairfax County Redevelopment &
Housing Authority v. W.M. Schlosser Co., 64 F. 3d 155 (CA4
1995), and Armistead v. C & M Transport,Inc., 49 F. 3d 43
(CA1 1995)). Accordingly, the court concluded, a proceeding
to review state administrative action under a deferential
standard is not a "civil action" within a district court's "original jurisdiction" under the removal statute, 28 U. S. C.
§ 1441(a), and so cannot be removed. 91 F. 3d, at 990.
The court then applied those principles to this case. The
court began by observing that, under the Illinois Administrative Review Law, judicial review of local administrative decisions is deferential and not de novo, because the reviewing
court must accept the agency's findings of fact as presumptively correct and cannot hear new evidence. Id., at 991-992
(discussing Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 735, § 5/3-110 (Supp. 1997)).2
Of the various claims raised in ICS' complaints, the court
explained, the as-applied constitutional challenges and the
claims requesting administrative review of the Commission's
decisions are bound by the administrative record, but the
facial constitutional challenges are independent of the record
and so would be removable to federal court if brought alone.
The court then addressed whether, "when the state action
involves both claims that, if brought alone, would be removable to federal court [and] issues that clearly are grounded
in the administrative record, removal of the entire state action to the district court is possible." 91 F. 3d, at 993. The
court ruled that, because some of the claims involve deferen2Section 5/3-110 provides: "Every action to review any final administrative decision shall be heard and determined by the court with all convenient speed. The hearing and determination shall extend to all questions
of law and fact presented by the entire record before the court. No new
or additional evidence in support of or in opposition to any finding, order,
determination or decision of the administrative agency shall be heard by
the court. The findings and conclusions of the administrative agency on
questions of fact shall be held to be prima facie true and correct."

Opinion of the Court

tial review, "the case removed to the district court cannot be
termed a 'civil action ... of which the district courts...
have original jurisdiction' within the meaning of" the removal statute. Id., at 994 (quoting 28 U. S. C. § 1441(a)).
We granted certiorari to address whether a case containing claims that local administrative action violates federal
law, but also containing state law claims for on-the-record
review of the administrative findings, is within the jurisdiction of federal district courts. 520 U. S. 1164 (1997). Because neither the jurisdictional statutes nor our prior decisions suggest that federal jurisdiction is lacking in these
circumstances, we now reverse.
II
A
We have reviewed on several occasions the circumstances
in which cases filed initially in state court may be removed
to federal court. See, e. g., CaterpillarInc. v. Williams, 482
U. S. 386, 391-392 (1987); MetropolitanLife Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 63 (1987); FranchiseTax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463
U. S. 1, 7-12 (1983). As a general matter, defendants may
remove to the appropriate federal district court "any civil
action brought in a State court of which the district courts
of the United States have original jurisdiction." 28 U. S. C.
§ 1441(a). The propriety of removal thus depends on
whether the case originally could have been filed in federal
court. CaterpillarInc., supra, at 392; Franchise Tax Bd.,
supra, at 8. The district courts have original jurisdiction
under the federal question statute over cases "arising under
the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."
§ 1331. "It is long settled law that a cause of action arises
under federal law only when the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint raises issues of federal law." MetropolitanLife Ins.
Co., supra, at 63.

164 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
Opinion of the Court

In this case, there can be no question that ICS' state court
complaints raised a number of issues of federal law in the
form of various federal constitutional challenges to the Landmarks and Designation Ordinances, and to the manner in
which the Commission conducted the administrative proceedings. It is true, as ICS asserts, that the federal constitutional claims were raised by way of a cause of action created by state law, namely, the Illinois Administrative Review
Law. See Howard v. Lawton, 22 Ill. 2d 331, 333, 175 N. E.
2d 556, 557 (1961) (constitutional claims may be raised in
a complaint for administrative review). As we have explained, however, "[e]ven though state law creates [a party's]
causes of action, its case might still 'arise under' the laws of
the United States if a well-pleaded complaint established
that its right to relief under state law requires resolution of
a substantial question of federal law." Franchise Tax Bd.,
463 U. S., at 13; see also id., at 27-28 (case arises under federal law when "federal law creates the cause of action or...
the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law"); Gully v. First
Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, 112 (1936) (federal
question exists when a "right or immunity created by the
Constitution or laws of the United States [is] an element, and
an essential one, of the plaintiff's cause of action"). ICS'
federal constitutional claims, which turn exclusively on federal law, unquestionably fit within this rule. Accordingly,
ICS errs in relying on the established principle that a plaintiff, as master of the complaint, can "choose to have the cause
heard in state court." CaterpillarInc., 482 U. S., at 398399. By raising several claims that arise under federal law,
ICS subjected itself to the possibility that the City would
remove the case to the federal courts. See ibid.
As for ICS' accompanying state law claims, this Court has
long adhered to principles of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction by which the federal courts' original jurisdiction over
federal questions carries with it jurisdiction over state law

Cite as: 522 U. S. 156 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

claims that "derive from a common nucleus of operative
fact," such that "the relationship between [the federal] claim
and the state claim permits the conclusion that the entire
action before the court comprises but one constitutional
'case."' Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715, 725 (1966);
see Hum v. Oursler, 289 U. S. 238 (1933); Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 213 U. S. 175 (1909). Congress has
codified those principles in the supplemental jurisdiction
statute, which combines the doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction under a common heading. 28 U. S. C.
§ 1367. The statute provides, "in any civil action of which
the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district
courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other
claims that are so related to claims in the action within such
original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or
controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution." § 1367(a). That provision applies with equal force to
cases removed to federal court as to cases initially filed
there; a removed case is necessarily one "of which the district courts .

.

. have original jurisdiction."

See § 1441(a);

Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U. S. 343, 350-351
(1988) (discussing pendent claims removed to federal court).
Here, once the case was removed, the District Court had
original jurisdiction over ICS' claims arising under federal
law, and thus could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
the accompanying state law claims so long as those claims
constitute "other claims that.., form part of the same case
or controversy." § 1367(a). We think it clear that they do.
The claims for review of the Commission's decisions are legal
"claims," in the sense that that term is generally used in
this context to denote a judicially cognizable cause of action.
And the state and federal claims "derive from a common nucleus of operative fact," Gibbs, supra, at 725, namely, ICS'
unsuccessful efforts to obtain demolition permits from the
Chicago Landmarks Commission. That is all the statute
requires to establish supplemental jurisdiction (barring an

166 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
Opinion of the Court

express statutory exception, see § 1367(a)). ICS seemed to
recognize as much in the amended complaint it ified in the
District Court following removal, stating that the nonfederal
claims "are subject to this Court's pendent jurisdiction."
App. 143. We conclude, in short, that the District Court
properly exercised federal question jurisdiction over the federal claims in ICS' complaints, and properly recognized that
it could thus also exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
ICS' state law claims.
B
ICS, urging us to adopt the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, argues that the District Court was without jurisdiction over its actions because they contain state law claims
that require on-the-record review of the Landmarks Commission's decisions. A claim that calls for deferential judicial review of a state administrative determination, ICS asserts, does not constitute a "civil action .

.

. of which the

district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction" under 28 U. S. C. § 1441(a).
That reasoning starts with an erroneous premise. Because this is a federal question case, the relevant inquiry is
not, as ICS submits, whether its state claims for on-therecord review of the Commission's decisions are "civil actions" within the "original jurisdiction" of a district court:
The District Court's original jurisdiction derives from ICS'
federal claims, not its state law claims. Those federal claims
suffice to make the actions "civil actions" within the "original
jurisdiction" of the district courts for purposes of removal.
§ 1441(a). The Court of Appeals, in fact, acknowledged that
ICS' federal claims, "if brought alone, would be removable
to federal court." 91 F. 3d, at 993. Nothing in the jurisdictional statutes suggests that the presence of related state
law claims somehow alters the fact that ICS' complaints, by
virtue of their federal claims, were "civil actions" within the
federal courts' "original jurisdiction."

Cite as: 522 U. S. 156 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

Having thus established federal jurisdiction, the relevant
inquiry respecting the accompanying state claims is whether
they fall within a district court's supplemental jurisdiction,
not its original jurisdiction. And that inquiry turns, as we
have discussed, on whether the state law claims "are so related to [the federal] claims ...that they form part of the
same case or controversy." § 1367(a); see Gibbs, supra, at
725, n. 12 (distinguishing between "the issue whether a claim
for relief qualifies as a case 'arising under ... the Laws of
the United States' and the issue whether federal and state
claims constitute one 'case' for pendent jurisdiction purposes"). ICS' proposed approach-that we first determine
whether its state claims constitute "civil actions" within a
district court's "original jurisdiction"-would effectively
read the supplemental jurisdiction statute out of the books:
The whole point of supplemental jurisdiction is to allow the
district courts to exercise pendent jurisdiction over claims
as to which original jurisdiction is lacking.
The dissent attributes a different line of argument to ICS.
Post, at 186-187. That argument, roughly speaking, is that
federal jurisdiction would lie over ICS' federal claims if they
had been brought under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, because review
would then range beyond the administrative record; but ICS
deliberately confined review of its claims to the administrative record by raising them under the Illinois Administrative
Review Law, thereby assuring itself a state forum. See
Brief for Respondents 21-26. The essential premise of ICS'
argument is that its actions arise solely under state law and
so are not within the district courts' federal question jurisdiction, and that § 1367(a)-which presupposes a "civil action
of which the district courts have original jurisdiction"-is
thus inapplicable. Id., at 15-21.
That reasoning is incorrect because ICS in fact raised
claims not bound by the administrative record (its facial constitutional claims), see supra,at 162, and because, as we have
explained, see supra, at 164, the facial and as-applied federal

168 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
Opinion of the Court

constitutional claims raised by ICS "arise under" federal law
for purposes of federal question jurisdiction. See New Orleans PublicService, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans,
491 U. S. 350, 372 (1989) ("[A] facial challenge to an allegedly
unconstitutional.., zoning ordinance" is a claim "which we
would assuredly not require to be brought in state courts").
ICS submits, however, that although its complaints contain
some claims that arise under federal law, its actions nonetheless do not fall within the district courts' original jurisdiction
over federal questions. Brief for Respondents 20-21, 26.
Understandably, ICS does not rest this proposition on the
notion that its federal claims are so insubstantial as not to
establish federal jurisdiction. See, e. g., Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 817 (1986);
Duke Power Co. v. CarolinaEnvironmental Study Group,
Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 70-71 (1978); Gibbs, 383 U. S., at 725. It
follows, then, that ICS' view that the district courts lack jurisdiction even over the federal claims in its actions stems
from the mistaken idea-embraced by the court below, see
91 F. 3d, at 993-994, and n. 14-that the other, nonfederal
claims somehow take the complaints in their entirety (including the federal claims) out of the federal courts' jurisdiction.
ICS' rationale thus ultimately devolves into the erroneous
argument we ascribe to it: that its state law claims for onthe-record review of the Commission's decisions must be
"civil actions" within the district courts' "original jurisdiction" in order for its complaints to be removable to federal
court.
C
To the extent that ICS means to suggest not only that a
claim involving deferential review of a local administrative
decision is not a "civil action" in the "original jurisdiction"
of the district courts, but also that such a claim can never
constitute a claim "so related to claims ... within such origi-

nal jurisdiction that [it] form[s] part of the same case or controversy" for purposes of supplemental jurisdiction, we dis-

Cite as: 522 U. S. 156 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

agree with its reasoning. There is nothing in the text of
§1367(a) that indicates an exception to supplemental jurisdiction for claims that require on-the-record review of a state
or local administrative determination. Instead, the statute
generally confers supplemental jurisdiction over "all other
claims" in the same case or controversy as a federal question,
without reference to the nature of review. Congress could
of course establish an exception to supplemental jurisdiction
for claims requiring deferential review of state administrative decisions, but the statute, as written, bears no such
construction.
Nor do our decisions in Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Stude,
346 U. S. 574 (1954), and Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 367
U, S. 348 (1961), on which ICS principally relies, require that
we read an equivalent exception into the statute. Both
Stude and Horton-to the extent that either might be read
to establish limits on the scope of federal jurisdiction-address only whether a cause of action for judicial review of
a state administrative decision is within the district courts'
original jurisdiction under the diversity statute, 28 U. S. C.
§ 1332, not whether it is a claim within the district courts'
pendent jurisdiction in federal question cases. Even assuming, arguendo, that the decisions are relevant to the latter
question, both Stude and Horton indicate that federal jurisdiction generally encompasses judicial review of state administrative decisions.
In Stude, for instance, a railroad company challenging the
amount of a condemnation assessment attempted to establish
federal jurisdiction by two separate routes. First, the railroad filed a complaint seeking review of the amount of the
assessment in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, and second, it ified an appeal from the assessment in
state court and then undertook to remove that case to federal court. As to the action ified directly in federal court,
this Court upheld its dismissal, finding that state eminent
domain proceedings were still pending and that the com-

170 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
Opinion of the Court

plaint thus improperly attempted to "separate the question
of damages and try it apart from the substantive right from
which the claim for damages arose." 346 U. S., at 582. ICS
emphasizes the Court's observation in this interlocutory context that a district court "does not sit to review on appeal
action taken administratively or judicially in a state proceeding." Id., at 581. By that remark, however, the Court did
not suggest that jurisdiction turned on whether judicial review of the administrative determination was deferential or
de novo. The decision, in fact, makes no reference to the
standard of review.
Moreover, reading the Court's statement broadly to suggest that federal courts can never review local administrative decisions would conflict with the Court's treatment of
the second action in the case: the railroad's attempt to remove its state court appeal to federal court. With respect
to that action, the Court held that removal was improper in
the particular circumstances because the railroad was the
plaintiff in state court. But the Court observed that, as a
general matter, a state court action for judicial review of an
administrative condemnation proceeding is "in its nature a

United States District Court." Id., at 578-579; see County
ofAllegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., 360 U. S. 185, 195 (1959)
("Although holding that the respondent could not remove a
state condemnation case to the Federal District Court on
diversity grounds because he was the plaintiff in the state
proceeding, the Court [in Stude] clearly recognized that the
defendant in such a proceeding could remove in accordance
with § 1441 and obtain a federal adjudication of the issues
involved"). If anything, then, Stude indicates that the jurisdiction of federal district courts encompasses ICS' claims
for review of the Landmarks Commission's decisions.
Horton is to the same effect, holding that a District Court
had jurisdiction under the diversity statute to review a state

Opinion of the Court

workers' compensation award. 367 U. S., at 352. The bulk
of the opinion addresses the central issue in the case,
whether the suit satisfied the amount-in-controversy threshold for diversity jurisdiction. See id., at 352-354; id., at
355-363 (Clark, J., dissenting). But the plaintiff also alleged, based on Stude, that diversity jurisdiction was lacking
because the action was an appeal from a state administrative
order, to which the Court simply responded that, "[a]side
from many other relevant distinctions which need not be
pointed out," the suit in fact was a "trial de novo" and not
an appellate proceeding. 367 U. S., at 354-355. The Court
did not purport to hold that the de novo standard was a precondition to federal jurisdiction.
Any negative inference that might be drawn from that aspect of Horton, even assuming that the decision speaks to
the scope of supplemental (and not diversity) jurisdiction,
would be insufficient to trump the absence of indication in
§ 1367(a) that the nature of review bears on whether a claim
is within a district court's supplemental jurisdiction. After
all, district courts routinely conduct deferential review pursuant to their original jurisdiction over federal questions, including on-the-record review of federal administrative action. See Califano v. Sanders, 430 U. S. 99, 105-107 (1977).
Nothing in § 1367(a) suggests that district courts are without
supplemental jurisdiction over claims seeking precisely the
same brand of review of local administrative determinations.
Cf. Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist.,
Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 206 (1982) (interpreting Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20
U. S. C. § 1415(e), which contemplates deferential review of
state administrative action).
The dissent disagrees with our conclusion that 28 U. S. C.
§ 1367(a) encompasses state law claims for on-the-record review of local administrative action, but it is unclear exactly
why, for the dissent never directly challenges our application

172 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
Opinion of the Court

of that statute to ICS' claims. In fact, the dissent only
makes passing reference to the terms of § 1367(a), which, in
our view, resolve the case. In this light, the dissent's candid
misgivings about attempting to square its position with the
text of the jurisdictional statutes, see post, at 176, 183-184,
are understandable. And the failure to come to grips with
the text of § 1367(a) explains the dissent's repeated assumption, post, at 175, 177, 182, 185-186, that the jurisdictional
analysis of diversity cases would be no different. But to
decide that state law claims for on-the-record review of a
local agency's decision fall within the district courts' "supplemental" jurisdiction under § 1367(a), does not answer the
question, nor do we, whether those same claims, if brought
alone, would substantiate the district courts' "original" jurisdiction over diversity cases under § 1332. Ultimately, the
dissent never addresses this case as it is presented: a case
containing federal questions within the meaning of § 1331
and supplemental state law claims within the meaning of
§ 1367(a).
III
Of course, to say that the terms of § 1367(a) authorize the
district courts to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
state law claims for on-the-record review of administrative
decisions does not mean that the jurisdiction must be exercised in all cases. Our decisions have established that pendent jurisdiction "is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiff's
right," Gibbs, 383 U. S., at 726, and that district courts can
decline to exercise jurisdiction over pendent claims for a
number of valid reasons, id., at 726-727. See also Cohill,
484 U. S., at 350 ("As articulated by Gibbs, the doctrine of
pendent jurisdiction thus is a doctrine of flexibility, designed
to allow courts to deal with cases involving pendent claims
in the manner that most sensibly accommodates a range of
concerns and values"). Accordingly, we have indicated that
"district courts [should] deal with cases involving pendent
claims in the manner that best serves the principles of econ-

Cite as: 522 U. S. 156 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

omy, convenience, fairness, and comity which underlie the
pendent jurisdiction doctrine." Id., at 357.
The supplemental jurisdiction statute codifies these principles. After establishing that supplemental jurisdiction encompasses "other claims" in the same case or controversy
as a claim within the district courts' original jurisdiction,
§1367(a), the statute confirms the discretionary nature of
supplemental jurisdiction by enumerating the circumstances
in which district courts can refuse its exercise:
"(c) The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if"(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of
State law,
"(2) the claim substantially predominates over the
claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,
"(3) the district court has dismissed all claims over
which it has original jurisdiction, or
"(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other
compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction." 28
U. S. C. § 1367(c).
Depending on a host of factors, then-including the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the state
law claims, the character of the governing state law, and the
relationship between the state and federal claims-district
courts may decline to exercise jurisdiction over supplemental state law claims. The statute thereby reflects the understanding that, when deciding whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, "a federal court should consider and weigh
in each case, and at every stage of the litigation, the values of
judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity." Cohilt,
supra, at 350. In this case, the District Court decided that
those interests would be best served by exercising jurisdiction over ICS' state law claims. App. to Pet. for Cert.
45a-46a.

174

CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
Opinion of the Court

In addition to their discretion under § 1367(c), district
courts may be obligated not to decide state law claims (or to
stay their adjudication) where one of the abstention doctrines articulated by this Court applies. Those doctrines
embody the general notion that "federal courts may decline
to exercise their jurisdiction, in otherwise exceptional circumstances, where denying a federal forum would clearly
serve an important countervailing interest, for example
where abstention is warranted by considerations of proper
constitutional adjudication, regard for federal-state relations,
or wise judicial administration." Quackenbush v. Allstate
Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 716 (1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We have recently outlined the various abstention principles, see ibid., and need not elaborate
them here except to note that there may be situations in
which a district court should abstain from reviewing local
administrative determinations even if the jurisdictional prerequisites are otherwise satisfied.
IV
The District Court properly recognized that it could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over ICS' state law claims, including the claims for on-the-record administrative review of
the Landmarks Commission's decisions. ICS contends that
abstention principles required the District Court to decline
to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, and also alludes to its
contention below that the District Court should have refused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1367(c). We express no view on those matters, but think
it the preferable course to allow the Court of Appeals to
address them in the first instance. Accordingly, we reverse
the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

JUSTICE GINSBURG,

J., dissenting

with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins,

dissenting.
This now-federal case originated as an appeal in state
court from a municipal agency's denials of demolition permits. The review that state law provides is classically appellate in character-on the agency's record, not de novo.
Nevertheless, the Court decides today that this standard
brand of appellate review can be shifted from the appropriate state tribunal to a federal court of first instance at the
option of either party-plaintiff originally or defendant by
removal. The Court approves this enlargement of district
court authority explicitly in federal-question cases, and by
inescapable implication in diversity cases, satisfied that "neither the jurisdictional statutes nor our prior decisions suggest that federal jurisdiction is lacking." Ante, at 163.
The Court's authorization of cross-system appeals qualifies
as a watershed decision. After today, litigants asserting
federal-question or diversity jurisdiction may routinely lodge
in federal courts direct appeals from the actions of all manner of local (county and municipal) agencies, boards, and commissions. Exercising this cross-system appellate authority,
federal courts may now directly superintend local agencies
by affirming, reversing, or modifying their administrative
rulings.
The Court relies on the statutory words found in both 28
U. S. C. §§ 1331 and 1332: "The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions. .. ." Then, as its linchpin, the Court emphasizes the 1990 codification and expansion, in § 1367, of what previously had been known as
"ancillary jurisdiction" and "pendent jurisdiction." Specifically, the Court stresses the broad authorization in § 1367(a)
for district court exercise of "supplemental jurisdiction" over
claims "so related" to a "civil action of which the district
courts have original jurisdiction" as to "form part of the
same [Article III] case or controversy." See ante, at 164-

176 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS

GINsBURG, J., dissenting
169, 171-174.1 The bare words of §§ 1331, 1332, and 1367(a)
permit the Court's construction. For the reasons advanced
in this opinion, however, I do not construe these prescriptions, on allocation of judicial business to federal courts of
first instance, to embrace the category of appellate business
at issue here.
The Court's expansive reading, in my judgment, takes us
far from anything Congress conceivably could have meant.
Cf. Lynch v. Overholser,369 U. S. 705, 710 (1962) ("The decisions of this Court have repeatedly warned against the dangers of an approach to statutory construction which confines
itself to the bare words of a statute, for 'literalness may
strangle meaning.'") (citations omitted). Cross-system appeals, if they are to be introduced into our federal system,
should stem from the National Legislature's considered and
explicit decision. In accord with the views of the large majority of federal judges who have considered the question, I
would hold the cross-system appeal unauthorized by Congress, and affirm the Seventh Circuit's judgment.
I
Until now it has been taken almost for granted that federal
courts of first instance lack authority under §§ 1331 and 1332
to displace state courts as forums for on-the-record review
of state and local agency actions. In Chicago, R. L & P. R.
Co. v. Stude, 346 U. S. 574 (1954), we recalled the historic
understanding: A federal district court "does not sit to review on appeal action taken administratively or judicially in
1 The

Court assumes, although § 1367 does not expressly so provide, that

the section covers cases originating in a state court and removed to a
federal court. Ante, at 165. Although the point has not been briefed, I
do not question that assumption. See Steinman, Supplemental Jurisdiction in § 1441 Removed Cases: An Unsurveyed Frontier of Congress'
Handiwork, 35 Ariz. L. Rev. 305, 308-310 (1993) (observing that arguments
against application of § 1367 to removed cases "are weak").

a state proceeding." Id., at 581.2 Cross-system appellate
authority is entrusted to this Court, we said in Rooker v.
Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923), but it is outside the
domain of the lower federal courts. Interpreting the statutory predecessors of 28 U. S. C. §§ 1331 and 1257, we held in
Rooker that a federal district court could not modify a decision of the Indiana Supreme Court, for only this Court could
exercise such authority. 263 U. S., at 416.
Today, the Court holds that Congress, by enacting § 1367,
has authorized federal district courts to conduct deferential,
on-the-record review of local agency decisions whenever a
federal question is pended to the agency review action. Dismissing, as irrelevant to jurisdiction, the distinction between
de novo and deferential review, the Court also provides easy
access to federal court whenever the dissatisfied party in a
local agency proceeding has the requisite diverse citizenship.
The Court does all this despite the overwhelming weight
of lower federal court decisions disclaiming cross-system appellate authority, and without even a hint from Congress
that so startling a reallocation of power from state courts
was within the national lawmakers'
to federal courts
3
contemplation.
Court in Stude also made the following statement: "When the proceeding has reached the stage of a perfected appeal and the jurisdiction
of the state district court is invoked, it then becomes in its nature a civil
action and subject to removal by the defendant to the United States District Court." Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Stude, 346 U. S., at 578-579.
This statement, made on the way to the Court's conclusion that the District Court lacked removal jurisdiction, does not carry great weight. It
suggests that while the plaintiff in Stude could not have ified the action in
federal court initially under § 1332, the defendant could have removed the
action to federal court pursuant to §1441(a). That suggestion is incorrect,
for "[o]nly state-court actions that originally could have been filed in federal court may be removed to federal court by the defendant." CaterpillarInc. v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386, 392 (1987).
sThe Court's holding can embrace the decisions of state, as opposed to
local, agencies, only if the State consents to the district court's jurisdiction.

Until today, federal habeas corpus proceedings were the
closest we had come to cross-system 'appellate review. See
28 U. S. C. §§ 2241-2254. 4 Unlike the jurisdictional reallocation the Court now endorses, habeas corpus jurisdiction does
not entail direct review of a state or local authority's decision. See Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U. S.518, 523 (1997).
4The Court's citation to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA), ante, at 171, is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, IDEA has
its own jurisdictional provision, so it does not concern §§ 1331, 1332, or
1367. See §615 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
Amendments of 1997, Pub. L. 105-17, 111 Stat. 92, to be codified at 20
U. S. C. § 1415(i)(8)(A); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509
U. S. 1, 4 (1993). Second, IDEA creates a federal regime. While IDEA
may require federal courts to defer to state agency decisions, those decisions are made pursuant to federal legislation.

180 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Notably, in providing for federal habeas corpus review,
Congress has taken great care to avoid interrupting or intruding upon state-court processes. See, e. g., 28 U. S. C.
§2254(b)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (requiring exhaustion of
state remedies before fling a federal petition for writ of habeas corpus). The Court's holding in this "Chicago" case,
however, permits the federal court to supplant the State's entire scheme for judicial review of local administrative actions.
When a local actor or agency violates a person's federal
right, it is indeed true that the aggrieved party may bring
an action under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 without first exhausting
state remedies. See Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457
U. S.496, 516 (1982). But such an action involves no disregard, as the cross-system appeal does, of the separateness of
state and federal adjudicatory systems. In a § 1983 action,
a federal (or state) court inquires whether a person, acting
under color of state law, has subjected another "to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by
the Constitution and [federal] laws." The court exercises
original, not appellate, jurisdiction; it proceeds independently, not as substantial evidence reviewer on a nonfederal
agency's record. As now-Chief Judge Posner explained:
"[A] suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 is not a review proceeding even when ...

it challenges administrative action

that has an adjudicative component. Federal courts
have no general appellate authority over state courts or
state agencies .... The case that is in federal court did

not begin in the state agency but is an independent as
well as an original federal action." Hameetman v. Chicago, 776 F. 2d 636, 640 (CA7 1985).
Ii
To reach its landmark result, the Court holds that a district court may perform cross-system appellate review of administrative agency decisions so long as the plaintiff's complaint also contains related federal claims, for "[t]hose federal

Cite as: 522 U.S. 156 (1997)
GINSBU1RG, J., dissenting

claims suffice to make the actions 'civil actions' within the
'original jurisdiction' of the district courts." Ante, at 166.
Measuring today's disposition against prior decisions concerning proceedings in federal court following a state administrative decision, the Court, ante, at 169-171, takes up Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 367 U. S. 348 (1961), and Stude,
see supra, at 176-177, and n. 2.
Horton was a workers' compensation case proceeding in
federal court on the basis of the parties' diverse citizenship.
The contending parties were an injured worker and the insurance company that served as compensation carrier for the
worker's employer. At the administrative stage, the Texas
Industrial Accident Board made an award of $1,050. Neither side was satisfied. The insurer maintained that the
worker was entitled to no compensation, while the worker
urged his entitlement to the statutory maximum of $14,035.
The insurer brought suit first, filing its complaint in federal
court; one week later, the worker filed a state-court suit and
sought dismissal of the insurer's federal action on alternative
grounds: (1) the matter in controversy did not meet § 1332's
monetary amount requirement (then "in excess of $10,000");
(2) the insurer's suit was "nothing more than an appeal from
a state administrative order" and federal courts have "no
appellate jurisdiction" over such orders, 367 U. S., at 354.
After concluding that the jurisdictional amount requirement was met, the Court turned to the question whether the
federal-court proceeding was in fact an "appeal," and therefore barred under Stude, which, as the Horton Court described it, "held that a United States District Court was
without jurisdiction to consider an appeal 'taken administratively or judicially in a state proceeding."' 367 U. S., at 354
(quoting Stude, 346 U. S., at 581). On that matter, the Texas
Supreme Court's construction of the State's compensation
law left no room for debate. When suit commences, the administrative award is vacated and the court determines liability de novo. See 367 U. S., at 355, n. 15. The suit to set

182 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
GrNsBuRG, J., dissenting

aside an award is thus like any other first instance proceeding-it is "'a suit, not an appeal."' Id., at 354 (quoting
Booth v. Texas Employers' Ins. Assn., 132 Tex. 237, 246, 123
S. W. 2d 322, 328 (1938)).
Remarkably, the Court today asserts that neither Stude
nor Horton "suggest[ed] that jurisdiction turned on whether
judicial review of the administrative determination was deferential or de novo." Ante, at 170; see also ante, at 171
("The Court [in Horton] did not purport to hold that the de
novo standard was a precondition to federal jurisdiction.").
The Court thus casts aside the critical difference between
fresh first instance proceedings not tied to a record made by
a tribunal lower in the hierarchy, and on-the-record substantial evidence review, which cannot fairly be described as anything but appellate in character.
If, as the Court reasons today, the distinction between
de novo and deferential review is inconsequential, then a
district court may, indeed must, entertain cross-system, onthe-record appeals from local agency decisions-without
regard to the presence or absence of any federal questionwhenever the parties meet the diversity-of-citizenship requirement of § 1332. The Court so confirms by noting that,
in accord with Califano v. Sanders, 430 U. S. 99, 105-107
(1977), "district courts routinely conduct deferential review
[of federal administrative action] pursuant to their original
jurisdiction over federal questions." Ante, at 171. Just as
routinely, it now appears, district courts must "conduct deferential review [of local administrative action] pursuant to
their original jurisdiction over [diversity cases]."
The Court's homogenization of de novo proceedings and
appellate review rests on a single case, Califano v. Sanders.
In Sanders,the Court settled a longstanding division of opinion over whether § 10 of the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. §§ 701-704, ranked as an independent grant of subject-matter jurisdiction to federal courts,
allowing them to review the actions of federal agencies,

Cite as: 522 U. S. 156 (1997)
GINSBURG, J.,

dissenting

without regard to the amount in controversy. The Court
held that the APA "does not afford an implied grant of
subject-matter jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency action." 430 U. S., at 107. Nevertheless,
the Court explained, district court review of federal administrative action-when Congress had not prescribed another
review route or specifically excluded review-would persist.
Congress had just dropped the amount-in-controversy
requirement from §1331, thus "fill[ing] the jurisdictional
void." Id., at 106. With the amount-in-controversy deleted, the Court indicated in Sanders, §1331 would assure
fidelity to the presumption that administrative action is subject to judicial review. See id., at 105-106; Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,387 U. S. 136, 141 (1967) (courts generally
hold agency action nonreviewable "only upon a showing of
'clear and convincing evidence' of a contrary legislative intent"); see also Barlow v. Collins, 397 U. S. 159, 166 (1970)
("[J]udicial review of [federal] administrative action is the
rule, and nonreviewability an exception which must be
demonstrated.").
Whatever the reason for the rule implicit in Sanders-that
federal district courts may engage in on-the-record, substantial evidence review of federal agency actions under § 1331Chicago homes in on the statutory language. See Brief for
Petitioners 11, 30, 39. Section 1331 reads: "The district
courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United
States." If deferential, on-the-record review of a federal
agency's action qualifies as a "civil action" within a district
court's "original jurisdiction," Chicago urges, then deferential, on-the-record review of local agency action must fit the
same bill, i.e., such review must qualify as a "civil action"
within the district court's "original jurisdiction."
But one of these things is not necessarily like the other.
I recognize that the bare and identical words "original jurisdiction" and "civil action" in H 1331 and 1332 comport with

184 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

Chicago's view and that of the Court. See supra,at 175. We
would do well, however, to recall in this context a sage and
grave warning: "The tendency to assume that a word which
appears in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with
more than one purpose, has and should have precisely the
same scope in all of them, runs all through legal discussions.
It has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be
guarded against." Cook, "Substance" and "Procedure" in
the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933).
Cases "arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of
the United States" within the meaning of § 1331 compose a
collection smaller than the one fitting within the similarly
worded Clause in Article III of the Constitution, "Cases ...
arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United
States, and Treaties made." See, e.g., Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152 (1908); Shoshone
Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U. S. 505, 513 (1900). Diversity of
citizenship must be complete to proceed under § 1332, see
Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267, 268 (1806), but it may
be "minimal" in interpleader cases brought under § 1335, see
State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523,
530-531 (1967).
Significantly, in assuming that § 1331 ordinarily would be
available when a person complains about arbitrary federal
administrative action, the Court in Sanders never fixed on
the words of § 1331, and never even mentioned in relation
to that provision the terms "civil action" or "original jurisdiction." The Court simply concluded from the legislative
history that Congress meant to fill "an interstitial gap,"
430 U. S., at 107, i. e., Congress meant to hold federal agencies accountable by making their actions subject to judicial
review.
Statutes like the Illinois Administrative Review Law, Ill.
Comp. Stat., ch. 735, §§ 5/3-103, 5/3-104 (Supp. 1997), explicitly provide for state-court judicial review of state and local
agency decisions. Unlike the federal picture the Court con-

fronted in Sanders, there is no void to fill. The gap to which
Sanders attended-the absence of any forum for "nonstatutory" review of federal agency decisions unless § 1331 provided one-simply does not exist in a case brought under a
state measure like the Illinois Administrative Review Law.
I would therefore resist reading Sanders out of context to
mandate cross-system appellate review of local agency
decisions.
III
Just last Term, two Members of today's majority recognized the vital interest States have in developing and elaborating state administrative law, for that law regulates the
citizen's contact with state and local government at every
turn, for example, in gaining life-sustaining public benefits,
obtaining a license, or, as in this case, receiving a permit.
Last Terms lead opinion observed:
"In the States there is an ongoing process by which
state courts and state agencies work to elaborate an administrative law designed to reflect the State's own
rules and traditions concerning the respective scope of
[The
judicial review and administrative discretion ....
elaboration of administrative law.., is one of the primary responsibilities of the state judiciary. Where, as
here, the parties invoke federal principles to challenge
state administrative action, the courts of the State have
a strong interest in integrating those sources of law
within their own system for the proper judicial control
of state officials." Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of
Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 276 (1997). (principal opinion of
KENNEDY, J.,

joined by REHNQUIST, C. J.).

Today's decision jeopardizes the "strong interest" courts of
the State have in controlling the actions of local as well as
state agencies. State court superintendence can now be displaced or dislodged in any case against a local agency in

which the parties are of diverse citizenship and in any case
in which a Fourteenth Amendment plea can be made.
The Court insists that there is no escape from this erosion
of state-court authority. Its explanation is less than compelling. The Court describes as the alternative "ICS' proposed
approach." See ante, at 167. That approach, according to
the Court, would have us determine first "whether [ICS's]
state claims constitute 'civil actions' within a district court's
'original jurisdiction."' Ibid. The Court then demolishes
the supposed approach by observing that it "would effectively read the supplemental jurisdiction statute out of the
books." Ibid.; see also ante, at 167-169.
I do not find in ICS's brief the approach the Court constructs, then destructs. Instead, the argument I do find, see
Brief for Respondents 21-24, runs as follows. Chicago has
tried to persuade the Court that ICS's "Complaints for Administrative Review are no different, than civil rights actions." Id., at 21. See Notice of Removal for Petitioner in
No. 91 C 1587 (ND Ill.), App. 15 ("it appears from the face of
plaintiffs' complaint that this is a civil rights complaint").
ICS acknowledged that it might have chosen to bypass onthe-record administrative review in state court, invoking
federal jurisdiction under § 1983 instead, without exhausting
state remedies. Brief for Respondents 22-24. Had ICS
done so, review would have been "plenary in its scope" and
would not have been "confined by the administrative record."
Id., at 24. But ICS did not take that path. It proceeded
under the Illinois Administrative Review Law seeking resolution of both state-law and federal constitutional issues "in
the context of on-the-record administrative review." Id., at
22. The distinction between the appellate review it sought
and the first instance action it did not bring "is crucial," ICS
argued. Ibid.
In sum, from start to finish, ICS sought accurately to portray the Seventh Circuit's resistance to "federaliz[ing],"
without explicit congressional instruction to do so, "garden-

GINSBURG, J., dissenting

variety appeals from... local administrative decisions," id.,
at 3, appeals in which the federal issues ultimately raised
"are inextricably intertwined with [the State's] administrative review scheme," id., at 4. Not a case in which pendent
or supplemental jurisdiction has ever been exercised is
touched by the argument ICS in fact made, which trained
constantly on the impropriety of cross-system appellate review. Far from urging the Court to "read the supplemental
jurisdiction statute out of the books," ante, at 167, ICS simply asked the Court not to read into § 1867 more than any
other tribunal has conceived to be there. What ICS sought
to convey, the Court obscures: "[T]he City fail[ed] to cite a
single case in which a federal court specifically assumed
pendent or supplemental jurisdiction over an on-the-record
state administrative appeal." Brief for Respondents 24,
n. 11.
IV
Even if the Court were correct in maintaining that Congress thrust local administrative agency on-the-record review proceedings into federal court at the option of either
party, given diversity or an ultimate constitutional argument, the Court's reluctance to "articulat[e] general standards" for the guidance of the lower courts is puzzling. Cf.
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 698 (1984) (after
"articulat[ing] general standards for judging ineffectiveness
[of counsel] claims," the Court considered it "useful to apply
those standards to the facts of th[e] case in order to illustrate
the meaning of the general principles"). ICS, seeking such
guidance, did not simply "allud[e] to" the District Court's
extraordinary course. Cf. ante, at 174. This is a summary
of the points ICS made in urging the impropriety of federalcourt retention of the case, assuming, arguendo, federalcourt power to keep it. The permits in question were
sought under Chicago's Landmarks Ordinance, a measure
"Illinois courts have never had an opportunity to interpret."
Brief for Respondents 4. "The issues of Illinois constitu-

188 CHICAGO v. INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
GINSBURG,

J., dissenting

tional law raised by [ICS] have never been decided by Illinois appellate courts." Ibid. Land-use cases generally,
and landmark designations particularly, implicate "local
policies" and "local concerns." Ibid. Yet all this Court is
willing to say is that "the District Court properly exercised
federal question jurisdiction over the federal claims in
ICS' complaints, and properly recognized that it could thus
also exercise supplemental jurisdiction over ICS' state law
claims." Ante, at 166. The Court's opinion expresses "no
[further] view." Ante, at 174.
The District Court disposed of ICS's federal equal protection and due process claims in less than 13 pages of its 63page opinion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a-46a, and then devoted over 40 pages more to the state-law claims. Id., at
46a-89a. That court wrote at greatest length on whether
the Landmarks Commission's conclusions were "Against the
Manifest Weight of the Evidence." Id., at 73a-89a. Finally, the District Court "affirm[ed] the Commission's decisions." Id., at 89a. It would have been in order for this
Court to have recalled, in face of the District Court's
federal-claims-first approach, the "fundamental rule of judicial restraint" that federal courts "will not reach constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding
them." Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U. S. 138, 157 (1984).
As a rule, potentially dispositive state-law challenges, not
ultimate constitutional questions, should be cleared first.
See, e.g., Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 546-547 (1974).
When local official actions are contested on state and federal grounds, and particularly when construction of a state
measure or local ordinance is at issue, the state questions
stand at the threshold. In this case, for example, had ICS's
construction of the Landmarks Ordinance prevailed, no federal constitutional question would have ripened. The Court
does note that § 1367(c) "enumerat[es] the circumstances in
which district courts can refuse [to] exercise [supplemental

Cite as: 522 U. S. 156 (1997)
GINSBURG, J., dissenting

jurisdiction]," ante, at 173, but as to that, the Court simply
reports: "[T]he District Court decided [judicial economy,
convenience, fairness, and comity] would be best served by
5
exercising jurisdiction over ICS' state law claims," ibid.
The Court also mentions, abstractly, that "district courts
may be obligated not to decide state law claims (or to stay
their adjudication) where one of the abstention doctrines
articulated by this Court applies." Ante, at 174.
Section 1367(c), which concerns supplemental jurisdiction,
will have no utility in diversity cases where, if jurisdiction
exists, it is generally not within the court's discretion to "decline." And lower courts have found our abstention pronouncements "less than pellucid." See R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts
and the Federal System 1247, 1251 (4th ed. 1996). Which of
our "various abstention principles," ante, at 174, should the
lower federal courts consult when asked to review as an appellate instance, and affirm, modify, or reverse, a local license
or permit denial? To dispel confusion and advance comity,
should the lower courts endeavor to fashion-and will we
eventually declare-a "Chicago" abstention doctrine?
Given the state forum to which ICS resorted, and the
questions it raised there, see App. 26-35, 76-77, ICS's primary contention is clear: The Commission should have
granted, under state law, demolition permits or an economic
hardship exception. I do not comprehend the Court's reasons for suggesting that the District Court may have acted
5But cfd PennhurstState School and Hospitalv. Halderman,465 U. S.,

properly in holding on to this case, rather than allowing the
state courts to proceed in their normal course.
V
In Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689 (1992), we addressed the question whether civil actions for divorce, alimony, or child custody fall within § 1332 when the parties
are of diverse citizenship. Nothing in the text of the Constitution or in the words of § 1332 excluded parties from bringing such "civil actions" in federal court. Historically, however, decrees terminating marriages had been considered
wholly within the State's domain. See Barber v. Barber,21
How. 582 (1859). That understanding, we noted in Ankenbrandt, had prevailed "for nearly a century and a half." 504
U. S., at 694-695. "Given the long passage of time without
any expression of congressional dissatisfaction," we reaffirmed the absence of statutory jurisdiction for federal court
adjudication of original civil actions for divorce, alimony, and
child custody. Id., at 703. The Court explained that its
conclusion was also
"supported by sound policy considerations ....

[S]tate

courts are more eminently suited to work of this type
than are federal courts, which lack the close association
with state and local government organizations dedicated
to handling [the] issues [involved]." Id., at 703-704.6
6Ankenbrandt clarified and illustrated "that the domestic relations exception encompasses only cases involving the issuance of a divorce, ali-

mony, or child custody decree"; claims of a kind traditionally adjudicated
in federal courts, for example, tort or contract claims, are not excepted
from federal-court jurisdiction simply because they arise in a domestic
relations context. Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S., at 704. In enacting the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1916, 42 U. S. C.
§ 13931 et seq., Congress reinforced Ankenbrandt by providing expressly
that 28 U. S. C. § 1367 shall not be construed, by reason of a claim arising
under the Act, "to confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction
over any State law claim seeking the establishment of a divorce, alimony,
equitable distribution of marital property, or child custody decree." 42
U. S. C. § 13981(e)(4).

History and policy tug strongly here as well. There surely
has been no "expression of congressional dissatisfaction"
with the near-unanimous view of the Circuits that federal
courts may not engage in cross-system appellate review,
and "the elaboration of [state] administrative law" is a
"prim[e] responsibilit[y] of the state judiciary." Idaho v.
Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S., at 276.
This Court said in Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545,
547-548 (1989):
"It remains rudimentary law that '[a]s regards all courts
of the United States inferior to this tribunal, two things
are necessary to create jurisdiction, whether original or
appellate. The Constitution must have given to the
court the capacity to take it, and an act of Congress
must have supplied it.... To the extent that such action
is not taken, the power lies dormant."' (quoting Mayor
v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 247, 252 (1868)).
As I see it, no Act of Congress adverts to and authorizes
any cross-system appeal from state or local administrative
agency to lower federal court. I would await express legislative direction before proceeding down that road. Accordingly, I would affirm the Seventh Circuit's judgment.
