CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. v. HUNT,
GOVERNOR OF ALABAMA, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA
No. 91-471. Argued April 21, 1992-Decided June 1, 1992
Petitioner, Chemical Waste Management, Inc., operates a commercial hazardous waste land disposal facility in Emelle, Alabama, that receives
both in-state and out-of-state wastes. An Alabama Act imposes, inter
alia, a fee on hazardous wastes disposed of at in-state commercial facilities, and an additional fee on hazardous wastes generated outside, but
disposed of inside, the State. Petitioner filed suit in state court, requesting declaratory relief against respondent state officials and seeking
to enjoin the Act's enforcement. The trial court declared, among other
things, that the additional fee violated the Commerce Clause, finding
that the only basis for the fee is the waste's origin. The State Supreme
Court reversed, holding that the fee advanced legitimate local purposes
that could not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory
alternatives.
Held:
1. Alabama's differential treatment of out-of-state waste violates the
Commerce Clause. Pp. 339-349.
(a) No State may attempt to isolate itself from a problem common
to the several States by raising barriers to the free flow of interstate
commerce. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617; Fort Gratiot
Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post,
p. 353. The State Act's additional fee facially discriminates against hazardous waste generated outside Alabama, and the Act has plainly discouraged the full operation of petitioner's facility. Such a burdensome
tax imposed on interstate commerce alone is generally forbidden and
is typically struck down without further inquiry. However, here the
State argues that the additional fee serves legitimate local purposes.
Pp. 339-343.
(b) Alabama has not met its burden of showing the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve the local interests at stake. See Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising
Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 353. Alabama's concern about the volume of
waste entering the Emelle facility could be alleviated by less discriminatory means-such as applying an additional fee on all hazardous waste
disposed of within Alabama, a per-mile tax on all vehicles transporting
such waste across state roads, or an evenhanded cap on the total ton-

nage landfilled at Emelle-which would curtail volume from all sources.
Additionally, any concern touching on environmental conservation and
Alabama citizens' health and safety does not vary with the waste's point
of origin, and the State has the power to monitor and regulate more
closely the transportation and disposal of all hazardous waste within its
borders. Even possible future financial and environmental risks to be
borne by Alabama do not vary with the waste's State of origin in a way
allowing foreign, but not local, waste to be burdened. Pp. 343-346.
(c) This Court's decisions regarding quarantine laws do not counsel
a different conclusion. The additional fee may not legitimately be
deemed a quarantine law because Alabama permits both the generation
and landfilling of hazardous waste within its borders and the importation of additional hazardous waste. Moreover, the quarantine laws upheld by this Court "did not discriminate against interstate commerce as
such, but simply prevented traffic in noxious articles, whatever their
origin." Philadelphiav. New Jersey, supra,at 629. This Court's decision in Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131-upholding a state ban on the
importation of baitfish after Maine showed that such fish were subject
to parasites foreign to in-state baitfish and that there were no less discriminatory means of protecting its natural resources-likewise offers
no respite to Alabama, since here the hazardous waste is the same
regardless of its point of origin and adequate means other than overt
discrimination meet Alabama's concerns. Pp. 346-348.
2. On remand the Alabama Supreme Court must consider the appropriate relief to petitioner. See, e. g., McKesson Corp. v. Division of
Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulations,
496 U. S. 18, 31. Pp. 348-349.

Opinion of the Court

Supreme Court held that this differential treatment does not
violate the Commerce Clause. We reverse.
I
Petitioner, Chemical Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware
corporation with its principal place of business in Oak Brook,
Illinois, owns and operates one of the Nation's oldest commercial hazardous waste land disposal facilities, located in
Emelle, Alabama. Opened in 1977 and acquired by petitioner in 1978, the Emelle facility is a hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility operating pursuant to
permits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
of 1976 (RCRA), 90 Stat. 2795, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §6901
et seq., and the Toxic Substances Control Act, 90 Stat. 2003,
as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 2601 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. II),
and by the State of Alabama under Ala. Code § 22-30-12(i)
(1990). Alabama is 1 of only 16 States that have commercial
hazardous waste landfills, and the Emelle facility is the
largest of the 21 landfills of this kind located in these 16
States. Brief for National Governors' Assn. et al. as Amici
Curiae 3, citing E. Smith, EI Digest 26-27 (Mar. 1992).
The parties do not dispute that the wastes and substances
being landfilled at the Emelle facility "include substances
that are inherently dangerous to human health and safety
and to the environment. Such waste consists of ignitable,
corrosive, toxic and reactive wastes which contain poisonous
and cancer causing chemicals and which can cause birth defects, genetic damage, blindness, crippling and death."' 584
'As used in RCRA, 42 U. S. C. §6903(5), the term "hazardous waste"
means:
"a solid waste, or combination of solid wastes, which because of its
quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics
may"(A) cause, or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an
increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness; or

338

CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. v. HUNT
Opinion of the Court

So. 2d 1367, 1373 (Ala. 1991). Increasing amounts of out-ofstate hazardous wastes are shipped to the Emelle facility for
permanent storage each year. From 1985 through 1989, the
tonnage of hazardous waste received per year has more than
doubled, increasing from 341,000 tons in 1985 to 788,000 tons
by 1989. Of this, up to 90% of the tonnage permanently buried each year is shipped in from other States.
Against this backdrop Alabama enacted Act No. 90-326
(Act). Ala. Code §§22-30B-1 to 22-30B-18 (1990 and Supp.
1991). Among other provisions, the Act includes a "cap"
that generally limits the amount of hazardous wastes or
substances 2 that may be disposed of in any 1-year period,
and the amount of hazardous waste disposed of during the
first year under the Act's new fees becomes the permanent
ceiling in subsequent years. Ala. Code § 22-30B-2.3 (1990).
The cap applies to commercial facilities that dispose of over
100,000 tons of hazardous wastes or substances per year, but
only the Emelle facility, as the only commercial facility operating within Alabama, meets this description. The Act also
imposes a "base fee" of $25.60 per ton on all hazardous
wastes and substances disposed of at commercial facilities,
to be paid by the operator of the facility. Ala. Code § 2230B-2(a) (Supp. 1991). Finally, the Act imposes the "additional fee" at issue here, which states in full:
"For waste and substances which are generated outside of Alabama and disposed of at a commercial site for
"(B) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or
the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed."
RCRA directs the EPA to establish a comprehensive "cradle to grave"
system regulating the generation, transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes, §§ 6921-6939b, which includes identification and
listing of hazardous wastes, §6921. At present, there are more than 500
such
listed wastes. See 40 CFR pt. 261, subpt. D (1991).
2
"Hazardous substance(s)" and "hazardous waste(s)" are defined terms
in the Act, §§22-30B-1(3) and 22-30B-1(4), but these definitions largely
parallel the meanings given under federal law.

Opinion of the Court

the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances
in Alabama, an additional fee shall be levied at the rate
of $72.00 per ton." § 22-30B-2(b).
Petitioner filed suit in state court requesting declaratory
relief against respondents and seeking to enjoin enforcement
of the Act. In addition to state-law claims, petitioner contended that the Act violated the Commerce, Due Process,
and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution, and was pre-empted by various federal statutes. The
trial court declared the base fee and the cap provisions of
the Act to be valid and constitutional; but, finding the only
basis for the additional fee to be the origin of the waste, the
trial court declared it to be in violation of the Commerce
Clause. App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a-88a. Both sides appealed. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the rulings
concerning the base fee and cap provisions but reversed the
decision regarding the additional fee. The court held that
the fee at issue advanced legitimate local purposes that could
not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory
alternatives and was therefore valid under the Commerce
Clause. 584 So. 2d, at 1390.
Chemical Waste Management, Inc., petitioned for writ of
certiorari, challenging all aspects of the Act. Because of the
importance of the federal question and the likelihood that it
had been decided in a way conflicting with applicable decisions of this Court, this Court's Rule 10.1(c), we granted
certiorari limited to petitioner's Commerce Clause challenge to the additional fee. 502 U. S.1070 (1992). We now
reverse.

CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. v. HUNT
Opinion of the Court

of interstate trade.3 Today, in Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post,
p. 353, we have also considered a Commerce Clause challenge
to a Michigan law prohibiting private landfill operators from
accepting solid waste originating outside the county in which
their facilities operate. In striking down that law, we adhered to our decision in Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437
U. S. 617 (1978), where we found New Jersey's prohibition of
solid waste from outside that State to amount to economic
protectionism barred by the Commerce Clause:
"'[T]he evil of protectionism can reside in legislative
means as well as legislative ends. Thus, it does not
matter whether the ultimate aim of ch. 363 is to reduce
the waste disposal costs of New Jersey residents or to
save remaining open lands from pollution, for we assume
New Jersey has every right to protect its residents'
3

The Alabama Supreme Court assumed that the disposal of hazardous
waste constituted an article of commerce, and the State does not explicitly
argue here to the contrary. In Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.
Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post, at 359, we have reaffirmed
the idea that "[s]olid waste, even if it has no value, is an article of commerce." As stated in Philadelphiav. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 622-623
(1978): "All objects of interstate trade merit Commerce Clause protection;
none is excluded by definition at the outset .... Just as Congress has

power to regulate the interstate movement of these wastes, States are not
free from constitutional scrutiny when they restrict that movement."
The definition of "hazardous waste" makes clear that it is simply a grade
of solid waste, albeit one of particularly noxious and dangerous propensities, see n. 1, supra,but whether the business arrangements between outof-state generators of hazardous waste and the Alabama operator of a
hazardous waste landfill are viewed as "sales" of hazardous waste or "purchases" of transportation and disposal services, "the commercial transactions unquestionably have an interstate character. The Commerce Clause
thus imposes some constraints on [Alabama's] ability to regulate these
transactions." Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, at 359. See National Solid Wastes Management Assn. v. Alabama Dept. of Environmental Mgmt., 910 F. 2d 713, 718-719 (CAll 1990), modified, 924 F. 2d

Opinion of the Court

pocketbooks as well as their environment. And it may
be assumed as well that New Jersey may pursue those
ends by slowing the flow of all waste into the State's
remaining landfills, even though interstate commerce
may incidentally be affected. But whatever New Jersey's ultimate purpose, it may not be accompanied by
discriminating against articles of commerce coming from
outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from
their origin, to treat them differently. Both on its face
and in its plain effect, ch. 363 violates this principle of
nondiscrimination.
"'The Court has consistently found parochial legislation of this kind to be constitutionally invalid, whether
the ultimate aim of the legislation was to assure a steady
supply of milk by erecting barriers to allegedly ruinous
outside competition, Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294
U. S.[511,] 522-524 [(1935)]; or to create jobs by keeping
industry within the State, Foster-FountainPacking Co.
v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1, 10 [(1928)]; Johnson v. Haydel,
278 U. S.16 [(1928)]; Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S.[385,]
403-404 [(1948)]; or to preserve the State's financial
resources from depletion by fencing out indigent immigrants, Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160, 173174 [(1941)].'" Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, at
360 (quoting Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra, at
626-627).
To this list may be added cases striking down a tax discriminating against interstate commerce, even where such tax
was designed to encourage the use of ethanol and thereby
reduce harmful exhaust emissions, New Energy Co. of Ind.
v. Limbach, 486 U. S.269, 279 (1988), or to support inspection
of foreign cement to ensure structural integrity, Hale v.
Bimco Trading, Inc., 306 U. S.375, 379-380 (1939). For in
all of these cases, "a presumably legitimate goal was sought
to be achieved by the illegitimate means of isolating the

342

Opinion of the Court

State from the national economy." Philadelphia v. New
Jersey, supra, at 627.
The Act's additional fee facially discriminates against hazardous waste generated in States other than Alabama, and
the Act overall has plainly discouraged the full operation of
petitioner's Emelle facility.4 Such burdensome taxes imposed on interstate commerce alone are generally forbidden:
"[A] State may not tax a transaction or incident more heavily
when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely
within the State." Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638,
642 (1984); see also Walling v. Michigan, 116 U. S. 446, 455
(1886); Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434, 439 (1880). Once a
state tax is found to discriminate against out-of-state commerce, it is typically struck down without further inquiry.
See, e. g., Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Tully, 466 U. S. 388,
406-407 (1984); Maryland v. Louisiana,451 U. S. 725, 759760 (1981); Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429
U. S. 318, 336-337 (1977).
The State, however, argues that the additional fee imposed
on out-of-state hazardous waste serves legitimate local purposes related to its citizens' health and safety. Because the
additional fee discriminates both on its face and in practical
effect, the burden falls on the State "to justify it both in
terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the
unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to
preserve the local interests at stake." Hunt v. Washington
State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 353 (1977);
see also Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, at 359; New
Energy Co., supra, at 278-279. "At a minimum such facial
discrimination invokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absence of nondis4

The Act went into effect July 15, 1990. The volume of hazardous
waste buried at the Emelle facility fell dramatically from 791,000 tons in
1989 to 290,000 tons in 1991.

Opinion of the Court

criminatory alternatives." Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S.
322, 337 (1979). 5
The State's argument here does not significantly differ
from the Alabama Supreme Court's conclusions on the legitimate local purposes of the additional fee imposed, which
were:
"The Additional Fee serves these legitimate local purposes that cannot be adequately served by reasonable
nondiscriminatory alternatives: (1) protection of the
health and safety of the citizens of Alabama from toxic
substances; (2) conservation of the environment and the
state's natural resources; (3) provision for compensatory
revenue for the costs and burdens that out-of-state
waste generators impose by dumping their hazardous
waste in Alabama; (4) reduction of the overall flow of
wastes traveling on the state's highways, which flow creates a great risk to the health and safety of the state's
citizens." 584 So. 2d, at 1389.
These may all be legitimate local interests, and petitioner
has not attacked them. But only rhetoric, and not explanation, emerges as to why Alabama targets only interstate
hazardous waste to meet these goals. As found by the trial
court, "[a]lthough the Legislature imposed an additional fee
of $72.00 per ton on waste generated outside Alabama, there
6 To some extent the State attempts to avail itself of the more flexible
approach outlined in, e. g., Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York
State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 579 (1986), and Pike v. Bruce
Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970), but this lesser scrutiny is only
available "where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and
there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade." Philadelphia
v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 624 (emphasis added). We find no room here
to say that the Act presents "effects upon interstate commerce that are
only incidental," ibid., for the Act's additional fee on its face targets only
out-of-state hazardous waste. While no "clear line" separates close cases
on which scrutiny should apply, "this is not a close case." Wyoming v.
Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 455, n. 12 (1992).

Opinion of the Court

is absolutely no evidence before this Court that waste generated outside Alabama is more dangerous than waste generated in Alabama. The Court finds under the facts of this
case that the only basis for the additional fee is the origin of
the waste." App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a-84a. In the face of
such findings, invalidity under the Commerce Clause necessarily follows, for "whatever [Alabama's] ultimate purpose, it
may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles
of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is
some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently." Philadelphiav. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 626-627;
see New Energy Co., 486 U. S., at 279-280. The burden is on
the State to show that "the discriminationis demonstrably
justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism,"' 6 Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 454 (1992) (em-

phasis added), and it has not carried this burden. Cf. Fort
Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, at 361.
Ultimately, the State's concern focuses on the volume of
the waste entering the Emelle facility.7 Less discriminatory
6The

Alabama Supreme Court found no "economic protectionism" here,
and thus purported to distinguish Philadelphiav. New Jersey, based on
its conclusions that the legislature was motivated by public health and
environmental concerns. 584 So. 2d 1367, 1388-1389 (1991). This narrow
focus on the intended consequence of the additional fee does not conform
to our precedents, for "[a] finding that state legislation constitutes 'economic protectionism' may be made on the basis of either discriminatory
purpose, see Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S.
333, 352-353 (1977), or discriminatory effect, see Philadelphia v. New
Jersey, supra." Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias,468 U. S. 263, 270 (1984).
The "virtually per se rule of invalidity," Philadelphia v. New Jersey,
supra, at 624, applies "not only to laws motivated solely by a desire to
protect local industries from out-of-state competition, but also to laws that
respond to legitimate local concerns by discriminating arbitrarily against
interstate trade." Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 148, n. 19 (1986).
"The risk created by hazardous waste and other similarly dangerous
waste materials is proportional to the volume of such waste materials
present, and may be controlled by controlling that volume." Brief for

Opinion of the Court

alternatives, however, are available to alleviate this concern,
not the least of which are a generally applicable per-ton additional fee on all hazardous waste disposed of within Alabama, cf. Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S.
609, 619 (1981), or a per-mile tax on all vehicles transporting
hazardous waste across Alabama roads, cf. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 286 (1987), or an
evenhanded cap on the total tonnage landfilled at Emelle, see
Philadelphiav. New Jersey, supra, at 626, which would cur-

tail volume from all sources.s To the extent Alabama's concern touches environmental conservation and the health and
safety of its citizens, such concern does not vary with the
point of origin of the waste, and it remains within the State's
power to monitor and regulate more closely the transporta8

The State asserts: "An equal fee, at any level, would necessarily fail

to serve the State's purpose. An equal fee high enough to provide any
significant deterrent to the importation of hazardous waste for landfilling
in the State would amount to an attempt by the State to avoid its responsibility to deal with its own problems, by tending to cause in-state waste to
be exported for disposal. An equal fee not so high as to amount to an
attempt to force Alabama's own problems to be borne by citizens of other
states would fail to provide any significant reduction in the enormous volumes of imported hazardous waste being dumped in the State. At the
point where an equal fee would become effective to serve the State's purpose in protecting public health and the environment from uncontrolled
volumes of imported waste, that equal fee would also become an avoidance
of the State's responsibility to deal with its own waste problems." Id., at
46. These assertions are without record support and in any event do not
suffice to validate plain discrimination against interstate commerce. See
New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 280 (1988); Hale v.
Bimco Trading, Inc., 306 U. S. 375, 380 (1939): "That no Florida cement
needs any inspection while all foreign cement requires inspection at a cost
of fifteen cents per hundredweight is too violent an assumption to justify
the discrimination here disclosed." The additional fee is certainly not a
"'last ditch' attempt" to meet Alabama's expressed purposes "after nondiscriminatory alternatives have proved unfeasible. It is rather a choice of
the most discriminatory [tax] even though nondiscriminatory alternatives
would seem likely to fulfill the State's purported legitimate local purpose
more effectively." Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 338 (1979).

tion and disposal of all hazardous waste within its borders.
Even with the possible future financial and environmental
risks to be borne by Alabama, such risks likewise do not
vary with the waste's State of origin in a way allowing foreign, but not local, waste to be burdened. 9 In sum, we find
the additional fee to be "an obvious effort to saddle those
outside the State" with most of the burden of slowing the
flow of waste into the Emelle facility. Philadelphiav. New
Jersey, 437 U. S., at 629. "That legislative effort is clearly
impermissible under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution." Ibid.
Our decisions regarding quarantine laws do not counsel
a different conclusion. 10 The Act's additional fee may not
legitimately be deemed a quarantine law because Alabama
permits both the generation and landfilling of hazardous
9

The State presents no argument here, as it did below, that the additional fee makes out-of-state generators pay their "fair share" of the costs
of Alabama waste disposal facilities, or that the additional fee is justified
as a "compensatory tax." The trial court rejected these arguments, App.
to Pet. for Cert. 88a, n. 6., finding the former foreclosed by American
Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 287-289 (1987), and the
latter to be factually unsupported by a requisite "substantially equivalent"
tax imposed solely on in-state waste, as required by, e. g., Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232, 242244 (1987). Various amici assert that the discrimination patent in the
Act's additional fee is consistent with congressional authorization. We
pretermit this issue, for it was not the basis for the decision below and
has not been briefed or argued by the parties here.
10The State collects and refers to the following decisions, inter alia,as

waste within its borders and the importation of still more
hazardous waste subject to payment of the additional fee.
In any event, while it is true that certain quarantine laws
have not been considered forbidden protectionist measures,
even though directed against out-of-state commerce, those
laws "did not discriminate against interstate commerce as
such, but simply prevented traffic in noxious articles, whatever their origin." Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra, at
629.11 As the Court stated in Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S.,
at 443:
"In the exercise of its police powers, a State may exclude from its territory, or prohibit the sale therein of
any articles which, in its judgment, fairly exercised, are
prejudicial to the health or which would endanger the
lives or property of its people. But if the State, under
the guise of exerting its police powers, should make such
exclusion or prohibition applicable solely to articles, of
that kind, that may be produced or manufactured in
other States, the courts would find no difficulty in holding such legislation to be in conflict with the Constitution of the United States."

Co. v. Husen, 95 U. S. 465, 472 (1878).
n "The hostility is to the thing itself, not to merely interstate shipments
of the thing; and an undiscriminating hostility is at least nondiscriminatory. But that is not the case here. The State of Illinois is quite willing
to allow the storage and even the shipment for storage of spent nuclear
fuel in Illinois, provided only that its origin is intrastate." Illinois v.
General Elec. Co., 683 F. 2d 206, 214 (CA7 1982), cert. denied, 461 U. S.
913 (1983); cf Oregon.Washington Co. v. Washington,supra, at 96: Inspection followed by quarantine of hay from fields infested with weevils is "a

real quarantine law, and not a mere inhibition against importation of
alfalfa from a large part of the country without regard to the condition
which might make its importation dangerous."

CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. v. HUNT
Opinion of the Court

The law struck down in Philadelphiav. New Jersey left
local waste untouched, although no basis existed by which
to distinguish interstate waste. But "[i]f one is inherently
harmful, so is the other. Yet New Jersey has banned the
former while leaving its landfill sites open to the latter."
437 U. S., at 629. Here, the additional fee applies only to
interstate hazardous waste, but at all points from its entrance into Alabama until it is landfilled at the Emelle facility, every concern related to quarantine applies perforce to
local hazardous waste, which pays no additional fee. For
this reason, the additional fee does not survive the appropriate scrutiny applicable to discriminations against interstate commerce.
Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131 (1986), provides no additional justification. Maine there demonstrated that the outof-state baitfish were subject to parasites foreign to in-state
baitfish. This difference posed a threat to the State's natural resources, and absent a less discriminatory means of protecting the environment-and none was available-the importation of baitfish could properly be banned. Id., at 140.
To the contrary, the record establishes that the hazardous
waste at issue in this case is the same regardless of its point
of origin. As noted in Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, "our
conclusion would be different if the imported waste raised
health or other concerns not presented by [Alabama] waste."
Post, at 367. Because no unique threat is posed, and because adequate means other than overt discrimination meet
Alabama's concerns, Maine v. Taylor provides the State no
respite.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

dissenting.

I have already had occasion to set out my view that States
need not ban all waste disposal as a precondition to protecting themselves from hazardous or noxious materials brought
across the State's borders. See Philadelphiav. New Jersey,
437 U. S. 617, 629 (1978) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting). In a
case also decided today, I express my further view that
States may take actions legitimately directed at the preservation of the State's natural resources, even if those actions
incidentally work to disadvantage some out-of-state waste
generators. See Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.
Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post, p. 368 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting). I dissent today, largely for the reasons I have set out in those two cases. Several additional
comments that pertain specifically to this case, though, are
in order.
Taxes are a recognized and effective means for discouraging the consumption of scarce commodities-in this case the
safe environment that attends appropriate disposal of hazardous wastes. Cf. 26 U. S. C. §§ 4681, 4682 (1988 ed., Supp.
III) (tax on ozone-depleting chemicals); 26 U. S. C. § 4064 (gas
guzzler excise tax). I therefore see nothing unconstitutional
in Alabama's use of a tax to discourage the export of this
commodity to other States, when the commodity is a public
good that Alabama has helped to produce. Cf. Fort Gratiot,
post, at 372 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting). Nor do I see
any significance in the fact that Alabama has chosen to adopt
a differential tax rather than an outright ban. Nothing in
the Commerce Clause requires Alabama to adopt an "all or
nothing" regulatory approach to noxious materials coming

from without the State. See Mintz v. Baldwin, 289 U. S. 346
(1933) (upholding State's partial ban on cattle importation).
In short, the Court continues to err by its failure to recognize that waste-in this case admittedly hazardous wastepresents risks to the public health and environment that a
State may legitimately wish to avoid, and that the State may
pursue such an objective by means less Draconian than an
outright ban. Under force of this Court's precedent, though,
it increasingly appears that the only avenue by which a State
may avoid the importation of hazardous wastes is to ban such
waste disposal altogether, regardless of the waste's source
of origin. I see little logic in creating, and nothing in the
Commerce Clause that requires us to create, such perverse
regulatory incentives. The Court errs in substantial measure because it refuses to acknowledge that a safe and attractive environment is the commodity really at issue in cases
such as this. See Fort Gratiot,post, at 369, n. (REHNQUIST,
C. J., dissenting). The result is that the Court today gets it
exactly backward when it suggests that Alabama is attempting to "isolate itself from a problem common to the several
States." Ante, at 339. To the contrary, it is the 34 States
that have no hazardous waste facility whatsoever, not to
mention the remaining 15 States with facilities all smaller
than Emelle, that have isolated themselves.
There is some solace to be taken in the Court's conclusion,
ante, at 344-345, that Alabama may impose a substantial fee
on the disposal of all hazardous waste, or a per-mile fee on
all vehicles transporting such waste, or a cap on total disposals at the Emelle facility. None of these approaches provide Alabama the ability to tailor its regulations in a way
that the State will be solving only that portion of the problem that it has created. See Fort Gratiot, post, at 370-371
(REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting).

But they do at least give

Alabama some mechanisms for requiring waste-generating
States to compensate Alabama for the risks the Court declares Alabama must run.

Cite as: 504 U. S. 334 (1992)
REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting

Of course, the costs of any of the proposals that the Court
today approves will be less than fairly apportioned. For example, should Alabama adopt a flat transportation or disposal tax, Alabama citizens will be forced to pay a disposal
tax equal to that faced by dumpers from outside the State.
As the Court acknowledges, such taxes are a permissible effort to recoup compensation for the risks imposed on the
State. Yet Alabama's general tax revenues presumably already support the State's various inspection and regulatory
efforts designed to ensure the Emelle facility's safe operation. Thus, Alabamians will be made to pay twice, once
through general taxation and a second time through a specific disposal fee. Permitting differential taxation would, in
part, do no more than recognize that, having been made to
bear all the risks from such hazardous waste sites, Alabama
should not in addition be made to pay more than others in
supporting activities that will help to minimize the risk.
Other mechanisms also appear open to Alabama to achieve
results similar to those that are seemingly foreclosed today.
There seems to be nothing, for example, that would prevent
Alabama from providing subsidies or other tax breaks to domestic industries that generate hazardous wastes. Or Alabama may, under the market participant doctrine, open its
own facility catering only to Alabama customers. See, e. g.,
White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc.,
460 U. S. 204, 206-208 (1983); Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S.
429, 436-437 (1980); Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426
U. S. 794, 810 (1976). But certainly we have lost our way
when we require States to perform such gymnastics, when
such performances will in turn produce little difference in
ultimate effects. In sum, the only sure byproduct of today's
decision is additional litigation. Assuming that those States
that are currently the targets for large volumes of hazardous
waste do not simply ban hazardous waste sites altogether,
they will undoubtedly continue to search for a way to limit
their risk from sites in operation. And each new arrange-

ment will generate a new legal challenge, one that will work
to the principal advantage only of those States that refuse
to contribute to a solution.
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.
