SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1992

MARTIN v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT OF
APPEALS ET AL.
ON MOTION OF PETITIONER FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED
IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 92-5584. Decided November 2, 1992*
Since this Court's Rule 39.8 was invoked in November 1991 to first deny
pro se petitioner Martin in forma pauperis status, he has filed 11 petitions for certiorari, all but one of which have been demonstrably
frivolous.
Held: Martin is denied leave to proceed in forma pauperisin the instant
cases, and the Clerk is directed not to accept any further petitions for
certiorari from him in noncriminal matters unless he pays the required
docketing fee and submits his petition in compliance with this Court's
Rule 33. Martin is a notorious abuser of the Court's certiorari process,
and consideration of his repetitious and frivolous petitions does not
allow the Court to allocate its resources in a way that promotes the
interests of justice.
Motions denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner James L. Martin requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We
deny this request pursuant to our Rule 39.8. Martin is al*Together with No. 92-5618, Martin v. McDermott et al., also on motion
of petitioner for leave to proceed informa pauperis.

lowed until November 23, 1992, within which to pay the
docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Martin in noncriminal matters unless he pays the
docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition
in compliance with Rule 33.
Martin is a notorious abuser of this Court's certiorari process. We first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Martin in forma
pauperis status last November. See Zatko v. California,
502 U. S. 16 (1991) (per curiam). At that time, we noted
that Martin had filed 45 petitions in the past 10 years, and
15 in the preceding 2 years alone. Although Martin was
granted in forma pauperis status to file these petitions, all
of these petitions were denied without recorded dissent. In
invoking Rule 39.8, we observed that Martin is "unique-not
merely among those who seek to file in forma pauperis,but
also among those who have paid the required filing feesbecause [he has] repeatedly made totally frivolous demands
on the Court's limited resources." Id., at 18. Unfortunately, Martin has continued in his accustomed ways.
Since we first denied him in forma pauperis status last
year, he has filed nine petitions for certiorari with this Court.
We denied Martin leave to proceed informa pauperis under
Rule 39.8 of this Court with respect to four of these peti2
tions,1 and denied the remaining five petitions outright.
Two additional petitions for certiorari are before us today,
bringing the total number of petitions Martin has filed in the
IMartin v. Smith, post, p. 810; Martin v. Delaware, post, p. 810;
Martin v. Sparks, post, p. 810; Martin v. Delaware, 505 U. S. 1203
(1992).

past year to 11. With the arguable exception of one of these
petitions, see Martin v. Knox, 502 U. S. 999 (1991) (STEVENS,
J., joined by BLACKMUN, J., respecting denial of certiorari),
all of Martin's filings, including those before us today, have
been demonstrably frivolous.
In Zatko, we warned that "[f]uture similar filings from
[Martin] will merit additional measures." 502 U. S., at 18.
As we have recognized, "[e]very paper filed with the Clerk
of this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources. A
part of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests
of justice." In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 184 (1989) (per
curiam). Consideration of Martin's repetitious and frivolous petitions for certiorari does not promote this end.
We have entered orders similar to the present one on two
previous occasions to prevent pro se petitioners from filing
repetitious and frivolous requests for extraordinary relief.
See In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991) (per curiam); In re
McDonald, supra. Although this case does not involve
abuse of an extraordinary writ, but rather the writ of certiorari, Martin's pattern of abuse has had a similarly deleterious
effect on this Court's "fair allocation of judicial resources."
See In re Sindram, supra, at 180. As a result, the same
concerns which led us to enter the orders barring prospective filings in Sindram and McDonald require such action
here.
We regret the necessity of taking this step, but Martin's
refusal to heed our earlier warning leaves us no choice. His
abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases,
and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order will
therefore not prevent Martin from petitioning to challenge
criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him. But it
will free this Court's limited resources to consider the claims

STEVENS,

J., dissenting

of those petitioners who have not abused our certiorari
process.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins,
dissenting.
In my opinion the judicial resources of the Court could be
used more effectively by simply denying Martin's petitions
than by drafting, entering, and policing the order the Court
enters today. The theoretical administrative benefit the
Court may derive from an order of this kind is far outweighed by the shadow it casts on the great tradition of open
access that characterized the Court's history prior to its
unprecedented decisions in In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180
(1989) (per curiam), and In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991)
(per curiam). I continue to adhere to the views expressed
in the dissenting opinions filed in those cases, and in the
dissenting opinion I filed in Zatko v. California, 502 U. S.
16, 18 (1991) (per curiam). See also Talamini v. Allstate
Ins. Co., 470 U. S. 1067 (1985), appeal dism'd (STEVENS, J.,
concurring).
