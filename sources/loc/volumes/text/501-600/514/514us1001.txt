Memorandum of JUSTICE STEVENS, respecting the denial of
certiorari.
Petitioner raises the question whether executing a prisoner who
has already spent some 17 years on death row violates the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
Though the importance and novelty of the question presented by
this certiorari petition are sufficient to warrant review by this
Court, those factors also provide a principled basis for postponing
consideration of the issue until after it has been addressed by
other courts. See, e. g., McCray v. New York, 461 U. S. 961 (1983)
(STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari).
Though novel, petitioner's claim is not without foundation. In
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976), this Court held that the
Eighth Amendment does not prohibit capital punishment. Our
decision rested in large part on the grounds that (1) the death
penalty was considered permissible by the Framers, see id., at
177 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.), and (2) the
death penalty might serve "two principal social purposes: retribution and deterrence," id., at 183.
It is arguable that neither ground retains any force for prisoners who have spent some 17 years under a sentence of death.
Such a delay, if it ever occurred, certainly would have been rare
in 1789, and thus the practice of the Framers would not justify a
denial of petitioner's claim. Moreover, after such an extended
time, the acceptable state interest in retribution has arguably
been satisfied by the severe punishment already inflicted. Over
a century ago, this Court recognized that "when a prisoner sentenced by a court to death is confined in the penitentiary awaiting
the execution of the sentence, one of the most horrible feelings
to which he can be subjected during that time is the uncertainty
during the whole of it." In re Medley, 134 U. S. 160, 172 (1890).

OCTOBER TERM, 1994
Memorandum of STEVENS, J.

514 U. S.

If the Court accurately described the effect of uncertainty in
Medley, which involved a period of four weeks, see ibid., that
description should apply with even greater force in the case of
delays that last for many years.* Finally, the additional deterrent effect from an actual execution now, on the one hand, as
compared to 17 years on death row followed by the prisoner's
continued incarceration for life, on the other, seems minimal.
See, e.g., Coleman v. Balkcom, 451 U.S. 949, 952 (1981) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari) ("[T]he deterrent value
of incarceration during that period of uncertainty may well be
comparable to the consequences of the ultimate step itself"). As
Justice White noted, when the death penalty "ceases realistically
to further these purposes, . . its imposition would then be the
pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes. A penalty
with such negligible returns to the State would be patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth
Amendment." Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 312 (1972)
(opinion concurring in judgment); see also Gregg v. Georgia, 428
U. S., at 183 ("IT]he sanction imposed cannot be so totally without
penological justification that it results in the gratuitous infliction
of suffering").
Petitioner's argument draws further strength from conclusions
by English jurists that "execution after inordinate delay would
*See also People v. Anderson, 6 Cal. 3d 628, 649, 493 P. 2d 880, 894 (1972)
("The cruelty of capital punishment lies not only in the execution itself and
the pain incident thereto, but also in the dehumanizing effects of the lengthy
imprisonment prior to execution during which the judicial and administrative
procedures essential to due process of law are carried out. Penologists and
medical experts agree that the process of carrying out a verdict of death is
often so degrading and brutalizing to the human spirit as to constitute psychological torture") (footnote omitted); Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238,
288-289 (1972) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("[T]he prospect of pending execution exacts a frightful toll during the inevitable long wait between the imposition of sentence and the actual infliction of death"); Solesbee v. Balkcom,
339 U. S.9, 14 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) ("In the history of murder,
the onset of insanity while awaiting execution of a death sentence is not a
rare phenomenon"); Suffolk County District Attorney v. Watson, 381 Mass.
648, 673, 411 N. E. 2d 1274, 1287 (1980) (Braucher, J., concurring) (death
penalty is unconstitutional under State Constitution in part because "[i]t will
be carried out only after agonizing months and years of uncertainty"); id.,
at 675-686, 411 N. E. 2d, at 1289-1295 (Liacos, J., concurring).

have infringed the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments to be found in section 10 of the Bill of Rights 1689." Riley
v. Attorney General of Jamaica, [1983] 1 A. C. 719, 734, 3 All
E. R. 469, 478 (P. C. 1983) (Lord Scarman, dissenting, joined by
Lord Brightman). As we have previously recognized, that section is undoubtedly the precursor of our own Eighth Amendment.
See, e. g., Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S., at 169-170; Harmelin v.
Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 966 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in
judgment).
Finally, as petitioner notes, the highest courts in other countries have found arguments such as petitioner's to be persuasive.
See Prattv. Attorney General of Jamaica, [1994] 2 A. C. 1, 4 All
E. R. 769 (P. C. 1993) (en banc); id., at 32-33, 4 All E. R., at
785-786 (collecting cases).
Closely related to the basic question presented by the petition
is a question concerning the portion of the 17-year delay that
should be considered in the analysis. There may well be constitutional significance to the reasons for the various delays that have
occurred in petitioner's case. It may be appropriate to distinguish, for example, among delays resulting from (a) a petitioner's
abuse of the judicial system by escape or repetitive, frivolous
filings; (b) a petitioner's legitimate exercise of his right to review;
and (c) negligence or deliberate action by the State. Thus,
though English cases indicate that the prisoner should not be held
responsible for delays occurring in the latter two categories, see
id., at 33, 4 All E. R., at 786, it is at least arguable that some
portion of the time that has elapsed since this petitioner was first
sentenced to death in 1978 should be excluded from the calculus.
As I have pointed out on past occasions, the Court's denial of
certiorari does not constitute a ruling on the merits. See, e. g.,
Barber v. Tennessee, 513 U. S. 1184 (1995); Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U. S. 940, 942 (1978) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial
of certiorari). Often, a denial of certiorari on a novel issue will
permit the state and federal courts to "serve as laboratories in
which the issue receives further study before it is addressed by
this Court." McCray v. New York, 461 U. S., at 963. Petitioner's
claim, with its legal complexity and its potential for far-reaching
consequences, seems an ideal example of one which would benefit
from such further study.
