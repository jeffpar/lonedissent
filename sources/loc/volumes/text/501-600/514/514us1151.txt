LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
WASHINGTON, D. C.

APRIL

27, 1995

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress Assembled:
By direction of the Supreme Court of the United States, I
have the honor to submit to the Congress the amendments
to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that have been
adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States pursuant
to Section 2072 of Title 28, United States Code. To maintain
uniformity between revised and unrevised Rules, the Court
has edited the amendments transmitted to the Supreme
Court by the Judicial Conference of the United States to use
the word "shall" in a consistent manner. In addition, the
Court has restored the word "made" to the last sentence of
Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(a)(1) to keep that Rule consistent with Fed.
R. Crim. P. 57(c).
The rules are accompanied by an excerpt from the report
of the Judicial Conference of the United States' Committee
on Rules of Practice and Procedure and that Committee's
Advisory Committee Notes. In order to minimize confusion,
a footnote noting the changes made by the Supreme Court
has been added to the marked-up version of the proposed
amendments that accompanies the Advisory Committee
Notes.
Sincerely,
(Signed) WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST
Chief Justice of the United States

Rule 50. Judgment as a matter of law in jury trials;alternative motion for new trial;conditionalrulings.
(b) Renewing motion for judgment after trial; alternative motion for new trial.-If, for any reason, the court does
not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at
the close of all the evidence, the court is considered to have
submitted the action to the jury subject to the court's later
deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. The movant may renew its request for judgment as a matter of law
by filing a motion no later than 10 days after entry of judgment--and may alternatively request a new trial or join a
motion for a new trial under Rule 59. In ruling on a renewed motion, the court may:
(1) if a verdict was returned:
(A) allow the judgment to stand,
(B) order a new trial, or
(C) direct entry of judgment as a matter of law;
or
(2) if no verdict was returned:

dered shall be filed no later than 10 days after entry of
the judgment.
Rule 52. Findings by the court; judgment on partial
findings.
(b) Amendment.-On a party's motion filed no later than
10 days after entry of judgment, the court may amend its
findings-or make additional findings-and may amend the
judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under Rule 59. When findings of fact
are made in actions tried without a jury, the sufficiency of
the evidence supporting the findings may be later questioned
whether or not in the district court the party raising the
question objected to the findings, moved to amend them, or
moved for partial findings.
Rule 59. New trials;amendment of judgments.
(b) Time for motion.-Any motion for a new trial shall be
filed no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.
(c) Time for serving affidavits.-When a motion for new
trial is based on affidavits, they shall be filed with the motion. The opposing party has 10 days after service to file
opposing affidavits, but that period may be extended for up
to 20 days, either by the court for good cause or by the
parties' written stipulation. The court may permit reply
affidavits.
(d) On court's initiative;notice; specifying grounds.-No
later than 10 days after entry of judgment the court, on its
own, may order a new trial for any reason that would justify
granting one on a party's motion. After giving the parties
notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court may grant
a timely motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the
motion. When granting a new trial on its own initiative or
for a reason not stated in a motion, the court shall specify
the grounds in its order.

(e) Motion to alter or amend judgment.-Any motion to
alter or amend a judgment shall be filed no later than 10
days after entry of the judgment.
Rule 83. Rules by district courts;judge's directives.
(a) Local rules.
(1) Each district court, acting by a majority of its district judges, may, after giving appropriate public notice
and an opportunity for comment, make and amend rules
governing its practice. A local rule shall be consistent
with-but not duplicative of-Acts of Congress and
rules adopted under 28 U. S. C. §§ 2072 and 2075, and
shall conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
A local rule takes effect on the date specified by the
district court and remains in effect unless amended by
the court or abrogated by the judicial council of the circuit. Copies of rules and amendments shall, upon their
promulgation, be furnished to the judicial council and
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
and be made available to the public.
(2) A local rule imposing a requirement of form shall
not be enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose
rights because of a nonwillful failure to comply with
the requirement.
(b) Procedureswhen there is no controlling law.-A judge
may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal
law, rules adopted under 28 U. S. C. §§ 2072 and 2075, and
local rules of the district. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or the local district
rules unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the
particular case with actual notice of the requirement.
