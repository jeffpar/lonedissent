INYO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, ET AL. v. PAIUTESHOSHONE INDIANS OF THE BISHOP
COMMUNITY OF THE BISHOP
COLONY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 02-281.

Argued March 31, 2003-Decided May 19, 2003

The Bishop Paiute Tribe in California chartered and wholly owns the
Bishop Paiute Gaming Corporation, which operates and manages the
Paiute Palace Casino (Casino), a tribal gaming operation. When the
Inyo County District Attorney asked the Casino for the employment
records of three Casino employees under investigation for welfare fraud,
the Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees' consent. The District Attorney, on showing probable cause, then obtained and executed a search warrant authorizing a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.
The District Attorney subsequently asked for the records of six other
Casino employees. The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered
to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each
employee's signed welfare application. The District Attorney refused
the offer. To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and its Gaming Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court against the District
Attorney and the Sheriff, in their individual and official capacities, and
Inyo County (County). Asserting federal-question jurisdiction under
28 U. S. C. §§ 1331, 1337, 1343(i)(3)(4), and the federal common law of
Indian affairs, the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent
that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records. The Tribe also
sought relief under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, including compensatory damages,
alleging that the defendants violated the Tribe's and Gaming Corporation's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and the Tribe's right
to self-government. The District Court, on defendants' motion, dismissed the Tribe's complaint, holding, inter alia, that tribal sovereign
immunity did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the
Casino's personnel records. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that
execution of a search warrant against the Tribe interfered with "the
right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by
them." Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217, 220. Acknowledging a prior

BISHOP COMMUNITY OF BISHOP COLONY

decision in which it held that the right to tribal self-government is not
protected by § 1983, the court concluded that, in this case, a § 1983 claim
could be maintained because the Tribe sought protection from an unlawful search and seizure, a right secured by the Fourth Amendment and
therefore within § 1983's compass.
Held:
1. The Tribe may not sue under § 1983 to vindicate the sovereign
right it here claims. Section 1983 permits "citizen[s]" and "other person[s] within the jurisdiction" of the United States to seek legal and
equitable relief from "person[s]" who, under color of state law, deprive
them of federally protected rights. Although this case does not
squarely present the question, the Court assumes that tribes, like
States, are not subject to suit under § 1983. See Will v. Michigan Dept.
of State Police, 491 U. S. 58. The issue pivotal here is whether a tribe
qualifies as a claimant-a"person within the jurisdiction" of the United
States-under § 1983. Qualification of a sovereign as a "person" who
may maintain a particular claim for relief depends not "upon a bare
analysis of the word 'person,"' Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India, 434
U. S. 308, 317, but on the "legislative environment" in which the word
appears, Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S. 159, 161. There is in this case no
allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant
was otherwise defective. It is only by virtue of the Tribe's asserted
"sovereign" status that it claims immunity from the County's processes.
Section 1983 was designed to secure private rights against government
encroachment, see Will, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereign's
prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation.
For example, a tribal member complaining of a Fourth Amendment violation would be a "person" qualified to sue under § 1983. But, like other
persons, that member would have no immunity from an appropriately
executed search warrant based on probable cause. The Tribe, accordingly, may not sue under § 1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here
claims. Pp. 708-712.
2. The Tribe has not explained, and the trial and appellate courts have
not clearly decided, what prescription of federal common law, if any,
enables the Tribe to maintain an action for declaratory and injunctive
relief establishing its sovereign right to be free from state criminal
processes. This case is therefore remanded for focused consideration
and resolution of that jurisdictional question. P. 712.

INYO COUNTY v. PAIUTE-SHOSHONE INDIANS OF
BISHOP COMMUNITY OF BISHOP COLONY

Opinion of the Court

delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case stems from a California county's investigation of
Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation
crimes. Pursuing the investigation, county law enforcement
officers executed a state-court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation. The
Tribe sued Inyo County (County), the District Attorney, and
the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity
from state-court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.
The parties and, as amicus curiae, the United States
agree that a Native American Tribe, like a State of the
United States, is not a "person" subject to suit under 42
U. S. C. § 1983. We hold that, in the situation here presented, the Tribe does not qualify as a "person" who may
sue under § 1983. Whether the Tribe's suit qualifies for
federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than § 1983 is an issue the parties have not
precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have
not clearly decided. We therefore remand the case for
close consideration and specific resolution of that threshold
question.
I
The Bishop Paiute Tribe is a federally recognized tribe
located on the Bishop Paiute Reservation in California. The
Bishop Paiute Gaming Corporation, chartered and wholly
owned by the Tribe, operates and manages the Paiute Palace
Casino (Casino), a tribal gaming operation run under the
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 102 Stat. 2467, 25 U. S. C.
§ 2701 et seq.
In March 1999, the Inyo County Department of Health and
Human Services (Department) received information from the
State Department of Social Services indicating that three
Casino employees had failed to report Casino earnings on
their applications for state welfare benefits. Brief for Petitioners 4-5. According to the County, the employees failed

Opinion of the Court

to respond when the Department requested that they reconcile the apparent discrepancies between their Casino earnings and their welfare application forms. Id., at 5. The Department then forwarded the matter to the Inyo County
District Attorney's Office, which, in turn, asked the employees to reconcile the apparent discrepancies. Id., at 6. That
request, the County asserts, was also ignored. Ibid.
In February 2000, the District Attorney's Office asked the
Casino for the three employees' employment records, explaining that it was investigating "alleged welfare fraud."
291 F. 3d 549, 554 (CA9 2002). The Tribe responded that its
privacy policy precluded release of the records without the
employees' consent.
The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County
Superior Court. The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees. On March
23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney
executed the warrant. They did so over the objection of
tribal officials. Those officials urged that the state court
lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.' The Sheriff
and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the
Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the
Casino's personnel records. The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers
relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered
information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State. Each
item seized contained at least one reference to an employee
under investigation.
In July 2000, the District Attorney's Office asked the Tribe
for the personnel records of six other Casino employees.

The United States maintains, and the County does not dispute, that
the Corporation is an "arm" of the Tribe for sovereign immunity purposes.
See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11-14.

706

INYO COUNTY v. PAIUTE-SHOSHONE INDIANS OF
BISHOP COMMUNITY OF BISHOP COLONY
Opinion of the Court

The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept
as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of
each employee's signed welfare application. That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals
applying for public assistance were subject to review by
county officials. The District Attorney refused the offer.2
To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and the Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court naming as defendants the District Attorney and the Sheriff, in their individual and official capacities, and the County. Asserting
federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §§ 1331, 1337,
1343(i)(3)(4), and the "federal common law of Indian affairs,"
the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes
under federal law, and to establish that state law was
preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize
seizure of tribal records. App. 97, 1, 105-114,
26-53.
The Tribe's complaint also sought relief under 42 U. S. C.
§ 1983, including compensatory damages. In this regard, the
Tribe alleged that by acting beyond the scope of their jurisdiction and "without authorization of law" in executing the
warrant,3 the defendants violated the Tribe's and Corporation's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and the
Tribe's right to self-government. App. 109, 38; see id., at
108-110,
33-39.
2At oral argument, the County defended this refusal by asserting that
federal law prohibited it from releasing the relevant pages of the employees' welfare applications. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5. But the United
States assured the Court that "[t]here is no Federal regulation or other
Federal requirement" that would have prevented the County from sharing
the relevant information with the Tribe. Id., at 21. This entire controversy, it thus appears, might have been avoided had the county officials
understood that federal law allowed the accommodation sought by the
Tribe.
- The Tribe did not dispute the State's authority over the crimes under
investigation. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29.

Opinion of the Court

On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants'
motion, dismissed the Tribe's complaint. Tribal sovereign
immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the
search and seizure of the Casino's personnel records. Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the
Tribe, the court concluded that, "[i]n the interest of a fair and
uniform application of California's criminal law, state officials
should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe
and tribal property." App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a. The court
also held that the District Attorney and the Sheriff had qualified immunity from suit in their individual capacities. Id.,
at 57a-58a.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the
District Court's judgment dismissing the action. "[E]xecution of a search warrant against the Tribe," the Court of
Appeals said, "interferes with 'the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them."' 291
F. 3d, at 558 (quoting Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S.217, 220
(1959)). In the appellate court's view, the District Court
should not have "balanced the interests at stake" to determine whether the warrant was enforceable. 291 F. 3d, at
559. This Court's precedent, the Ninth Circuit said, advanced "a more categorical approach denying state jurisdiction ... over a tribe absent Awaiver by the tribe or a clear
grant of authority by Congress." Ibid. (citing Oklahoma
Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U. S.450, 458 (1995)).
"[Elven if a balancing test is the appropriate legal framework," the Court of Appeals added, "the balance of interests
favors a ruling for the Tribe." 291 F. 3d, at 559. The
Tribe's privacy policies regarding employee records "promote tribal [self-government] interests," the Ninth Circuit
reasoned; notably, those policies fostered "a trusting relationship with tribal members," and "affect[ed] the Casino,
the Tribe's predominant source of economic development
revenue." Ibid. The appeals court recognized the State's
countervailing "interest in investigating potential welfare

708

BISHOP COMMUNITY OF BISHOP COLONY
Opinion of the Court

fraud," but thought it incumbent upon the State to further
that interest "through far less intrusive means." Ibid.
The Court of Appeals also ruled that the District Attorney
and the Sheriff were not shielded by qualified immunity.
"[A] reasonable county officer," it held, "would have known
.. that seizing tribal property held on tribal land violated

the Fourth Amendment because the property and land were
outside the officer's jurisdiction." Id., at 568. The appeals
court acknowledged prior Ninth Circuit precedent holding
that the right to tribal self-government is not protected by
§ 1983. Id., at 568, n. 7 (citing Hoopa Valley Tribe v. Nevins,
881 F. 2d 657 (1989)); see Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 29, n. 15. But in this case, the Court of Appeals
concluded, a § 1983 claim could be maintained because the
Tribe sought "protection from an unlawful search and seizure," a right secured by the Fourth Amendment and therefore within § 1983's compass. 291 F. 3d, at 568, and n. 7.
On December 2, 2002, we granted certiorari. 537 U. S. 1043.
II
Central to our review is the question whether the Tribe's
complaint is actionable under § 1983. That provision permits "citizen[s]" and "other person[s] within the jurisdiction"
of the United States to seek legal and equitable relief from
"person[s]" who, under color of state law, deprive
them of
federally protected rights.4 In Will v. Michigan Dept. of
State Police, 491 U. S. 58 (1989), this Court held that a State
is not a "person" amenable to suit under § 1983. "[I]n enact4

The relevant portion of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 reads: "Every person who,
under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any
State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be
subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the
jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party
injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for
redress."

Cite as: 538 U. S. 701 (2003)
Opinion of the Court

ing § 1983," the Court said, "Congress did not intend to override well-established immunities or defenses under the common law," including "[t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity."
Id., at 67. Although this case does not squarely present the
question, the parties agree, and we will assume for purposes
of this opinion, that Native American tribes, like States of
the Union, are not subject to suit under § 1983. See Brief
for Petitioners 35-38; Tr. of Oral Arg. 49; Kiowa Tribe of
Okla. v. ManufacturingTechnologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751, 754
(1998) ("an Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its
immunity").
The issue pivotal here is whether a tribe qualifies as a
claimant-a "person within the jurisdiction" of the United
States-under § 1983.5 The United States maintains it does
not, invoking the Court's "longstanding interpretive presumption that 'person' does not include the sovereign," a presumption that "may be disregarded only upon some affirmative showing of statutory intent to the contrary." Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 7-8 (quoting Vermont
Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 780-781 (2000)); see Will, 491 U. S., at 64.
Nothing in the text, purpose, or history of § 1983, the Government contends, overcomes the interpretive presumption
5

Courts of Appeals have expressed divergent views on this question.
See Native Village of Venetie IRA Council v. Alaska, 155 F. 3d 1150,
1152, n. 1 (CA9 1998) (concluding that Tribes are persons entitled to sue
under § 1983); American Vantage Co. v. Table Mountain Rancheria,292
F. 3d 1091, 1097, n. 4 (CA9 2002) ("[I]t is doubtful whether [a] Tribe qua
sovereign would qualify as a 'citizen of the United States or other person'
eligible to bring an action under § 1983." (quoting White MountainApache

dictum that "a state is not a 'person' under [§ 1983]"); Pennsylvania v.
Porter,659 F. 2d 306, 314-318 (CA3 1981) (en banc) (holding that a State
may bring a § 1983 action in a parens patriae capacity).

INYO COUNTY v. PAIUTE-SHOSHONE INDIANS OF
BISHOP COMMUNITY OF BISHOP COLONY
Opinion of the Court

that "'person' does not include the sovereign." Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 7-8 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the Government urges,
given the Court's decision that "person" excludes sovereigns
as defendants under § 1983, it would be anomalous for the
Court to give the same word a different meaning when it
appears later in the same sentence. Id., at 8; see Brown v.
Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994) (the "presumption that a

given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a
statute" is "surely at its most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given sentence"); cf. Lafayette v. Louisiana
Power & Light Co., 435 U. S. 389, 397 (1978) (because municipalities are "persons" entitled to sue under the antitrust
laws, they are also, in principle, "persons" capable of being
sued under those laws).
The Tribe responds that Congress intended § 1983 "to provide a powerful civil remedy 'against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights."' Brief for Respondents 45 (quoting Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social
Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 700-701 (1978)). To achieve that remedial purpose, the Tribe maintains, § 1983 should be "broadly
construed." Brief for Respondents 45 (citing MoneUl, 436
U. S., at 684-685 (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indian tribes, the Tribe here asserts, "have been especially vulnerable to infringement of their federally protected rights
by states." Brief for Respondents 42 (citing, inter alia, The
Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737 (1867) (state taxation of tribal
lands); Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians,
526 U. S. 172 (1999) (state infringement on tribal rights to
hunt, fish, and gather on ceded lands); Mississippi Band of
Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30 (1989) (tribal jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings); California
v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202 (1987)
(state attempt to regulate gambling on tribal land)). To
guard against such infringements, the Tribe contends, the

Cite as: 538 U. S. 701 (2003)
Opinion of the Court

Court should read § 1983 to encompass suits brought by Indian tribes.
As we have recognized in other contexts, qualification of a
sovereign as a "person" who may maintain a particular claim
for relief depends not "upon a bare analysis of the word 'person,"' Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India,434 U. S. 308, 317
(1978), but on the "legislative environment" in which the
word appears, Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S. 159, 161 (1942).
Thus, in Georgia, the Court held that a State, as purchaser
of asphalt shipped in interstate commerce, qualified as a
"person" entitled to seek redress under the Sherman Act for
restraint of trade. Id., at 160-163. Similarly, in Pfizer, the
Court held that a foreign nation, as purchaser of antibiotics,
ranked as a "person" qualified to sue pharmaceuticals manufacturers under our antitrust laws. 434 U. S., at 309-320;
cf. Stevens, 529 U. S., at 787, and n. 18 (deciding States are
not "person[s]" subject to qui tam liability under the False
Claims Act, but leaving open the question whether they "can
be 'persons' for purposes of commencing an FCA qui tam
action" (emphasis deleted)); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001) ("Although we
generally presume that identical words used in different
parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,
the presumption is not rigid, and the meaning of the same
words well may vary to meet the purposes of the law." (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted)).
There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked
probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.
It is only by virtue of the Tribe's asserted "sovereign" status
that it claims immunity from the County's processes. See
App. 97-105,
1-25, 108-110,
33-39; 291 F. 3d, at 554
(Court of Appeals "find[s] that the County and its agents violated the Tribe's sovereign immunity when they obtained
and executed a search warrant against the Tribe and tribal

Opinion of the Court

property." (emphasis added)). Section 1983 was designed to
secure private rights against government encroachment, see
Will, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereign's prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribal
member complaining of a Fourth Amendment violation
would be a "person" qualified to sue under § 1983. See Brief
for Petitioners 20, n. 7. But, like other private persons, that
member would have no right to immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause. Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under § 1983
6
to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.
III

In addition to § 1983, the Tribe asserted as law under
which its claims arise the "federal common law of Indian
affairs." Supra, at 706 (quoting App. 97, 1). But the
Tribe has not explained, and neither the District Court nor
the Court of Appeals appears to have carefully considered,
what prescription of federal common law enables a tribe to
maintain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief establishing its sovereign right to be free from state criminal
processes. In short, absent § 1983 as a foundation for the
Tribe's action, it is unclear what federal law, if any, the
Tribe's case "aris[es] under." 28 U. S. C. § 1331. We therefore remand for focused consideration and resolution of that
jurisdictional question.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
Itis so ordered.

concurring in the judgment.
In my judgment a Native American tribe is a "person"
who may sue under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. The Tribe's complaint, however, does not state a cause of action under § 1983
because the county's alleged infringement of the Tribe's sovereign prerogatives did not deprive the Tribe of "rights,
privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and
laws" within the meaning of § 1983. At bottom, rather than
relying on an Act of Congress or a provision of the Constitution, the Tribe's complaint rests on the judge-made doctrine
of tribal immunity-a doctrine that "developed almost by
accident." Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. ManufacturingTechnologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751, 756 (1998). Because many applications of that doctrine are both anomalous and unjust, see id.,
at 760, 764-766 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), I would not accord
it the same status as the "laws" referenced in § 1983.
It is demeaning to Native American tribes to deny them
the same access to a § 1983 remedy that is available to any
other person whose constitutional rights are violated by persons acting under color of state law. The text of § 1983which provides that § 1983 defendants are "person[s] who,
under color of [State law,]" subject any "other person" to a
deprivation of a federal right-adequately explains why a
tribe is not a person subject to suit under § 1983. For tribes
generally do not act under color of state law. But that text
sheds no light on the question whether the tribe is an "other
person" who may bring a § 1983 suit when the tribe is the
victim of a constitutional violation. The ordinary meaning
of the word "person" as used in federal statutes,' as well as
the specific remedial purpose of § 1983, support the concluJUSTICE STEVENS,

sion that a tribe should be able to invoke the protections of

the statute if its constitutional rights are violated.
In this case, however, the Tribe's allegations do not state
a cause of action under § 1983. The execution of the warrant
challenged in this case would unquestionably have been lawful if the casino had been the property of an ordinary commercial corporation. See ante, at 711 ("There is in this case
no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that
the warrant was otherwise defective"). Thus, the Tribe
rests its case entirely on its claim that, as a sovereign, it
should be accorded a special immunity that private casinos
do not enjoy. See ibid. That sort of claim to special privileges, which is based entirely on the Tribe's sovereign status,
is not one for which the § 1983 remedy was enacted.
Accordingly, while I agree with the Court that the judgment should be set aside, I do not join the Court's opinion.

Our holding in Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 65
(1989), that a State is not a "person" within § 1983 is fully consistent with
this view. Will rested on "the ordinary rule of statutory construction
that if Congress intends to alter the 'usual constitutional balance between
the States and the Federal Government,' it must make its intention to do
so 'unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.' Atascadero State
Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985); see also Pennhurst State
School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 99 (1984)." Ibid.
