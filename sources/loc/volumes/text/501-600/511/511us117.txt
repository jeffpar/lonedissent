TICOR TITLE INSURANCE CO. ET AL. V.
BROWN ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 92-1988.

Argued March 1, 1994-Decided April 4, 1994

Respondents were members of a class whose money damages claims were
settled in a suit filed against petitioner title insurance companies. The
class was certified under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(A)
and (b)(2), which do not permit class members to opt out of a class.
When respondent Brown subsequently filed the present action on behalf
of Arizona and Wisconsin title insurance consumers, the District Court
granted petitioners summary judgment on the ground that respondents
were bound by the earlier judgment. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that it would violate due process to accord res judicata effect to a
judgment involving money damages claims where a plaintiff to the previous suit had not been afforded a right to opt out.
Held: Because deciding this case would require the Court to resolve a
constitutional question that may be entirely hypothetical, the writ is
dismissed as improvidently granted. The Court would not have to
reach the question whether absent class members have a constitutional
right to opt out of actions involving money damages if it turned out that
classes in such actions can be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3),. which
permits opt out. However, the determination that respondents' class
fit within Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) is conclusive upon these parties,
and the alternative of using the Federal Rules instead of the Constitution as a means of imposing an opt-out requirement on this settlement
is no longer available. Further, it is not clear that our resolution of the
constitutional question will make any difference even to these litigants.
Certiorari dismissed. Reported below: 982 F. 2d 386.

PER CURIAM.

For the reasons discussed below, we have concluded that
deciding this case would require us to resolve a constitutional question that may be entirely hypothetical, and we
accordingly dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.
I
In 1985, the Federal Trade Commission initiated enforcement proceedings against petitioners, six title insurance
companies, alleging that they conspired to fix prices in 13
States including Arizona and Wisconsin. Shortly after that,
private parties in the affected States filed 12 different "tagalong" antitrust class actions, seeking treble damages and
injunctive relief. Those private suits were consolidated for
pretrial purposes pursuant to 28 U. S. C. ยง 1407 (the federal
multidistrict litigation statute), and were transferred to the

District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as
MDL No. 633.
In January 1986, spurred on by an intervening decision of
this Court that substantially weakened the claims against
petitioners, see Southern Motor CarriersRate Conference,
Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S. 48 (1985), petitioners and the
class representatives in MDL No. 633 reached a settlement.
The settlement extinguished all money damages claims
against petitioners by those "'purchasers and insureds, who
purchased or received title insurance.., from any title insurance underwriter ... with respect to real estate located in
any of the thirteen Affected States during the period from
January 1, 1981 to December 31, 1985,"' a class that included
the respondents. In re Real Estate Title and Settlement
Services Antitrust Litigation,1986-1 Trade Cases 67,149,
pp. 62,921, 62,924 (ED Pa. 1986) (quoting settlement agreement). To the plaintiffs, the settlement agreement awarded
injunctive relief, an increased amount of coverage on any
title insurance policy that class members bought during the
class period, an increased amount of coverage on specified
title insurance policies that class members might purchase
from petitioners during a future 1-year period, and payment
of attorney's fees and costs of the lawsuit. The District
Court provisionally certified the settlement class (as stipulated by the class representatives and petitioners) under
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), and provisionally accepted the settlement.
.At the ensuing final settlement hearing, the State
of Wisconsin objected to the proposed settlement both as a class
member and as parens patriae for its resident class members, claiming that the action could not be certified under
Rule 23(b)(2) because the relief sought in the complaints was
primarily monetary. Wisconsin also claimed (and was joined
in this by the State of Arizona, both as a class member and
as parens patriae)that due process required that the proposed class members have an opportunity to opt out of the

TICOR TITLE INS. CO. v. BROWN

class. The District Court ultimately rejected these objections, certified the classes under Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and
(b)(2),* and accepted the settlement. The Third Circuit'affirmed without opinion, In re Real Estate Title and Settlement Services Antitrust Litigation, 815 F. 2d 695 (1987)
(judgment order), and we denied certiorari, 485 U. S. 909
(1988).
In 1990, respondent Brown filed the present action in District Court in Arizona on behalf of Arizona and Wisconsin
title insurance consumers, alleging that petitioners had conspired to fix rates for title-search services in those States in
violation of the federal antitrust laws. The District Court
granted petitioners summary judgment on the ground,
among others, that respondents, as parties to the MDL No.
633 suit, were bound by the judgment entered pursuant to
the settlement. The Ninth Circuit reversed, accepting respondents' contention that it would violate due process to
accord res judicata effect to a judgment in a class action that
involved money damages claims (or perhaps that involved
primarily money damages claims) against a plaintiff in the
previous suit who had not been afforded a right to opt out on
those claims. 982 F. 2d 386, 392 (1992). Before the Ninth
Circuit, respondents did not (and indeed could not) challenge
whether the class in the MDL No. 633 litigation was properly
certified under Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). And in this
Court, petitioners present only a single question-viz.,
"[w]hether a federal court may refuse to enforce a prior federal class action judgment, properly certified under Rule 23,
*Certification under Rule 23(b)(1)(A) requires that the prosecution of
separate actions would create a risk of "inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class."
Certification under Rule 23(b)(2) requires that "the party opposing the
class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the
class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding
declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole."

on grounds that absent class members have a constitutional
due process right to opt out of any class action which asserts
monetary claims on their behalf." Pet. for Cert. i.
II

That certified question is of no general consequence if,
whether or not absent class members have a constitutional
right to opt out of such actions, they have a right to do so
under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Such a right
would exist if, in actions seeking monetary damages, classes
can be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), which permits optout, and not under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), which do not.
See Rules 23(c)(2) and (c)(3). That is at least a substantial
possibility-and we would normally resolve that preliminary
nonconstitutional question before proceeding to the constitutional claim. See New York City Transit Authority v.
Beazer, 440 U. S.568, 582-583 (1979). The law of res judicata, however, prevents that question from being litigated
here. It was conclusively determined in the MDL No. 633
litigation that respondents' class fit within Rules 23(b)(1)(A)
and (b)(2); even though that determination may have been
wrong, it is conclusive upon these parties, and the alternative
of using the Federal Rules instead of the Constitution as the
means of imposing an opt-out requirement for this settlement is no longer available.
The most obvious consequence of this unavailability is,
as we have suggested, that our resolution of the posited constitutional question may be quite unnecessary in law, and
of virtually no practical consequence in fact, except with
respect to these particular litigants. Another consequence,
less apparent, is that resolving the constitutional question on
the assumption of proper certification under the Rules may
lead us to the wrong result. If the Federal Rules, which
generally are not affirmatively enacted into law by Congress,
see 28 U. S. C. ยงยง 2072(a), (b), 2074(a), are not entitled to that
great deference as to constitutionality which we accord fed-

eral statutes, see, e. g., Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64
(1981); Walters v. National Assn. of Radiation Survivors,
473 U. S. 305, 319-320 (1985), they at least come with the
imprimatur of the rulemaking authority of this Court. In
deciding the present case, we must assume either that the
lack of opt-out opportunity in these circumstances. was decreed by the Rules or that it was not (though the parties
are bound by an erroneous holding that it was). If we make
the former assumption we may approve, in the mistaken
deference to prior Supreme Court action and congressional
acquiescence, action that neither we nor Congress would
independently think constitutional. If we make the latter
assumption, we may announce a constitutional rule that is
good for no other federal class action. Neither option is
attractive.
The one reason to proceed is to achieve justice in this particular case. Even if the constitutional question presented
is hypothetical as to everyone else, it would seem to be of
great practical importance to these litigants. But that is
ordinarily not sufficient reason for our granting certiorarieven when unnecessary constitutional pronouncements are
not in the picture. Moreover, as matters have developed it
is not clear that our resolution of the constitutional question
will make any difference even to these litigants. On the day
we granted certiorari we were informed that the parties had
reached a settlement designed to moot the petition, which
now awaits the approval of the District Court.
In these circumstances, we think it best to dismiss the writ
as improvidently granted.

and

We granted certiorari to consider one specific question:
"Whether a federal court may refuse to enforce a prior federal class action judgment, properly certified under Rule 23,
on grounds that absent class members have a constitutional

O'CONNOR, J., dissenting

due process right to opt out of any class action which asserts
monetary claims on their behalf." Pet. for Cert. i. The
Court decides not to answer this question based on its speculation about a nonconstitutional ground for decision that is
neither presented on this record nor available to these parties. From that decision I respectfully dissent.
Respondents are members of a class that reached a final
settlement with petitioners in an antitrust action styled
MDL No. 633. In re Real Estate Title and Settlement
Services Antitrust Litigation, 1986-1 Trade Cases 67,149,
p. 62,921 (ED Pa. 1986), aff'd, 815 F. 2d 695 (CA3 1987), cert.
denied, 485 U. S. 909 (1988). Respondents subsequently
brought this action against petitioners, asserting some of the
same claims. The District Court held that respondents had
been adequately represented in the MDL No. 633 action, and
granted summary judgment for petitioners because, given
the identity of parties and claims, the MDL No. 633 settlement was res judicata. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a-28a. The
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 982 F. 2d
386 (1992). The court agreed that respondents had been adequately represented in the MDL No. 633 action, id., at 390391, but held that respondents could nevertheless relitigate
the same claims against petitioners: "Because [respondents]
had no opportunity to opt out of the MDL No. 633 litigation,
we hold there would be a violation of minimal due process if
[respondents'] damage claims were held barred by res judicata." Id., at 392.
The Court concludes that the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's constitutional interpretation "is of no general consequence if,... in actions seeking monetary damages, classes

can be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), which permits optout, and not under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), which do not."
Ante, at 121. In other words, the Court declines to answer
the constitutional question because the MDL No. 633 action
might not have been properly certified-an issue that was
litigated to a final determination in petitioners' favor more

TICOR TITLE INS. CO. v. BROWN

J., dissenting

than five years ago, and on which we denied certiorari. The
nonconstitutional ground for decision about which the Court
speculates is therefore unavailable to respondents. The constitutional ground on which the Court of Appeals relied, the
one we granted certiorari to review and the parties have
briefed and argued, was necessary to the decision in this
case. Our prudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions has no application in these circumstances, and the
Court errs in relying on it.
. The Court's assertion that "our resolution of the posited
constitutional question may be ...

of virtually no practical

consequence in fact," ibid., is unsound. The lower courts
have consistently held that the presence of monetary damages claims does not preclude class certification under Rules
23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). See 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, &
M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d ยง 1775,
pp. 463-470 (1986 and Supp. 1992). Whether or not those
decisions are correct (a question we need not, and indeed
should not, decide today), they at least indicate that there
are a substantial number of class members in exactly the
same position as respondents. Under the Ninth Circuit's
rationale in this case, every one of them has the right to
go into federal court and relitigate their claims against the
defendants in the original action. The individuals, corporations, and governments that have successfully defended
against class actions or reached appropriate settlements, but
are now subject to relitigation of the same claims with
individual class members, will rightly dispute the Court's
characterization of the constitutional rule in this case as
inconsequential.
The Court is likewise incorrect in suggesting that a decision in this case "may be quite unnecessary in law." Ante,
at 121. Unless and until a contrary rule is adopted, courts
will continue to certify classes under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2)
notwithstanding the presence of damages claims; the constitutional opt-out right announced by the court below will be

Cite as: 511 U. S. 117 (1994)
O'CONNOR,

J., dissenting

implicated in every such action, at least in the Ninth Circuit.
Moreover, because the decision below is based on the Due
Process Clause, presumably it applies to the States; although
we held in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797
(1985), that there is a constitutional right to opt out of class
actions brought in state court, that holding was expressly
"limited to those class actions which seek to bind known
plaintiffs concerning claims wholly or predominately for
money judgments." Id., at 811, n. 3. The Ninth Circuit's
rule, by contrast, applies whenever "substantial damage
claims" are asserted. See 982 F. 2d, at 392. The resolution
of a constitutional issue with such broad-ranging consequences is both-necessary and appropriate.
Finally, I do not agree with the Court's suggestion that
the posture of the case could "lead us to the wrong result"
with respect to the question whether the Due Process Clause
requires an opt-out right in federal class actions. involving
claims for money damages. See ante, at 121-122. As the
case comes to us, we must assume that the ,MDL No. 633
class was properly certified under Rule 23, notwithstanding
the presence of claims for monetary relief. But this assumption, coupled with whatever presumption of constitutionality
to which the Rules are entitled, will not lead us to "approve
...
action that neither we nor Congress.would independently
think constitutional." Ante, at 122. Either an opt-out
right is constitutionally required, or,it is not. We can decide
this issue while reserving the question of how the Rules
should be construed. While it might be convenient, and it
would certainly accord with our usual practice, to decide the
nonconstitutional question first, that option is not available
to us in this case. The only question, then, is whether we
should dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. In my
view, the importance of the constitutional question, as well
as the significant expenditures of resources by the litigants,
amici, and this Court, outweighs the prudential concerns on
which the Court relies.

TICOR TITLE INS. CO. v. BROWN
O'CONNOR J., dissenting

When a constitutional issue is fairly joined, necessary to
the decision, and important enough to warrant review, this
Court should not avoid resolving it-particularly on the
basis of an entirely speculative alternative ground for decision that is neither presented by the record nor available
to the parties before the Court. The decision below rests
exclusively on a constitutional right to opt out of class actions asserting claims for monetary relief. We granted certiorari to consider whether such a right exists. The issue
has been thoroughly briefed and argued by the parties. We
should decide it.
