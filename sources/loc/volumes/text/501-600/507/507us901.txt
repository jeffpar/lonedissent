No. 92-379. ILLINOIS V. CONDON. Sup. Ct. Ill. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 148 Ill. 2d 96, 592 N. E. 2d 951.
JUSTICE WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,
dissenting.
The State of Illinois, petitioner here, seeks review of a judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court holding that a police search
of respondent's home, conducted pursuant to a warrant, was unconstitutional because the police failed to knock and announce
their presence before entering the premises. Because the decision below is in conflict with those of other courts on the question
of what showing police must make to dispense with the ordinary
knock-and-announce requirement in executing search warrants, I
would grant certiorari.
Based on information provided by informants, police in Du Page
County, Illinois, obtained a warrant to search respondent's home.
Police had been told by the informants that respondent had been
using the residence as a base for cocaine distribution, that residents of the house monitored approaching traffic with closedcircuit surveillance cameras and a police scanner, and that several
weapons were kept inside the house. The police also knew that
the house was owned by respondent's brother, whom they previously had arrested on drugs and weapons charges and who was
then a fugitive.
On the evening of November 6, 1987, a team of police officers
executed the warrant. They stormed respondent's home without
knocking or announcing their presence and arrested respondent.
A search of the home revealed cocaine, marijuana, 13 guns, and
marked currency obtained through drug transactions orchestrated
by police earlier that day.
At his subsequent trial, respondent contended that the search
was constitutionally invalid under the Fourth Amendment because police did not knock and announce their presence before
entering his home. The trial court denied respondent's suppression motion, finding that exigent circumstances justified the unannounced entry. Respondent was thereafter convicted on several
counts. On appeal, the State Appellate Court reversed respondent's conviction and the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed, holding
that the facts did not demonstrate exigent circumstances sufficient
to dispense with the knock-and-announce requirement. 148 Ill.
2d 96, 592 N. E. 2d 951 (1992). In so holding, the court turned

ORDERS
507 U. S.

February 22, 1993

aside each of the four circumstances proffered by the State as
justifying the unannounced entry: the presence of cocaine in the
house and the ease with which it could be destroyed, the existence
of surveillance cameras and a police scanner, the presence of
weapons in the house, and the fact that respondent's brother had
been carrying a loaded pistol at the time of his earlier arrest on
drug charges. Id., at 103-106, 592 N. E. 2d, at 955-956. The
court also rejected the State's contention that these circumstances
should be considered collectively in determining whether the unannounced entry was justified. Id., at 106, 592 N. E. 2d, at 956.
The decision below is in conflict with those of other courts
holding that similar factual showings demonstrate "exigent circumstances" justifying an unannounced entry. See, e. g., United
States v. Keene, 915 F. 2d 1164, 1168-1169 (CA8 1990) (fact that
narcotics on premises could have been quickly destroyed justified
unannounced entry), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 1102 (1991); State v.
Matos, 135 N. H. 410, 411, 605 A. 2d 223, 224 (1992) (same); State
v. Williams, 168 Wis. 2d 970, 985-986, 485 N. W. 2d 42, 48 (1992)
(combined presence of drugs and guns on premises justified unnanounced entry). The state courts are particularly divided over
whether the presence of illegal drugs alone will justify unannounced police entry on the theory that pausing to announce the
search will enable the destruction of evidence. See United States
v. Moore, 956 F. 2d 843, 849-850, and n. 9 (CA8 1992) (acknowledging split of authority and collecting cases); Matos, supra, at 412,
605 A. 2d, at 224 (same).
Although there are perhaps prudential reasons counseling
against plenary review in this case, I would grant certiorari to
resolve the conflict.

dissenting.
These petitions raise yet again the question whether waste byproducts that are not ingestible or marketable may be included
in calculating the weight of a "mixture or substance containing a
detectable amount of

. .

. methamphetamine" for purposes of

§2D1.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines
Manual (Nov. 1991). The Circuits are deeply split on this issue.
As I noted in Walker v. United States, 506 U. S. 967, 968 (1992), the
Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits have
joined the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits in adopting an approach
consistent with that urged by petitioners. By contrast, the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, joined by the First and Tenth
Circuits, has adopted a contrary approach. Ibid. In the decision
below, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit adhered to this
position, reaffirming its disagreement with the holding of the
Sixth Circuit in United States v. Jennings, 945 F. 2d 129 (CA6
1991), and recognizing inconsistency with approaches adopted by
the Second and Eleventh Circuits. United States v. Sherrod, 964
F. 2d 1501, 1509-1511, and n. 22 (CA5 1992). The conflict is enduring and the issue important. As a result of the conflict, those
convicted of violating federal law are subject to widely disparate
sentences, depending only on the federal circuit in which their
cases are brought. The issue is a recurring one. Respondent
concedes that the Circuits are in conflict, but notes that it did
not oppose certiorari in United States v. Mahecha-Onofre, 936
F. 2d 623 (CA1), and this Court nonetheless denied review there,
502 U. S. 1009 (1991), and since has denied review of the issue
four more times. Respondent is correct. See Cooper v. United
States, 506 U. S. 1041 (1992) (WHITE and BLACKMUN, JJ., dissenting
from denial of certiorari); Walker v. United States, supra (WHITE
and BLACKMUN, JJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Fowner

v. United States, 504 U. S. 933 (1992) (WHITE, J., dissenting from
denial of certiorari); Beltran-Felixv. United States, 502 U. S. 1065
(1992) (WHITE, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). This
marks the sixth time this issue has come before the Court in two
Terms. The Court should resolve this persistent conflict.

Miscellaneous Order
No. A-742. FARGO WOMEN'S HEALTH ORGANIZATION ET AL.
V. SCHAFER, GOVERNOR OF NORTH DAKOTA, ET AL. D. C. N. D.
Application for stay and injunction pending appeal, presented to
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and by him referred to the Court, denied.
The order heretofore entered by JUSTICE BLACKMUN on March
31, 1993, is vacated. JUSTICE BLACKMUN and JUSTICE STEVENS
would grant the application.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins,
concurring.
Applicants challenged certain provisions of the North Dakota
Abortion Control Act, N. D. Cent. Code §§ 14-02.1-01 to 1402.1-12 (1991), in the United States District Court for the District
of North Dakota. Relying on our decision in United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), the District Court granted summary
judgment against applicants. The court reasoned that applicants
could not mount a successful facial challenge because they were
unable to show that "'no set of circumstances exists under which
the [challenged provisions] would be valid."' Fargo Women's
Health Organization v. Skinner, No. A3-91-95 (Feb. 19, 1993)
(quoting Salerno, supra, at 745). The court denied applicants'
motion for a stay and injunction pending appeal. See Fargo
Women's Health Organization v. Schafer, No. A3-91-95 (Mar. 9,
1993). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit also denied
a motion for stay and injunction pending appeal. It agreed with
the District Court that the Salerno standard applied and concluded that this Court's decision last Term in Planned Parenthood
of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), did not counsel
a different approach. See Fargo Women's Health Organization

1014

OCTOBER TERM, 1992
O'CONNOR, J., concurring

507 U. S.

v. Schafer, No. 93-1579 (Mar. 30, 1993). The appeal was expedited, and argument is scheduled for April 14, 1993.
Applicants now ask us for a stay of the District Court's judgment and for injunctive relief. When a matter is pending before
a court of appeals, it long has been the practice of Members of
this Court to grant stay applications only "upon the weightiest
considerations." O'Rourke v. Levine, 80 S. Ct. 623, 624, 4 L. Ed.
2d 615, 616 (1960) (Harlan, J., in chambers). Accord, Certain
Named and Unnamed Non-Citizen Children and Their Parents
v. Texas, 448 U. S. 1327, 1330 (1980) (Powell, J., in chambers); see
also Heckler v. Redbud Hospital Dist., 473 U. S. 1308, 1312 (1985)
(REHNQUIST, J., in chambers) ("[A] stay application to a Circuit
Justice on a matter before a court of appeals is rarely granted"
(internal quotation marks omitted)); Heckler v. Lopez, 464 U. S.
879, 884 (1983) (STEVENS, J., joined by BLACKMUN, J., dissenting
in part) ("[I]n such a case the granting of a stay by a Circuit
Justice should be extremely rare and great deference should be
shown to the judgment of the Court of Appeals"). Consistent
with that practice, I vote to deny the stay application. I do not
believe applicants have demonstrated that this is one of those
rare and exceptional cases in which a stay pending appeal is
warranted.
I write separately, however, to point out that our denial of relief
should not be viewed as signaling agreement with the lower
courts' reasoning. In my view, the approach taken by the lower
courts is inconsistent with Casey. In striking down Pennsylvania's spousal-notice provision, we did not require petitioners to
show that the provision would be invalid in all circumstances.
Rather, we made clear that a law restricting abortions constitutes
an undue burden, and hence is invalid, if, "in a large fraction of
the cases in which [the law] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion."
Casey, 505 U. S., at 895. And the joint opinion specifically examined the record developed in the District Court in determining
that Pennsylvania's informed-consent provision did not create an
undue burden. See id., at 885-887 (opinion of O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, and SOUTER, JJ.). While I express no view as to whether
the particular provisions at issue in this case constitute an undue
burden, I believe the lower courts should have undertaken the
same analysis.

JUSTICE WHITE,

with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN and JUSTICE

SOUTER join, dissenting.

Under Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484-485 (1981), a
defendant who invokes the Fifth Amendment right to counsel
during custodial interrogation may not be subjected to further
interrogation until counsel is made available to him, unless he
subsequently initiates communications. "[I]t is inconsistent with
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),] and its progeny," the
Court concluded, "for the authorities, at their instance, to reinterrogate an accused in custody if he has clearly asserted his right
to counsel." Id., at 485. While easily stated, the Edwards rule
has not always been easy to apply. In particular, the question of
how officials conducting an interrogation ought to respond to a
defendant's ambiguous or equivocal assertion of the right to counsel has divided the state and federal courts. The Court should
take this opportunity to resolve this important constitutional
question.
Virginia police arrested petitioner in connection with the abduction, rape, and murder of 10-year-old Charity Powers. Petitioner
was advised of his Miranda rights and agreed to talk to a detective and an FBI agent. During the interrogation, petitioner
asked the detective: "'Do you think I need an attorney here?"'

1044

OCTOBER TERM, 1992
WHITE,

J., dissenting

507 U. S.

The detective responded by shaking his head slightly from side
to side, shrugging, and stating: "'You're just talking to us."' The
interrogation continued and petitioner confessed to the crimes.
See 244 Va. 386, 391, 422 S. E. 2d 380, 384 (1992). Petitioner
sought to suppress the confession, claiming, inter alia, that the
continuation of the interrogation constituted an Edwards violation. The trial court denied the motion and petitioner was tried,
convicted, and sentenced to death. Relying on its prior decision
in Eaton v. Commonwealth, 240 Va. 236, 253-254, 397 S. E. 2d
385, 395-396 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 824 (1991), which in
turn relied on Edwards' reference to a defendant who has "clearly
asserted" the right to counsel, see supra, at 1043, the Virginia
Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that petitioner's question
"did not constitute an unambiguous request for counsel" and
therefore was insufficient to trigger Edwards. 244 Va., at 396,
422 S. E. 2d, at 387. Petitioner now seeks review of this ruling,
among others. Pet. for Cert. 11-12.
It has been nearly a decade since the Court acknowledged the
existence of three "conflicting standards" used by state and federal courts for determining the consequences of ambiguous or
equivocal assertions of the right to counsel. Smith v. Illinois,
469 U. S. 91, 95-96, and n. 3 (1984) (per curiam). Thus,
"[s]ome courts have held that all questioning must cease
upon any request for or reference to counsel, however equivocal or ambiguous. Others have attempted to define a threshold standard of clarity for such requests, and have held that
requests falling below this threshold do not trigger the right
to counsel ....

Still others have adopted a third approach,

holding that when an accused makes an equivocal statement
that 'arguably' can be construed as a request for counsel,
all interrogation must immediately cease except for narrow
questions designed to 'clarify' the earlier statement and the
accused's desires respecting counsel." Id., at 96, n. 3 (citations omitted).
This disagreement has not abated. Although a number of Circuits have since adopted what Smith described as the "third approach," see United States v. Porter, 776 F. 2d 370 (CA1 1985);
United States v. Gotay, 844 F. 2d 971, 975 (CA2 1988); United
States v. Fouche, 776 F. 2d 1398, 1405 (CA9 1985); Towne v. Dugger, 899 F. 2d 1104 (CAll), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 991 (1990), the

ORDERS
507 U. S.

April 19, 1993

Sixth Circuit apparently adheres to the first approach. See Maglio v. Jago, 580 F. 2d 202, 205 (1978) (ambiguous invocation requires cessation of all questioning). State high courts also continue
to issue conflicting decisions. Kentucky and Texas, like Virginia,
now employ a variant of the second, "threshold standard," approach, see Dean v. Commonwealth, 844 S. W, 2d 417, 420 (Ky.
1992) (endorsing Eaton v. Commonwealth, supra); Russell v. State,
727 S. W. 2d 573, 575 (Tex. Crim. App.) (en banc) (right to counsel
invoked if "clearly asserted"), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 856 (1987),
while other States and the District of Columbia have embraced the
third approach, see State v. Staatz, 159 Ariz. 411, 414, 768 P. 2d
143, 146 (1988); People v. Benjamin, 732 P. 2d 1167, 1171 (Colo.
1987), Crawford v. State, 580 A. 2d 571, 576-577 (Del. 1990); Ruffin
v. United States, 524 A. 2d 685 (D. C. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U. S.
1057 (1988); Hall v. State, 255 Ga. 267, 273, 336 S. E. 2d 812, 816
(1985); State v. Robinson, 427 N. W, 2d 217, 223 (Minn. 1988).
As it is apparent that a substantial number of criminal defendants who are identically situated in the eyes of the Constitution
have received, and will continue to receive, dissimilar treatment
because of the different approaches taken by the lower courts, I
would grant certiorari.
