OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Per Curiam

DEMOS v. STORRIE ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS

No. 92-6846.

Decided March 8, 1993

Since this Court denied petitioner Demos leave to proceed in forma pauperis in all future petitions for extraordinary relief, he has filed 14 petitions for certiorari.
Held: Demos is denied leave to proceed under this Court's Rule 39.8, and
the Clerk is directed to reject all future petitions for certiorari from
Demos in noncriminal matters unless he pays the required docketing fee
and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.

His continued

course of abusive filings plainly warrants this sanction.
Motion denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner John R. Demos, Jr., has made 48 informa
pauperis filings in this Court since the beginning of the October 1988 Term, many of which challenged sanctions imposed by lower courts for frivolous filings. Almost two
years ago, we prospectively denied Demos leave to proceed
in forma pauperis "in all future petitions for extraordinary
relief." In re Demos, 500 U. S. 16, 17 (1991) (per curiam).
At that time, we said that Demos "remains free under the
present order to file in forma pauperis requests for relief
other than an extraordinary writ, if he qualifies under this
Court's Rule 39 and does not similarly abuse that privilege." Ibid.
Since then, Demos has filed 14 petitions for certiorari.
We denied the first seven petitions outright, and denied
Demos leave to proceed in forma pauperis under our Rule
39.8 as to the following six. Today, we invoke Rule 39.8
again with respect to the instant petition. Demos is allowed
until March 29, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees
required by Rule 38 and to submit the petition in compliance
with this Court's Rule 33. Because Demos has refused to
heed our prior warning, we further direct the Clerk to reject

STEVENS, J.,

dissenting

all future petitions for certiorari from Demos in noncriminal
matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule
38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33. See
Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S.
1, 1-2 (1992) (per curiam). Demos' continued course of abusive filings plainly warrants this sanction.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins,
dissenting.
In my opinion, the administration of special procedures for
disposing of repetitive and frivolous petitions is less efficient
than our past practice of simply denying such petitions.* I
continue to adhere to my previously stated views on this
issue, see Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals,
506 U. S. 1, 4 (1992) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Zatko v. California, 502 U. S. 16, 18 (1991) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), and
would deny certiorari rather than invoking Rule 39 in this
case. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

*The next issue the Court will confront in developing its Rule 39.8 jurisprudence, for instance, is whether to apply orders like today's retroactively, to petitions pending on the date they are issued.
