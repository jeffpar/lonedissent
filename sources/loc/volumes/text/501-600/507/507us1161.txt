The complaint is a written statement of the essential facts
constituting the offense charged. It shall be made upon
oath before a magistrate judge.
Rule 4. Arrest warrant or summons upon complaint.
(c) Form.
(1) Warrant.-The warrant shall be signed by the
magistrate judge and shall contain the name of the defendant or, if the defendant's name is unknown, any
name or description by which the defendant can be identified with reasonable certainty. It shall describe the
offense charged in the complaint. It shall command
that the defendant be arrested and brought before the
nearest available magistrate judge.
(d) Execution or service; and return.

and canceled by the magistrate judge by whom it was
issued. On or before the return day the person to
whom a summons was delivered for service shall make
return thereof to the magistrate judge before whom the
summons is returnable. At the request of the attorney
for the government made at any time while the complaint is pending, a warrant returned unexecuted and
not canceled or summons returned unserved or a duplicate thereof may be delivered by the magistrate judge
to the marshal or other authorized person for execution
or service.
Rule 5. Initial appearance before the magistratejudge.
(a) In general.-An officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest
without a warrant shall take the arrested person without
unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or, in the event that a federal magistrate judge
is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial
officer authorized by 18 U. S. C. ยง 3041. If a person arrested
without a warrant is brought before a magistrate judge, a
complaint shall be filed forthwith which shall comply with
the requirements of Rule 4(a) with respect to the showing of
probable cause. When a person, arrested with or without
a warrant or given a summons, appears initially before the
magistrate judge, the magistrate judge shall proceed in accordance with the applicable subdivisions of this rule.
(b) Misdemeanorsand other petty offenses.-If the charge
against the defendant is a misdemeanor or other petty offense triable by a United States magistrate judge under 18

(c) Offenses not triable by the United States magistrate
judge.-If the charge against the defendant is not triable by
the United States magistrate judge, the defendant shall not
be called upon to plead. The magistrate judge shall inform

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

the defendant of the complaint against the defendant and of
any affidavit filed therewith, of the defendant's right to retain counsel or to request the assignment of counsel if the
defendant is unable to obtain counsel, and of the general circumstances under which the defendant may secure pretrial
release. The magistrate judge shall inform the defendant
that the defendant is not required to make a statement and
that any statement made by the defendant may be used
against the defendant. The magistrate judge shall also inform the defendant of the right to a preliminary examination.
The magistrate judge shall allow the defendant reasonable
time and opportunity to consult counsel and shall detain or
conditionally release the defendant as provided by statute or
in these rules.
A defendant is entitled to a preliminary examination, unless waived, when charged with any offense, other than a
petty offense, which is to be tried by a judge of the district
court. If the defendant waives preliminary examination,
the magistrate judge shall forthwith hold the defendant to
answer in the district court. If the defendant does not
waive the preliminary examination, the magistrate judge
shall schedule a preliminary examination. Such examination shall be held within a reasonable time but in any event
not later than 10 days following the initial appearance if the
defendant is in custody and no later than 20 days if the defendant is not in custody, provided, however, that the preliminary examination shall not be held if the defendant is indicted or if an information against the defendant is filed in
district court before the date set for the preliminary examination. With the consent of the defendant and upon a showing of good cause, taking into account the public interest in
the prompt disposition of criminal cases, time limits specified
in this subdivision may be extended one or more times by a
federal magistrate judge. In the absence of such consent by
the defendant, time limits may be extended by a judge of
the United States only upon a showing that extraordinary
circumstances exist and that delay is indispensable to the
interests of justice.

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Rule 5.1. Preliminaryexamination.
(a) Probable cause finding.-If from the evidence it appears that there is probable cause to believe that an offense
has been committed and that the defendant committed it, the
federal magistrate judge shall forthwith hold the defendant
to answer in district court. The finding of probable cause
may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part.
The defendant may cross-examine adverse witnesses and
may introduce evidence. Objections to evidence on the
ground that it was acquired by unlawful means are not properly made at the preliminary examination. Motions to suppress must be made to the trial court as provided in Rule 12.
(b) Discharge of defendant.-If from the evidence it appears that there is no probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed or that the defendant committed
it, the federal magistrate judge shall dismiss the complaint
and discharge the defendant. The discharge of the defendant shall not preclude the government from instituting a subsequent prosecution for the same offense.
(c) Records.-After concluding the proceeding the federal
magistrate judge shall transmit forthwith to the clerk of the
district court all papers in the proceeding. The magistrate
judge shall promptly make or cause to be made a record or
summary of such proceeding.
(1) On timely application to a federal magistrate
judge, the attorney for a defendant in a criminal case
may be given the opportunity to have the recording of
the hearing on preliminary examination made available
to that attorney in connection with any further hearing
or preparation for trial. The court may, by local rule,
appoint the place for and define the conditions under
which such opportunity may be afforded counsel.
(2) On application of a defendant addressed to the
court or any judge thereof, an order may issue that the
federal magistrate judge make available a copy of the
transcript, or of a portion thereof, to defense counsel.
Such order shall provide for prepayment of costs of such
transcript by the defendant unless the defendant makes

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

a sufficient affidavit that the defendant is unable to pay
or to give security therefor, in which case the expense
shall be paid by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts from available appropriated funds. Counsel for the government may move
also that a copy of the transcript, in whole or in part, be
made available to it, for good cause shown, and an order
may be entered granting such motion in whole or in
part, on appropriate terms, except that the government
need not prepay costs nor furnish security therefor.
Rule 6. The grand jury.
(e) Recording and disclosure of proceedings.
(4) Sealed indictments.-The federal magistrate
judge to whom an indictment is returned may direct
that the indictment be kept secret until the defendant is
in custody or has been released pending trial. Thereupon the clerk shall seal the indictment and no person
shall disclose the return of the indictment except when
necessary for the issuance and execution of a warrant
or summons.
(f) Finding and return of indictment.-An indictment
may be found only upon the concurrence of 12 or more jurors.
The indictment shall be returned by the grand jury to a federal magistrate judge in open court. If a complaint or information is pending against the defendant and 12 jurors do not
concur in finding an indictment, the foreperson shall so report to a federal magistrate judge in writing forthwith.

information.

government the court shall issue a warrant for each defendant named in an information supported by a showing of prob-

able cause under oath as is required by Rule 4(a), or in an
indictment. Upon the request of the attorney for the government a summons instead of a warrant shall issue. If no
request is made, the court may issue either a warrant or a
summons in its discretion. More than one warrant or summons may issue for the same defendant. The clerk shall deliver the warrant or summons to the marshal or other person
authorized by law to execute or serve it. If a defendant
fails to appear in response to the summons, a warrant shall
issue. When a defendant arrested with a warrant or given
a summons appears initially before a magistrate judge, the
magistrate judge shall proceed in accordance with the applicable subdivisions of Rule 5.
(b) Form.
(1) Warrant.-The form of the warrant shall be as
provided in Rule 4(c)(1) except that it shall be signed by
the clerk, it shall describe the offense charged in the
indictment or information and it shall command that the
defendant be arrested and brought before the nearest
available magistrate judge. The amount of bail may be
fixed by the court and endorsed on the warrant.

defendant to appear before a magistrate judge at a
stated time and place.
(c) Execution or service; and return.

the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service
and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to
the corporation's last known address within the district
or at its principal place of business elsewhere in the
United States. The officer executing the warrant shall

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

bring the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or,
in the event that a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer
authorized by 18 U. S. C. ยง 3041.
(2) Return.-The officer executing a warrant shall
make return thereof to the magistrate judge or other
officer before whom the defendant is brought. At the
request of the attorney for the government any unexecuted warrant shall be returned and cancelled. On or
before the return day the person to whom a summons
was delivered for service shall make return thereof. At
the request of the attorney for the government made at
any time while the indictment or information is pending,
a warrant returned unexecuted and not cancelled or a
summons returned unserved or a duplicate thereof may
be delivered by the clerk to the marshal or other authorized person for execution or service.

witnesses' opinions, the bases and the reasons
therefor, and the witnesses' qualifications.
(2) Information not subject to disclosure.-Exceptas
provided in paragraphs (A), (B), (D), and (E) of subdivision (a)(1), this rule does not authorize the discovery or
inspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government or other government agents in connection with
the investigation or prosecution of the case. Nor does
the rule authorize the discovery or inspection of statements made by government witnesses or prospective
government witnesses except as provided in 18 U. S. C.
ยง3500.
(b) The defendant's disclosure of evidence.

intends to use under Rules 702, 703 and 705 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence as evidence at trial.
This summary must describe the opinions of the
witnesses, the bases and reasons therefor, and the
witnesses' qualifications.

shall be issued by a United States magistrate judge in a proceeding before that magistrate judge, but it need not be
under the seal of the court.
(g) Contempt.-Failure by any person without adequate
excuse to obey a subpoena served upon that person may be
deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena

(c) Production of excised statement.-If the other party

court shall excise the portions of the statement that are privileged or that do not relate to the subject matter concerning
which the witness has testified, and shall order that the
statement, with such material excised, be delivered to the
moving party. Any portion of the statement that is withheld from the defendant over the defendant's objection must
be preserved by the attorney for the government, and, if
the defendant appeals a conviction, must be made available
to the appellate court for the purpose of determining the
correctness of the decision to excise the portion of the
statement.
(d) Recess for examination of statement.-Upon delivery

(1) Warrant upon affidavit.-A warrant other than a
warrant upon oral testimony under paragraph (2) of this
subdivision shall issue only on an affidavit or affidavits
sworn to before the federal magistrate judge or state

satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that
there is probable cause to believe that they exist, that
magistrate judge or state judge shall issue a warrant
identifying the property or person to be seized and naming or describing the person or place to be searched.
The finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay evidence in whole or in part. Before ruling on a
request for a warrant the federal magistrate judge or
state judge may require the affiant to appear personally

the warrant shall prepare a document to be known
as a duplicate original warrant and shall read such
duplicate original warrant, verbatim, to the Federal
magistrate judge. The Federal magistrate judge
shall enter, verbatim, what is so read to such magistrate judge on a document to be known as the original warrant. The Federal magistrate judge may
direct that the warrant be modified.
(C) Issuance.-If the Federal magistrate judge is
satisfied that the circumstances are such as to make
it reasonable to dispense with a written affidavit
and that grounds for the application exist or that
there is probable cause to believe that they exist,
the Federal magistrate judge shall order the issuance of a warrant by directing the person requesting the warrant to sign the Federal magistrate
judge's name on the duplicate original warrant.
The Federal magistrate judge shall immediately
sign the original warrant and enter on the face of
the original warrant the exact time when the warrant was ordered to be issued. The finding of probable cause for a warrant upon oral testimony may
be based on the same kind of evidence as is sufficient for a warrant upon affidavit.
(D) Recording and certification of testimony.When a caller informs the Federal magistrate judge
that the purpose of the call is to request a warrant,
the Federal magistrate judge shall immediately
place under oath each person whose testimony
forms a basis of the application and each person

1179

applying for that warrant. If a voice recording device is available, the Federal magistrate judge shall
record by means of such device all of the call after
the caller informs the Federal magistrate judge that
the purpose of the call is to request a warrant. Otherwise a stenographic or longhand verbatim record
shall be made. If a voice recording device is used
or a stenographic record made, the Federal magistrate judge shall have the record transcribed, shall
certify the accuracy of the transcription, and shall
file a copy of the original record and the transcription with the court. If a longhand verbatim record
is made, the Federal magistrate judge shall file a
signed copy with the court.
(d) Execution and return with inventory.-The officer
taking property under the warrant shall give to the person
from whom or from whose premises the property was taken
a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken
or shall leave the copy and receipt at the place from which
the property was taken. The return shall be made promptly
and shall be accompanied by a written inventory of any property taken. The inventory shall be made in the presence of
the applicant for the warrant and the person from whose
possession or premises the property was taken, if they are
present, or in the presence of at least one credible person
other than the applicant for the warrant or the person from
whose possession or premises the property was taken, and
shall be verified by the officer. The federal magistrate
judge shall upon request deliver a copy of the inventory to
the person from whom or from whose premises the property
was taken and to the applicant for the warrant.
(g) Return of papers to clerk.-The federal magistrate
judge before whom the warrant is returned shall attach to

the chief judge is the presiding judge in the case, to another
judge or United States magistrate judge in the district, except that in a district having a single judge and no United
