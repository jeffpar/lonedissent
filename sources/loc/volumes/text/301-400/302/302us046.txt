SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 11.

Argued October 15, 1937.--Decided November 8, 1937.

1. Congress may accept, or require, the military services of minors,
with or without the consent of their parents. P. 48.
2. Tnder 34 U. S. C. § 161 minors between the ages of 14 and 18
years are not accepted for anlistment in the Navy without their
parents' consent; but the statute does not confer upon or leave
with the parents any right to condition consent to their sons'
enlistment. P. 49.
3. No Act of Congress permits enlistment of minors upon condition
or upon the qualified consent of parents, nor does any Act authorize recruiting officers to bind the United States to carry, or to
require an enlisted man to carry, War Risk insurance for his
own protection or for the benefit of any person. P. 50.
4. Parents consented to the enlistment of their son on condition that
he carry War Risk insurance of specified amount in behalf of his
mother.. Before his death, in the service, the son had taken out
and later had canceled, such insurance. Held that the condition
did not bind the United States; that the son had a right under the
War Risk Insurance Act to cancel the insurance; and that the
mother had no cause of action against the United States. P. 50.

surance on the life of her minor son, Benson Charles
Williams, who died while serving in the navy. Trial by
jury having been waived, the court made findings of
fact, stated its conclusions of law and gave judgment
for the plaintiff. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.
86 F. (2d) 746.
The findings show: Plaintiff's son was born August 27,
1901, and January 13, 1919, enlisted in the navy for the
period of his minority. At that time defendant issued a
certificate of term insurance binding itself, in case of his
death while insured, to pay plaintiff $10,000 in 240 equal
monthly installments; he directed defendant to deduct
premiums from his pay; his parents executed a writing
by which they consented to the enlistment, released theirclaim to his pay, approved the transactions between him
and defendant and declared that their consent was given
on the condition that, during enlistment, he would carry
war risk insurance in the sum of $10,000 in behalf of
his mother. July 20, 1920, he made written request that
his insurance be terminated. Thereafter, defendant made
no deductions from his pay on account of premiums. The
insured died June 30, 1921. At all times until his death
his uncollected pay was more than enough to keep the
insurance in force. Upon learning of her son's death
plaintiff demanded payment of the insurance. When
notified by defendant of her son's cancelation she repudiated it, offered to pay all premiums, reiterated her claim
as beneficiary and, defendant having rejected it, brought
this suit.
The Circuit Court of Appeals reasoned as follows:
Plaintiff's consent was essential to the enlistment and
was given on condition that the insurance be maintained.
The minor and defendant could not set the condition at
naught. Defendant could not avail itself of his services,
to which it was entitled only if his mother so agreed, and
ignore the condition upon which the agreement was obtained. Defendant was charged with notice of plain-

tiff's inteest as beneficiary and, the cancelation not having been ratified by her, defendant was bound to collect
the premiums and maintain the insurance by deductions
from the pay of the insured. On that basis the court
concluded that the insurance remained in force and that
plaintiff is entitled to recover.
The opinion strongly puts the considerations that make
in favor of plaintiff's claim, but neglects the distinction
between private employment of minors and their service
in army or navy, and fails to give effect to the law applicable to contracts of enlistment and to the terms upon
which the Government granted the .war risk insurance
here in question. In virtue of its power to raise and
support armies, to provide and maintain a navy and to
make rules for the government of land and naval forces,
the Congress may require military service of adults and
minors alike.' The power of the United States may be
exerted to supersede parents' control and their right to
have the services of minor sons who are wanted and fit
for military service.2 And the Congress may confer upon
minors the privilege of serving in land or naval forces,
authorize them to enlist, or draft them upon such terms
as it may deem expedient and just.8

Opinion of the Court.

The statute under which plaintiff's son was accepted
declares that minors between ages of 14 and 18 years
shall not be enlisted in the navy without the consent of
their parents.4 It means that, while minors over 18
may enlist without parental permission, the government
elects not to take those between 14 and 18 unless their
parents are willing to have them go. It is a determination by Congress that minors over 14 have capacity to
make contracts for service in the navy.5 And it is in
harmony with rulings under the common law to the
effect that enlistment of a minor for military service is
not voidable by him or his parents.' Enlistment is more
than a contract; it effects a change of status.7 It operates to emancipate minors at least to the extent that
by enlistment they become bound to serve subject to
rules governing enlisted men and entitled to have and
freely to dispose of their pay.' Upon enlistment of plain4 "No minor under the age of fourteen years shall be enlisted in
the naval service; and minors between the age of fourteen and
eighteen years shall not be enlisted for the naval service without the
consent of their parents or guardians." 34 U. S. C., § 161. (See

tiff's son, and until his death, he became entirely subject to the control of the United States in respect of all
things pertaining to or affecting his service.
The statute does not confer upon or leave with the
parents any right to condition consent to their sons'
enlistment. No Act of Congress permits enlistment of
minors upon condition or upon the qualified consent of
parents, nor does any Act authorize recruiting officers
to bind the United States to carry, or to require an enlisted man to carry, war risk insurance for his own protection or for the benefit of any person. It follows that
defendant was not bound by the condition on which
the trial court found that the parents consented to .he
enlistment of their minor son.'
War risk insurance was made available to those in
active military service for the greater protection of themselves and their dependents." By the insurance contract, of which applicable provisions of statutes and
regulations constitute a part," the insured minor was
authorized to allot a part of his pay for the payment
of premiums,' to change beneficiaries without their
consent" and to cancel the insurance in whole or in

No. 25. Argued October 21, 22, 1937.-Decided November 8, 1937.
1. The law has long recognized a relation between punishment for
breach of prison and the offense for which the prisoner is held,
and it has more severely punished prison-breaking by one undergoing imprisonment for grievous crime than if done by one held
for a lesser offense. P. 53.
2. A law of Pennsylvania classifying punishments to be imposed on
convicts breaking out of the penitentiary by authorizing the
court to imprison each for a period not exceeding his original
sentence, held consistent with the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. P. 52.
