Syllabus.

As the first sentence was a final judgment and appeal

therefrom was properly taken, the District Court was
without jurisdiction during the pendency of that appeal
to modify its judgment by resentencing the prisoner.

UNITED STATES v. KAPP

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 97.

Argued November 12, 1937.-Decided December 6, 1937.

1. Within the meaning of the Criminal Appeals Act, an indictment
for conspiracy (Criminal Code, § 37) to commit a substantive
offense may be treated as founded on the statute defining the substantive offense. P. 216.
2. The District Court sustained a demurrer to 9,n indictment for conspiracy to violate the False Claims Act (§ 35 Criminal Code), upon
the ground that that Act does not apply to an attempt to defraud
the United States by obtaining approval of claims to payments
of money through false representations, if the statute authorizing
such payments is invalid. Held:
(1) A construction not of the indictment but of the False Claims
Act. P. 217.
(2) An inadmissible construction. Id.
3. Those who attempt to obtain payments from the Government by
false representations are estopped to defend upon the ground that
the statute providing for such payments has been declared unconstitutional. P. 218.

Opinion -of the Court.

APPEAL from a judgment sustaining a demurrer to an
-indictment and dismissing the cause.
Assistant Attorney General McMahon, with whom
Solicitor General Reed and Messrs. W. W. Barron and
William C. Lewis were on the brief, for the United States.
Mr. William J. Hughes, Jr., with whom Mr. William E.
Leahy was on the brief, for appellees.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This case comes here under the Criminal Appeals Act.
18 U. S. C. 682.
The second count of an indictment charged appellees
with conspiracy to defraud the United States by furnishing false information and making false statements to the
Secretary of Agriculture in order to secure benefit payments under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12,
1933, c. 25, 48 Stat. 31; Criminal Code, §§ 35, 37; 18
U. S. C., § § 80, 88. The District Court sustained a demurrer to this count and the Government appeals.
The cofltention of the Government is that the appellees
conspired to cheat the United States by selling hogs to
the Government at premium prices through misrepresentation as to the identity of the producers of the hogs
sold and the continued ownership by such producers. Appellees' demurrer went upon the ground, among others,
that the provisions of the statute and the regulations
of the Secretary of Agriculture to which the count referred are void (United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1)
and that the acts set forth in the indictment do not
constitute an offense against the laws of the United
States.
The false claims statute under which the prosecution
was brought penalizes one who "for the purpose and
with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding

216

the Government of the United States . . . shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any
trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause
to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations" (Criminal Code, § 35; 35 Stat. 1095, as
amended, 40 Stat. 1015). After referring to the statute,
the District Judge said in his opinion:
"The overt acts charged, which would be material in
this count, are that hogs were shipped under the representation by the defendants that they were the hogs of
various producers when in fact the hogs belonged to one
or more of the defendants.
"There is no contention that the hogs were not shipped
and that the bills, which were made to Armour and Company and other processors, were not correct bills, with the
exception that the hogs did not originate from the sources
represented by the defendants.
"This ceases to be a material fact, if the provisions of
the Agricultural Adjustment Act are void. In other
words, the representations, which are alleged to have
been made, cease to be misrepresentations of material
facts when the act itself falls."
1. Appellees contend that if any statute was construed,
it was not the statute on which the indictment is founded
and hence that this Court has no jurisdiction. The point
is that the indictment charged a conspiracy under Criminal Code, § 37. But the conspiracy charged'is one to violate the false claims statute, Criminal Code, § 35. In
similar cases the jurisdiction of this Court has been sustained. The statute, at the violation of which the conspiracy is aimed, has been treated as the statute upon
which the indictment is founded within the meaning of
the Criminal Appeals Act. United States v. Bowman,
260 U. S. 94,95; United States v. Walter, 263 U. S. 15,
16, 17. See, also, United States v. Keitel, 211 U. S.370,
387.

UNITED STATES v. KAPP.
214

Opinion of the Court.

2. Appellees contend that the court below construed
the indictment and not the statute. United States v.
Colgate & Co., 250 U. S. 300, 306; United States v. Hastings, 296 U. S. 188, 192. The argument is that a conspiracy to violate § 35 must involve a pecuniary
fraud. United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S. 339, 345, 346.
In that view appellees urge that the court below has simply ruled that there was no pecuniary loss under the facts
alleged. But the District Court found no flaw in the indictment as a pleading. Nor does the court appear to
have considered the question of pecuniary loss. The
court rested its decision upon the point that the facts
alleged in the indictment with respect to the identity of
the producers of the hogs, or the sources from which the
hogs originated, had ceased to be material because of the
unconstitutionality of the provisions of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act. This did not purport to be a construction of the indictment but a ruling that the indictment
in view of the invalidity of that Act failed to state an
offense. The substance of the decision thus appears to
be that the false claims statute does not apply to an attempt to defraud the United States by obtaining the approval of claims and benefit payments through false
representations, if the statute providing for such claims
and payments is found to be invalid. That is clearly a
construction of the statute. United States v. Patten, 226
U. S.525, 535; United States v. Birdsall, 233 U. S. 223,
230.
3. Such a construction is inadmissible. It might as
well be said that one could embezzle moneys in the
United States Treasury with impunity if it turns out
that they were collected in the course of invalid transactions. See Madden v. United States, 80 F. (2d) 672, 674.
Appellees were not indicted for a conspiracy to violate
the Agricultural Adjustment Act but for a conspiracy to
violate the statute protecting the United States against

frauds. It is cheating the Government at which the statute aims and Congress was entitled to protect the Government against those who would swindle it regardless of
questions of constitutional authority as to the operations
that the Government is conducting. Such questions cannot be raised by those who make false claims against the
Government. See Langer v. United States, 76 F. (2d)
817, 824, 825; Madden v. United States, supra; United
States v. Harding, 65 App. D. C. 161; 81 F. (2d) 563,
568.; United States v. MacDonald, 10 F. Supp. 948.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this
opinion.
Reversed.

v. UNITED STATES.*

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 202.

Argued November 15, 1937.-Decided December 6, 1937.

1. Registration of stills for the production of distilled spirits should
be with the District Supervisor of the Alcohol Tax Unit in the
Bureau of Internal Revenue. P. 219.
A count charging conspiracy to commit the offense of possessing
such stills "without haying the same registered with the Collector
of Internal Revenue, as required by law," is therefore bad. (Cf.
Rev. Stats. § 3258; 26 U. S. C. § 1162.)
2. When the first of several counts upon which consecutive sentences are based is defective the sentences should be corrected so
as to fix a .definite date for their commencement. P. 220.'
91 F. (2d) 404, reversed.

CERTIORARI, post, p. 673, to review judgments affirming
judgments sentencing petitioners aftbr conviction upon
four counts of a joint indictment for conspiracy.
* Together with No. 203, Sam Fleisher v. United States; and No.
204, Stein v. United States, also on writs of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
