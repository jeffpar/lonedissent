SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 30.

FOR THE

Argued November 10, 1937.-Decided January 3, 1938.

1. By the common law it is the duty of a trustee or receiver, unless
relieved by agreement, statute, or order of court, to exercise reasonable care in the custody of the fiduciary estate. P. 450.
2. In respect of the care of the funds of the bankrupt estates here
involved, the duty of the trustee or receiver was not limited, by
any agreement, statute, or order of court, to depositing them in one
of the depositories designated by the court under U. S. C., Title 11,
ยง 101. Pp. 450-452.
3. Although designation by the court of depositories for funds of
bankrupt estates limits the discretion of the depositing officer and
may render him absolutely liable for the loss of funds placed elsewhere, it does not relieve him of the duty of exercising care and
prudence within the field left to his discretion. Pp. 451-452.
4. The mere imposition of statutory duties does not remove liability
for breach of existing common law duties. P. 452.
5. The contention that the Bankruptcy Act established a depository
system-analogous to the depository system established by Congress for the deposit of Treasury funds-which relieved trustees
and receivers wholly of the duty of exercising care as to the condition or stability of a depository, cannot be sustained. P. 453.'

depositories, he deposited funds of the estates totaling more than
eight times the penalty of the bank's depository bond. He continued to maintain the funds there, although he knew of several
heavy runs on the bank and that its deposits and resources were
dwindling. The bank closed its doors, and subsequently actions
were brought on the bonds given by H. Held:
(1) The exercise of ordinary care in making and maintaining
deposits, even though made in a designated depository, was part
of H's official duties, and he and his surety are liable on the bonds
if he failed in this respect. P. 454.
(2) The evidence on the issue as to whether H had failed in
the faithful performance of his official duties was ample-particularly in view of the personal loans to him-to justify submitting
the question to the jury. P. 454.

Court.
The question for decision is whether a trustee (or
receiver) in bankruptcy and the surety on his official
bond can be held liable for the loss resulting from the
insolvency of the bank in which the estate's funds were
deposited, if it was one of the depositories designated by
the court under U. S. C. Title 11, ยง 101.

U. S. EX REL. WILLOUGHBY v. HOWARD. 447
445

Opinion of the Court.

Sam Howard was trustee in bankruptcy of 114 separate
bankrupt estates, and was receiver of 9, in the federal
court for northern Illinois, Eastern Division. Between
August 20, 1930, and June 21, 1932, he had deposited the
funds of each of the 123 estates in the Phillip State Bank
and Trust Company of Chicago, as ordinary commercial
accounts. On the latter date the bank, being insolvent,
closed its doors. The aggregate of his bankruptcy deposits in the 123 accounts was, at the time of its closing,
over eight times the penalty of the bank's depository
bond of $50,000. The only dividend received by the
bankruptcy estates was about 11 percent-which Was
paid from the amount collected on the depository bond.
As required by U. S. C. Title 11, ยง 78, Howard had
given an official bond to the United States for each estate,
and Continental Casualty Company was the surety.
The form of the trustee's bond was that prescribed by
Form 25 of the General Orders aid Forms in Bankruptcy,
pursuant to U. S. C. Title 11, ยง 53.
The obligors bound themselves to pay any loss resulting to the estate from failure by Howard, (a) to obey
any order of the court, (b) truly and faithfully to account for all moneys, (c) faithfully to perform his official duties as trustee.' It is agreed that the condition
of the bonds given as receiver was in effect the same.
Howard resigned as trustee or receiver of each estate.
Chester A. Willoughby, who succeeded him, brought in
that court, pursuant to leave, three actions in the name
of the United States against Howard and the Casualty
1 The

condition of each bond given as trustee was: "Now, there-

fore, if the said Sam Howard, Trustee as aforesaid, shall obey such
orders as said Court may make in relation to said trust, and shall
faithfully and truly account for all the moneys, assets and effects
of the estate of said Bankrupt, which shall come into his hands
and possession, and shall in all respects faithfully perform all his
official duties as said-Trustee, then this obligation to be void; otherwise, to remain in full force and virtue."

Company. In these actions, which were consolidated, recovery was sought on each bond on the ground that its
condition had been broken by Howard's failing to perform
his official duties as trustee or receiver. The failure assigned was that he negligently deposited the funds, or
permitted them to remain, in the Phillip Bank, whereas
ordinary care and prudence would have required him to
desist from such practice and take care that the aggregate
of the deposits of estate funds in that bank should not
exceed the penalty of the depository bond. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaints on the ground that
they failed to disclose any breach of the condition of the
bonds. Upon the denial of the motions, the consolidated
cases were heard before a jury on the issue whether
Howard had been negligent in the performance of his official duties in so depositing the funds, or in leaving them,
in the Phillip Bank.
The f3llowing, among other facts, appeared: About
twenty Chicago banks had been designated by the court
as depositories of bankruptcy funds in that district.
Howard, who had for years served as trustee and receiver of bankrupt estates, had, prior to August, 1930, deposited the funds of the estates either in the Central Trust
Company qf Illinois or the Foreman State National Bank
of Chicago. In July he was solicited to transfer his bank'ruptcy deposits to the Phillip Bank, a small institution.
He agreed to do so if the Phillip Bank should become a
depository, would make him unsecured personal loans
sufficient to discharge his existing personal indebtedness
to the Central Trust Company and the Foreman State
National Bank-and would give him thereafter like accommodation. The Phillip Bank loaned him $11,000;
Howard paid his indebtedness to the other banks; and
on August 20, the Phillip Bank qualified as a depository,
giving a bond in the sum of $50,000. Within the next

Opinion of the Court.

few days, Howard opened in the Phillip Bank accounts
for bankruptcy estates with deposits aggregating $249,968.15. The number of his accounts, the aggregate
amount on deposit, and the amount of his personal loans
from that bank increased from time to time. When the
bank closed, the accounts numbered 123, the deposits
aggregated $416,833.90, and the loans to Howard $17,500.
The Phillip Bank's depository bond remained at $50,000.
He knew that during this period of deposit there were
several heavy runs on the Phillip Bank, its deposits were
steadily declining and its resources were being drained.
Defendants' motions for a directed verdict were denied;
the jury found for the plaintiff verdicts aggregating $225,740.45; a new trial was refused; and an appeal was taken
to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case was heard
first by two judges, then reargued before the full court.
A condensed report of the evidence and other proceedings
at the trial occupies 250 pages of the printed record.
Much evidence offered by defendants had been excluded;
many rulings sought had been refused; and timely exceptim)n had been taken to instructions given to the jury and
to those refused. Eighty-four assignments of error had
been filed with the petition for appeal. But the appellate
court examined only a few of the assigned errors. For it
held that the trial court should have directed a verdict for
the defendants, on the ground that, since Howard had
deposited and maintained the funds in one of the banks
designated by the court as depositories, he fully performed
his official duty in respect to the care of the funds. It
reversed the judgment with direction to grant a new trial
and to proceed in accordance with the opinion. 87 F.
(2d) 243. One judge dissented. We granted certiorari
because of the importance of the question presented.
First. That the obligors in the bonds are liable only for
breach by Howard of an official duty may be assumed.

Opinion of the Court.

302 U. S.

By the common law 2 every trustee or receiver of an
estate has the duty of exercising reasonable care in the
custody of the fiduciary estate unless relieved of such
duty by agreement, statute, or order of court. Obviously,
Howard was not relieved of the duty by any agreement.
The question for decision is whether under the Bankruptcy Act,a or any order of the court, this duty in respect
to the care of funds was limited to depositing them in one
of the depositories designated by the court under U. S. C.
Title 11, ยง 101, so that Howard was relieved of all duty
to exercise care in selecting the depository and maintaining funds therein.
Second. No statute relieved Howard of the common
law duty to exercise care in the custody of the funds.

U. S. EX REL. WILLOUGHBY v. HOWARD. 451

Opinion of the Court.

The only relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act prescribing duties of the trustee are:
"Sec. 61 (U. S. C. Title 11, ยง 101). Depositories for
Money. Courts of bankruptcy shall designate, by order,
banking institutions as depositories for the money of
bankrupt estates, as convenient as may be to the residences of trustees, and shall require bonds to the United
States, subject to their approval, to be given by such
banking institutions, and may from time to time as occasion may require, by like order increase the number of
depositories or the amount of any bond or change such
depositories."
"Sec. 47 (U. S. C. Title 11, ยง 75). Duties of Trustees.
(a) Trustees shall respectively . . .
"(3) deposit all money received . . . in one of the
designated depositories;
"(4) disburse money only by check or draft on the
depositories in which it has been deposited;
"(5) furnish such information concerning the estates
. .. and their administration as may be requested by
parties in interest; . . .
"(7) lay before the final meeting of the creditors detailed statements of the administration of the estates;
"(8) make final reports and file final accounts with the
courts fifteen days before the days fixed for the final
meetings of the creditors; . . .
"(10) report to the courts, in writing, the condition
of the estates and the amounts of money on hand, and
such other details as may be required by the courts, within
the first month after their appointment and every two
months thereafter, unless otherwise ordered by the
courts; . . ."
Obviously the Act does not in terms relieve the trustee
of the common law duty to exercise care in the custody of
funds. The designation of banks of deposit proper for
bankruptcy funds, like the listing of legal investments

for trustees and guardians, limits the discretion which
can be exercised by the depositing officer and may render
him absolutely liable for the loss of funds placed in a
non-designated depository. But the fact that the freedom of choice of the fiduciary is limited by statute does
not relieve him of the duty of exercising care and prudence
within the field left to his discretion. As he may not
shut his eyes to the fact that a so-called legal investment
is no longer sound, he may not disregard the fact that
a depository proper when designated is no longer safe.4
The mere imposition of statutory duties does not remove
liability for breach of existing common law duties. Compare Bowerman v. Hamner, 250 U. S. 504, 510-11;
Yates v. Jones National Bank, 206 U. S. 158, 178; Mechanics Universal Joint Co. v. Culhane, 299 U. S. 51, 57.
Third. No order of the court limited the common law
duty of Howard to exercise care in the custody of estate
funds. The Phillip Bank was designated as a depository
on its own application. No order directed Howard to
deposit funds in the Phillip Bank; and no order specifically authorized him to do so. Being free to select any
one or more of the designated depositories, Howard was
in respect thereto under the common law obligation to
exercise care in the performance of his functions as a
fiduciary. While he was making deposits in the Phillip
Bank there were about twenty others in the Chicago area
which were designated depositories, so he had a wide range
from which to choose. By designating the Phillip Bank
as a depository the court may have justified Howard in
assuming that on August 20, 1930, it was a trustworthy

Opinion of the Court.

place of deposit for bankruptcy funds to the extent of
$50,000. But throughout the period of deposit the legal
duty to exercise care remained. If at any time he discovered facts tending to show that the place of deposit
was no longer safe, it was his duty to bring the facts to the
attention of the court.' And at no time was Howard
justified in maintaining a deposit not entirely secured by
the depository bond if he had reasonable cause to doubt
the stability of the bank.
Fourth.The contention that the Bankruptcy Act established a depository system which relieved trustees and
receivers wholly of the duty of exercising care as to the
condition or stability of a depository rests upon false
analogy. For federal public funds Congress has provided
a depository system by which the moneys, as soon as
deposited are in effect in the Treasury of the United
States. 31 U. S. C. ยงยง 476-478, 495; 12 U. S. C. ยงยง 391,
392. Under that system an officer who has duly made the
deposits is relieved of all responsibility for the stability
of the depository. Similar provision has been made in
many States for the deposit of public funds of the state
or municipality.' But the funds of bankruptcy estates
are private funds, see Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Pottorff,
291 U. S. 245, 257, note 11; and the provisions in the
5 Compare Jordon v. Baker, 252 Ky. 40, 49; 66 S. W.'(2d) 84;
Zimmerman v. Coblentz, 170 Md. 468, 476; 185 Atl. 342.
6In a number of States statutes specifically relieve public officers
of liability if the funds entrusted to them are deposited in the manner
provided by law. Some courts hold that in the absence of such a
provision the mere fact that the funds are placed in a duly designated depository is not a complete defense; and that if the officer
acquires knowledge of facts which show the bank to be unsafe, he
may be held responsible if he fails to have the funds removed.

Statement of the Case.

302 U. S.

Bankruptcy Act concerning the appointment of depositories and the deposits to be made by trustees are of a
very different character.
As the exercise of ordinary care in making and maintaining deposits, even if made in a designated depository,
was part of Howard's official duties, he and his surety are
liable on the bonds if he failed in this respect. On that
issue the evidence-particularly in view of the personal
loans to him-was ample to justify submitting the question to the jury. The judgment of the Circuit Court of
Appeals is, therefore, reversed; and the cause is remanded
to it for consideration of the other errors which the
defendants assigned concerning the conduct of the trial.
Reversed.
