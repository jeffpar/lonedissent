HALE ET AL. V. STATE BOARD OF ASSESSMENT
AND REVIEW.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF IOWA.

No. 16. Argued October 18, 19, 1937.-Decided November 8, 1937.
1. In determining the extent of a contractual obligation alleged to
have been impaired by a state law, this Court will accept the
judgment of the highest court of the State unless manifestly wrong.
P. 100.
2. Iowa legislation, in effect when state and municipal bonds were

issued and acquired, declared that such bonds should not be taxed.
Later, a tax on the net income of residents in the State was
imposed for the first time, and income taxes were assessed to the

bondholders, the interest derived from their bonds being included
in the computation of net income. The state court assumed without deciding that the statutes of exemption should be treated as
giving rise to contracts, but interpreted those statutes as limited
to taxes laid directly upon property in proportion to its value,
and not as touching taxes in the nature of an excise upon the net

income of the owner. This Court follows the state court's conclusion, finding that at the least it is not plainly wrong and that
it has support (a) in the State's statutory system of taxation
viewed in its entirety (P. 101), (b) in decisions of Iowa and other
States before the bonds were bought and afterwards (P. 103), and
(c) in decisions of this Court. P. 104.
3. Contracts of tax exemption are strictly construed. P. 103.
4. The classification of a tax upon net income as something different
from a property tax, if not substantially an excise, is not unreasonable. P. 106.
5. The tax complained of in this case is not laid upon the obligation
to pay the principal or the interest, at all events not within the
meaning of the contract of exemption; but is laid upon the yield,
if any, of an aggregate of occupations and investments. P. 107.

APPEAL from a decree sustaining the dismissal by the
State District Court of a petition in equity praying annulment of an income tax assessment.
Messrs. Alan Loth and William L. Hassett, with whom
Mr. Denis M. Kelleher was on the brief, for appellants.
The statutory exemption is contractual within the protection of the Federal Constitution.
The scope of the exemption, and whether this tax violates it, are questions for this Court to determine independently.
An income tax on interest derived from securities is in
practical incidence and effect a tax upon the securities;
and so a property tax within the exemption contract.
The contractual exemption is not confined to property
taxes; it forbids any tax on the bonds, including this tax
on their interest, which always has been held a tax on
the bonds. The exemption is broad and general, and cannot be construed to exclude only one sort of tax on the
bonds.
The exemption cannot be construed thus narrowly in
order to save the constitutionality of the later income
tax statute.

HALE v. STATE BOARD.
95

Argument for Appellants.

Previous Iowa cases do not justify construing the exemption to permit the present tax.
Whether or not income is itself "property," the exemption is violated for this tax still taxes the bonds. City of
Dubuque v. Northwestern Life Ins. Co., 29 Iowa 9, does
not involve nor apply to our question.
Decisions as to whether a graduated income tax is forbidden by state constitutions requiring property taxes
to be uniform do not apply here.
The exemption cannot be avoided by treating the tax
as "in the nature of an excise." Even an excise on receiving income under a pre xisting contract impairs the
obligation of that contract. There is no excise here, for
appellees exercise no taxable privilege which can be the
subject of an excise, or of any tax other than one in the
nature of a property tax. The things mentioned below
to show that appellants "engaged in business" are simple
acts of ownership, not taxable as privileges, and a tax
because of them is a tax on property-ownership and not
an excise. The statute does not pretend to impose an
excise or privilege tax.
Declaring the tax to be one on the recipient of income
rather than on the income is of no avail. Taxing one
because of ownership of property or receipt of such income as this is tantamount to taxing the property or its
income. -This tax is explicitly imposed on the income as
well as on the recipient.
Macallen v. Massachusetts, 279 U. S. 620, and Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501, have not been overruled
or made inapplicable by any subsequent decisions of this
Court, and cases believed to overrule them actually uphold them; and show that whenever the tax is an income
tax (as here) rather than a tax upon corporate franchises,
it may not include income from exempt securities.
The case of People v. Gilchrist, 262 U. S. 94, does not
permit this tax or control this case.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Argument for Appellee.

302 U. S:

The power of the State to levy income taxes can not
override the exemption.
Mr. ClairE. Hamilton, with whom Mr. Leon W. Powers was on the brief, for appellee.
The statutory exemption from taxation is not contractual, and therefore not protected by the Federal Constitution.
To bind a State by a statutory exemption from taxation
there must be a binding contract supported by consideration. A mere gratuity or bounty is not a contract, and
-a general statutory exemption from taxation is a gratuity not a contract. Here there was no consideration for
the exemptions, hence no contract.
The statutes under which the exemptions are claimed
apply to general property taxes only, and not to an
excise.
The exemption statute had been construed by the Supreme Court of Iowa to apply only to general property
taxes, prior to the time when it was amended to include
municipal, county, state and school bonds. Therefore,
the legislature knew that it was amending a statute which
exempted only from general property taxes.
A general income tax is not a property tax but an excise tax. Income is not property, as the Iowa Supreme
Court has held.
People v. Gilchrist, 262 U. S. 84, is authority for the
proposition that the Iowa income tax statute does not
violate the contract clause of the Federal Constitution.
Cases on which appellants rely, as holding that to tax
the interest is to tax the bonds, are not authority for the
questions involved in this case. Most of those cases deal
with the power of a State to tax the Federal Government
or its instrumentalities. None of them deals with the
right of a State to tax its own citizens, under a general
income tax statute.

HALE v. STATE BOARD.
Opinion of the Court.

95

Macallen v. Massachusetts, 279 U. S. 620, is not applicable. The exemption statute involved there exempted
persons as well as property, and the taxing statute, by
amendment, was aimed directly at interest from the
tax-exempt bonds. Moreover, the Massachusetts taxing
statute construed in that case did not impose a general
incoipe tax, but applied only to domestic business
corporations.
The Iowa income tax is not aimed at interest from taxfree bonds. It is a tax on the recipient of the income
measured by his income from all sources.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question is whether interest upon bonds of the
State of Iowa or its political subdivisions may be included
in the assessment of a tax on the net income of the owners
without detracting from earlier exemptions in respect of
taxes upon property and without an unconstitutional
impairment of the obligation of contract.
Appellants, residents of Iowa, were the owners in 1934
and afterwards of Iowa School District bonds, Iowa Road
bonds, Iowa County bonds, and an Iowa Soldiers' Bonus
bond, of the face value, aside from interest, of $752,900.
The statutes of the state in force when the bonds were
issued and when the appellants acquired ownership provide in varying but equivalent terms that such bonds
"are not to be taxed," "shall not be taxed," 2 or "shall be
1 "The following classes of property are not to be taxed: 1. The
property of the United States and this state. . . . municipal, school,

and drainage bonds or certificates hereafter issued by any municipality, school district, drainage district or county within the state."

exempt from taxation." " Iowa was without an income
tax when these exemptions were declared. A "Personal
Net Income Tax" upon persons resident within the state
was imposed for the first time by a statute enacted in
1934. Code 1935, §§ 6943-44 et seq. In the assessment of
that tax for 1935 interest on appellants' bonds in the sum
of $36,893.75 was included by the State Board of Assessment and Review against appellants' protest that the
law, if so applied, impaired the obligation of contracts
of exemption. Constitution of the United States, Article
I, Sec. 10. By appropriate proceedings the controversy
was brought to the Supreme Court of Iowa, where the
assessment was upheld. 271 N. W. 168. The court assumed, without deciding, that the statutes of exemption
should be treated as giving rise to contracts, and not
merely as declarations of a legislative policy subject to
revocation at the legislative pleasure. Proceeding on that
assumption, the court interpreted the contracts as limited to taxes laid directly upon property in proportion to
its value, and not as touching taxes in the nature of an
excise upon the net income of an owner. This conclusion was supported by an analysis of the Iowa statutes
and a review of Iowa decisions as well as the decisions
of this and other courts. The case is here upon appeal.
28 U. S. C. § 344.
We make the same assumption that was made in the
state court as to the existence of a contract, without indicating thereby how we would rule upon the point if a
ruling were essential. Cf. New York ex rel. Clyde v. Gilchrist, 262 U. S.94, 98; Pacific Co. v. Johnson, 285 U. S.
480, 489; Wisconsin & Michigan Ry. Co. v. Powers, 191
U. S. 379, 386; Dodge v. Board of Education, ante, p. 74.
Essential it is not for the decision of this case if the con8"All bonds issued hereunder [the Soldiers' Bonus Act] shall be
exempt from taxation." Acts 39th G. A. c. 332, § 10; Code 1935,

Opinion of the Court.

tract to be assumed is limited in scope and operation as it
was limited below. Whether the limitation should be accepted is thus the pivotal inquiry. The power is ours,
when the impairment of an obligation is urged against a
law, to determine for ourselves the effect and meaning of
the contract as well as its existence. U. S. Mortgage Co.
v. I14atthews, 293 U. S. 232, 236; Funkhouser v. Preston
Co., 290 U. S. 163, 167. Even so, we lean toward agreement with the courts of the state, and accept their judgment as to such matters unless manifestly wrong. Phelps
v. Board of Education, 300 U. S. 319, 322, 323; Violet
Trapping Co. v. Grace, 297 U. S. 119, 120; Tampa Water
Works Co. v. Tampa, 199 U. S. 241, 243, 244; Dodge v.
Board of Education, supra. For reasons to be developed,
obvious error is not discernible in the ruling of the highest court of Iowa that the statutory exemptions invoked
by the appellants were not intended to include taxes upon
the net income derived from business or investments. To
the contrary the decision has support in the statutory
system of taxation viewed in its entirety, in state decisions
both in the courts of Iowa and elsewhere before the bonds
were bought and afterwards, and even indeed in decisions of this court. Our search is for something more than
the meaning of a property tax or an excise in the thought
of skilled economists or masters of finance. It is for the
meaning that at a particular time and place and in the
setting of a particular statute might reasonably have acceptance by men of common understanding.
1. The limitation affixed to the contracts of exemption
has support, first of all, in the statutory system of taxation considered as a whole.
Of the total interest ($36,893.75) collected on appellants' bonds, the greater portion ($32,776.25) is protected,
if at all, by reason of the exemption given to bonds issued
by any school district or county within the state. That
exemption may best be studied as it stood in the Supple-

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

302 U. S.

mental Code of 1915.1 It was then subdivision 1 of § 1304.
There were other subdivisions exempting other items:the grounds and buildings for public libraries; household
furniture up to a prescribed value; the farming utensils
of any person who makes his livelihood by farming; and
many other kinds of property. The section opens with
the statement that "the following classes of property are
not to be taxed," and then enumerates the classes. But
the scope of the exemption is likely to be exaggerated unless the next preceding section (1303) is read at the
same time. "The board of supervisors of each county
shall, annually, at its September session, levy the following taxes upon the assessed value of the taxable property in the county," a mandate clearly addressed to the
levy of ad valorem taxes only. The inference is a fair one
that §..1304 did not exempt the items there enumerated
from taxation of every form and for every purpose. It
withdrew them from the operation of the levy commanded by the. section next preceding.' True, in later
compilations of the statutes, the sections have been rearranged, though with substance unaffected. Cf. Code,
1935, § 6953. In the Code of 1935, subdivision 1 of
§ 1304 is subdivision 5 of § 6944; § 1303 is § 7171. There
can be little doubt that the meaning remains what it
was before. United States v. Ryder, 110 U. S. 729, 740;
United States v. Sischo, 262 U. S. 165, 168, 169; Warner
v. Goltra;293 U. S. 155, 161; Davis v. Davis, 75 N. Y. 221,
'Compare Code of 1851, § 455; Code of 1873, § 797; Code of 1897,

§ 1304.
' An earlier form of the same statute, after providing, like the later
one, that "the following classes of property are not to be taxed,"
adds the significant words, "and they may be omitted from the assessments herein required." Code of 1873, § 797. The opinion in Sioux

City v. Independent School District, 55 Iowa 150, 151, 152; 7 N. W.
488, refers to these words as emphasizing the conclusion that exemption relAtes to taxes on the value of the property. The 1851 Code
provision is almost identical.

Besides the school and county bonds, appellants were
the owners of a Soldiers' Bonus bond in the sum of $1,000,
and Road bonds or certificates to the amount of $82,000.
The.exemption of the Bonus bond was declared by the
statute authorizing the issue. 39th G. A., c. 332, § 10,
adopted March 23, 1921. The exemption is now subdivision 22 of § 6944 of the Code of 1935, and should be
given the same meaning as the exemption conferred by the
other subdivisions. The Road bonds or certificates have
their exemption under a different statute (§ 4753a13,
Codes of 1931 and 1935), but the bonds are expressly
declared to be obligations of the county (§ 4753a14), and,
as the court below observed, there is no reason to suppose
that the exemption given them was broader than that of
county obligations generally.
2. The meaning of the Iowa statutes is clarified, if
otherwise uncertain, by the opinions of the Iowa court
in this and other cases.
The court in its opinion in this case applied the general
principle that contracts of tax exemption must receive a
strict construction. The teaching of this court has been
always to the same effect. "Grants of immunity from
taxation in derogation of a sovereign power of the state,
are strictly construed." Pacific Co. v. Johnson, 285 U. S.
480, 491, citing many cases. Adhering to that principle,
the Iowa court held that the tax exemption was limited
to taxes upon property, and could not be extended to
taxes in the nature of an excise. For this restriction it
found support in its own earlier decisions, rendered many
years before appellants' bonds were purchased. Thus,
Sioux City v. Independent School District, 55 Iowa 150;
7 N. W. 488, decided in 1880, and E. & W. Construction
Co. v. Jasper County, 117 Iowa 365; 90 N. W. 1006, de-

cided in 1902, held the exemption inapplicable to special
assessments, limiting it at the same time "to the taxes
contemplated in title 6 of the Code." 6 So also Iowa Mutual Tornado Ins. Assn. v. Gilbertson, 129 Iowa 658; 106
N. W. 153, decided in 1906, interpreting a different subdivision of the exemption statute, but a cognate one,
again limited the exemption to taxes upon property, and
refused to apply it to an excise or license tax measured by
receipts. The ruling was reiterated in State v. City of
Des Moines, 221 Iowa 642; 266 N. W. 153, decided in
1936, upon facts not greatly different. Cf. Plummer v.
Coler, 178 U. S. 115. From these precedents the Iowa
court advanced to the holding, announced in the case at
bar, that a tax upon net income was substantially an excise, and hence did not come within the scope of an exemption confined to taxes upon property. The result
was conceived to be latent in the precedents if effect was
to be given to their fair implications. "So the state
court has told us," construing its own decisions, "and the
good faith of its declaration is not successfully impeached." Stockholders v. Sterling, 300 U. S. 175, 183.
3. The ruling that a tax upon net income is without the
scope of the exemption cannot be adjudged unreasonable,
for it will be found to be supported by decisions in many
other states, and even, indeed, by decisions of this court.
(a) The question as to the nature of such a tax has
come up repeatedly under state constitutions requiring
taxes upon property to be equal and uniform, or imposing similar restrictions. Many, perhaps most, courts
hold that a net income tax is to be classified as an excise.!

the better reason if the choice were an original one for us,
unaffected by the view accepted in the court below.

not plainly wrong. The propriety of our keeping to it is

decisions pointing the same way before appellants became
owners.
(b) Finally, and even more conclusively, decisions of
our own court forbid us to stigmatize as unreasonable
the classification of a tax upon net income as something
different from a property tax, if not substantially an excise. New York ex rel. Clyde v. Gilchrist, 262 U. S. 94;
New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U. S. 308; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, all point in
that direction. We will consider them in the order stated.
The taxpayer in New York ex rel. Clyde v. Gilchrist
claimed the benefit of an exemption under a statute of
New York to the effect that, upon payment of a recording tax, debts and obligations secured by mortgages of
real property should be exempt from other taxation by
the state and local subdivisions. . The question was
whether the exemption thus accorded was applicable to
an income tax enacted long afterwards. The state court
ruled against the taxpayer (People ex rel. Central Union
Trust Co. v. Wendell, 197 App. Div. 131; 188 N. Y. S.
344; People ex rel. Clyde v. Wendell, 197 App. Div. 913;
187 N. Y. S. 949; 232 N. Y. 550; 134 N. E. 567), assuming the existence of a contract of exemption, but holding
that it was not intended to apply to taxes upon income.
This court, considering the fact that at the date of the
exemption statute "no one thought of an income tax,"
and recalling that "any contract of exemption must be
shown to have been indisputably within the intention of
the Legislature," sustained the judgment of the state
court. "The conclusion does not seem to us very difficult
to reach." 262 U. S. at p. 98.
The controversy in New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves,
decided at the last term, evoked a ruling by this court
that a state tax upon net income which included rents
derived from land in another state, was not equivalent to
a property tax imposed upon the land itself. "The inci-

HALE v. STATE BOARD.
95

Opinion of the Court.

dence of a tax on income differs from that of a tax on
property. Neither tax is dependent upon the possession
by the taxpayer of the subject of the other. His income
may be taxed, although he owns no property, and his
property may be taxed although it produces no income."
300 U. S. at p. 314. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust
Co., 157 U. S.429; 158 U. S.601, was considered and distiriguished. Two rulings emerge as a result of the analysis. By the teaching of the Pollock case an income tax
on the rents of land (157 U. S.429) or even on the fruits
of other investments (158 U. S. 601) is an impost upon
property within the section of the Constitution (Art. I,
sec. 2, cl. 3) governing the apportionment of direct taxes
among the states. 300 U. S. at p. 315. By the teaching
of the same case an income tax, if made to cover the interest on government bonds, is a clog upon the borrowing
power such as was condemned in McCulloch v. Maryland,
4 Wheat. 316, and Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124.
300 U. S. at pp. 315, 316. There was no holding that
the tax is a property one for every purpose or in every
context. We look to all the facts.
In line with that conception of the Pollock case is
Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., supra, where the
court pointed out (240 U. S. at pp' 16, 17) that "the
conclusion reached in the Pollock Case did not in any degree involve holding that income taxes generically and
necessarily came within the class of direct taxes on property," but that to the contrary such taxes were enforcible
as excises except to the extent that violence might thus
be done to the spirit and intent of the rule governing
apportionment.
The doctrine of these decisions, we think, is applicable
here. We do not overlook the argument that the promise
to pay interest may be part of the obligation of a contract as much as the promise to pay principal. To concede this counts for little if the distinction between an

108

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

302 U. S.

excise and a property tax, or between the different meanings of a property tax, is not permitted to escape us.
Unless the foregoing analysis is faulty, the tax complained
of by appellants is not laid upon the obligation to pay
the principal or interest created by the bonds, at all
events within the meaning of the contract of exemption.
The tax is laid upon the net results of a bundle or aggregate of occupations and'investments. Under a statute
so conceived and framed a. man may own a quantity of
state and county bonds and pay no tax whatever. The
returns from his occupation and investments are thrown
into a pot, and after deducting payments for debts and
expenses as well as other items, the amount of the net
yield is the base on which his tax will be assesssed. Cf.
United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, 247 U. S. 321, 329.
In the light of all the precedents brought together in
this opinion, we cannot say that a tax assessed on such
a base is a plain violation of any contract of exemption
to be discovered in the laws of Iowa.
Doubtless a contract of exemption can be phrased in
such terms as to forbid the imposition of a net income tax
or indeed a tax of any sort. Bonds issued by the Government of the United States are sometimes exempt by
their express terms from income taxes to any degree (40
Stat. 35, § 1), sometimes from income taxes other than
surtaxes or excess profits taxes. 40 Stat. 288, 291, § 7.
Such were the Liberty Bonds considered by this court in
Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, 279 U. S. 620. Broad
also was the exemption given to the Federal Farm Loan
bonds considered in the same case, at least in respect of
taxes levied by the states, for the bonds were declared
expressly to be federal instrumentalities. 39 Stat. 360,
380, § 26. Less clear and comprehensive was the exemption of the Massachusetts bonds declared by a Massachusetts statute (Mass. G. L. c. 59, § 5) and dealt with
more or less summarily at the end of the opinion. 279

Opinion of the Court.

U. S. at p. 634. However, the courts of Massachusetts
had already rejected the. contention that an income tax
was to be classified as an excise rather than a tax on
property. Opinion of the Justices, 220 Mass. 613, 624;
108 N. E. 570; 266 Mass. 583, 585; 165 N. E. 900; Harrison v. Commissioner of Corporations, 272 Mass. 422,
427; 172 N. E. 605. The meaning of the exemption was
properly ascertained in subjection to that ruling. Cf.
Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, 282 U. S. 379, and
Pacific Co. v. Johnson, supra.
Nothing in this opinion is at war with Weston v.
Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, or other cases declaring the immunities of governmental agencies. In the case cited
and its congeners the problem for decision was whether
a tax upon income, even though not a property tax in
strictness or for every purpose, was one in such a sense
or in such a measure as to hamper the freedom of the
central government through the interference of the states
or the freedom of the states through the interference of
the central government. The limitations declared in
those decisions were gathered by implication from the
structure of our federal system, and were accommodated,
as the court believed, to the public policy at stake. What
the court is now concerned with, however, is not the
preservation or protection of any governmental function.
Iowa cannot be held to cripple in an unconstitutional way
her own privileges and powers when she levies an income
or even a property tax upon bonds issued by herself.
The court is now concerned with the meaning and effect
of particular contracts of exemption to be read narrowly
and strictly. There is no room at such a time for the
freer and broader methods that have been thought to be
appropriate in the development of the doctrine of implied
restraints.
The judgment is
Affirmed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
SUTHERLAND,

MR. JUSTICE

SUTHERLAND,

I think the judgment should be reversed.
At the time the bonds here involved were purchased,
the statutes of Iowa expressly provided that they "are not
to be taxed" or "shall not be taxed" or "shall be exempt
from taxation." These are plain words, and there is no
room for construction. When the language is clear, it is
conclusive. "There can be no construction where there
is nothing to construe." This has been held so often by
this court that it has become axiomatic. That the provisions with respect to the non-taxability of the bonds constitute a statutory contract with the purchaser of the
bonds, and that any subsequent statute which violates
these provisions impairs the obligation of the contract, is
not a matter of dispute. The sole question is whether the
imposition of an income tax in respect of the interest
derived from the bonds is a tax upon the bonds.
We are not concerned with the name given to the tax.
The exemption is in unqualified terms, and includes all
taxes. And I see no warrant for saying that the exemption must be limited to so-called ad valorem taxes. The
exemption is not in the form or nature of a proviso to
the section fixing the time and providing for the levy of
such taxes, but is a substantive enactment standing independently and complete in itself. Nor do I see any ground
for confining it to taxes then known to the Iowa law.
Such an all-embracing exemption cannot be avoided by
the invention of a new tax. To me, it seems evident that
if any tax be imposed upon the bonds, the contract is
impaired. It likewise seems evident that the tax here is
imposed on the bonds themselves.
Of what does a bond for the payment of money consist?
Certainly not the principal alone; for the promise to pay
interest is as much a part of the obligation of the bond
as the promise to pay the principal. A bond, for example, promises to pay the bearer at the end of ten years
the sum of $1,000, and also interest at the rate of 5% per

annum, to be paid semi-annually; that is to say, promises
to pay $25 at the end of every six-months' period, and
$1,000 at the end of ten years. There is no difference
between the two promises in respect of their binding or
legal quality. Both are obligations of the bond. If one
cannot be violated, neither can the other.
There is no difference in principle between such a bond
and one'where the bond is issued upon a discount basis,
as in the case of United States Savings Bonds (Treasury
Department Circular No. 529, February 25, 1935). A
United States Savings Bond for $1,000, payable in ten
years "without interest," may be, purchased for the sum
of $750-the remaining $250 being deferred interest.
Plainly, the $250 deferred interest is as much a part
of the bond as the $750 originally invested; and a contractual obligation exempting the bond from taxation is
equally applicable to each. Is the case different if the
bond shall provide for the payment of $750, together
with interest in the sum of $250 to be paid in installments
or at the end of ten years? Certainly not, unless form is
to be exalted and substance ignored.
The force of what has been said cannot be avoided by
merely calling the tax an excise. If a tax falls upon the
bond and lessens its proceeds, either in respect of principal or interest, it is a tax on the bond, and cannot be made
something else by resort to the vocabulary or by employing some circuitous method of imposing it. It is well
settled, at least generally, that "what cannot be done
directly . . . cannot be accomplished indirectly by legislation which accomplishes the same result." Fairbankv.
United States, 181 U. S. 283, 294, 300, and cases cited. I
am unable to subscribe to that philosophy which seems
to teach that a forbidden result may nevertheless be
achieved if only some delusive and devious way of achieving it can be found.
