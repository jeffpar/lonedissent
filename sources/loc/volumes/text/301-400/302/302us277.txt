BREEDLOVE v. SUTTLES.
272

Syllabus.

New York court said, 259 N. Y., pp. ,70-71, "to set off his
deposit when the maker is solvent and able to indemnify
the indorser as in this case would enable the indorser to
collect the full amount unpaid on the note from the maker
and at the same time receive a larger amount of his deposit
than other depositors. Such a result would be inequitable." An excellent statement in support of the foregoing view, and the reasons for it, will be found in the
opinion delivered by Judge Parker in Shannon v. Sutherland, 74 F. (2d) 530, 531-532.
The facts are not sufficiently disclosed by the record
to enable us to dispose of this item. The opinion of neither
court deals with the subject, and respondents, neither in
their brief nor oral argument, have had anything to say
about it. In these circumstances, the case must be remanded to the district court for further consideration of
the question, with authority, in its discretion, to take
further evidence to that end. With that exception, the
decree below is approved.
Reversed and. remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

BREEDLOVE v. SUTTLES, TAX COLLECTOR.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA.

No. 9.

Argued November 16, 17, 1937.-Decided December 6, 1937.

1. A Georgia statute exempts all persons under 21 or over 60 years
of age, and all females who do not register for voting, from a poll
tax of $1.00 per year, which is levied generally upon all inhabi-

tants, and which, under the state constitution, must be paid by the
person liable, together with arrears, before he can be registered for
voting. Held that males who are not within the exemption are
not denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 281-282.

2. On the basis of special consideration to which they are naturally
entitled, women ad a class may be exempted from poll taxes without exempting men. P. 282.
3. Since this discrimination is permissibie in favor of all women, a
man subject to the tax has no status to complain that, among
women, the tax is levied only on those who register to vote, or
that registration is allowed to them without paying taxes for previous years. P. 282.
4. Payment of the Georgia poll tax as a prerequisite to voting is not
required for the purpose of denying or abridging the privilege of
voting. P. 282.
5. Exaction of payment of poll taxes before registration as an aid to
collection is a use of tht State's power consistent with the Federal Constitution. P. 283.
6. Voting is. a privilege derived not from the United States but from
the State, which may impose such conditions as it' deems appropriate, subject only to the limitations of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments and other provisions of the Federal Constitution. P. 283.
7. A state law requiring payment of poll taxes as a condition to
voting does not abridge any privilege or immunity protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 283.
8. The Nineteenth Amendment, forbidding denial or abridgement
of the right to vote, on account of sex, applies equally in favor of
men and women, and by its own force supersedes inconsistent
measures, whether federal or state. P. 283.
9. It was not the purpose of the Nineteenth Amendment to limit the
taxing power of the State. P. 283.
10. The Georgia statute levying on 'inhabitants of the State. a poll
tax, payment whereof is made a prerequisite to voting, but exempting females who do not register for voting, does not abridge the
right of male citizens to vote, on account of their sex, and is not
repugnant to the Nineteenth Amendment. P. 284.

the appellee to allow the appellant to register for voting
for federal and state officers at primary and general elections, without payment of poll taxes.

BREEDLOVE v. SUTTLES.
277

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. J. Ira Harrelsonand Henry G. Van Veen, with
whom Mr. Arthur Garfield Hays was on the brief, for
appellant.
The appellant contends that the privilege of voting
for federal officials is one to which he is entitled, unrestricted by a tax unreasonably imposed through state
invasion of his rights as a citizen of the United States.
As such citizen he is entitled to participate in the choice
of electors of the President and the Vice President of
the United States and of Senators and Representatives
in Congress and no State may exercise its taxing power
so as to destroy this privilege. If the tax imposed by
Georgia were increased to a high degree, as it can be if
valid, it could be used to reduce the percentage of voters
in the population to even less than eight per cent. as at
present, or to destroy the elective franchise altogether.
Whatever property and other economic restrictions on
the franchise may have been upheld in earlier periods
of our history, the admission today that a State has the
power to prevent its poorer inhabitants from participating
in the choice of federal officials would be totally contrary
to the contemporary spirit of American institutions, and
inconsistent with the purposes announced in the Preamble
to the United States Constitution.
Messrs. W. S. Northcutt and E. Harold Sheats, with
whom Mr. Chas. B. Shelton was on the brief, for appellee.
MR. JUsTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the
Court.
A Georgia statute provides that there shall be levied
and collected each year .from every inhabitant of the
State between the ages of 21 and 60 a poll tax of one
dollar, but that the tax shall not be demanded from the

blind or from females who do not register for voting.
Georgia Code, 1933, § 92-108. The state constitution
declares that to entitle a person to register and vote at
any election he shall have paid all poll taxes that he may
have had opportunity to pay agreeably to law. Art. II,
§ I, par. III; Code, § 2-603. The form of oath prescribed
to qualify an elector contains a clause declaring compliance with that requirement. § 34-103. Tax collectors
may not allow any person to register. for voting unless
satisfied that his poll taxes have been paid. § 34-114.
Appellant brought this suit in the superior court of Fulton
pounty to have the clause of the constitution and the
statutory provisions above mentioned declared repugnant
to various provisions of the Federal Constitution and to
compel appellee to allow him to register for voting without payment of poll taxes. The court dismissed his petition. The state supreme court affirmed. 183 Ga. 189;
188 S. E. 140.
The pertinent facts alleged in the petition are these.
March 16, 1936, appellant, a white male citizen 28 years
old, applied to appellee to register him for voting for
federal and state officers at primary and general elections.
He informed appellee he had neither made poll tax returns nor paid any poll taxes and had not registered to
vote because a receipt for poll taxes and an oath that he
had paid them are prerequisites to registration. He demanded that appellee administer the oath, omitting the
part declaring payment of poll taxes, and allow him to
register. Appellee refused.
Appellant maintains that the provisions in question are
repugnant to the equal protection clause and the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and to the Nineteenth Amendment.
1. He asserts that the law offends the rule of equality
in that it extends only to persons between the ages of
21 and 60 and to women only if they register for voting

and in that it makes payment a prerequisite to registration. He does not suggest that exemption of the blind
is unreasonable.
Levy by the poll has long been a familiar form of taxation, much used in some countries and to a considerable
extent here, at first in the Colonies and later in the
States. To prevent burdens deemed grievous and oppressive, the constitutions of some States prohibit or limit
poll taxes. That of Georgia prevents more than a dollar
a year. Art VII, § II, par. III; Code § 2-5004. Poll
taxes are laid upon persons without regard to their occupations or property to raise money for the support of government or some more specific end.1 The equal protection clause does not require absolute equality. While
possible by statutory declaration to levy a poll tax upon
every inhabitant of whatsoever sex, age or condition, collection from all would be impossible for always there are
many too poor to pay. Attempt equally to enforce such
a measure would justify condemnation of the tax as harsh
and unjust. See Faribaultv. Misener, 20 Minn. 396, 398;
Thurston County v. Tenino Stone Quarries,44 Wash. 351,
355; 87 Pac. 634; Salt Lake City v. Wilson, 46 Utah 60,
66, et seq.; 148 Pac. 1104. Collection from minors would
be to put the burden upon their fathers or. others upon
whom they depend for support 2 It is not unreasonable
to exclude them from the class taxed.
Men who have attained the age of 60 are often, if not
always, excused from road work, jury duty and service

in the militia." They have served or have been liable to
be called on to serve the public to the extent that the
State chooses to require. So far as concerns equality
under the equal protection clause, there is no substantial
difference between these exemptions and exemption from
poll taxes. The burden laid upon appellant is precisely
that put upon other men. The rate is a dollar a year,
commencing at 21 and ending at 60 years of age.
The tax being upon persons, women may be exempted
on the basis of special considerations to which they are
naturally entitled. In view of burdens necessarily borne
by them for the preservation of the race, the State reasonably may, exempt them from poll taxes. Cf. Muller v.
Oregon, 208 U. S.412, 421, et seq. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, 223 U. S. 59, 63. Riley v. Massachusetts, 232
U. S. 671. Miller v. Wilson, 236 U. S. 373, Bosley v.
McLaughlin, 236 U. S.385. The laws of Georgia declare
the husband to be the head of the family and the wife
to be subject to him. § 53-501. To subject her to the
levy would be to add to his burden. Moreover, Georgia
poll taxes are laid to raise money for educational purposes, and it is the father's duty to provide for education
of the children. § 74-105. Discrimination in favor of
all women being permissible, appellant may not complain
because the tax is laid only upon some or object to registration of women without payment of taxes for previous
years. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, 275 U. S. 440, 447.
Rosenthal v. New York, 226 U. S.260, 270.
Payment as .a prerequisite is not required for the purpose of denying or abridging the privilege of voting. It
does not limit the tax to electors; aliens are not there
permitted to vote, but the tax is laid upon them, if within
'InGeorgia, men are excused from road work at 50 (§ 95-401)
from jury duty at 60 (§ 59-112) and from liability for service in the
militia at 45 (§ 86-201; see also § 86-209).

BREEDLOVE v. SUTTLES.

the defined class. It is not laid upon persons 60 or more
years old, whether electors or not. Exaction of payment
before registration undoubtedly serves to aid collection
from electors desiring to vote, but that use of the State's
power is not prevented by the Federal Constitution. Cf.
Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292.U. S. 40, 44.
2. To make payment of poll taxes a prerequisite of
voting is not to deny any privilege or immunity protected
by the Fourteenth Amendment. Prirvilege of voting is
not derived from the United States, but is conferred
by the State and, save as restrained by the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments and other provisions of the Federal Constitution, the State may condition suffrage as it deems appropriate. Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 170 et seq. Ex parte Yarbrough, 110
U. S. 651, 664-665. McPherson v. Blackeer, 146, U. S. 1,

37-38. Guinn v. United States, 238 U. S. 347, 362. The
privileges and immunities protected are only those that
arise from the Constitution and laws of the United States
and not those that spring from other sources. Hamilton
v. Regents, 293 U. S. 245, 261.
3. The Nineteenth Amendment, adopted in 1920, declares: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote
shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or
by any State on account of sex." It applies to pen and
women alike and by its own force supersedes inconsistent
measures, whether federal or state. Leser v. Garnett, 258
U. S. 130, 135. Its purpose is not to regulate the levy
or collection of taxes. The construction for which appellant contends would make the amendment a limitation
upon the power to tax. Cf. Minor v. Happersett, supra,
173; Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., 271 U. S. 170,
173-174. The payment of poll taxes as a prerequisite to
voting is a familiar and reasonable regulation long enforced in many States and for more than a century in

Georgia.' That measure reasonably may be deemed essential to that form of levy. Imposition without enforcement would be futile. Power to levy and power to collect are equally necessary. And, by the exaction of payment before registration, the right to vote is neither
denied nor abridged on account of sex. It is fanciful to
suggest that the Georgia law is a mere disguise under
which to deny or abridge the right of men to vote on
account. of their sex. The challenged enactment is not
repugnant to the Nineteenth Amendment.
