ATLANTIC REFINING CO. v. VIRGINIA.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA.

No. 1. Argued October 21, 22, 1936. Reargued October 11, 1937.Decided November 8, 1937.
1. An entrance fee exacted by a State from a foreign corporation
for a license -to carry on local business is not a tax but compensation for a privilege, and the validity of the charge is not dependent
upon the method by Which the amount is determined. P. 26.
2. There is nothing to show that the entrance fee of $5000 charged
the corporation in this case was more than reasonable compensation for the privilege granted. P. 27.
3. The amount of authorized capital stock does not represent either
property owned or business done by a corporation; and an entrance fee for the privilege of doing local business, measured by
the authorized capital stock of a foreign corporation having property situate in many of the States and abroad, used in interstate
and foreign commerce, does not necessarily burden such commerce. P. 28.
4. Such an entrance fee, so measured, held not an arbitrary taking
of property beyond the jurisdiction, nor arbitrary in amount.
P. 29.
The value of the privilege is dependent upon the financial resources of the corporation; 'not only present capital, but also
capital to be procured by issuing additional stock. The power
inherent in the possession of large financial resources is not dependent upon, or confined to, the place where the assets are located,; and the value of the privilege to 6xert that power is not
necessarily measured by the amount of the property located, or
by the amount of the local business done, in the State granting
the privilege.
5. Virginia statute imposing graded fees on foreign corporations,
measured on authorized capital stock, for authority to do business
in the State,. does not operate arbitrarily and unequally between
the appellant and other foreign corporations seeking the same
privilege within the State. P. 31.

JUSTICE

BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Atlantic Refining Company is a Pennsylvania
corporation engaged in refining and selling gasoline and
petroleum which it markets throughout the United
States and in foreign countries. In 1929 the year's sales
aggregated more than $153,000,000. Prior to 1930 the
company had never applied for permission to do business
in Virginia. It had not done any intrastate business
there; and had no property or place of business within
the State. It had done some interstate business, but had
not paid, or been requested by the State to pay, either
an entrance fee or taxes. In January 1930 the company
applied to the State Corporation Commission for a certificate of authority to do intrastate business. Its net assets were then $132,196,275; its authorized capital $100,000,000; its issued capital $67,049,500. The Commission
granted the certificate; but, as prescribed by Chapter 53,

of Virginia to be ascertained and fixed as follows:
For a company whose maximum capital stock is fifty thousand
dollars, or less, thirty dollars;
For a company whose capital stock is over fifty thousand dollars, and not to exceed one million dollars, sixty cents for each
thousand dollars or fraction thereof;
Over one million dollars, and not to exceed ten million dollars,

Over ninety million dollars, five thousand dollars.
But foreign corporations without capital stock shall pay fifty
dollars for such certificate of authority to do business within the
State.
For the purpose of this section the amount to which the company
is authorized by the terms of its charter to increase its capital stock
shall be considered its maximum capital stock."

Opinion of the Court.

Answering the company's statement under Rule 12, the
Commonwealth opposed our taking jurisdiction. Its objection was that the appeal presented no substantial federal question, since, in 1918, the validity of the statute
was challenged under similar circumstances and sustained by a unanimous Court in General Railway Signal
Co. v. Virginia, 246 U. S. 500; and, in 1928, was again
sustained, by a Per Curiam opinion, in Western Gas Construction Co. v. Virginia, 276 U. S. 597. The company
asks us to overrule these decisions, contending that they
are inconsistent with other and later cases. It asserts that
in sustaining the Virginia statute this Court followed
views expressed in Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts,
231 U. S. 68, 87; and that the doctrine of the Baltic case
has since been repudiated, in Alpha Portland Cement Co.
v. Massachusetts, 268 U. S. 203, 218 and Cudahy Packing
Co. v. Hinkle, 278 U. S. 460, 466. Consideration of the
jurisdiction of this Court was postponed to the hearing
on the merits.
By the statute foreign corporations are divided, for the
purpose of fixing the amount of the entrance fee, into
twelve classes. The fee for the lowest class-those whose
authorized capital stock is $50,000 or less-is $30. The
fee for the highest class-those whose authorized capital
stock exceeds $90,000,000-is $5,000. The company does
not object to the subject or the occasion of the exaction.
Its objection is solely to the measure. Its claim is that
the statute imposes an unconstitutional condition because it determines the amount of the fee by the amount
of the company's authorized capital. The contention is
that a fee so determined necessarily burdens ixterstate
commerce, denies due process, and denies equal protection of the laws.
Unlike the cases in which the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions has been applied, the condition here

questioned does not govern the corporation's conduct
after admission. But it may be assumed that the rule declared in Terral v. Burke Construction Co., 257 U. S.
529, is applicable also to conditions to be performed
wholly before admission; and that the $5,000 must be
refunded if its exaction involved denial of any constitutional right. For we are of opinion that in refusing to
grant the authority to carry on local business except upon
payment of the $5,000 no constitutional right of the company was violated.
First. Virginia recognized the constitutional right of
the company to carry on interstate business without paying an entrance fee. On the other hand, the company
conceded that the Federal Constitution does not confer
upon it the right to engage in intrastate commerce in Virginia unless it has secured the consent of the State.
Compare Hemphill v. Orloff, 277 U. S. 537, 548.
Whether the privilege shall be granted to a foreign corporation is a matter of state policy. Virginia might refuse to grant the privilege for any business, or might
grant the privilege for some kinds of business and deny
it to others 2 It might grant the privilege to all corporations with small capital while denying the privilege to
those whose capital or resources are large. It might grant
the privilege without exacting compensation; or it could
insist upon a substantial payment as a means of raising
revenue.
As the entrance fee is not a tax, but compensation for
a privilege applied for and granted, no reason appears
why the State is not as free to charge $5,000 for the
privilege as it would be to charge that amount for a

franchise granted to a local utility, or for a parcel of land
which it owned. If Virginia had the power to charge
$5,000 for the privilege, the particular measure applied
by the Legislature in arriving at that sum would seem
to be legally immaterial; and the company is in a position like that of the taxpayer in Castillo v. McConnico,
168 U. S. 674, 680, of whom it was said: "His right is
limited solely to the inquiry whether in the case which
he presents the effect of applying the statute is to deprive him of his property without due process of law."
The validity even of a tax "can in no way be dependent
upon the mode which the State may deem fit to adopt."
Home Insurance Co. v. New York, 134 U. S. 594, 600.
"The selected measure may appear to be simply a matter
of convenience in computation . . . and if the tax
purports to be laid upon a subject within the taxing
power of the State, it is not to be condemned by. the
application of any artificial rule . . ." Kansas City,
F. S. & M. Ry. Co. v. Botkin, 240 U. S. 227, 233. Compare Rae Consolidated Copper Co. v. United,States, 268
U. S. 373, 376; New York v. Latrobe, 279 U. S. 421, 427.
Second. Even if the Federal Constitution conferred
upon every foreign corporation the right to enter any
State and carry on there a local business upon paying a
reasonable fee, there is nothing in the record to show
that the $5,000 charged is more than reasonable compensation for the privilege granted. The payment required is a single, non-recurrent charge-a payment in
advance for a privilege extending into the long future.
No matter how large the company's local business may
be, no matter how much, or how often, its issued capital
may be increased, no additional entrance fee is payable.
The value of such a privilege cannot be gauged by the
sales expected in the year 1930.1 They may increase

rapidly from year to year. The corporation with $132,196,275 assets in 1930 may have more than double the
amount a decade later. Nor is it unreasonable to base
the fee upon the amount of the capital authorized at the
time of the application, instead of charging a fee based
upon the amount of the capital then issued, or upon the
amount of assets then owned, and exacting later additional fees if, and when, more capital stock is issued or
more assets are acquired. By fixing the fee in accordance with the, capital authorized at the time of the application for admission, the State relieves itself of the necessity of keeping watch of changes in the future in these
respects.
Third. It is contended that a fee measured solely by
the amount of the corporation's authorized capital stock
necessarily burdens interstate commerce. In support of
that contention it is said that the authorized capital stock
represents property located in forty-seven States and several foreign countries used in both interstate and foreign
commerce. But this is not true. Authorized capital has
no necessary relation to the property actually owned or
used by the corporation; furthermore, the fee for which
it is the measure represents simply the privilege of doing
a local business. Because the entrance fee does not represent either property or business being done, it is immaterial that in fixing its amount no apportionment is made
between the property owned or the business done within
the State and that owned or done elsewhere.
The entrance fee is obviously not a charge laid upon
interstate commerce; nor a charge furtively directed
against interstate commerce; nor a charge measured by
such commerce. Its amount does not grow or shrink
according to the volume of interstate commerce or the
property and business within the State. The aggregate of the sales
of the company in interstate commerce in Virginia in 1929 and of
sales by the subsidiaries in intrastate commerce amounted to
$1,396,600. About two-thirds of this business was intrastate.

amount of the capital used in it. The size of the fee
would be exactly the same if the company did no interstate commerce in Virginia or elsewhere. The entrance
fee is comparable to the charter, or incorporation, fee of
a domestic corporation-a fee commonly measured by
the amount of the capital authorized.' It has never been
doubted that such a charge to a domestic corporation
whatever the amount is valid, although the company proposes to engage in interstate commerce and to acquire

property also in other States.

No reason is suggested

why a different rule should be applied to the entrance fee
charged this foreign corporation.

the entrance fee solely by the authorized capital deprives
the corporation of its property without due process, beForty-three states as well as the District of Columbia, Alaska,

cause the amount is determined by reference to property
beyond the taxing jurisdiction; and also that this charge
is an arbitrary taking of property. As has been shown,
the amount of the entrance fee is not measured by property, either within or without the jurisdiction; and it is
not a tax upon property. It is payment for an opportunity granted. Nor is it a charge arbitrary in amount.
The value of the privilege acquired is obviously dependent
upon the financial resources of the corporation-not only
upon the capital possessed at the time of its admission
to do business, but also upon the capital which it will

ity to issue additional stock. Obviously, the power inherent in the possession of large financial resources is
not dependent upon, or confined to, the place where the
assets are located. Compare Great Atlantic & Pacific
Tea Co. v. Grosjean,301 U.. S. 412. Great power may be
exerted by the company in Virginia although it has little
property located there. And the value to it of the privilege to exert that power is not necessarily measured by
the amount of the property located, or by the amount
of the local business done, in Virginia. Moreover, it is
immaterial whether the opportunity is availed of or not.
The State grants a large privilege. It may demand a corresponding price.
Fifth. It is contended that the statute by measuring
the entrance fee solely by the authorized capital is void
because it operates arbitrarily and unequally between the
appellant and other foreign corporations seeking the
same privilege Within the State. The contention is unfounded. Even if a corporation which has not yet been
admitted to do business were in a position to complain
that the State denies it equal protection, there is here
no basis for a claim of discrimination. Every foreign
corporation with an authorized capital exceeding ninety
million dollars which seeks admission to do an intrastate
business is, and has been since 1910, required to pay the
same entrance fee. Nor is there any discrimination between foreign corporations and domestic of which the
company may complain. While the charter fees of domestic corporations are smaller than the entrance fees
of foreign corporations, Virginia levies upon foreign corporations, after admission, less in taxes than it does upon
domestic corporations. A domestic corporation with an
authorized capital of $100,000,000 is required to pay a
charter fee of only $600; but it must pay each year a
franchise tax of $8,850. A foreign corporation of that
authorized capital is required to pay ail entrance fee of
$5,000, but pays no franchise tax whatever.

32

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

302 U. S.

The difference in the powers of a State over entrance
fees and taxes was pointed out in Hanover Fire Ins. Co.
v. Harding, 272 U. S. 494, 510-511: "In subjecting a law
of the State which imposes a charge upon foreign corporations to the test whether such a charge violates the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
a line has to be drawn between the burden imposed by
the State for the license or privilege to do business in
the State, and the tax burden which, having secured the
right to do business, the foreign corporation must share
with all the corporations and other taxpayers of the
State. With respect to the admission fee, so to speak,
which the foreign corporation must pay, to become a
quasi citizen of the State and entitled to equal privileges
with citizens of the State, the measure of the burden is
in the discretion of the State, and any inequality as between the foreign corporation and the domestic corporation in that regard does not come within the inhibition
of the Fourteenth Amendment; but, after its admission,
the foreign corporation stands equal, and is to be classified with domestic corporations of the same kind."
Sixth. The position of the company in the case at bar
differs radically from that of the foreign corporation involved in Cudahy Packing Co. v. Hinkle, supra, and from
those in the other decisions of this Court on which appellant relies. In each of those cases the corporation had,
before the exaction held unconstitutional, entered the
State with its permission to do local business and pursuant to that permission had acquired property and made.
other expenditures. Their property and the local business were found to be so closely associated with this interstate business done there that the exaction burdened
it. The exaction, although called in some of those cases a
filing fee, was in each case strictly a tax; for it was imposed after the admittance of the corporation into the

State.' In the case at bar the situation is different. In
1930, when the company applied for the permission to do
local business, it had no property whatsoever within the
State. It had never done any local business there. Its
product had been marketed locally in Virginia by two
other foreign corporations which had been duly admitted
to do local business, and whose facilities the company had
used in connection with its interstate business. The company wished to make a change. It wanted to acquire the
property and business of the two corporations which
were marketing its product and thereafter to carry on
the local business itself. In order to do so it sought permission of the State to engage in local business. The
State in no way attempted to impose an additional burden
upon the company or otherwise to change the conditions
under which it was operating. Virginia insisted merely
that if the company wished to change the existing conditions, it should comply with the statute enacted fourteen years before the company began to do business
there.
Affirmed.
The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
5 This is true of Cudahy Packing Co. v. Hinkle, 278 U. S. 460;
Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1; Pullman Co. v.
Kansas, 216 U. S. 56; Ludwig v. Western. Union Tel. Co., 216 U. S.
146; and also of Looney v. Crane Co., 245 U. S. 178, although there
the admission had been under a Texas license, and the act challenged
imposed a greatly increased filing fee applicable to the extension
of the license. The exactions involved in InternationalPaper Co. v.
Massachusetts, 246 U. S. 135; Locomobile Co. v. Massachusetts, 246
U. S. 146; and Air-Way Elec. Appliance Corp. v. Day, 266 U. S. 71,
were annual franchise taxes applicable only after the corporation
had been duly admitted. In Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massachusetts,
246 U. S. 147, and Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, 268
U. S. 203, the foreign corporation was engaged exclusively in interstate business, so that the subject of the exaction was not taxable.
