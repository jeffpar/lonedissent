UNITED STATES v. GARBUTT OIL CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 262. Argued December 9, 1937.-Decided January 3, 1938.
1. An oil operating company made timely claim for refund of an
additional income tax, basing it upon the specific grounds that
proper deduction for amortization had not been made, and that,
in respect of excess profits tax, its invested capital had been
understated. While this claim was pending, it sought to amend
by setting up, as a further ground, that during the tax year it had
received no income taxable, because its entire production of oil
had been distributed in kind to its lessors and to its shareholders.
Held, not a permissible amendment but a new claim untimely filed.

2. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is without power to waive
the bar of the statute of limitations against a claim for 9 taxrefund. P. 533.

brought by the respondent in the District Court for Southern California to recover an alleged overpayment of in-

come taxes for 1919. There is no controversy as to the
facts found by the trial court. The respondent, a California corporation, acquired a lease of oil property October 3, 1907. April 10, 1911, the directors resolved that all
oil produced after January 1 of that year should be transferred in kind to the lessors to the extent of their royalty
interest and to the company's stockholders pro rata to
their respective holdings, so long as the latter should pay
calls for money necessary to defray the company's expenses. The resolution remained in effect to and including the year 1919 and distribution of all oil produced was
made accordingly. In its books of account and its return
for income tax the respondent recorded at market value
the oil produced and treated the difference between that
value and the cost of production as income. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue followed the same method
in computing taxable income. In its 1919 return the respondent disclosed a net income of $16,928.61 and a tax
liability of $2,072.68 which was paid during the year
1920. The Commissioner, as the result of an audit, assessed an additional tax of $3,105.65 which was paid April
3,1925.
March 30, 1929, within the four year period of limitations prescribed by the applicable statute,' the respondent filed a claim for the return of the additional tax so
paid, based upon two grounds: first, that the respondent
was entitled to an additional deduction of $12,500 for the
amortization of the cost of a drilling contract with Union
Oil Company by which the latter, in consideration of
$250,000 par value of respondent's stock, agreed to provide expenses of developing the leased oil property, reimbursement to be made only out of oil produced; and,
second, that, in respect of excess profits tax, its invested
capital had been understated by failure to include the unrecovered cost of the same contract in the sum of $109,375.

Opinion of the Court.

302 U. S.

While this claim was pending, but subsequent to the expiration of the period of limitation, the respondent filed
a "Statement of Garbutt Oil Company... for the purpose
of perfecting and completing claim for refund covering
alleged overpayment of income tax for the calendar year
1919." Therein the respondent asserted that it "now
develops that a further reason exists in support of" the
pending claim since, by distribution of oil in kind, the
respondent realized no taxable income during 1919, and
that "it therefore follows that even though the specific
grounds set forth in the claim for refund are denied said
claim should, nevertheless, be allowed in full," for the
reasons set forth in the statement. Refund was demanded of the entire tax paid for 1919 ($5,178.33) "or
so much thereof as is properly refundable within the
statute of limitations." August 12, 1929, the Commissioner wrote the respondent, concerning the merits of the
original claim and the amendment, stating that a refund
of $3,105.65 would not be allowed but that a hearing could
be had upon the proposed rejection if requested in writing. On October 4, 1929, a conference was held but it
does not appear whether the merits of the amendment
were 'discussed. November 13, 1929, the Commissioner
advised the respondent that the claim would be rejected on
the merits and that the new contention embodied in the
statement filed would be rejected as it was not referred to
in the timely claim and was presented only after the expiration of the period of limitations and after the expiration of the time allowed to perfect informal claims, pursuant to a Treasury decision. Formal rejection of the
claim was made November 21, 1929.
The respondent brought suit for the recovery of the
$3,105.65, it being admitted that the remainder of the
tax paid for the year 1919 could not be recovered because not claimed within the four year period specified
in the statute. At the trial the grounds of the refund

Opinion of the Court.

claim originally filed were abandoned and recovery was
sought upon the basis of the statement filed after the
expiration of the statutory period of limitation. The
court held that the latter did not constitute an amendU
ment of the claim originally filed and came too late
although it also found that the Commissioner had considered the late contention on its merits. Judgment was
entered in favor of the United States. The Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed, holding the statement filed as an
amendment was germane to the original refund claim and
that both were grounded in substantially the same facts.'
We granted certiorari to resolve alleged conflict of
decision.
In view of what has been said in United States v.
Andrews, supra, it is necessary only to 'inquire in the instant case whether the original claim was specific and the
so-called amendment completely shifted to a totally
different ground for refund.
The transactions of the taxpayer which gave rise to its
tax liability were exceedingly simple due to the fact that
it had resorted to distribution of all the oil produced,
partly to its lessors as royalty and partly to its stockholders in return for their advancing the corporate expenses: If it was liable for income tax the method of
calculation it adopted was apparently the correct one.
Claim for refund. was not filed until 1929 when the
statute of limitations had barred refund of all payments
made by the respondent except the amount of the additional assessment paid in 1925. In an effort to recover
that much of the tax paid for the year 1919 the claim set
out two grounds: first, that a deduction of $12,500 should
be allowed for amortization of a drilling contract which
the company had and, second, that its invested capital
should have been increased by more than $100,000 to em
brace the unrecovered cost of this drilling contract. The

claim directed the Commissioner's attention to these two
items only. It gave him no notice that the taxpayer
claimed not to have been in receipt of any income whatever for the taxable year. The documents would not
naturally suggest any such claim for, as in United States
v. Henry Prentiss & Co., 288 U. S. 73, the ground asserted in the later demand was totally inconsistent with
and involved a negation of that specified in the claim for
refund. Before the Commissioner had acted on the claim
for refund the respondent, in an effort to evidence continuity and identity of claim, filed its so-called statement
perfecting and completing the claim for refund. This
abandoned the grounds originally alleged in support of
the claim. The position taken in the amendment was
that the taxpayer had no income whatever and that if the
Commissioner refused refund on the basis of a rejection
of the deductions claimed from gross income in the original demand, he should find that the taxpayer's operations were not productive of any income to it.
In defense of the amendment the respondent says that
it was claiming only the $3,105.65 paid in 1929 pursuant
to the additional assessment; that in no event could it
recover the entire tax paid; that if the original grounds
for claiming refund of payment of the sum in question
had been held valid this would have been sufficient to require the refund of the whole of the sum, and the amended
claim would have no different result. This contention is
advanced to persuade us that, after all, the cause of action

in this case was for the recovery of $3,105.65 as money
had and received to the respondent's use, and that, there-fore there is no departure and no new cause of action
asserted by the amendment. To adopt this view would
be to disregard what was said in earlier cases to the effect
that the analogies of pleading must not be pressed to such
an extent as to disregard the realities of administrative
procedure. The claim as filed called for no investigation

U. S. v. GARBUTT OIL CO.
528

Opinion of the Court.

of the question whether the taxpayer's transactions gave
rise to income. On the contrary, the grounds advanced
assumed the receipt of income. The claim being thus
specific the Commissioner was entitled to take it at face
value and to examine only the points to which it directed
his attention. It would be to disregard the natural course
of procedure in the Bureau to suppose that grounds thus
specifically asserted would direct attention to another at
war with them.
The respondent urges that although the amendment
was not timely, the Commissioner, in considering the
merits of the position taken therein, waived any objection which might have beefi available to him that this
position was not disclosed in the original claim. The contention is bottomed upon the fact that, in his letter of
August 12, 1929, the Commissioner refers to the reasons
advanced in the untimely statement. The argument confuses the power of the Commissioner to disregard a statutory mandate with his undoubted power to waive the requirements of the Treasury regulations. The distinction
was pointed out in United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil
Co., 288 U. S. 62, 71, wherein it was said: "The line of
division must be kept a sharp one between the function
of a statute requiring the presentation of a claim within
a given period of time, and the function of a regulation
making provision as to form. The function of the statute, like that of limitations generally, is to give protection against stale demands. The function of the regulation is to facilitate research." In the cited case, and
others decided at about the same time, we held that, while
the Commissioner might have enforced the regulation and.
rejected a claim for failure to comply with it in omitting
to state with particularity the grounds on which the claim
was based, he was not bound to do so,. but might waive
the requirement of the regulation and consider a general
claim on its merits. This was far from holding that after

the period set by the statute for the filing of claims he had
power to accept and act upon claims that complied with
or violated his regulations. Tucker v. Alexander, 275
U. S. 228, cited by the respondent, is clearly distinguishable. There a timely claim was filed and disallowed. It
alleged two specific grounds for refund. Suit was brought
to recover the alleged overpayment and again reliance
was placed on the same two specific grounds. At the
trial of the action, and within the period of limitations,
the taxpayer abandoned the grounds alleged in its claim
and complaint and asserted a new ground. Counsel for
the Government stated that the new question brought forward was the only one involved in the case and stipulated
as to the amount to be recovered if the trial court should
hold in favor of the taxpayer on this new ground. The
court did so. On appeal the Government, for the first
time, raised the point of the insufficiency of the claim for
refund,, and the Court of Appeals held that the new basis
for the claim did not sustain recovery because reference
had not been made to it in the refund claim. This court
decided that there was an express waiver as to the form
and contents of the claim and that counsel representing
the Government had power, prior to the expiration of the
period of limitation, to waive the objection that the supposed basis for refund was not disclosed in the claim. In
so holding the court adverted to the fact that the Commissioner was not deceived or misled by the deficiency of
the claim *andthat it was in the interest of justice that in
the circumstances the claimant be not remitted to the
resort of filing a new claim and pursuing it through the
Bureau and the courts. The opinion expressly recognized
that no officer of the government has power to waive the
statute of limitations and cited, in support of the proposition, Finn v. United'States, 123 U. S. 227, saying: "Such
waivers, if allowed, 'would defeat the only purpose of the
statute and impose a liability upon the United States

Statement of the Case.

which otherwise would not exist-consequences which do
not attach to the waiver here." 275 U. S. 232.
The statement filed after the period for filing claims
had expired was not a permissible amendment of the
original claim presented. It was a new claim untimely
filed and the Commissioner was without power, under the
statute, to consider it.
The judgment is
Reversed.
