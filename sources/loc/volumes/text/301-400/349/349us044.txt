NATURAL GAS PIPELINE CO. v. PANOMA
CORPORATION ET AL.
NO.

191.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT
OF OKLAHOMA.*

Argued March 28-29, 1955.-Decided April 11, 1955.
A State may not fix a minimum price to be paid for natural gas,
after its production and gathering has ended, by a company which
transports the gas for resale in interstate commerce; because such
sale and transportation are subject to regulation by the Federal
Power Commission exclusively.
271 P. 2d 354 and 272 P. 2d 425, reversed.

Douglas F. Smith argued the cause for appellant in Nos.
191 and 321. Clarence H. Ross argued the cause for

PER CURIAM.

In these cases Oklahoma has attempted to fi:. a minimum price to be paid for natural gas, after its production
and gathering has ended, by a company which transports
the gas for resale in interstate commerce. We held in
Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, 347 U. S. 672, that
*Together with No. 321, Natural Gas Pipeline Co. v. Corporation
Commission of Oklahoma et al., also on appeal fr6m the same court,
argued March 29, 1955. "

NATURAL GAS CO. v. PANOMA CORP.
44

Opinion of the Court.

such a sale and transportation cannot be regulated by a
State but are subject to the exclusive regulation of the
Federal Power Commission. The Phillips case, therefore,
controls this one.
We disagree with the contention of the appellees
that CitiesService Gas Co. v. Peerless Oil and Gas Co., 340
U. S. 179, and Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Oklahoma, 340
U. S. 190, are applicable here. In those cases we were
dealing with constitutional questions and not the construction of the Natural Gas Act. The latter question
was specifically not passed upon in those cases.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, being of opinion that State
regulation of price is permissible until the Federal price
regulation permitted by Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, 347 U. S. 672, is imposed, dissents.
took no part in the consideration
or decision of these cases.
MR.

JUSTICE HARLAN
