Statement of the Case.

305 U. S.

UNITED STATES v. McCLURE,
ADMINISTRATRIX.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 154. Argued December 8, 1938.-Decided January 3, 1939.
1. A veteran allowed his yearly renewable term insurance to lapse
by failing to pay the premium due in February, 1919, when he was
suffering from a compensable disability for which compensation
was not collected. In December, 1929, when he became permanently and totally disabled, there remained compensation due him
sufficient to pay all premiums due on the lapsed policy. Held that
his insurance was revived under § 305 of the World War Veterans'
Act, which provides for revival of lapsed insurance by application to premium of compensation due. P. 473.
This is not inconsistent with § 301, which provides generally
for coinversion of yearly renewable term insurance by July 2,
1927 and declares that "all yearly renewable term insurance shall
cease on July 2, 1927, except when death or total permanent disability shall have occurred before July 2, 1927."
2. Although § 305 of the Act, and § 304 dealing with reinstatement
of yearly renewable term insurance and prohibiting such reinstatement after July 2, 1927, both emanated from a single section in
an earlier Act, they are to be regarded as distinct parts of the later
statute, having been separated by Congress in order to provide
for the individual treatment that has been given reinstatement as
distinguished from revival of lapsed policies. The separation indicates an intended change. P. 477.
3. A proviso is to be read as referring, presumably, to the provision
to which it is attached. P. 478.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
We are called upon to determine whether § 301 or § 305
of the World War Veterans' Act' applies to a lapsed
policy of War Risk yearly renewable term insurance.
Section 301 authorizes conversion of such policies and
provides (with exceptions not applicable here) that "All
yearly renewable term insurance shall cease on July 2,
1927, except when death or total permanent disability
shall have occurred before July 2, 1927: . ..
Section 305 provides that "Where any person has heretofore allowed his insurance to lapse, .. .while suffering from a compensable disability for which compensation was not collected and dies or has died, or becomes
or has become permanently and totally disabled" while
"entitled to compensation remaining uncollected . . .
his insurance . . . shall not be considered as lapsed"; and
the Veterans' Administration shall pay him or his beneficiaries "so much of his insurance as said uncollected
compensation ... would purchase if applied as premiums
when due . . .less the unpaid premiums and interest at
five per centum compounded annually in installments."
John F. McClure, a World War veteran, allowed his
yearly renewable term insurance to lapse by failing to
pay the premium due February, 1919, "while suffering

from a compensable disability for which compensation
was not collected." December 1, 1929, when he became
permanently and totally disabled, there remained uncollected compensation due him sufficient to pay all premiums then due on his lapsed policy. The veteran
brought suit on his policy alleging total and permanent
disability and, at his death, respondent-as administratrix and individually-filed an amended complaint seeking recovery under § 305. The District Court held that
the insurance was not revived under § 305 and entered
judgment for the government. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed,2 believing. § 301 did not limit § 305 and
that respondent was entitled to judgment on the policy,
contrary to the result reached by the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. '
Since this veteran's lapsed policy was "yearly renewable term insurance" and his permanent disability occurred after July 2, 1927, the question is: Did such insurance cease to exist on July 2, 1927 because of the
general sweeping provisions of § 301, or was lapsed yearly
renewable term insurance-such as his-saved by the
special benefits extended under § 305? We find the
answer in the language of the original War Risk Insurance Act and its amendments.
That original Act of October 6, 1917,' provided government insurance without medical examination for persons engaged in war services. Yearly renewable term
insurance was granted with provision for conversion into
other forms of insurance without medical examination
not later than five years after the termination of the war.
August 9, 1921, Congress amended this Act and
added § 408.' Section 408 greatly liberalized the rights

of veterans, both to reinstate and to revive lapsed "yearly
renewable term insurance." First. Veterans suffering
from disability contracted in active war service were permitted to reinstate their policies despite such disability.
Second. Veterans' insurance which had lapsed while the
veterans were suffering from service connected disabilities for which compensation had not been paid-as here,
was revived in the amount which such uncollected compensation-at death or date of total disability-would
purchase. This first provision of § 408 was the original
predecessor of § 304; the second provision-relied upon
to enforce McClure's policy-became § 305.
By the Act of March 4, 1923,' Congress broadened both
beneficial provisions of § 408 and left it as a single section. But in 1924, when Congress revised the War Risk
Insurance Act,' these twin provisions of § 408 were severed and thereafter appeared as two separate and distinct
paragraphs, §§ 304 and 305. Section 304 incorporated
that portion of § 408 which had provided for reinstatement of lapsed term insurance despite physical disability.
Section 305 re~nacted the second provision of § 408 which
had authorized utilization of uncollected compensation
for revival of such lapsed insurance. It is of vital significance that Congress in creating these two new sections
was careful to limit reinstatement of lapsed term insurance by concluding § 304 with the pointed proviso "That
no term insurance shall be reinstated after July 2, 1926."
But Congress placed no such limitation on the right of
revival under § 305, on which this suit is brought.
The action of Congress in restricting the benefits only
under one of the two sections must be considered together
with § 301 of the same 1924 Act which provided that "All
term insurance shall cease on July 2, 1926, except when
death or total permanent disability shall have occurred

before July 2, 1926." Congress in this 1924 Act, clearly
evidenced its purpose to prohibit reinstatement of yearly
renewable term policies under § 304 after July 2, 1926, in
order to make § 304 conform to § 301 which authorized
conversion of such policies prior to that date. Reinstatement under § 304, however, required action by the
veteran. He was required to submit application, to comply with statutory and administrative regulations, and
to pay back premiums. But action by the veteran was
not required to revive a lapsed policy under § 305. His
rights did not depend upon application, proof, compliance
with regulations or payment. Because his policy had
lapsed while the government owed him money for service
connected disability which had become total and permanent, his lapsed policy was automatically revived. To
have required action on his part would have been inconsistent with the manifest purpose of Congress to permit
revival and continuation of insurance solely because
the government had in its possession funds due the
veteran and sufficient to pay for his insurance.
June, 1926,' § 301 was amended extending the date for
conversion of yearly renewable term insurance to July 2,
1927, and the following month the proviso of § 304 was
specifically amended to conform to the June amendment
to § 301, by prohibiting reinstatement of such insurance
after July 2, 1927." Although the right of reinstatement
under § 304 thus was again specifically restricted, Congress in no way indicated any intention to add the same
restriction to the right of revival under § 305 on which the
present suit is based. Instead, the benefits under § 305
were extended by the July amendment so as to permit
beneficiaries to apply uncollected bonuses to the lapsed
policies of deceased veterans. Congress again gave special

attention to § 305 in 1928 10 and authorized the revival of
lapsed policies by utilization of compensation otherwise
uncollectible because barred by limitations. Continuing
the separate consideration and treatment of §§ 304 and
305, Congress in 1930 once more applied the restrictive
proviso to § 304 but not to § 305.11
The deliberate intention of Congress to apply different
restrictions to the right of reinstating lapsed policies under § 304 and that of reviving such policies, under § 305
was also made manifest by other changes in the Act of
July 2, 1926.12 While reinstatement of yearly renewable
term insurance under § 304, but not revival under § 305,
was therein prohibited after July 2, 1927, a new proviso
was added to § 305 under which the "insurance hereafter
revived under this section [305] ... shall be paid only to
the insured, his widow, child or children, dependent
mother or father, . . ." On the other hand, there is no
such limitation as to beneficiaries of policies reinstated
under the provisions of § 304. This studied limitation of
the government's liability on policies revived under § 305,
by restriction of beneficiaries, indicates a distinctive legislative consideration and treatment of that section.
To hold that a lapsed yearly renewable term insurance
policy cannot be revived under § 305 would be to apply
to that section, by construction, the proviso which Congress attached only to § 304. Sections 304 and 305 are
distinct parts of the statute which contains them. While
both sections emanated from a single prior section, Congress evidently separated them to provide for the individual treatment that has been given reinstatement as
distinguished from revival of lapsed policies. A deliberate separation of the two parts of the old section-ap10 45

plying a restriction to one and not the other-indicates
that a change was intended. 3 This is in accord with
the presumption that a proviso "refers only to the provision to which it is attached." 14
In the light of the statutory development of the War
Risk Insurance Act, there is no conflict between the general provisions of § 301 requiring conversion of yearly renewable term insurance by July 2, 1927, and the special
benefits granted by § 305 to that particular group of veterans to whom the government had not paid disability
compensation which was justly their due. The benefits
of the special provisions of § 305 are extended to every
veteran who has "heretofore allowed his insurance to
lapse, . . ."

The meaning of the words of the statute is

apparent and we need not look beyond the language and
statutory development of the War Risk Insurance Act. 15

A lapsed policy, whether yearly renewable term or in
converted form, comes within the provisions of § 305.
Since the veteran in this case was due compensation
for service connected disabilities at the time his policy
lapsed and at the time he became totally and permanently
disabled the amount of his uncollected compensation was
sufficient to pay all premiums then due, his insurance was
revived under § 305. The judgment of the Circuit Court
of Appeals is therefore
Affirmed.
