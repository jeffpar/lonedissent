DAVIDSON v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 18.

Argued October 14, 1938.-Decided November 7, 1938.

The taxpayer directed his brokers to sell certain shares bought by
him in the then current year, and directed his bank, which held
the certificates, to deliver them to the broker. By mistake, the
bank delivered and the broker sold other shares of the same stock
which the bank held for the taxpayer and which he had bought in
an earlier year for a lower price. Held that the taxable gain was
properly computed on the basis of the cost of the shares so actually
sold, rather than the higher cost of the shares which the taxpayer
intended to sell. P. 45.

94 F. 2d 300, affirmed.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Upon petitioner's insistence and respondent's admission, that the decision below conflicts with that of the
circuit court of appeals for the second circuit in Miller v.
Commissioner, 80 F. 2d 219, we granted a writ of certiorari. The question presented is whether petitioner's

taxable gain from sale in 1929 of 1,000 shares of stock
is to be determined upon the basis of the cost of stock
petitioner bought in that year, or upon the basis of lower
cost of like shares earlier bought by him.
The details found by the board of tax appeals may be
given briefly. March 27, 1929, at cost of $49.90 each, petitioner bought 1,000 shares for which he received 10 separately numbered certificates covering 100 shares each and
delivered them to a bank to be held as security for a
loan. Some years earlier he had bought, at cost of $4.42
each, 1,000 shares of like stock for which he obtained
certificates that he delivered to the same bank as collateral security, where they were held until the sales here
involved. June 19, 1929 petitioner instructed his broker
to sell 500 shares of the stock he bought March 27, and,
to enable the broker to deliver, petitioner instructed the
bank to give the broker certificates covering shares bought
in that year. By mistake the bank delivered him certificates of shares included in the lot earlier purchased by
petitioner. July 1, 1929 petitioner instructed the broker
to sell the rest of the lot bought in that year and directed
the bank to deliver the broker certificates of the stock
petitioner intended to have sold. Again failing to follow
instructions, the bank delivered the broker certificates of
stock in the other lot. It may be taken as granted that,
when he made his return, petitioner excusably assumed
that the bank had followed his directions.
He reported gain on the basis of cost of the stock purchased in that year. The commissioner calculated gain
on the basis of cost of the stock earlier purchased and
gave notice of deficiency. The board of tax appeals sustained his determination. 34 B. T. A. 555. The circuit
court of appeals affirmed. 94 F. 2d 300.
Petitioner contends that by his reference to amounts
and dates of purchases, he adequately designated to the

broker the shares to be sold; that in fact the shares so
identified were sold and that the bank's delivery of certificates of other stock to the broker did not affect petitioner's order. Undoubtedly, petitioner sufficiently indicate4 to the broker and to the bank the shares he intended to sell. He plainly allocated the lots to be sold to
the 1,000 shares he bought in 1929. But it does not follow that they were the shares sold. His intention to sell,
even when coupled with his order to the broker and direction to the bank, cannot be held to constitute sale.
Snyder v. Commissioner, 295 U. S. 134, 137. Notwithstanding his order to the broker to sell shares in the 1929
lot, petitioner was free later to direct that shares from the
other lot be used for final consummation of the sale.
And so, when the bank delivered him certificates of stock
not designated in his order to sell, the broker may well
have assumed that petitioner's final purpose was to sell
the shares covered by the certificates that the bank sent
him. He had no reason to suppose that the bank did not
act in accordance with instructions given it by petitioner.
The case is not different from what it would have been
if petitioner himself had delivered to the broker the certificates sent by the bank. Plainly, petitioner's contention that the certificates used to complete the sale did not
cover the shares sold cannot be upheld. Commissioner
v. Rankin, 295 U. S. 123, 128. The commissioner rightly
computed gain on the basis of what was done rather than
on what petitioner intended to do. United States v.
Phellis, 257 U. S. 156, 172; Bonham v. Commissioner,
89 F. 2d 725, 728; Curtis v. Commissioner, 89 F. 2d 736,
738; Remington Rand, Inc. v. Commissioner, 33 F. 2d
77, 78.
Affirmed.
