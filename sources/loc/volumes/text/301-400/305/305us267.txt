M. E. BLATT CO. v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 98. Argued November 15, 16, 1938.-Decided December 5, 1938.
1. Special findings of fact made by the Court of Claims are not
affected by any statement of fact, reasoning, or conclusion that
may be found in its opinion. P. 277.
2. Rent is a fixed sum, or property amounting to a fixed sum. It
does not include payments, uncertain as to amount and time, made
by the lessee for the cost of improvements. P. 277.
3. Improvements made by the lessee, even when required by the
lease, will not be deemed rent unless such intention is plainly disclosed. Id.
4. Improved real property was leased for use a8 a picture theater,
for ten years beginning upon completion of improvements made
and paid for partly by the lessor and partly by the lessee. The
lease provided that ipnprovements made by the lessee should become the property of the lessor, on expiration or earlier termination
of the leasehold. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue estimated
the depreciated values, at the end of ten years, of the lessee's improvements, omitting some which could then have no value, and
added one-tenth of the total estimate to the lessor's income for the
tax year next following the commencement of the lease. Held
erroneous.
(1) The question presented is whether, under this particular
lease, one-tenth of this "estimated depreciated value," at the end
of the term, was income of the lessor in the first year of the term.
There is nothing in the findings to suggest that cost of any improvement made by lessee was rent or an expenditure not properly
to be attributed to its capital or maintenance account as distinguished from operating expense.
They disclose no basis of value
on which to lay an income tax or the time of realization of taxable

gain, if any there was. The figures made by the Commissioner are
not defined. The findings do not show whether they are intended
to represent value of improvements if removed or the amount
attributable to them as a part of the building. The figures themselves repel the suggestion that they were intended to represent
amounts obtainable for the item- if removed; it is not to be assumed
that they were intended s valuations of salvage at the end of
the term; and it does not appear that the improvements, if detached, would then have any value, even as junk, over necessary
cost of removal. Equally conjectural would be assumption that
the figures represent enhancement of value of the leased premises
by reason of the improvements when new, or as deteriorated at the
end of the term. Present or future value of the premises, however
ascertained, is single in substance; it can not be arrived at by mere
summation of actual or estimated cost of constituent elements, new
or depreciated. Pp. 276, et seq.
(2) Granting that the improvements increased the value of the
building, the enhancement was not realized income of lessor; it was
addition to capital, not income within the meaning of the Revenue
Act of 1932, ยง 22 (a). P. 279.
(3) Assuming that at sometime value of the improvements
would
be income of lessor, it can not be reasonably absigned to the year
in which they were installed. P. 280.

Mr. Lawrence Cake for petitioner.
When improvements are made by a lessee, as in this
case, there is no realization of gain by the lessor at the
time when the improvements are completed.
The tenant agreed to paint and decorate (provided the
landlord would pay $1500 of the cost) and to install the
latest type of moving picture and talking apparatus,
theatre seats, and all other fixtures, furniture, and equipment necessary for the successful operation of a modern
up-to-date theatre. That was all. The tenant was not
required to spend any certain amount. The amount was

left entirely to his discretion and self-interest. He had
a lease for ten years and presumably would spend as
much on improvements as would fit the premises for his
purpose, but he was not required to spend any amount
whatever for the benefit of the lessor. So far as the lease
went, his expenditures might well be limited to improvements which would have a life not exceeding the term
of the lease. If he spent more and the improvements he
made were of such character as would carry over some
residual value beyond the term of the lease, any such
excess value would be a gift to the lessor. At all events
it was not required by the terms of the lease.
The common definition of rent or rental is an agreed
fixed payment for the use of property. It need not necessarily be payable in money but it must be agreed upon
and it must be fixed in amount or quantity. Duffy v.
Central Railroad Co., 268 U. S. 55, 63.
It is the fundamental rule of income taxation, laid
down in Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, that to constitute taxable gain or income there must be a realization,
either by severance from the source or by conversion of
both source and gain into a different form, and that unrealized appreciation in value is not taxable as income.
United States v. Safety Car Heating & L. Co., 297 U. S.
88, 99. Compare also Koshland v. Helvering, 298 U. S.
441; North American Oil Consolidatedv. Burnet, 286 U. S.
417; MacLaughlin v. Alliance Insurance Co., 286 U. S.
244; Burnet v. Logan, 283 U. S. 404.
Here the petitioner is the owner of property which it
has leased to another for ten years. The lessee of the
property has added improvements which the Commissioner has found will have a residual value of $17,423.14
at the end of the term of the lease. The value of petitioner's property, therefore, has been increased and a
part of that increased value will presumably still be in
the property when it reverts to petitioner upon the ter-

mination of the lease. Has petitioner realized any immediate gain by virtue of all this? Certainly there has
been nothing "severed" from the property (petitioner's
capital) or "received or drawn" by petitioner for its
"separate use, benefit and disposal." There has been no
gain or profit in the sense of "something of exchangeable
value proceeding from the property." Petitioner has no
control over the property, or the improvements, so long
as the lease runs. Even when the lease ends, petitioner
will have only the possession of real estate bearing improvements which fit it for use as a theatre.
The court below suggests, however, that petitioner has
at all times a right to sell the property subject to the lease,
and so immediately realize the cash value of the improvements to the extent that they will have value beyond the
term of the lease. This does not aid the court's conclusion. On the contrary, it supports petitioner's argument
that there was no realization of gain at the time the improvements were added, and that the realization of gain,
if any,-and the taxation thereof as income-can only
take place upon the sale or other disposition of the property. Hewitt Realty Co. v. Commissioner, 76 F. 2d 880.
The decision of the court below ignores the practical
difficulties and realities of the situation.
It seems fairly obvious that the regulations in question
which tax as income to the lessor, either immediately or
by spreading it over the term of the lease, the "estimated
depreciated value" at the end of the lease of any improvements made by the lessee, are bound to be uncertain and
difficult of application in particular cases. See Morphy
v. Commissioner, 35 B. T. A. 289, minority opinion; Hart
v. Commissioner, 37 B. T. A. 360; Paul & Mertens, Law
of Federal Income Taxation, Vol. 1, ยง 10.12, 1937 Supplement.
If the "income" which the Government has charged to
petitioner here, not only for the taxable year actually

M. E. BLATT CO. v. U. S.

involved in this case but likewise for every year of the
lease in question, is in fact and in law income to petitioner
as the Government contends, it becomes a problem to
determine how it can be distributed so as to avoid the
tax on undistributed profits.
When improvements are made by a lessee, as in this
case, the accession of value to the property is not income
but a capital addition. Edwards v. Cuba Railroad Co.,
268 U. S. 628. See Taft v. Bowers, 278 U. S. 470.
Mr. J. Louis Monarch, with whom Solicitor General
Jackson and Assistant Attorney General Morris were on
the brief, for the United States.
(a) The view that the income is realized upon completion of the improvement.-The legal significance of
adding improvertents to the lessor's property is precisely
equivalent to the payment of advance rentals, and therefore the income is realized when the improvements are
complete. The lessor is undoubtedly the owner as soon
as the improvements are made, and if title be the test he
has then derived income. The cash rentals are allocable
in part to the improvements, so that the lessor has the
immediate use of the improvement to that extent, just
as he has the use and benefit of the rest of the property.
The only reason why he is not entirely free to use the
property is that he has agreed in advance with the lessee
to permit the latter the exclusive use. This circumstance is analogous to the assigned income cases and
should not prevent the tax. Moreover, the concept of
income does not necessarily require that the respondent
have the unrestricted right to enjoy it. Burnet v. Harmel,
287 U. S. 103; Poe v. Seaborn, 282 U. S. 101; Miller v.
Gearin, 258 F. 225; 250 U. S. 667; Cryan v. Wardell, 263
F. 248.
The Treasury Regulations then in effect provided that
the depreciated value of improvements erected by a lessee

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Argument for Respondent.

305 U. S.

constituted taxable income to the lessor upon the termination of the lease. Art. 4, par. 50, Reg. 33 (Rev. ed.);
Art. 48, Reg. 45. But the cited cases overruled the existing regulations, whereupon the Treasury made changes
to conform to the decisions. T. D. 3062, 3 Cumulative
Bulletin 109; Mim. 2714, 4 Cumulative Bulletin 90; Art.
48, Regulations 45 (1920 ed.). The Regulations under
the later Acts have consistently regarded the income as
realized upon the completion of the improvements. The
Regu' tions under the 1921 and subsequent Acts have
permitted the gain to be spread over the life of the lease.
Art. 48, Regulations 62, 65 and 69; Art. 63, Regulations
74 and 77; Art. 22 (a)-13, Regulations 86 and 94.
Against this view it may be urged that the lessor has
not "derived" the income because he is not free to use it.
But the lessor derives rent from the improvements and,
to that extent at least, it would appear that he does use
the improved property. His full right of use is tied up
and restricted during the term of the lease by the agreement of the parties made in advance of the improvements.
In other situations it has been held that such an assignment does not avoid the tax. Lucas v. Earl, 281 U. S.
111; Lonsdale v. Commissioner, 32 F. 2d 537; 280 U. S.
575. Cf. Burnet v. Wells, 289 U. S. 670; Poe v. Seaborn,
282 U. S. 101; Cleveland Ry. Co. v. Lucas, 36 F. 2d 347;
281 U. S. 743; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner,
279 U. S. 716; United States v. Hendler, 303 U. S. 564;
and see United States v. Boston & M. R. Co., 279 U. S.
732.
(b) The view that the income is realized upon the termination of the lease.-If the restrictions upon enjoyment prevent the income from being treated as derived
when the improvements are made, it should follow that
the income is received when the restrictions are removed.
The principle is well recognized that the release of a liability is the equivalent of receipt, and where income is

M. E. BLATT CO. v. U. S.
267

Argument for Respondent.

physically received at a time when there is some restriction upon its use, the timne of receipt is deemed to be
postponed until the restriction is removed. If that
theory is applicable, the income is derived at the expiration or earlier termination of the lease. Helvering v.
Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376; United States
v. Kirby Lumber Co., 284 U. S. 1; Helvering v. American
Chicle Co., 291 U. S. 426; Maryland Casualty Co. v.
United States, 251 U. S. 342; North American Oil v.
Burnet, 286 U. S. 417, 424; cf. Heivering v. Tex-Penn
Co., 300 U. S. 481.
(c) The view that the income is realized upon disposition of the improved property.-The theory that the
income is realized upon the disposition of the property is
based upon the view that the increased value which
resulted from the improvements is merely appreciation
of some character, like an increase resulting from fluctuating conditions. However, there is little similarity between general conditions causing day-to-day fluctuations
and a permanent improvement to the particular realty.
Furthermore, this theory is based upon the misconception that there must be an actual physical separation of
income from capital. We think the cases show that the
concept of income is satisfied where the taxpayer's investment produces new property which, in some form,
is made available to him. The simplicity of the theory
has appealed to some courts, but if the income is lost
as a result of unrelated events occurring between the time
of its receipt and the disposition of the property, this
theory would permit it to escape taxation altogether.
In no other situation is a taxpayer excused from accounting for income because of its subsequent loss. Hewitt
Realty Co. v. Commissioner, 76 F. 2d 880; Marr v. United
States, 268 U. S. 536, 540; Helvering v. Midland Ins. Co.,

Opinion of the Court.

The case is squarely within the Regulations, and the
validity of the tax depends upon the acceptance of the
theory which underlies the Regulations.
MR.JUSTICE BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner paid, and in this suit seeks to recover, af
amount included in a deficiency assessment made by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue as additional income
tax for the year ending January 31, 1932. The question is
whether petitioner is liable under Revenue Act of 1932,
ยง 22 (a). 1
The material substance of the findings follows.
For itself and a subsidiary corporation, petitioner made
consolidated return. The commissioner added to the income of the subsidiary on account of improvements made
to its property by a lessee. He ruled the improvements
were income to lessor in that year to the extent of their
value at termination of the lease.
Lessor purchased the real estate in 1927, and September
13, 1930, leased it for use as a moving picture theater
for a term of ten years, beginning upon completion of
improvements to be made. At its own cost and expense,
lessor agreed to make alterations in accordance with plans
and specifications prepared by an architect selected by the
parties. Lessee agreed to install the latest type of moving picture and talking apparatus, theater seats and all
other fixtures, furniture and equipment necessary for the
'"Gross income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from
salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service, of whatever kind
and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades,
businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or
personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such
property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits
and income derived from any source whatever. .. ." 47 Stat. 178.
The regulation applied by the commissioner (Reg. 77, Art. 63) has
since been changed. See Reg. 94 and 86, Art. 22 (a)-13.

successful operation of a modern theater to become the
property of lessor at the expiration or sooner termination
of the lease.
Lessor made a contract with the builder to make the
contemplated improvements and agreed to pay, up to a
specified limit, actual cost, plus builder's profit and architect's fee. Additional work ordered by lessee was to be
paid for by it. Lessee consented to the terms of the contract and agreed to pay for work and materials ordered
by it. All improvements were completed in January
1931; lessee took possession of the property February 1
of that year.
The total cost of all improvements was $114,468.77;
lessor paid $73,794.47; lessee paid the balance, $40,674.30.
"The estimated depreciated value at the termination of
the lease of the alterations and improvements paid for
by the lessee was computed by the Commissioner and was
agreed to by the plaintiff [petitioner], as follows:

Cost

[1] Ventilating system .........
[2] Glazing, architect's fee and
other items ..............

preciated. The resulting additional tax was $211.61. Petitioner paid it; the commissioner disallowed claim for
refund. The lower court held petitioner not entitled to
recover; it sustained the tax on the ground that, immediately upon completion of the improvements made by
lessee, they became the property of lessor, and constituted
compensation paid by lessee as additional rental for the
use of the leased premises.
Petitioner insists that where improvements are made
by lessee, there is no realization of gain at the time
the improvements are completed; that the accession of
value to the property is not income but a capital addition.
The United States says that, while the case presents the
question whether depreciated value of improvements by
lessee constitutes income to lessor in the taxable year,
the "basic question is whether income is ever realized by
the lessor in such cases, and if so, when." Assuming that
improvements made by lessee and which will outlast the
term constitute income to lessor at some time, its brief
discusses the questions whether the income is realized
upon (1) completion of the improvements, (2) termination of the lease, or (3) disposition of the improved
property. It concludes that the "soundest theory -seems
to be that such income is taxable at the time the improvements are erected." And, without supporting the lower
court's ruling that the estimated depreciated value at the
end of the ten-year term constituted additional rent or
compensation paid for the use of the premises, it asks
that the judgment be upheld.
We are not called on to decide whether under any lease
or in any circumstances, income is received by lessor by
reason of improvements made by lessee, nor to choose,
for general approval or condemnation, any of the theories
expounded by the United States. Concretely, the ques-

M. E. BLATT CO. v. U. S.
267

Opinion of the Court.

tion presented is whether, under the lease here involved,
one-tenth of what the commissioner and taxpayer call
and agree to be "estimated depreciated value," as of the
end of the term, was income to petitioner in the first year
of the term. And that question is to be decided upon
the lower court's special findings unaffected by any statement of fact, reasoning, or conclusion that may be found
in its opinion.'
There is nothing in the findings to suggest that cost of
any improvement made by lessee was rent or an expenditure not properly to be attributed to its capital or maintenance account as distinguished from operating expense.
While the lease required it to make improvements necessary for successful operation, no item was specified, nor
the time or amount of any expenditure. The requirement
was one making for success of the business to be done
on the leased premises. It well may have been deemed
by lessor essential or appropriate to secure payment of
the rent stipulated in the lease. Even when required,
improvements by lessee will not be deemed rent unless intention that they shall be is plainly disclosed. Rent is "a
fixed sum, or property amounting to a fixed sum, to be
paid at stated times for the use of property ...;...it
does not include payments, uncertain both as to amount
and time, made for the cost of improvements

lower court's holding to the effect that the making of improvements by lessee was payment of rent.
It remains to be considered whether the amount in question represented taxable income, other than rent, in the
first year of the term.
The findings fail to disclose any basis of value on which
to lay an income tax or the time of realization of taxable
gain, if any there was. The figures made by the commissioner are not defined. The findings do not show whether
they are intended to represent value of improvements if
removed or the amount attributable to them as a part
of the building.
The figures themselves repel the suggestion that they
were intended to represent amounts obtainable for the
items if removed. We are not required to assume that
the commissioner intended his estimates to represent salvage, at the end of the term, of ventilating system, glazing, architect's fees and the like, draperies, chairs, electric
signs, and marquee, the useful lives of which in place have
declined from 30 to 66% per cent. It does not appear
that if detached from the building they would then have
any value, even as junk, over necessary cost of removal.
It is clear that, if any value as of that time may be attributed to them, it is included in and not separable from
that of the leased premises.
Equally conjectural would be assumption that the figures represent enhancement of value of the leased premises by reason of the improvements when new or as deteriorated at the end of the term. The leased property
is capable of inventory and analysis for the purpose of
ascertaining original and estimated present costs of its
elements and other relevant facts as indications of worth
to be taken into account in determining its value; i. e.,
the money equivalent of the property as a whole.' But

Opinion of the Court.

305 U. S.

But, assuming that at some time value of the improvements would be income of lessor, it cannot be reasonably
assigned to the year in which they were installed. The
commissioner found that at the end of the term some
would be worthless and excluded them. He also excluded
depreciation of other items. These exclusions imply that
elements which will not outlast lessee's right to use are
not at any time income of lessor. The inclusion of the
remaining value is to hold that petitioner's right to have
them as a part of the building at expiration of lease constitutes income in the first year of the term in an amount
equal to their estimated value at the end of the term
without any deduction to obtain present worth as of date
of installation. It may be assumed that, subject to the
lease, lessor became owner of the improvements at the
time-they were made. But it had no right to use or dispose of them during the term. Mere acquisition of that
sort did not amount to contemporaneous realization of
gain within the meaning of the statute.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE.

I acquiesce in that part of the Court's opinion which
construes the findings below as failing to establish that
the lessee's improvements resulted in an increase in market value of the lessor's land in the taxable year. As it
is unnecessary to decide whether such increase, if established, would constitute taxable income of the lessor, I
do not join in so much of the opinion as, upon an assumption contrary to the findings, undertakes to discuss that
question.
