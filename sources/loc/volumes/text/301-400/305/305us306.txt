INTER-ISLAND STEAM NAVIGATION CO. v.
TERRITORY OF HAWAII.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 94. Argued November 18, 1938.-Decided December 5, 1938.
1. The conclusion of the Supreme Court of Hawaii that a common
carrier of freight and passengers by water between different points
in the Territory was a public utility within the meaning of the
Hawaii Utilities Act of 1913, is accepted by this Court on review.
P. 311.
2. Enactment by Congress of the Shipping Act of 1916 did not oust
the Public Utilities Commission of Hawaii of all jurisdiction whatsoever over common carriers by water between ports of the Territory, and did not abrogate the Commission's power to exact fees
from such carriers to defray the expense of investigatory services
which it still had authority to perform. Pp. 311, 313.
3. An Act of Congress will not be deemed to supersede a territorial
law unless that intention is clear. P. 312.
4. The imposition of a tax upon a common carrier by water between
ports of the Territory of Hawaii (assumed to be engaged in interstate or foreign commerce), under an Act of the Territory to which
Congress had expressly subjected such carrier, does not violate the
commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. P. 313.
0. Congress has plenary legislative authority over the people and
government of the territories. P. 314.
6. The general tax imposed on public utilities by the Hawaii Utilities
Act of 1913, designed to effectuate a plan for control and supervision of the utilities of the Territory, is not void under the Fifth
Amendment as applied to a particular utility which may not have
directly benefited from the investigatory and supervisory services
performed by the Commission under the Act. P. 314.
96 F. 2d 412, affirmed.

CERTIORARI, post, p. 580, to review the affirmance of a

judgment for the Territory of Hawaii in a suit against
the Navigation Company to collect taxes.

sion of petitioner's business, and has incurred no expense
on its account. Under these circumstances the inspection fees amounting to more than $4000 per annum levied
against petitioner's business indisciriminately (local, interstate, and foreign) are void as a direct burden on interstate and foreign commerce and deny to petitioner due
process of law.
Where inspection fees are assessed against a number
of unrelated public utilities and are deposited in a common fund to be used by the Commission for the regulation and inspection of utilities generally, the burden is
upon the Commission to prove that the fees demanded
are no more than necessary to defray the expense of regulation or inspection. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Washington, 300 U. S. 154.
Under the proper construction of the Shipping Act of
1916, and the Utility Act, the Commission has no jurisdiction over the petitioner and can not collect the fees
demanded.
Mr. Julius Russell Cades, with whom Mr. Urban Earl
Wild was on the brief, for respondent.
The power of Congress under the Constitution to
amend and extend the provisions of Act 135, S. L. Haw.
1913, and to ratify and confirm the applicability of the
Public Utility Act of 1913, is indubitable. France v.
Connor, 161 U. S. 65, 72; Mormon Church v. United
States, 136 U. S. 1; National Bank v. Yankton County,
101 U. S. 129.
The statements made in Congress at the time of the
amendment and ratification of the territorial statute, show
beyond dispute that Congress intended the Utilities Act
of 1913 to apply to all utilities operating within the Territory.
The exaction of territorial utility fees approved by
Congress can not impose a burden on interstate and foreign commerce.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

305 U. S.

The enactment by Congress of the Shipping Act of
1916, did not divest the local commission of its powers
of investigation or its duty to collect the fees provided
to permit such investigation.
The Shipping Act should be interpreted and applied
in analogy to the Interstate Commerce Act.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner, a Hawaiian corporation, is a common carrier of freight and passengers by water between different
points in the Territory. A substantial part of its gross
income is derived from transporting freight destined for
trans-shipment to foreign or mainland ports. In 1913 a
statute of the Territory created a Public Utilities Commission, prescribed its duties and levied a uniform semiannual tax--denominated a fee '-upon all public utilities
doing business in the Territory, partially to defray the
Commission's expenses. Petitioner paid the tax until
1923, when it refused to make further payments, contending the tax could not validly be applied to it. In this suit,
the Territory recovered judgment in the territorial court
for the taxes assessed for the years 1923 to 1930, inclusive.
The Supreme Court of Hawaii and the Circuit Court of
Appeals both affirmed.
The Hawaiian "Utilities Act of 1913," ' under which the
challenged taxes have been levied, invested the territorial
Commission with broad powers to investigate all public
utilities doing business in the Territory, with reference to
the safety and accommodation of the public; safety, working hours and wages of employees; rates and fares; valuation; issuance of securities; amount and disposition of

income; business relations with others; compliance with
territorial and federal laws and provisions of franchises,
charters, and articles of association; regulations, practices
and service; accidents, in connection with utility operations, believed by the Commission to require investigation
and "all matters of every nature affecting the relations
and transactions between . . . [such utilities] and the
public, or persons, or corporations."
This territorial Commission was empowered to make its
investigations "notwithstanding that the same may be
within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, or within the jurisdiction of any court or other
body, and when after such examination the [territorial]
commission shall be of the opinion that the circumstances
warrant, it shall be its duty to effect the necessary relief
or remedy by the institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings or otherwise before the Interstate Commerce Commission, or such court, or other body, in its
own name or the name of the Territory, . . ."
The taxes in question accrued under ยง 17 of the Act of
1913, providing that "There shall . . . be paid to the
commission in each of the months of March and September in each year by each public utility which is subject
to investigation by the commission a fee which will be
equal to one-twentieth of one per centum of the gross
income from the public utility business carried on by such
public utility in the Territory during the preceding year,
plus one-fiftieth of one per centum of the par value of
the stock issued by such public utility and outstanding on
December 31 of the preceding year, . . ." After collection, the taxes "shall be deposited in the treasury of the
Territory to the credit of a special fund to be called the
'Public Utilities Commission Fund' " to be used-with
any appropriations made available by the territorial legislature-to pay necessary expenses of the Commission in
the performance of its duties under the Act.

305 U. S.

The Organic Act granting legislative power to the territorial government of Hawaii provides that "the legislature shall not grant to any corporation, association,
or individual any special or exclusive privilege, immunity,
or franchise without the approval of Congress; . . ."I
Pursuant to the Organic Act, and prior to the effective
date of the Utilities Act of 1913, the territorial legislature
passed Act 135 S. L. Haw. 1913-to take effect upon the
approval by Congress--providing that all public utilities
previously granted franchises should "be subject as to
reasonableness of rates, prices, and charges and in all
other respects to the provisions of . . . [the Utilities
Act of 1913] and all amendments thereof for the regulation of public utilities in said Territory; . . . " March
28, 1916,' Congress expressly ratified, approved and confirmed this Hawaiian Act 135.
Act 135 as enacted by the Territory applied only to
Hawaiian utilities specially described in the Act. However, Congress in ratifying and approving, broadened the
Act by amendment so as to include not only the described utilities but "all public utilities and public-utilities
companies organized or operating within the Territory
of Hawaii." By further amendment Congress provided
that nothing in Act 135 should "limit the jurisdiction
or powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission" and
that all actions of the Hawaiian Public Utility Commission should "be subject to review by the courts of the . . .
Territory."
September 7, 1916, Congress enacted the "Shipping
Act of 1916." ' For the purposes of the Shipping Act,
"The term 'common carrier by water in interstate commerce'" was given a statutory definition to include

"a common carrier

property . . . on regular routes from port to port between . . ." places in the same "Territory, District or
possession." This Act created the United States Shipping
Board, with broad powers to investigate and supervise
carriers by water in foreign and interstate commerce as
defined therein.
We accept the conclusion of the Supreme Court of
Hawaii that petitioner is a public utility as defined by
the Hawaiian Act.' However, petitioner contends that
the Territory cannot validly apply this tax to it. We
have examined all of the grounds upon which this contention rests. None is sufficient to remove petitioner
from the operation of the Utilities Act of 1913 as applied
here.
First. Petitioner contends that the passage of the
Shipping Act by Congress completely ousted the territorial Commission of all jurisdiction over it in any respect,
or for any purpose, and thus withdrew the Commission's
power to collect the fees in question.
The Supreme Court of Hawaii held in this case, as heretofore,8 that the Shipping Act did deprive the territorial
Commission of authority, under the Act of 1913, to regulate by its own order the rates of this petitioner. In the
present case, however, that court concluded that the Shipping Act did not withdraw the territorial Commission's
power to investigate water carriers-such as petitioneras to rates and other matters, either for the exercise of
its own permitted supervisory powers or for presentation
of the public's case before appropriate governmental
bodies.' The territorial Act of 1913-to which Congress

in 1916 subjected all utilities doing business in Hawaiigave the territorial Commission jurisdiction over many
matters other than rate regulation. In general, the Commission was empowered to supervise and regulate local
properties and activities of utilities and to protect the
public interest in relation to rates, operations, and many
other phases of the utility business. While, in some instances, the Commission was powerless to enter any final
order, nevertheless its authority to investigate and to appear before appropriate governmental agencies was designed as a part of a general plan to safeguard the public
interest. The Shipping Act invested the Shipping Board
with authority over some of these matters. But no language in that Act indicates that Congress intended to
withdraw all of the territorial Commission's jurisdiction
over territorial water carriers. While Congress had complete power to repeal the entire territorial Public Utilities Act, "an intention to supersede the local law [of a
Territory] is not to be presumed, unless clearly expressed." 10 Petitioner owns, controls, operates and manMoses Dig. of Stats. of Ark. 1921, ยง 1630; Struckmeyer, Revised

ages numerous steam vessels, wharfs, docks and real and
personal property useful in the transportation of passengers and freight between the various ports and islands of
Hawaii. Petitioner's gross income between the years 1922
and 1929 from business transacted in the Territory
amounted to approximately $18,000,000. This Territory
is located far from the mainland of the United States.
Only clear and explicit statutory language could justify
a holding that Congress intended by the Shipping Act to
deprive the territorial government of all jurisdiction over
activities such as petitioner's, vitally affecting the trade,
commerce, safety and welfare of the people of the Territory.
We agree with the Supreme Court of Hawaii that the
Shipping Act of 1916 did not wholly supersede the territorial Act of 1913 as applied to water carriers like petitioner, and did not take from the territorial Commission
its power to investigate such utilities. A valid legislative
power necessarily includes the right to provide funds to
be expended in its exercise.
Second. Petitioners contend, however, that the taxes
involved constitute a burden on interstate and foreign
commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the
Federal Constitution. But here, Congress, by its Act of
1916, subjected petitioner to the territorial law under
which these very taxes were levied.
Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to
regulate interstate commerce." Therefore, assumingbut not deciding-that petitioner is engaged in interstate
and foreign commerce, Congress has exercised its power
in the present case by permitting the Territory to act

upon this commerce by the imposition of the contested
taxes. The imposition of these taxes under an Act to
which Congress expressly subjected petitioner does not
violate the Commerce Clause.
Congress had the power to subject petitioner to this
tax by virtue of its authority over the Territory, in addition to its power under'the Commerce Clause. "Congress
may not only abrogate laws of the territorial legislatures,
but it may itself legislate directly for the local government. It may make a void act of the territorial legislature
valid, and a valid act void. In other words, it has full and
complete legislative authority over the people of the Territories and all the departments of the territorial governments." "
Third. Petitioner contends that the challenged tax is
prohibited by the Fifth Amendment because "no investigation, supervision, or regulation of petitioner was in fact
made by the Commission."
A general tax designed to effectuate a plan for control and supervision of public utilities need not be apportioned among the taxpayers according to the actual services performed directly for each. Such a requirement
would seriously impair the effective application and operation of general tax systems. Services performed by the
Hawaiian Public Utilities Commission were for the benefit of the public as a whole and are not any the less services beneficial to petitioner because its business has not
been given any special assistance.'- "A tax is not an
assessment of benefits." '4
