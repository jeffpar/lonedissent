UNITED STATES v. PLEASANTS.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 169. Argued December 5, 1938.-Decided January 3, 1939.
1. Under the Revenue Act of 1932, which allows deduction from
gross income of charitable contributions not to exceed 15% of
"net income" as ascertained without such deduction, § 23 (n),
the net income intended is that upon which normal tax and surtax are levied, undiminished by the amount of a capital net loss
121/2% of which is allowed as an off-set in computing the total
tax, under the special provision of § 101 (b). Helvering v. Bliss,
293 U. S. 144, explained. P. 358.
2. Exemptions from taxation of income devoted to charity are not
narrowly construed. P. 363.
3. Administrative construction of a statute, to be persuasive, should
be consistent. Id.
86 Ct. Cls. 679; 22 F. Supp. 964, affirmed.

the Revenue Act of 1932 is to be calculated on the taxpayer's net income computed without regard to a capital net loss as to which special provision is made by
§ 101 (b).
Section 23 (n) provides that in computing net income
there shall be allowed as a deduction from gross income"In the case of an individual, contributions or gifts
made within the taxable year to or for the use of: . . .
to an amount which in all the above cases combined does
not exceed 15 per centum of the taxpayer's net income
as computed without the benefit of this subsection."
47 Stat. 181-182.
Respondent in 1932 made charitable contributions to
the amount of $3496. His net income, irrespective of a
capital net loss, was determined by the Commissioner to
be $94,963.52. Upon that net income the Commissioner
assessed the normal tax and surtax at the rates prescribed
by §§ 11 and 12.1 Respondent contended that this was his
net income as described in § 23 (n) and that as his charitable contributions, were less than 15 per centum of that
amount they were deductible in full in determining his
normal tax and surtax. The Commissioner refused to
allow the deduction.
The taxpayer had sustained a "capital net loss," as
defined in § 101(c)(6), of $154,921.98. The Commissioner ruled that "Since the capital loss of $154,921.98 is
in excess of adjusted ordinary net income of $94,963.52
'These sections provide:
"See. 11. Normal Tax on Individuals."There shall be levied, collected, and paid for each taxable year
upon the net income of every individual a normal tax equal to the
sum of the following: . . .
"Sec. 12. Surtax on Individuals."(a) Rates of Surtax.-There shall be levied, collected, and paid
for each taxable year upon the net income of every individual a
surtax as follows: . . ." 47 Stat. 174.

(without contributions) there is no net income against
which to make a deduction for contributions."
Having paid the tax assessed by the Commissioner
upon that theory, respondent filed his claim for a refund
and on its rejection brought this suit in the Court of
Claims. Judgment was rendered in his favor. 22 F.

"Capital net gains" and "capital net losses" of individual taxpayers are .the subject of special treatment under
§ 101. In the case of a "capital net gain," there is to be
levied, at the election of the taxpayer, and in lieu of all
other taxes imposed by the income tax title, a tax of 121/,
per centum of the capital net gain, to be added to the
tax computed upon the basis of the "ordinary net income." § 101(a). In the case of a "capital net loss,"
§ 101(b) provides for a tax to be determined, also in
lieu of other income taxes but irrespective of any election
by the taxpayer, as follows:
"a partial tax shall first be computed upon the basis
of the ordinary net income at the rates and in the manner as if this section had not been enacted, and the total
tax shall be this amount minus 12 per centum of the
capital net loss; but in no case shall the tax of a taxpayer who has sustained a capital net loss be less than the
tax computed without regard to the provisions of this
section."
Section 101 (c) (6) defines "capital net loss" as "the excess of the sum of the capital losses plus the capital
deductions over the total amount of capital gain."

Section 101(c)(7) defines "ordinary net income" as "the
net income, computed in accordance with the provisions
of this title, after excluding all items of capital gain, capital loss, and capital deductions."
There is no doubt as to the purpose of this provision as
to capital net losses, which was first introduced in the
Revenue Act of 1924.1 Prior to that time, and under the
Revenue Act of 1921, capital losses were to be deducted
from capital gains in the process of determining the
"capital net gain."' If capital deductions and capital
losses were in excess of the capital gain, or if there were
capital losses in the absence of capital gain, such losses
were deductible as ordinary losses. We are told that the
4Dpportunity to minimize taxes by the practice of taking
capital losses to offset ordinary net income constituted a
particularly serious problem after the Act of 1921, which
reduced the rate of tax on capital net gains. The results
to the Treasury of that method of treating capital losses
led to the adoption in the Act of 1924 of the plan for
subjecting capital net losses to a limited rate in order to
protect the revenues,' a plan which was continued in the
Revenue Acts of 1926, 1928, and 1932.'
It will be observed that the provision for the limitation
with respect to a capital net loss under § 101 (b) (unlike
the provision in § 101 (a) as to a capital net gain) gives
no option to the taxpayer." The limitation is explicit
and must be followed as written. The limitation applies
equally when there is no capital gain and hence nothing
to be deducted from capital losses on that score.' The

Opinion of the Court.

limitation is applicable unless, as stated in the last clause
of § 101 (b), a greater tax would result from not applying it.' In the instant case there is no question that the
limitation does apply and the Commissioner has
applied it.
In such a case the statute directs that a partial tax shall
be first computed upon the basis of the "ordinary net
income" and at the rates and in the manner provided in
§§ 11 and 12.10 The total tax is then arrived at by deducting 121 per centum of the capital net loss. That
loss thus figures in the computation of the total tax only
by the allowance of an offset to the specified extent
against the tax determined apart from the capital losses.
Thus, where the limitation is applicable and the offset of
12 per centum of the capital net loss is allowed accordingly, capital losses are not deductible in determining the
taxpayer's net income for the purpose of the normal tax
and surtax. And, as in such case there is no capital
gain, the "ordinary net income" under § 101 (b), that is,
the net income computed after excluding capital loss and
capital deductions, is the only net income upon which a
tax is laid.
We have noted that the limitation of § 101 (b) is not applicable if the tax, computed without regard to that section, would be greater. The latter method of computation
brings out the distinction clearly. For in that method
the capital net loss is deducted from the ordinary net
income in order to arrive at the total net income for the
purpose of applying the normal tax and surtax rates.
See illustration in Regulations 77, Article 503. But where
the limitation of § 101(b) governs, because the tax as
otherwise computed would not be greater, capital losses
are not deducted in determining the net income which is

to be taxed, but are used only for the purpose of determining the specified offset against the tax on that net
income. Id.
We are not impressed with the argument based on the
provisions of §§ 21, 22 and 23. True, § 21 provides that
"net income" means gross income computed under § 22
less the deductions allowed by § 23. Section 22 defines
gross income and § 23 provides for deductions, including
deductions for losses. But §§ 21, 22 and 23 are not to be
construed so as to derogate from the special and explicit
provisions of § 101 (b). Under the limitation of that section, as we have seen, the taxpayer is not permitted to deduct capital losses so as to reduce the net income subject
to tax and his capital losses enter into the computation of
his ultimate tax only through the deduction of 121/2 per
centum of the capital net loss from the tax which is computed upon the net. income ascertained irrespective of
that loss.
It is in this light that we must decide the particular
question here presented as to the meaning of the words
"the taxpayer's net income" in § 23(n) providing for a
deduction of 15 per centum for charitable contributions.
Do these words refer to the taxpayer's net income which
under the statutory scheme is actually subject to tax? Or
is that net income, although treated as subsisting for the
purpose of being taxed, to be regarded as non-existent for
the purpose of admitting deductions for contributions?
We think that Congress, in the application of the special
provision of § 101(b) for an 6ffset in case of a capital
net loss, intended to make the taxpayer's net income, ascertained irrespective of that loss, the subject of the tax
and that the provision in § 21(n) allowing a deduction for
charitable contributions is applicable to that taxable net
income.
There is nothing to the contrary in our decision in
Helvering v. Bliss, supra. In that case there was a capi-

tal net gain. The net income of the taxpayer comprehended that net gain as well as his net income otherwise computed. We decided that it was his total net income which was to be regarded as the basis for the allowance under § 23 (n). We found nothing in § 101, which
in that application prescribed "merely a method for segregating a portion of that net income for taxation at a
special rate," that in any wise altered the right of the
taxpayer to take the deduction in accordance with § 23
(n). Id., 150, 151. Here, instead of a capital net gain,
we have a capital net loss. There is no gain to be added
to the taxpayer's net income otherwise computed, and
thus that is the only net income taxable under the statute. To that net income, the provision of § 23 (n) appropriately applies. We observed in the Bliss case that
the exemption of income devoted to charity and the reduction of the rate of tax on capital gains "were liberalizations of the law in the taxpayer's favor, were begotten from motives of public policy, and are not to be narrowly construed." That observation is equally pertinent
here.
The administrative construction invoked by the Government has not been of a sufficiently consistent character to afford adequate support for its contention."
We conclude that the Commissioner erred in refusing
to permit the deduction sought by respondent for his
charitable contributions and that the judgment of the
Court of Claims should be
Affirmed.
