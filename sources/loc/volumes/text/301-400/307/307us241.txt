Opinion of the Court.

reasonable investigation would add but imperceptibly if
at all to the cost of doing business. In this field such investigation entails a burden which any legitimate enterprise should be prepared to carry. We need not conjure
up hypothetical cases of extended inquiry which disclosed
no straw man, for they would meet the test of reasonable
investigation here proposed.
For these reasons, the judgments should be reversed.

ELECTRICAL FITTINGS CORP. ET AL. v. THOMAS
& BETTS CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 582.

Argued April 19, 1939.-Decided May 22, 1939.

A defendant in a patent suit is entitled to appeal from so much of
a decree adjudging him not guilty of infringement as purports to
adjudge the patent valid. P. 242.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

307 U. S.

1 valid but not infringed and claim 2 invalid.1 Instead of
dismissing the bill without more, it entered a decree adjudging claim 1 valid but dismissing the bill for failure to
prove infringement.
The respondents did not appeal, but filed in the Patent
Office a disclaimer of claim 2. The petitioners appealed
to the Circuit Court of Appeals from so much of the decree as adjudicated claim 1 valid. The appeal was dismissed on the ground that the petitioners had been
awarded all the relief to which they were entitled, the
litigation having finally terminated in their favor.2 The
court Was of opinion that the decree would not bind the
petitioners in subsequent suits on the issue of the validity
of claim 1.
We granted certiorari because of an alleged conflict of
decision. A party may not appeal from a judgment or
decree in his favor, for the purpose of obtaining a review
of findings he deems erroneous which are not necessary
to support the decree.4 But here the decree itself purports to adjudge the validity of claim 1, and though the
adjudication was immaterial to the disposition of the
cause, it stands as an adjudication of one of the issues
litigated. We think the petitioners were entitled to have
this portion of the decree eliminated, and that the Circuit Court' of Appeals had jurisdiction,' as we have held
this court has 6 to entertain the appeal, not for the purpose of passing on the merits, but to direct the reformation of the decree.

MAYTAG COMPANY v. HURLEY MACHINE CO.
ET AL.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 76.

Argued April 19, 20, 1939.-Decided May 22, 1939.

Unreasonable neglect and delay of a patentee in suing upon or disclaiming a claim not definitely distinguishable from another adjudged invalid for anticipation and disclaimed, avoids the entire
patent. R. S. §§ 4917 and 4922. P. 245.
Snyder patent No. 1,866,779, issued to Maytag Company,
assignee, embracing claims for a washing machine and a method
of washing fabrics, held invalidated.
96 F. 2d 87, affirmed.
100 F. 2d 218, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 306 U. S. 666, to review decrees in the Second Circuit denying relief in two infringement suits upon
the ground that the claims sued upon had been anticipated; and (306 U. S. 626) to review a decree in the
Eighth Circuit upholding the same claims as valid. The
claims sued upon were three of thirty-six apparatus
claims, for a washing machine, embraced in the patent.
The same patent included also three claims for a method
of washing fabrics, two of which had been disclaimed; the
third furnished the basis for the present decision.
* Together with No. 77, Maytag Co. v. Easy Washing Machine Co.,
also on writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit; and No. 661, General Electric Supply Corp. v. Maytag Co., on writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit.
