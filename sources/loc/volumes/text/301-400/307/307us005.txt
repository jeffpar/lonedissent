of 1889 discloses that it is not cast in the form of an
agreement; and, we may not assume that Congress
abandoned its guardianship of the tribe or the bands and
entered into a formal trust agreement with the Indians,
in the absence of a clear expression of that intent.
It is not contended that the expenditures made from
the fund, or reimbursed from it, were not for the benefit of the Indians or were not such as properly might be
made for their education and civilization, the purposes
stated in the Act of 1889.
We hold that the Act did not tie the hands of Congress so that it could not depart from the plan envisaged

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 441. Argued February 28, 1939.-Decided April 17, 1939.
1. Under R. S. § 4886, a patent for an invention made but not patented or published in a foreign country, is good, in a suit for
infringement, against an innocent infringing use in this country for
which no patent right is claimed and which began before the date
of the application but after the actual date of the invention.

2. R. S. § 4887 contains no provision which precludes proof of facts
respecting the actual date of invention in a foreign country to overcome the prior knowledge or use bar of § 4886. P. 12.
3. R. S. § 4923, which provides that if the patentee, at the time of
his application, believed himself the original or first inventor, his
patent shall not be refused or held void by reason of the invention
having been known or used in a foreign country, before his invention or discovery, if it had not been patented or described in

a printed publication, held inapplicable where the litigation is between the patentee of a foreign invention, or his assignee, and an
alleged infringer who defends only in virtue of prior knowledge or
use not covered by patent. P. 13.
4. Repeated amendment of sections of the Patent Laws without
alteration of provisions theretofore construed by the courts, implies legislative approval of such constructions. P. 14.
5. The question whether an invention has been abandoned is one of
fact. P. 15.
6. R. S. § 4920 makes abandonment an affirmative defense which must
be pleaded and proved. P. 16.
Held in this case that the defense was waived by failure to
plead it in the original answer or by amendment, and that the
circumstances did not afford an excuse on- the ground of surprise.
7. Findings of the District Court to the effect that a foreign inventor
limited his application for a foreign patent to one step of his
process, and, for motives not inquired into, withheld more essential
features for future patenting, are not to be construed in this case
as meaning that he concealed the full invention and delayed applications for the purpose of extending unduly the life of his
patents. P. 15.
8. Under R. S. § 4886, a valid patent can not issue for an invention
in public use in this country for more than two years prior to the
filing of the application. P. 17.
This defense was duly pleaded in this case by denials of negative
allegations of the bill and by affirmative allegations, in the answer.
P. 17.
9. The ordinary use of a machine or the practice of a process in a
factory in the usual course of producing articles for commercial
purposes is a public use within the meaning of R. S. § 4886.

So held where the defendant had continuously employed the
allegedly infringing machine and process for the production of
lead oxide powder used in the manufacture of plates for storage
batteries which were sold in quantity, and where the machine,
process and the product were well known to the employees in the
plant, and no efforts were made to conceal them from anyone who
had a legitimate interest in understanding them.
10. Upon finding that two of the patents sustained by the courts
below are invalid because of more than two years' public use prior
to application, the Court directs that the bill be dismissed as to
them; but as to a third patent, not subject to that objection, it

the process. The third is for an apparatus for the continuous production of lead oxides in the form of a dry
fine powder. Such powder is useful in the manufacture
of plates for storage batteries.
The bill was filed by the respondents as patentee and
exclusive licensee. The answer denied that Shimadzu
was the first inventor; asserted knowledge and use of the
invention by the petitioner in the United States more
than two years prior to the dates of the applications;
and pleaded that earlier patents procured by Shimadzu
in Japan avoided the United States patents as the former
were for the same inventions and each was granted more
than a year prior to the filing of the corresponding application in this country. The case was tried, the District
Court found the facts, stated its conclusions, and entered
a decree for the respondents,' which the Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed. 3 The petitioner sought certiorari alleging that the case presents three questions, one which
should be settled by this court and two which were decided below contrary to our adjudications.
The questions are: In an infringement suit by the
owner of a patent for an invention, made but not patented
or published abroad, to restrain an innocent use, the inception of which antedates the application for patent,
may the plaintiff prove that his actual date of invention
was earlier than the commencement of the asserted infringing use? Is the delay of the patentee in this case
in applying for patent a bar to relief for alleged infringement? Does commercial use of the patented process and
apparatus in the alleged infringer's plant for more than
two years prior to the application for patent preclude
redress?

Opinion of the Court.

No controversy of fact is involved as the petitioner concedes it must accept the concurrent findings of the courts
below 4 The relevant facts lie within a narrow compass.
The inventions which are the basis of the patents were
conceived by Shimadzu and reduced to practise in Japan
not later than August 1919. He did not disclose the inventions to anyone in the United States before he applied
for United States patents. Application was presented for
No. 1,584,149 on January 30, 1922; for No. 1,584,150 on
July 14, 1923; and for No. 1,896,020 on April 27, 1926.
The inventions were not patented or described in a printed
publication in this or any foreign country prior to the
filing of the applications. The petitioner, without knowledge of Shimadzu's inventions, began the use of a machine, which involved both the method and the apparatus
of the patents, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, early in
1921 and attained commercial production in June 1921.
Over the objection of the petitioner the respondents were
permitted by testimony, and by the introduction of contemporaneous drawings and note books, to carry the date
of invention back to August 1919, and the courts below
fixed that as the date of invention and reduction to practise in Japan.
First. The petitioner asserts that R. S. 4886, 4887,
and 4923,' considered together, require one who has made
'At the trial the respondents relied, to some extent, upon an
adjudication in an interference proceeding between Shimadzu and
Hall, an employe of the petitioner who in 1924 applied for a patent
for a process of producing finely powdered mixed lead and lead oxide.
See Hall v. Shimadzu, 59 F. 2d 225. The courts below have held
that this interference has no bearing upon the present controversy
and their holding in this respect involves questions of fact. As the
respondents did not cross-petition they may not, in this court, attack
the findings in question.

an invention abroad to take as his date of invention
the date of his application in the United States unless,
prior thereto, the invention has been communicated and
described to someone in this country, or has been patented abroad. The respondents insist that the sections
have no such force. They say that where the alleged
infringer is not acting under the supposed protection of
a prior patent, but is using an unpatented process or
device, the holder of a patent for a foreign invention, like
the holder of one for an invention made here, may show
novelty by proving that his invention antedated his
application and the infringing use.
The solution of the issue requires examination of two
of the sections in the light of their development from
earlier patent statutes.
.R. S. 4886, as it stood when the patents were granted,'
was:
"Any person who has invented or discovered any new
and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of
matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof,
not known or used by others [in this country], [before
his invention or discovery thereof], and not patented or
described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country, before his invention or discovery thereof,
[or more than two years prior to his application], and
not in public use or on sale [in this country] for more
than two years prior to his application, unless the same
is proved to have been abandoned, may, upon payment
of the fees required by law, and other due proceeding
had, obtain a patent therefor."
The legislative history of the section may be briefly
outlined. The Patent Act of 1790' authorized the grant
' The section was amended by the Act of May 23, 1930, c. 312, § 1,
46 Stat. 376, to authorize the patenting of inventions of certain
plants.

of a patent to "any person or persons" who made an invention "not before known or used." The succeeding
Act of 1793 ' confined the privilege to "a citizen or citizens of the United States," but the Act of 1800 " conferred it on any alien who, at the time of his application,
had resided for two years within the United States. By
the Act of 1836 'o it was provided that a patent might be
obtained by "any person or persons." The Act of 1870,11
which was carried into the Revised Statutes; added the
words "in this country" as they appear in the first bracket
in the foregoing quotation. The Act of 1897 1 added the
three other bracketed clauses.
The requirement of the Act of 1790 was that the discovery be "not before known or used." The Act of 1793
amended this to read "not known or used before the application." The Act of 1800 altered the provision so that
the petitioner had to swear that his invention had not
"been known or used either in this or any foreign country."
The Act of 1836 changed the knowledge and use clause
to read "not known or used by others before his or their
discovery or invention thereof."
These successive alterations throw into relief the fact
that the section makes the criterion of novelty the same
whether the invention was conceived abroad or in this
country. The test is whether the invention was "known
or used by others in this country, before his invention
or discovery thereof . . ." The elements which preclude
patentability are a patent, or a description in a printed
publication in this or any foreign country, which antedates
the invention or discovery of the applicant.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

307 U. S.

None of the statutes has ever embodied as an element
the place of invention or discovery, but the change effected
by the Act of 1836, and carried forward in all succeeding
statutes, is the fixation of the actual date of the inventive
act as the date prior to which the invention must have
been known or used to justify denial of a patent for want
of novelty. The omission of any limitation as to the
place of invention or discovery precludes a ruling imposing
such a limitation, especially so since the Act of 1870 expressly limited the area of prior knowledge or use to this
country.
The provisions of R. S. 4886 which affect the question
are not modified by R. S. 4887, the purpose of which is
to permit the filing of applications for the same invention
in foreign countries and in the United States. It derives
from § 25 of the Act of 1870.1"
The second paragraph of the section, which was added
by the Act of 1903 1 to comply with reciprocal agreements
with foreign countries, gives the same force and effect to
the filing of an application in a foreign country as it would
have if filed here on the date on which the application for
patent was first filed in the foreign country, provided that
the domestic application is filed within twelve months of
the foreign filing date. The last sentence of the paragraph
expressly preserves the bars of more than two years' prior
patenting, description in a printed publication before the
filing of application in this country, and public use, more
than two years before such filing. But the section does
not contain any provision which precludes proof of facts
respecting the actual date of invention in a foreign country to overcome the prior knowledge or use bar of
§ 4886.
The petitioner also relies upon R. S. 4923, which provides that if the patentee, at the time of his application,

Opinion of the Court.

believed himself the original or first inventor, his patent
shall not be refused or held void by reason of the invention having been known or used in a foreign country, before his invention or discovery, if it had not been patented
or described in a printed publication. The effect of this
section is that in an interference between two applicants
for United States patent, or in an infringement suit where
the alleged infringer relies upon a United States patent,
the application and patent for the domestic invention
shall have priority despite earlier foreign knowledge and
use not evidenced by a prior patent or a description in a
printed publication.
The section, on its face, is without application where
the litigation is between the patentee of a foreign invention, or his assignee, and an alleged infringer who defends
only in virtue of prior knowledge or use not covered by a
patent.
While this court has never been called upon to decide
the precise question presented, the lower federal courts
have refused to extend § 4923 to such a case. They have
held that § 4886 does not limit the plaintiff to the date
of application in this country but that he may prove the
invention was in fact made at an earlier date, as could the
owner of an invention made in the United States. 5
There is force in the petitioner's argument that the distinction seems illogical. Thus, if a diligent domestic inventor applies, in good faith believing himself to be the
first inventor, § 4923 assures him a patent and gives
it priority, despite prior foreign use, even though that use
is evidenced "by a patent applied for after the invention
made in this country. The foreign applicant or patentee

cannot carry the date of his invention back of the date of
application in this country, as the holder of a later patent
for an invention made here would be permitted to do in
order to establish priority. On the other hand, a domestic inventor who is willing to dedicate his invention to
the public may be held as an infringer by reason of the
later patenting of an invention abroad which antedates
the invention and use in this country; and so is put in a
worse position vis a vis a foreign inventor who subsequently secures a patent, and succeeds in establishing an
earlier date of invention, than he would occupy if he had
promoted his own interest by procuring a patent.
We have no way of knowing whether the discrimination results from inadvertence or from some undisclosed
legislative policy, but, in order to redress the disadvantage
under which one in the petitioner's situation suffers, we
should have to read into the law words which plainly are
missing.16 We cannot thus rewrite the statute. 7 Moreover §§ 4886 and 4887 have repeatedly been amended and
other portions of the patent act have been revised and
amended from time to time since the decisions pointing
out that § 4886 did not prevent the foreign inventor from
carrying back his date of invention beyond the date of his
application. Congress has not seen fit to amend the
statute in this respect and we must assume that it has
been satisfied with, and adopted, the construction given
to its enactment by the courts. 8
" The petitioner would have us insert in § 4886, for the third time,
the words "in this country" which Congress has twice inserted in the
section by amendment. The petitioner's argument requires us to
read the section as if the phrase "in this country" appeared between the words "discovery thereof" and the words "and not patented."

Opinion of the Court.

We are of opinion that the courts below were right in not
limiting Shimadzu's date of invention to the date of his
application but allowing him to show an earlier actual
date.
Second. A patent is not validly issued if the invention
"is proved to have been abandoned." 19 Abandonment
may be evidenced by the express and voluntary declaration of the inventor; 20 it may be inferred from negligence
or unexplained delay in making application for patent; 21
it may be declared as a consequence of the inventor's concealing his invention and delaying application for patent
in an endeavor to extend the term of the patent protection beyond the period fixed by the statute." In any
case, the question whether the invention has been aban23
doned is one of fact.
Referring to a Japanese patent applied for November
27, 1920, and issued May 10, 1922, the District Court
found: "We are not concerned with the motives which
prompted him . . . to confine it [the Japanese patent]
to the single step of mechanical removal of the dust from
the drum, and to withhold the really essential steps of the
invention for later patenting. It is sufficient to say that
he had the right to do this if he chose." Taken in connection with the court's finding that Shimadzu's inventions were conceived and reduced to practise in August
1919 this finding is said to convict him of intentional and
inexcusable concealment. In the light of the record we
are unable so to hold.

Opinion of the Court.

307 U. S.

R. S. 492021 makes abandonment an affirmative defense which must be pleaded and proved. 25 Admittedly
the defense was not pleaded and the respondents assert,
without contradiction, that it was not relied upon in brief
or argument in the courts below. The petitioner explains its failure so .to plead by saying that, when it
filed its answer, it believed that certain of the Japanese
patents issued to Shimadzu covered the identical inventions described in the patents in suit and invalidated the
latter because application was not made in this country
within one year of the grant of the foreign patents as
required by R. S. 4887. The claim is that the refusal to
sustain this defense and the assignment of August 1919
as the date of invention, took petitioner by surprise; and
that the question of Shimadzu's concealment of his invention from 1919 until he made his applications in the
United States did not emerge until the District Court's
decision was rendered.
We think this is not a sufficient excuse for not pleading the defense. Alternative and inconsistent defenses
may be pleaded.26 Certainly if the petitioner was surprised it could at least have requested an opportunity to
amend its answer. If the defense had been pleaded
originally or by amendment the respondents would have
had an opportunity to meet it by proof and this they
appear not to have been afforded. We have a finding
which seems not to have been addressed to this issue; and
no findings as to the circumstances which led to the delay
in filing applications. In the circumstances we think we
are not justified in assigning to the findings below the
force of a finding that Shimadzu, with intent, concealed

his invention and delayed making applications for the
purpose of unduly extending the life of his patents,-a
defense not pleaded.
Third. If a valid patent is to issue, the invention must
not have been in public use in this country for more than
two years prior to the filing of the application.27 Such
public use is an affirmative defense to be pleaded and
proved.28 The respondents insist that it was not pleaded
in this case and that the findings respecting the defense,
on which the petitioner relies, are unsupported by the
evidence. We cannot agree with either position.
Although not required so to do, the respondents in
their bill pleaded with respect to each of the patents
that the invention had not been in public use for more
than two years before application filed. The petitioner
denied the allegation as to each patent and, in addition,
alleged that it was successfully making and selling the
product of the invention in its plant long before it ever
learned of Shimadzu's existence or his inventions, and
further asserted that "the claims of said letters patent are
invalid and void because the subject matter thereof was,
prior to the alleged invention thereof by Shimadzu, and
for more than two years prior to his application dates,
known to and used by the defendant at Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania,

. . ."

Upon the trial, employes of the

petitioner described an early apparatus and process used
in 1918 and 1919 and abandoned in the latter year when
experiments began towards employment of the apparatus and process the petitioner now uses. They testified to the increasing perfection of the apparatus and
process during the early months of 1921, and that commercial production was accomplished sometime between

April and June of that year. Former employes of the
petitioner were called by the respondents and described
this apparatus and process as used and practised in the
petitioner's plant in Philadelphia subsequent to the date
of Shimadzu's applications, but the evidence indicates
that, after its perfection in 1921, the same apparatus has
been used, and the same process practised, from that date
to the present. This is the apparatus and process which
the courts below have held to infringe. The District
Court found "commercial production by the Hardinge
mill with its forced air draft undoubtedly involved the
use of the plaintiff's patent, and June, 1921, may be
fixed as the date when that began." The respondents insist that this does not amount to a finding of prior public use, distinguishing between the court's phrase "commercial production" and the designation "public use"
found in the statute. We think the position is untenable.
The finding of the District Court appears under a
heading in its opinion entitled "Alleged Prior Public
Use." As originally promulgated the finding fixed January 1921 as the date of commercial production. The
respondents sought a rehearing and asked that the finding as to commercial production in January 1921 be revised. A rehearing was granted and the District Judge
filed a memorandum amending his opinion. In this he
said: "As to the second statement of fact, it may be said
at once that it was never intended by the Court to make
a finding of a prior public use (in the statutory sense of
that term) by the defendant in January 1921." After
discussing the use of the apparatus in the early months of
1921, the court said: "It is therefore plain that there is
no evidence of anything beyond an experimental use by
the defendant earlier than about the middle of the year
1921. It is entirely possible that the word 'January' in

Opinion of the Court.

the second statement of fact referred to above is a mere
typographical error and that what the Court had in mind
was, 'June.' However that may be and in order to avoid
any possible misunderstanding as to the scope of the
finding, I will amend it to read 'Commercial production
by the Hardinge mill with its forced air draft undoubtedly involved the use of the plaintiff's patent, and June,
1921, may be fixed as the date when that began.'"
Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
That the respondents understood the force and effect of
the finding as to prior use is evident from their assignments, one of which is that the District Court erred "in
finding and adjudging that commercial production by the
Hardinge mill with its forced draft involving the use
5f plaintiff's patent began in June 1921."
It remains to determine whether the commercial use
found is, in contemplation of law, a public use within the
meaning of R. S. 4886. We hold that it is.
The earlier Acts provided that the bar should consist in public use or sale "with the applicant's consent or
allowance prior to the application." 9 The Act of 1839 30
altered the clause to read "no patent shall be held to be
invalid" except upon proof that "such . . . prior use has
been for more than two years prior to such application
for a patent." This court construed the later Act, which
has been carried forward into the revised statutes, as
rendering prior public use a bar whether the use was with
or without the consent of the patentee.31
Decisions turning on prior public use have been numerous both in this court and in other federal courts; and
the definition of such use, formulated when the statute
made only use by consent a bar, has been adopted in
" Act of July 4, 1836, § 7, 5 Stat. 117, 119.

A mere experimental use is not the public use defined
by the Act,8" but a single use for profit, not purposely
hidden, is such. 4 The ordinary use of a machine or
the practise of a process in a factory in the usual course
of producing articles for commercial purposes is a
public use. 35
In the present case the evidence is that the petitioner,
since June 1921, has continuously employed the alleged
infringing machine and process for the production of lead
oxide powder used in the manufacture of plates for storage batteries which have been sold in quantity. There
is no finding, and we think none would have been justified, to the effect that the machine, process, and product
were not well known to the employes in the plant, or
that efforts were made to conceal them from anyone
who had a legitimate interest in understanding them. 6
This use, begun more than two years before Shimadzu
applied for patents 1,584,150 and 1,896,020, invalidated
the claims in suit.

Opinion of the Court.

filed January 30, 1922. The defendant's commercial
production commenced about six months earlier. The
District Court held the patent valid and infringed. Its
claims cover merely a process for the production of a
finely divided chemically reactive lead powder by introducing relatively large masses of lead into a rotatable
vessel, rotating the vessel at a relatively low speed, forming the powder by attrition resulting from the rubbing of
the masses against each other, and blowing the powder
from the vessel by a current of air. The process and
apparatus covered by the other two patents in issue involve use and control of an air current and use and control of temperature within the receptacle for the oxidation of the lead. With respect to 1,584,149 the trial
court said:
"Whether or not '149 is for the same process as U. S. patent '150 is immaterial, so far as the question of validity
of either is concerned. There is no double patenting involved. The two patents issued on the same day. They
both expired on the same day. There can be no extension of the monopoly and one is not prior art against the
other.
"The fact that '149 does not disclose the oxidizing
function of the air or refer to the highly important element of the process having to do with the temperature
control necessary to its successful operation might throw
doubt upon its validity in view of the prior art. This is,
of course, upon the assumption that it is not for the
same invention as '150. The whole matter however is
rather academic since '149 is coincident in duration with
'150, and the defendant's process infringes the somewhat
more precise, if not narrower, claims of '150.
"This patent is therefore held valid and infringed."
The holding was assigned as error in the Circuit Court
of Appeals and is specified as error in the petition for
certiorari.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Syllabus.

307 U. S.

In view of our decision as to 1,584,150 and of the basis
of the decision below respecting 1,584,149, we think the
petitioner is entitled to a reexamination of the questions
of the validity and infringement of the latter.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be
reversed and-the cause remanded to the District Court
with directions to dismiss the bill as to Nos. 1,584,150
and 1,896,020, and to proceed, in the light of the
dismissal as to those patents, to determine whether
1,584,149 is valid and infringed.
Reversed.

FOR THE

FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 330. Argued February 10, 13, 1939.-Decided April 17, 1939.
1. Section 1 of the Act of October 16, 1918, as amended, provides
that aliens of described classes, including "aliens who believe in,
advise, advocate, or teach, or who are members of or affiliated with
any organization, association, society, or group, that believes in,
advises, advocates, or teaches . . . the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States . . .", shall be excluded from admission to the United States. Section 2 provides
that "any alien who, at any time after entering the United States,
is found to have been at the time of entry, or to have become
thereafter, a member of any of the classes of aliens enumerated"
in Section 1, shall, upon warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be
taken into custody and deported, in the manner provided by law.
Held that an alien who after entry becomes a member of such
an organization is not deportable on that ground if at the time of
his arrest his membership has ceased. P. 30.
2. The legislative history of the statute supports this conclusion.
