HAGUE v. C. I. 0., 307 U. S. 496.
The following summaries of the briefs in the case of
Hague v. C. I. 0., ante, p. 496, will be of interest to the
profession.
Messrs. Charles Hershenstein and Edward J. O'Mara,
with whom Messrs. James A. Hamill and John A.
Matthews were on the brief, for petitioners.
The State has absolute control over the use of the
streets and public places, for the benefit of the public
at large, which it may delegate to a municipality. Under
the law of New Jersey no one has the right to hold a
public meeting in the streets or public places of a municipality without the consent of the local authorities. Commonwealth v. Davis, 162 Mass. 510, affirmed, Davis v.
Commonwealth, 167 U. S. 43; West v. Monmouth

the holding of such meeting. Davis v. Commonwealth,
167 U. S. 43; s. c. 162 Mass. 510; cf. Bradley v. Public
Utilities Comm'n, 289 U. S. 92, 95; Allen & Reed, Inc.
v. Presbrey,50 R. I. 53, 56.
Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 697, and kindred cases
are not applicable and do not overrule or modify the
Davis decision. Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, makes
clear that the prevention of disorder is a proper, constitutional test. In that case it was merely -held that
there is freedom to distribute written matter in whatever orderly manner may be necessary or expedient for
the purpose. The distribution there in question was of
a religious tract. This kind of distribution is commonly
from house to house, only incidentally involving use of
the streets. And even were it on the street, there was no
indication that such distribution would involve an expropriation of the entire street area such as ordinarily
ensues when a mass meeting is there held, with its obstruction of traffic, littering of streets, and general disorder, if not riot. The clear implication from that case
is that maintenance of public order is a proper ground
for regulation.
If the right of free speech and assembly is sought to
be exercised in public streets and places in conflict with
the right of the public at large to free and untrammeled
use of such places, and in contravention of the discretion of the public officials entrusted with their administration, the right is necessarily dissipated; not because
it is any the less intrinsically a fundamental right, but
because, under the circumstances, its exercise becomes a
perversion, and an invasion of the rights of the community generally. The liberty referred to in the Fourteenth
Amendment, is, in the language of Mr. Justice Cardozo
in Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325, "a concept
of ordered liberty." Distinguishing DeJonge v. Oregon,

As for public meetings in parks, there is no proof of
discrimination in the record. Furthermore, such a use is
repugnant to the uses to which the parks are dedicated,namely, recreation and refreshment of the people. Davis

Under the New Jersey law as expressed in the case of
West v. Monmouth Beach, 107 N. J. L. 445, a diversion

The vagueness of the decree has the effect of preventing petitioners, at peril of criminal liability, from drafting a new ordinance.
No proof of the value of the matters in controversy was
offered. Therefore there was no jurisdiction under Jud.
Code § 24 (1). The rights claimed did not have a
pecuniary value or consequence, i. e., calculable in money
and immediately, not remotely or contingently, dependent
on the litigation. Smith v. Adams, 130 U. S. 167, 175;

Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U. S. 58 and Nixon v. Herndon,273
U. S. 536, dealt with common law action for damages due
to interference with the right to vote. The broad proposition that any social, political or civil rights are presumably of a value in excess of $3,000 would render needless
several of the other subdivisions of § 24, such as (12) and
(14), which dispense with the jurisdictional minimum in
certain specific types of action for particular civil deprivations. Smith v' Adams, 130 U. S. 167; Ohio v. Cox,
257 F. 334.
In Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33, jurisdiction was assumed without reference to the amount in controversy,
because of the interference with rights secured by laws
of the United States providing for equal rights of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States, under
the predecessor section to Jud. Code, § 24 (14), which is
one of the fixed exceptions to the requirement of a showing of jurisdictional amount. See Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Pollak, 272 F. 137.

In a proceeding in the federal courts, where a requirement of jurisdictional minimum is necessary, the right
of freedom from unlawful incarceration is not, per se,
a right susceptible of pecuniary valuation for jurisdictional purposes. Kurtz v. Moffitt, supra; Barry v. Mercein, supra. The rule of presumptive jurisdictional
amount applies only in a technical action at law for
damages for false imprisonment. Hynes v. Briggs, 41 F.

The claim that the bill alleges a "conspiracy," presumptively within the jurisdictional minimum, is without merit.

The rights involved are not "secured" by the Constitution, within Jud. Code § 24 (14). On the contrary, they
are fundamental rights having their inception in tht several States before the adoption of the Constitution and
are merely guaranteed by it, or by the Fourteenth
Amendment as judicially construed, from invasion by the
States. Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36; United
States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542; United States v.

School District,21 F. Supp. 581.
Privileges and immunities protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment are those that belong to citizens of the
United States as such, as contrasted with those derived
from other sources, and the clear intent of subdivision
(14) is limited to those rights strictly which fall within
the privileges and immunities claust or other provisions
of the Constitution proper. Distinguishing Smith v.
United States, 157 F. 721, 724, 725. The word "secured"
in subdivision (14) is used as a word of art.
The claimed right of peaceable assembly is not a right
secured by the Federal Constitution. United State's v.
'Cruikshank,supra; DeJonge v. Oregon, supra, 364.
The rights of free speech and a free press were attributes of national citizenship before the Fourteenth
Amendment. Patterson v. Colorado, 205 U. S. 454, 464
(dissent). The right of free speech was one of those
fundamental rights brought into the Colonies from England antedating the Federal Constitution. 4 Blackstone's Comm. 151, 152; 4 Madison's Wks. 543, Report
on the Virginia Resolutions.

arraignment, and from forcible removal or deportation
from one State to another, it is elementary that the first
two of these are protected by the Federal Constitution
only against invasion by Congress. So far as unlawful
acts in these respects by state officers are concerned, the
remedies are exclusively a matter of state action.
The right to be immune from the alleged deportations
is not a privilege or immunity secured to a United States
citizen, within the conspiracy statute construed by the
Court in United States v. Cruikshank, supra; United
States v. Wheeler, 254 U. S. 281, affirming 254 F. 611. Of
course, state action of the nature complained of might
call for federal protection within Art. IV, § 2 of the Federal Constitution, as constituting a denial to citizens of
other States of rights and privileges of citizens of New
Jersey, 254 U. S. 299; United States v. Harris, 106 U. S.
629, 645.
The rights involved in this case are in no instance secured by any law of the United States providing for equal
rights of citizens of the United States or of all persons
within the jurisdiction of the United States, and therefore no such law brings them within the alternative provisions of Jud. Code § 24 (14).
Jurisdiction can not be derived from Jud. Code, § 24
(12).
The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutes no basis for jurisdiction under (14).

137. Such rights as maS, be said to flow from Art. IV, § 2,
do not arise from the Constitution and laws of the United
States as contrasted with those that spring from other
sources.
The alleged deprivation of the "privilege," under the
Fourteenth Amendment, of passing freely from State to
State is no basis for jurisdiction under subdivision (14).
Jurisdiction can not flow from the commerce clause and
the Interstate Commerce Act.
Those respondents which are artificial entities have no
constitutional rights, either under the "liberty" concept
of the due process clause, or under the "privileges and immunities" clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
No case is made for jurisdiction under Jud. Code § 24
(14) as to the individual respondents, since there is no
allegation or proof that any of them ever made any attempt either to secure a permit, or to hold a meeting on
the public streets.
Jud. Code, § 24 (14) deals with deprivation of certain
rights under color of a statute, law, ordinance, etc., of
any State, and therefore does not extend to such of the
respondents' grievances as were not imputable to the State
of New Jersey. Nor may jurisdiction be predicated under
Jud. Code, § 24 (1) (dealing with controversies arising
under the Constitution and laws of the United States)
so far as grievances are based upon deprivations under
the Fourteenth Amendment, since that Amendment is
likewise limited to state action.
Messrs. Morris L. Ernst and Spaulding Frazer, with
whom Messrs. Lee Pressman and Benjamin Kaplan were
on the brief, for respondents.
The Jersey City policy of deportation violates the
privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

HAGUE v. C. I. 0.
307 U. S.

Argument for Respondents.

Freedom to pass without molestation throughout the
United States is an attribute of national citizenship protected against state interference.
The policy of deportation likewise offends against the
interstate commerce clause.
It violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, as does the policy respecting search and seizure. The New Jersey Constitution forbids such unreasonable searches and seizures. As the unlawful searches
and seizures are part of a scheme or conspiracy hostile to
federal constitutional guaranties, jurisdiction to enjoin
them would exist in any event.
Police interference with peaceful picketing violates due
process. In any event, there must be arrest and fair
trial.
The municipal ordinances are void. Lovell v. Griffin,
303 U. S. 444. Distribution of literature is the substance
of the right of free press so far as labor unions are concerned. The Jersey City ordinances, unlike that of the
City of Griffin, are absolute prohibitions, not merely previous restraints by license or permit.
The standard of anticipated disorder is unconstitutional. It was unconstitutionally applied to the respondents.
The concurrent findings of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement are supported by ample evidence. Respondents could obtain no private halls in Jersey City.
If the public places of the City were denied them, they
would be without a voice in the City.
The standard set up by the ordinance imposes a previous restraint and is void. Freedom of speech and of
the press are secured by the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment against invasion by the States
and their governmental agencies. Near v. Minnesota,
283 U. S. 697, 707; DeJonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353,

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.

307 U. S.

364; Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 450. And just as
freedom of the press embraces the right to circulate as
well as the right to publish (Lovell v. Griffin, supra), so
freedom of speech embraces the right to address an audience as well as the right merely to talk. See Whitney v.
California,274 U. S. 357; DeJonge v. Oregon, supra; and
Palko v. Connecticut, 302'U. S. 319, 324.
Primarily, freedom of speech and freedom of the press
mean freedom from previous restraint.
Under the ordinance a man may be forbidden in advance the right to address the public on the ground that
his words will, in the opinion of the Director of Public
Safety, provoke disorder. Under the Constitution a
speaker may not be barred upon a guess that he will be
lawless, or that others will be lawless and riot in resentment against him or what he may choose to say.
The respondents do not contend that there is, nor did
the courts below find, any constitutional or social objection to the requirement of permits for public meetings.
Permits must be applied for three days in advance; so
said the ordinance and so says the decree. The City is
thus given notice of the gatherings that are to be held,
and is enabled to take whatever precautions it deems
necessary. Furthermore, under the decree, the City is
properly given the right to refuse permits on the ground
of traffic conditions or conflicting recreational schedulesto this extent the exercise of the right of free speech is
reasonably accommodated to other uses of the streets and
parks. What petitioners are precluded from doing is anticipating a riot before the applicant has opened his
mouth, and denying him the right to speak in public
places on the basis of such a guess. Near v. Minnesota,
supra; Dearborn Pub. Co. v. Fitzgerald, 271 F. 479;
American League of the Friends of New Germany v.
Eastmead, 116 N. J. Eq. 487; Hudson County Committee v. Hague, N. J. Chancery, Jan. 19, 1937.

HAGUE v. C. I. 0.
307 U. S.

Argument for Respondents.

Undoubtedly general police regulations having nothing
to do with speech or the press as such are not considered
to be previous restraints. Thus ordinances and statutes
may constitutionally be passed, which require that permits be obtained from the building, health and fire
departments before a building is used to house a newspaper plant. Newspapers may likewise be compelled to
pay a social security tax, to enter into collective bargaining with their employees, and the like. Associated Press
v. National Labor Relations Board, 301 .U. S. 103, 132133.
These regulations find their origin, not in the subject
matter of the constitutional guaranty, but in the exigencies of communal life which make general rules on fire,
sanitation and the like indispensable. These rules, because they have no relation whatever to the impartial
distribution of the written word as such, are not regarded
as previous restraints. The same reasoning applies to
the right of speech; a speaker, like a newspaper, has no
special immunity from the application of general laws.
Certainly a speaker may be required to conform with
non-discriminatory regulations based on traffic conditions
and proper regard for public recreation other than public
meetings. Anderson v. Wellington, 40 Kan. 173, 180.
Davis v. Massachusetts, 167 U. S. 43, is not in point
here, and in any event does not represent good law today.
In so far as the ordinance in the Davis case required
that a permit be obtained, there could be no constitutional
objection to it. The fact that Davis spoke without even
applying for a permit marks one contkolling distinction
between that case and the present. Moreover, unlike the
Jersey City ordinance, which conditions refusal of permits
upon an anticipation of disorder, the Boston ordinance
did not in terms prescribe any standard for refusal. This
Court naturally assumed that in enforcing it the adminisfrative authority was free to apply constitutional criteria,

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.

307 U. S.

such as traffic conditions, etc., and had done so. The
present ordinance leaves the official no room for applying
a constitutional standard.
The Davis case does not qualify or rebut the conclusion that the standard of anticipated disorder is unconstitutional. It is a holding that the right to speak may
be constitutionally conditioned-a point which is conceded.
This Court took the view that Davis had been validly
convicted and punished because he violated a law which
could have been constitutionally applied (and Davis made
no effort to show that it had been unconstitutionally applied as to him). Distg. People ex rel. Doyle v. Atwell,
232 N. Y. 96; People v. Smith, 263 N. Y. 255; Duquesne
v. Fincke, 269 Pa. 112.
The decision in the Davis case is inconsistent with more
recent authorities.
In England the use of public places for speaking purposes is taken for granted. Cobbett's Case, 29 How. St.
Trials 49 (1804); Liberty of the Press, Speech and Public
Worship, (1800) by James Paterson; A. V. Dicey, The
Law of the Constitution, (1915, 8th ed.). Of course, the
right may not be exercised at all times in all places. Highways may not be rendered useless or public squares be
clogged by public assemblages. R. v. Carlile, 6 C. & P.
636; Ex parte Lewis, 21 Q. B. D. 191. See Jennings, The
Law and the Constitution (1933), p. 242. Public parks
may not be cluttered with public meetings. But the
necessity that there be some adequate places where the
right can be exercised has never been questioned. Paterson, op cit., supra, 23; Dicey, op. cit., supra, 498.
The rights of free speech and free assembly are essential parts of American heritage. Traditionally in the
United States, freedom of speech means freedom to speak
in public places. State v. Butterworth, 104 N. J. L. 579,
581, reversing 104 N. J. L. 43. Obviously, cases sustaining license ordinances do not hold that the municipality

HAGUE v. C. I. 0.

Argument for Respondents.

could prohibit public speaking entirely. They establish
only that licenses may be required if proper criteria for
their issuance are adhered to. Of such a nature are the
Davis, Atwell, Smith, Fincke and other cases relied upon
by the petitioners. See, also, State v. Coleman, 96 Conn.
190; Anderson v. Tedford, 85 So. 673; Bloomington v.
Richardson, 38 Ill. App. 60; Rich v. Naperville, 42 Ill.
App. 222; Chicago v. Trotter, 136 Ill. 430, 433; Anderson

Mich. 396, 405; State ex rel. Garrabadv. Dering, 84 Wisc.
585, 594-5.
Viewed even as a general police regulation (as distinguished from a previous restraint prohibited under any
circumstances), the ordinance is void because unreasonable in the light of the underlying facts, which in this
instance demonstrate the lack of necessity for conditioning the right to speak in public places upon prevision of
disorder. See Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357. •
The ordinance has been so applied to and enforced
against the respondents as to violate the equal protection
and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Jurisdiction existed under Jud. Code § 24 (1). The
concurrent findings of minimal amount as a fact should
not be disturbed.
In cases seeking injunctive relief, the value in dispute
is that of the object of the bill. The value of social or
political rights is presumptively in excess of the jurisdictional amount. McNichols v. International Typ.
Union, 21 F. 2d 497, 498.
The rights of which respondents were deprived were
bythem attempted to be exercised in pursuance of a federally declared policy incorporated in the National Labor
Relations Act (29 U. S. C. §§ 151-166).
Denial of the rights here involved meant destruction
of the opportunity to work or to pursue a calling. That
such rights°- have
an economic aspect is settled by Truax v.

Had respondents brought actions for damages on the
law side, each could in good faith have alleged compensatory and exemplary damages in excess of $3,000 and
jurisdiction would have definitely attached. Barry v.
Edmunds, 116 U. S. 550; Ragsdale v. Rudick, 293 F. 182.
See Hynes v. Briggs, 41 F. 468.
It is immaterial that respondents joined in a suit to
restrain the repeated and continuous trespasses and other
tortious acts rather than filed actions for damages.
They sought to vindicate their right to be free from unlawful interferences, and the value of that right is determinative of amount in .controversy. Past acts and
future or threatened probabilities enter into such calculation. Fidler v. Roberts, 41 F. 2d 305.
The rule of aggregation to establish jurisdictional
amount is applicable. Troy Bank v. Whitehead, 222

Rights distinctively civil in character are "secured"
by each of the three principal clauses of the first section
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Jud. Code § 24 (14)
and 8 U. S. C. § 43 cover the rights so secured. Raich

unreasonable search and seizure is secured by the due
process clause (and perhaps also by the privileges or
immunities clause); the rights of free speech, free press
and peaceable assembly are secured by the due process
clause (and perhaps also by the privileges or immunities
clause). To the extent that discrimination was shownand discrimination pervades the case and the findingsthe equal protection clause is also involved.
Since Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, and Fiske v.
Kansas, 274 U. S. 380, it is no longer open to question
that these civil rights are as much within the ambit of
the due process clause as vested rights of property, which
were likewise brought within this clause only as the result of a lengthy and tortuous development. See Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578.
The contention that the provisions of the Civil Rights
Act cover only such rights protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment as originated in or were created by provisions of the Constitution other than the Fourteenth
Amendment itself-thus confining the provisions of the
Civil Rights Act to so-called rights of national citizenship and unwarrantably reading the word "secured" in
the Civil Rights Act as meaning "created,"-is erroneous.
Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, and United States
v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, reflect a narrow view of the
scope of the Fourteenth Amendment long since discountenanced by this Court.
As to the due process clause, rights of property are now
plainly protected. See Butchers Union Slaughter-House

There is no conceivable basis in the authorities upon
which the petitioners principally rely, for their conception that rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment
may be summarily categorized as, on the one hand, rights
"secured" because originating in or created by other provisions of the Constitution and thereupon guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment (rights of national citizenship), and, on the other hand, rights not "secured" because not originating in or created by other provisions of
the Constitution, but nonetheless guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment. The purported distinction rests,
as we have seen, only on early cases declaring that rights
other than those of national citizenship were in no sense
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and these cases
are no longer good law. As the Fourteenth Amendment
now protects and guarantees both kinds of rights (assuming that any distinction whatever can be sensibly made),
it "secures" them; and by the same token they are covered by the Civil Rights Act. Distinguishing Holt v. Indiana Co., 176 U. S. 68; Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Pollak, 272 F. 137; Gobitis v. Minersville School District, 21

The civil rights here in issue are secured by the Fourteenth Amendment (and therefore by the Civil Rights
Act) in the simple sense that, whereas in the absence of
the Amendment a State could impair those rights with
impunity so far as the federal Constitution was concerned,
they are by the Amendment forbidden to do so. See
Smith v. United States, 157 F. 721, cert. den., 208 U. S.
618.
The rights are "created" by the Fourteenth Amendment in the sense that the Amendment created a new
set of sanctions to protect against their invasion.
The rights are created by the First Amendment (possibly also the Fourth). Certainly the rights created by
the Bill of Rights were new rights freshly granted or created, since the national Government whose power they
effectively limited, was a new entity. The fact that the
Fourteenth Amendment, as judicially construed, affords
additional protection to the same basic rights, does not
militate against the fact that the First Amendment created them.
Jurisdiction existed under § 24 (12) of the Judicial
Code (conspiracy respecting civil rights).
All of petitioners' actions constituted state action.
The status of the respondent American Civil Liberties
Union (a corporation) and the unincorporated labor unions was correctly adjudged below. The American Civil
Liberties Union, is not a business corporation but a membership corporation which reflects the interests of its individual members. Cf. KVOS, Inc. v. Associated Press,
299 U. S. 269, 279. A ruling that corporations are not
entitled to the benefit of the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment so far as freedom of speech and press
are concerned would be unthinkable. See Grosjean v.

From the brief of the Committee on the Bill of Rights,*
of the American Bar Association:
The course of conduct of the city officials, as revealed
by the findings in this record, constitutes a serious abridgment of the constitutional right "peaceably to assemble"
of so deliberate and important a character as to be of national consequence.
The refusal of the permits for the meetings in this case
was clearly on the ground that the persons desiring to
speak were unpopular in Jersey City and that the sentiments they might utter would be unpopular. If the law
should ever countenance the suppression of free speech
on the basis of the inacceptability to the prevailing majority opinion of the speakers or their sentiments, the
very basis of the doctrines on which our institutions are
built would be destroyed.

Freedom of assembly is an essential element of the
American democratic system. The decree below is in accord with the modern doctrine of this Court in its interpretation of the constitutional guaranties.
Although none of the recent cases (Fiske v. Kansas,
274 U. S. 380; Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359;
Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 697; Grosjean v. American
Press Co., 297 U. S. 233; Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S.
242; Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444) deals specifically
with the subject of interference with freedom of assembly through the denial of permits for outdoor meetings,
nevertheless the denial by this method of the right of
assembly is closely analogous to the suppression of unpopular meetings by criminal prosecutions, which was
held invalid in DeJonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353.
The ordinance has been unconstitutionally administered. Permits were denied because of threatened disorder without reference to the possibility of controlling
such disorder. Some danger of disorder must be faced
for the sake of the constitutional right of free assembly.
It is natural that threats of trouble should often accompany meetings on controversial questions. But meetings
may not be suppressed on that account. The practice
under ordinary conditions in our large cities is for the
authorities to arrange with the applicants to have the
meeting held in a suitable place, and to have enough
policemen on hand to quell apprehended disturbances.
The real question at issue is whether any threat of
disorder, even though only by opponents of the speakers,
excuses denial of permits. If so, the right of free assembly will have become a mockery. The right would thus
be subject to destruction by an arbitrary official decision,
notwithstanding that the Bill of Rights was intended to
protect citizens from arbitrary action of that very
character.

To "secure" the rights of free speech and assembly
against "abridgment," it is essential not to yield to
threats of disorder. Otherwise these rights of the people
to meet and of speakers to address the citizens so gathered, could not merely be "abridged" but could be destroyed by the action of a small minority of persons hostile to the speaker or to the views he would be likely to
express.
The essential ground upon which the Circuit Court of
Appeals held this ordinance void on its face appears to
have been that the ordinance by its very terms contains
an unconstitutional standard for the guidance of the licensing officer. The court did not deny that any ordinance merely requiring an application to be made to a
city official for a permit, or giving the official a reasonable discretion as to the time or place of the meeting in
order to allow for traffic or recreational conditions, would
have been valid. It evidently considered that an ordinance which by its terms contemplates the refusal of a
permit merely because, in the opinion of the licensing official, disorder is probable, without regard to a city's ability to prevent or suppress the disorder, is void per se.
As a practical matter a city has a virtual monopoly
of every open space at which a considerable outdoor meeting can be held, and if its streets and parks may be entirely
closed to such meetings, the practical result would be to
abolish them.
A statesmanlike and workable approach would be to
regard the availability of streets and parks as but two
parts of a single problem which should be handled as a
unit. This problem is that of reconciling the city's function of providing for the exigencies of traffic in its streets
and for the recreation of the public in its parks, with its
other basic obligation to provide adequate places for public
discussion in order to safeguard the guaranteed right of
public assembly.

HAGUE v. C. I. 0.
307 U. S.

Argument for Amici Curiae.

It would seem that if a city adopted the policy of providing an adequate number of places similar to Hyde
Park in London, to be used exclusively for outdoor meetings, it might constitutionally close both its streets and
ordinary parks to such meetings if, in the judgment of the
city authorities, the requirements of traffic and recreation
made this advisable. It is true that under usual conditions in an average large city it is perfectly feasible to
find some suitable places for meetings even in streets; yet
it is conceivable that under extraordinary conditions, the
necessities of traffic would make all the streets unsuitable,
at least temporarily. In another city it might be that
the parks are unsuitable under certain- conditions and at
particular times, while proper places for meetings could
readily be provided in squares or wide streets. It may
well develop that the most feasible solution of this problem in many cities will be the establishment of "Hyde
Parks" of sufficient number and so located as to provide
effectively for free outdoor public discussion.
The sound constitutional doctrine which should control
this problem is that a city must in some adequate manner
provide places on its property for public meetings--as distinguished from a more rigid doctrine that would compel
both its streets and its ordinary parks to be made available. Under such a doctrine, the basic constitutional requirement of protecting freedom of assembly would be
fulfilled, but without imposing rigid specific requirements
as to either streets or parks that might in practice prove
difficult or unworkable.
Thus, while we stress the vital importance of upholding the principle that a city must safeguard the right of
assembly in open-air meetings, we also suggest that in
respect of ways and means to that end, the rule should
be reasonably flexible.
Davis v. Massachusetts, 167 U. S. 43, relied upon by
defendants, is distinguishable in respect of its facts and

the issue involved. Moreover, its rationale is incompatible with more recent decisions of this Court. A city does
not control its parks like a private owner of property, but
holds them for public purposes including public meetings.
The right of a city in respect of its parks resembles other
governmental rights in that it must be administered for
the benefit of the public and not in an arbitrary manner.
There are many different kinds of public benefits to be
derived from parks, and one of the most important is the
constitutional right of assembly therein. The parks are
held by the city subject to this right. It can be regulated
in a reasonable manner; it must not be denied.
