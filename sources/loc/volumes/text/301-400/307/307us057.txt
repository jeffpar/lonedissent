Statement of the Case.

If the penalty is imposed for marketing in interstate
commerce, it is a regulation not authorized by the commerce clause.
To impose penalties for marketing in excess of quotas
not disclosed before planting and cultivation is to deprive
plaintiffs of their liberty and property without due process
of law.
The judgment of the district court should be reversed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

JUSTICE

BLACK

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The sole question is whether proceeds of a War Risk
Insurance policy payable to a deceased veteran's widow
were properly included in his gross estate under a federal
estate tax.
The federal estate tax in question 1 included in a decedent's gross estate the amount in excess of forty thousand dollars received by "beneficiaries [other than his
estate] as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life." This veteran's total life insurance for beneficiaries other than his estate exceeded
at death the statutory exemption of forty thousand dollars, if his War Risk Insurance policy payable to his widow
in the sum of ten thousand dollars is included. The
Commissioner assessed an estate tax measured by this
excess. As decedent's executor, petitioner claimed that
proceeds of the War Risk Insurance policy could not be
included in the estate because of ยง 22 of the World War
Veterans' Act, 1924, providing that such "insurance . . .
shall be exempt from all taxation." 2 The Board of Tax
Appeals upheld the determination of the Commissioner,
and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.'

U. S. TRUST CO. v. HELVERING.
Opinion of the Court.

57

Congress has manifested a consistent policy in the
Revenue Acts from 1918 to 1934, when the veteran died,
by impositions of estate taxes upon transfers at death of
proceeds of all life insurance (not payable to an insured's
estate) in excess of forty thousand dollars. This has
been in harmony with a general plan of graduating income and inheritance taxes to accord with the respective
sizes of incomes and estates. 4 And the Treasury Regulations have stated that "The statute provides for the inclusion in the gross estate of . . . All insurance [not for
the benefit of an estate] . . to the extent that it
exceeds . . forty thousand dollars . . The term
'insurance' refers to life insurance of every description,

. . ."

But petitioner invokes the provision of the World War
Veterans' Act, 1924, that insurance thereunder "shall be
exempt from all taxation." An amendment to that Act
of August 12, 1935 provides that "Payments of benefits
due or to become due . . . shall be exempt from taxation . .. " However, this amendment served only to
clarify the original provision for exemption, without
more." Unless resort is had to enlargement by implication, this exemption means only that the proceeds or
benefits of a War Risk policy are exempt from taxation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

307 U. S.

Exemptions from taxation do not rest upon implication.8
An estate tax is not levied upon the property of which
an estate is composed. It is an excise imposed upon the
transfer of or shifting in relationships to property at
death.9 The tax here is no less an estate tax because
the proceeds of the policy were paid by the Government
directly to the beneficiary; the taxing power was nevertheless exercised upon "the transfer of property procured
through expenditures by the decedent with the purpose,
effected at his death, of having it pass to another." 1o In
an analogous situation, federal bonds exempt by statute
from all taxation have been held subject to a federal inheritance tax."t And state inheritance taxes can be measured by the value of federal bonds exempted by statute
from state taxation in any form. 2 Similarly, the statutory immunity of War Risk Insurance from taxation does
not include an immunity from excises upon the occasion
of shifts of economic interests brought about by the death
of an insured.
Petitioner makes the further point that the inclusion
of 'proceeds of the War Risk policy for purposes of an
estate tax amounts to an impairment of the Government's
contract with the insured veteran, in violation of the
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. But neither the
Act of 1924, as amended, nor any of the provisions of
the War Risk Insurance Act purported to exempt War
Risk Insurance from death duties. Therefore, no statuRapid Transit Corp. v. New York, 303 U. S. 573, 592, 593; Trotter

McCRONE v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 660.

Argued March 30, 1939.-Decided April 17, 1939.

1. Contempt of an order of the District Court, issued upon the application of an agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and
requiring the person cited to appear and testify before such official
in a lawful investigation of the tax liability of another, was a
civil contempt; and a judgment that the contemnor be held in
jail until he purged himself of the contempt was appealable only
in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions governing
appeals from judgments in civil cases. P. 64.
2. An appeal from such a judgment of contempt, which was not applied for or allowed by the trial judge or a judge of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, as required by the applicable statutory provisions, was properly dismissed by the appellate court for want of
jurisdiction. P. 65.
3. A contempt arising out of a proceeding to which the United States
or its agents are parties is not necessarily a criminal contempt.
P. 63.
4. Rule 73 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, governing appeals to the
Circuit Court of Appeals, is inapplicable to a proceeding in respect
of which the statutory time allowed for appeal had expired without
application prior to the effective date of the Rules. Such a proceeding was not "pending" within the meaning of Rule 86. P. 65.
