NEWARK FIRE INS. CO. v. STATE BOARD. 313

Syllabus.

This holding can be brought within the rule of the
Big Vein Coal Company case, supra, if that decision is
narrowly limited. For in one sense it can be said that
attachment or garnishment is here used only as an "auxiliary remedy." Id., p. 37. The garnishment effected
under the affidavit of February 17, 1936, if valid under
Ohio law, would merely extend the proceedings in rem
to reach other property of the same defendant. Accordingly, if that extension is permissible under § 915, it is
not defective merely because jurisdiction in personam
is absent. Whether or not such extension is permissible
is a matter of state law on which we do not pass. Since
the case will be remanded, that question and other questions raised by the respondent can be more appropriately
disposed of by the District Court.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for
further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
Judgment reversed.

CHIEF JUSTICE,

The controversy in No. 449 relates to the jurisdiction
of New Jersey to tax the appellant upon the full amount
of its capital stock paid in and accumulated surplus.
The case is here by appeal under § 237 (a) of the Judicial
Code.'
Chapter 236 of the Laws of 1918 2 is a general act for
the assessment and collection of taxes. Section 202 subjects all real and personal property within the jurisdiction of New Jersey to taxation annually at its true value.
By § 301 the tax on other than tangible personal property
is assessed on each inhabitant in the taxing district of
his residence on the first day of October in each year.
Section 305 deals with domestic corporations as residents
of the district in which their chief office is located and
renders their personal property taxable in the same manner as that of individuals, except as otherwise provided.
Section 307, the most vital in the case, provides:
"Every fire insurance company and every stock insurance company other than life insurance shall be assessed in the taxing district where its office is situate,
upon the full amount of its capital stock paid in and accumulated surplus; . . . no franchise tax shall be imposed upon any such fire insurance company or other
stock insurance company included in this section."

Opinion of

REED, J.

307 U. S.

The appellant is a stock fire insurance corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey which at the time
of this assessment required it to locate its principal office
and to conduct its general business in the state.3 It is
stipulated that a registered office is maintained in Newark,
New Jersey, together with such books as the law requires
to be kept within the state. The only business carried
on in this Newark office is a local or regional claim and
underwriting department for Essex and three other counties. No executive officer is there and reports are sent to
the New York office. The stipulation further shows that
the company's "executive officers and its executive office
are located at 150 William Street, New York City. The
general accounts of the company are kept in the office
in New York City. The general accounting, underwriting
and executive offices of the company are all located at
the main office at 150 William Street, New York City.
All cash and securities of the company are located there
or in banks in that City or in other banks outside of the
State of New Jersey, with the exception of the sum of
$6,425.32 on deposit in New Jersey banks. All of the
general affairs of the company are conducted at the main
office in New York City and have been so conducted there
since appellant moved its main office from Newark six
years ago." No personal property tax is paid in New
York. The company does pay there a franchise tax
based upon premiums.
The Board of Assessment of the City of Newark made
an assessment, as of October 1, 1934, upon the capital
stock paid in and accumulated surplus of the appellant,
with deductions for debts and exemptions allowed by
law. The assessment was sustained, in succession, by the
N. J. Laws 1902, c. 134, § 3, second, 408; N. J. Laws 1929, c. 6,
§ 3, second, p. 18, and c. 47, § 1, p. 82. By c. 164 of N. J. Laws
1937, this was amended to read that the certificate of incorporation must set forth "the place where the principal office of the said
company in this State is to be located."

Opinion of

REED, J.

Essex County Board of Taxation, by the New Jersey
State Board of Tax Appeals, now an appellee, by the
Supreme Court,4 and by the Court of Errors and Appeals,
the highest court in the state.' Throughout the proceedings below the appellant resisted the jurisdiction of New
Jersey to tax on the ground that its intangibles had acquired a business situs and the corporation a tax domicile
in New York. Throughout, the state tribunals treated
the assessment as upon personal property with a business situs in the sister state. The Supreme Court characterized the exaction as a personal property tax and
discussed its validity "in the light of the proofs ... upon
the inescapable premise that . . . the securities, the
personalty involved, have become an integral part of
[appellant's] business situs in New York ... 6 It held
that the state of domicile may impose a personal property
tax upon intangibles which have acquired a business situs
in another state and added that, in the absence of a New
York personal property tax, multiple taxation was impossible. The Court of Errors and Appeals of New
Jersey, per curiam, affirmed the judgment for the reasons
expressed in the opinion of the Supreme Court.7
Appellant urges error in sustaining the assessment in
the face of the conclusion that the tax is a property tax
upon intangibles with a business situs in New York, the
commercial domicile of the corporation. Such approval,
it is claimed, violates the due process clause of the 14th
Amendment.
The present tax, as administered, is levied upon an
assessment of the full amount of capital stock and surplus. It is a tax on the net value of the corporation less
allowable deductions, reached by taking liabilities from
gross value of assets and subtracting exempt items from

the remainder. This is apparently because capital stock
and surplus are treated as invested in the exempt assets.8
The value thus assessed is not determined by specific
items but is the result of a calculation in which all assets
are involved except those definitely exempted. Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to resolve doubts as to
whether this is a property tax.
When a state exercises its sovereign power to create a
private corporation, that corporation becomes a citizen,
and domiciled in the jurisdiction, of its creator.9 There
it must dwell.1" The dominion of the state over its
creature is complete. 1 In accordance with the ordinary
recognition of the rule of mobilia sequuntur personam
2
to determine the taxable situs of intangible personalty,
the presumption is that such property is taxable by the
state of the corporation's origin. 3 This power of New
Jersey to tax is made effective by § 307 of the Act of 1918,
heretofore quoted. It is the only tax sought by the state
from corporations of this type, as the franchise tax, at

Opinion

319

of REED, J.

There are occasions, however, when the use of intangible
personalty in other states becomes so inextricably a part
of the business there conducted that it becomes subject
to taxation by that state.16 The carrying on of the business of the corporation in New York, it is urged, has withdrawn its intangibles completely from the tax jurisdiction
of New Jersey. With the assumption of a business situs
and commercial domicile in New York, that state, under
the authorities cited, would have the right to tax intangibles with this relation to its sovereignty. Appellant
contends that if New York may levy a property tax on
these intangibles, it will violate the due process clause
of the 14th Amendment to permit New Jersey to do the
same thing; that property cannot be in two places; that
if it is in New York for tax purposes, it cannot be in New
Jersey. We are asked to decide that both states have not
the power to tax the same property for the same incidents. This question has been heretofore reserved.
We do not find it necessary to answer it in this case.
Where consideration has been given to the existence
of a business situs of intangibles for taxation by a state
other than the state of domicile, there has been definite
evidence that the intangibles were integral parts of the
business conducted. In so far as the conclusion as to the
existence of a business situs for the purpose of taxation,
distinct from the domiciliary situs, is the basis for a
claim of a federal right,, the duty of inquiring into the

evidence which establishes such business situs rests upon
this Court. 8
In the Stempel, Bristol, Comptoir National, Metropoli-

tan and Liverpool cases, cited in note 16, supra, the integration of the foreign-owned intangibles with local activities was evident from the continued course of business.
The presence or absence of the evidences of the credits
from the jurisdiction was immaterial."9 The non-resident
individuals and corporations carried on continuously a
course of lending money or granting credits within the
taxing states. The taxed intangibles grew out of these
transactions. They were, in fact, a part of them. In the
Wheeling Steel case, the same type of amalgamation occurred. West Virginia sought to tax a Delaware corporation on accounts receivable and bank deposits. The
opinion points out, pages 212 and 213, that these choses
in action were the indebtedness for or the proceeds of
sales confirmed in West Virginia, attributable "to the
place where they arise in the course of the business of
making contracts of sale." In First Bank Stock Corp. v.
Minnesota another Delaware corporation was found to
have established a commercial domicile for itself and
given a business situs to certain of its intangibles. The
intangibles in question were stocks of Montana and North
Dakota state banks, purchased and held as part of the
corporation's assets in its Minnesota business of holding
the shares and managing, through stock ownership, the
business of numerous banks, trust companies and other
financial institutions of the Ninth Federal Reserve District. As this business was localized in Minnesota, the
stocks of these banks were an essential factor of that business and therefore had a taxable situs in Minnesota.

J.

The conception of a business situs for intangibles enables the tax gathering entity to distribute the burden
of its support equitably among those receiving its protection. It makes the notion of a tax situs for particular
intangibles more definite. It is not the substitution of
a new fiction as to the mass of choses in action for the
established fiction of a tax situs at the place of incorporation. To overcome the presumption of domiciliary location, the proof of business situs must definitely connect
the intangibles as an integral part of the local activity.
The facts presented by this record fall far short of this
requirement.
The tax is upon "the full amount of capital stock ,and
surplus" less certain allowed deductions of real estate and
exempt securities. The evidence gives no explanation
of the amount or source of the assets making up the
amount $3,370,080.66 which balances with the capital
stock and surplus less these deductions. The stipulation
shows "agreed" figures, $8,107,901.83 presumably of capital and surplus, as shown below. 0 Agreed deductions are

$4,737,821.17. But the assessment is $1,069,000. From
the stipulation, we learn the "general accounts" are kept
in New York City and all cash except $6,425.32 and all
securities are located at the New York office or in banks
outside of New Jersey. If we assume that the "general
accounts" mentioned are the company's claims against
agents, other insurance companies, and similar bills receivable, no progress is made towards their identification
with New York business. Nothing is shown as to the
volume of New York business in comparison with New
Jersey or the other states. We are not told where business is accepted, moneys collected or insurance contracts
made. The securities may represent local loans or investments in New Jersey or elsewhere made from funds
derived from similar insurance contracts with a business
situs at those points.2' They may be the result of insurance activities of many kinds, taking place far from New
York. If we were to assume that the intangibles of a
corporation may have only one taxable situs, the mere
fact that general affairs of a foreign corporation are conducted by general officers in New York without further
evidence of the source and character of the intangibles
does not destroy the taxability of a part of these intangibles by the state of the corporation's legal domicile. The
presumption of a taxable situs solely in New Jersey is not
overturned.
Universal Insurance Company and Universal Indemnity Insurance Company have appeals involving the
same questions. By stipulation these cases were consolidated for review below and appeal here.
agency balances an asset, and the reserve for taxes a liability which
is deductible. Nothing was said about the reserve for contingencies.
Addition of the items known to constitute assets--capital stock, surplus, reserve for unearned premiums, reserve for reinsurance, agency
balances-equals $8,107,901.83.

These appellants are New Jersey insurance corporations, assessed by the City of Newark in the same way,
under the same statute and with the same result in the
state courts as the appellant in No. 449.
There are no significant distinctions between the cases.
A management corporation handles these companies at a
New York office, where accounts are payable. Seven per
cent of the business of Universal Insurance Company
originates in New Jersey. The corresponding percentage
for the other company is not shown. As in No. 449,
the record is silent as to the character, source and use
of the securities and credits.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER announced the following
opinion, concurred in by MR. JUSTICE STONE, MR. JUSTICE
BLACK,

and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.

Wise tax policy is one thing; constitutional prohibition
quite another. The task of devising means for distributing the burdens of taxation equitably has always challenged the wisdom of the wisest financial statesmen.
Never has this been more true than today when wealth
has so largely become the capitalization of expectancies
derived from a complicated network of human relations.
The adjustment of such relationships, with due regard to
the promotion of enterprise and to the fiscal needs of
different governments with which these relations are entwined, is peculiarly a phase of empirical legislation.
It belongs to that range of the experimental activities
of government' which should not be constrained by rigid
1 Compare

Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 226:, "The science

of government is the most abstruse of all sciences; if, indeed, that
can be called a science which has but few fixed principles, and
practically consists in little more than the exercise of a sound discretion, applied to the exigencies of the state as they arise. It is
the science of experiment."

and artificial legal concepts. Especially important is it
to abstain from intervention within the autonomous
area of the legislative taxing power where there is no
claim of encroachment by the states upon powers granted
to the National Government. It is not for us to sit in
judgment on attempts by the states to evolve fair tax
policies. When a tax appropriately challenged before us
is not found to be in plain violation of the Constitution
our task is ended.
Chapter 236 of the New Jersey Laws of 1918, as applied to the circumstances of these two cases, clearly
does not offend the Constitution. In substance, such
legislation has heretofore been found free from constitutional infirmity. Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks,
253 U: S. 325, affirming 41 N. Dak. 330; 170 N. W. 863.
During all the vicissitudes which the so-called "jurisdiction-to-.tax" doctrine has encountered since that case was
decided, the extent of a state's taxing power over a corporation of its own creation, recognized in the Cream of
Wheat case, has neither been restricted nor impaired.
That case has not been cited otherwise than with approval.2 Questions affecting the fictional "situs" of intangibles, which received full consideration in Curry v.
McCanless, post, p. 357, do not concern the present controversies. Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks, supra,
and the cases that have followed it, afford a wholly
adequate basis for affirming the judgments below.
