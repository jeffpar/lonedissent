LOWE BROTHERS CO. v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 864. Argued April 29, 1938.-Decided May 16, 1938.
1. Under Jud. Code § 24 (20), as aiended, a suit against the United
States to recover internal revenue taxes wrongfully collected, in
excess of $10,000, will not lie in the District Court unless the overpayment was collected by a collector who could have been sued
personally but who, when the proceeding began, was dead or out
of office. P. 304.
2. Where the claim against the United States was for an overpayment
for 1917, more than $10,000, alleged to have resulted from the
action of the Commissioner in crediting against a barred deficiency
of that year an overpayment for 1918-held that the suit would
not lie in the District Court under Jud. Code § 24 (20) as amended,
"
Ithe action of the Commissioner, if a collection, was not the
action of the collector and occurred in a later year in which no
overpayment was made. P. 306.
3. Application of an overpayment to an earlier deficiency is effected
through the Commissioner's approval of the schedule of overpayments. The certification of the overpayment by the collector to
the Commissioner, a mere niinisterial act, could subject the collector
to no personal liability. Id.
92 F. 2d 905, affirmed.

Key were on the brief, for the United States.

LOWE BROS. CO. v. U. S.
302

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question for decision is whether the district courts
of the United States have jurisdiction, under § 24 (20)
of the Judicial Code, of a suit brought against the United
States to recover income and excess profits taxes in an
amount in excess of $10,000 when the recovery sought is
of an overpayment of taxes for one year, effected by
crediting against a barred deficiency for that year an overpayment for another year.
Petitioner' overpaid income and excess profits taxes
for 1918. The commissioner, on May 15, 1924, signed
a schedule of overpayments by which he approved a credit
as of April 24, 1924 of a part of the 1918 overpayment,
in an amount exceeding $10,000, against a tax deficiency
of petitioner for 1917, the collection of which was then
barred by the statute of limitations. The collector in
office in 1924, when the credit was allowed, having retired, petitioner brought the present suit against the
United States, in the district court of southern Ohio, to
recover the amount of the credit. The petition alleges
overpayment of the 1917 tax by reason of the credit, and
demands its recovery. Petitioner has neither alleged nor
proved any claim for refund of the 1918 overpayment,
recovery of which, without such claim, was barred by
limitation.
The trial court, construing the suit as one to recover
an overpayment of 1917 taxes, as petitioner conceded in
open court, gave judgment dismissing the petition on the
ground that the credit of the 1918 overpayment upon
the barred deficiency for 1917 was not a payment of the
'As petitioner stands in the place of its corporate predecessor by
virtue of a merger, and as their rights and interests in the present
suit may be treated as identical, both will be referred to as

1917 tax since the credit is "'void" under the applicable
sections, 607 and 609, of the Revenue Act of 1928. The
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed on a dif-

ferent ground, holding that the district court was without
jurisdiction, under the provisions of § 24 (20) of the
Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 41 (20), which confers jurisdiction on the district court of suits against the United
States to recover taxes erroneously assessed or collected
in excess of $10,000, only if the collector by whom the
tax was collected is dead or is not in office when the suit
is brought. 92 F. 2d 905. We granted certiorari, upon
a petition presenting the single question of the jurisdiction of the district court, in order to resolve an asserted
conflict between the decision below and that of the Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in United States v.
Piedmont Mfg. Co., 89 F. 2d 296.
The Court of Appeals, following United States v.
Piedmont Mfg. Co., supra, and its own decision in United
States v. John GallagherCo., 83'F. 2d 368, thought that
the credit of the 1918 overpayment of the 1917 tax was
not void, but voidable only at the election of the taxpayer and was consequently an overpayment of 1917
taxes for which recovery might be had in a court having
jurisdiction. But following its own decision in United
States v. Reeves Bros. Co., 83 F. 2d 121, and that of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Moses v.
United States, 61 F. 2d 791, it held that the district court
was without jurisdiction because the collection of the
1917 tax, effected by the allowance of the credit, was not
made by a collector and thus did not satisfy the jurisdictional requirement.
The Court of Claims has jurisdiction of suits against
the United States brought to recover internal revenue
taxes erroneously collected without regard to the amount
involved. § 145 J. C., 28 U. S. C., § 250. Before the

amendment of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 311 (continued by
Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 348, and, so far as now
material, in the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 121), § 24
(20) of the Judicial Code gave jurisdiction to the district courts, concurrent with the Court of Claims, of suits
against the United States to recover "claims not exceeding ten-thousand dollars founded upon . . .any law of
Congress . . .or upon any contract, express or implied,
with the Government of the United States . . ." C. 231,
36 Stat. 1093. Both before and after the amendment,
district courts also had jurisdiction of suits against a collector of internal revenue brought to recover, in any
amount, internal revenue taxes which he had erroneously
collected. § 24 (5) J. C., 28 U. S. C. § 41 (5). Such
suits brought against the collector survive lhis retirement
from office and do not abate upon his death. Patton v.
Brady, 184 U. S. 608; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co.,
257 U. S.1; Union Trust Co. v. Wardell, 258 U. S.537.
By the amendment of § 24 (20) the jurisdiction of district courts was extended so as to embrace suits against
the United States to recover taxes "even if the claim exceeds $10,000, if the collector of internal revenue by whom
such tax . .. was collected is dead or is not in office as
collector of internal revenue at the time such suit c.,
proceeding is commenced." Since the suit allowed against
the collector before the amendment was based on his. personal liability, Sage v. United States, 250 U. S.33; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., supra, no such suit will lie
unless he has collected the tax. The obvious purpose of
the amendment was to permit a substitution of a suit
against the United States for the suit previously allowed
against the collector whenever the amount claimed exceeds $10,000 and the collector is out of office. This is
made evident by the words of the amendment which authorize the substitution only when the collection is made
by the collector when in office.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

304 U. S.

As we think it plain that no suit could have been maintained against the collector to recover the alleged overpayment, it follows that the district court was without
jurisdiction to entertain the present suit. If the 1917 tax
can be said to have been collected at all, as to which we
express no opinion, it was collected by the action of the
commissioner in crediting against the 1917 deficiency the
1918 overpayment. In 1924, the year of the claimed overpayment, the collector received no overpayment of petitioner's tax for any year. If the 1917 taxes were then
collected it was by virtue of the application to the 1917
deficiency of moneys already in the treasury. The collector was without authority to make such application.
It was the commissioner's approval of the schedule of
overpayments which was effective for that purpose.
Girard Trust Co. v. United States, 270 U. S. 163, 170, 171;
United States v. Swift & Co., 282 U. S. 468. The certification of the overpayment by the collector to the commissioner, a mere ministerial act, could subject the
collector to no personal liability.
It is true that under the statutep of the United States
the collector is relieved from personal liability except in
the case where the district court is of opinion that he
acted without probable cause, Sage V. United States, supra,
37, and that such suits against the collector are commonly but a means of collecting the overpayment from
the United States. Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289
U. S. 373, 382. But no statute has enlarged the collector's common law liability to suit, and we cannot ignore
the words of the amendment of § 24 (20) which, in providing for a suit against the United States in lieu of one
against the collector, make collection by him the sine
qua non of jurisdiction.
Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, 282 U. S.409, did not
deal with the point here considered. The o.nly one of the
several cases decided there involving a credit of an over-

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIANA.

No. 641.

Argued March 30, 31, 1938.-Decided May 16, 1938.

1. Indiana Gross Income Tax Act of 1933 imposes a tax upon
gross receipts from commerce. P. 309.
2. It can not constitutionally be applied to the gross receipts derived by an Indiana corporation from sales in other States of
goods manufactured by it in Indiana. P. 311.
3. The Indiana Act of Mar. 9, 1903, which declared "that all bonds,
notes and other evidences of indebtedness hereafter issued by the
State of Indiana or by municipal corporations within the State
upon which the said State or the said municipal corporations
pay interest shall be exempt from taxation," is considered in
connection with other provisions with which it is associated in
the codification of March 11, 1919, and with regard to the fact
that the State had no income tax law. So considering it, the
construction adopted by the Supreme Court of Indiana confining the exemption to taxation ad valorem is not plainly wrong;
consequently, the claim that to include the interest from such
obligations in a tax on gross receipts would impair the contract
rights of those who bought in rcliance on the exemption, must
fail. P. 314.
212 Ind. 343; 7 N. E. 2d 941, affirmed in part; reversed in part.

declaring a taxing Act unconstitutional in certain parts,
