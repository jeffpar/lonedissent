HELVERING v. NATIONAL GROCERY CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 723.

Argued April 8, 11, 1938.-Decided May 16, 1938.

Section 104 of the Revenue Act of 1928 provides that if any corporation, however created or organized, is formed or availed of for
the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its
shareholders through the medium of permitting its gains and profits
to accumulafe instead of being divided or distributed, there shall
be levied, collected and paid for each' taxable year upon the net
income of such corporation an additional tax equal to 50 per centum
of the amount of such income, and that the fact that the gains
or profits are permitted to accumulate beyond the, reasonable needs
of the business, shall be prima facie evidence of a purpose to escape
the surtax. From the evidence before it, the Board of Tax Appeals
found that the respondent's accumulations in a taxable year were
,beyond such needs; that the evidence did not overcome the presumption, and that the corporition was availed of for the interdicted purpose. The corporation had-but one stockholder, so that
rights of minority stockholders were not involved. Held:
(1) The Act does not violate the Tenth Amendment by interfering with the right of the corporation to declare or withhold
dividends. It merely lays the tax upon corporations that use their
powers to prevent imposition upon their stockholders of the
federt surtaxes. P. 286.
(2) The Act is not unconstitutional as imposing, not a tax ujion
income, but a penalty to force distribution of corporate earnings
in order to create a basis for taxation against stockholders. P. 288.
. Congress may impose penaltiesin protection of the revenue.
.Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391.
(3) The tax is not objectionable as a direct tax on a mere
purpose-a state of mind. P. 289.
It is a tax on the income of tl'e corporation. The existence of
the defined purpose merely determines the incidence of the tax.
(4) The standard prescribed to guide the Commissioner in
assessing, or the corporate directors in avoiding, the additional
tax, is not too vague. P. 289.
(5) The retroactive assessment is not constitutionally objectionable. P. 290.

Opinion of the Court.

(6) The statute does not delegate legislative power to the Commissioner. P. 290.
(7) Depreciation in any of the assets is evidence to be considered by the Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals in
determining the issue of fact whether the accumulation of profits
was in excess of the reasonable needs of the business. But depreciation in the market value of securities which the corporation
continues to hold does not, as matter of law, preclude a finding
that the accumulation of the year's profits was in excess. of the
reasonable needs of the business. P. 291.
(8) The evidence in this case supports the findings of the
Board of Tax Appeals that the accumulation of a huge surplus
by the taxpayer-a chain grocery company-was not with a
purpose of providing for the expansion of the business, but to
enable the sole stockholder to escape surtaxes. P. 291.
(9) To weigh the evidence, draw inferences from it and declare the result is a function of the Board of Tax Appeals not
subject to' review by the Circuit Court of Appeals. P. 294.

CERTIORARI, 303 U. S. 630, to review a judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals which overruled a decision of
the Board of Tax Appeals, 35 B. T. A. 163, 'sustaining a
deficiency income tax assessment.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.

National Grocery Company is a New Jersey corporation, which operates chain stores. Since 1911 it has had

$200,000 capital stock, all owned beneficially by Henry
Kohl. In the year ending January 31, 1931, the corporation's books showed a net profit of $682,850.38, after
paying $104,000 to Kohl as salary and the regular federal

corporation income tax of '? per cent. Its surplus, as
shown by its books, increased during the year from
$7,245,824.26 to $7,938,965.54; tliat is $693,141.28. It
paid no dividend.
Section 104 of the Revenue Act- of 1928, c. 852, 45
Stat. 814, provides:
"(a) If any corporation, however created or organized,
is formed or availed of for the purpose of preventing the
imposition of the surtax upon its shareholders through
the medium of permitting its gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed, there shall
be levied, collected and paid for each taxable year upon
the net income of such corporation a tax equal to 50 per
centum of the amount thereof, which shall be in addition to the tax imposed by section 13 ...
"(b) The fact . . . that the gains or profits are permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the
business, shall be prima facie evidence of a purpose to
escape the surtax."
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, having found
that the corporation had been availed of for the purpose
of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon Kohl by
permitting the gains and profits to accumulate, assessed
upon it, under ยง 104, a deficiency tax of $477,322.81 for
the tax year, in addition to the regular corporation income tax, which had been paid. This amount, together
with $37.87 admittedly due, constitutes the total deficiency assessment of $477,360.68.
The corporation petitioned for a redetermination by
the Board of Tax Appeals. Before the Board a large
volume of evidence was introduced which had not been
submitted to the Commissioner. It detailed, among other
things, the financial history 'f the business from its inception. There were 35 elaborate exhibits, many of them
prepared from the books with the co-operation of the
counsel for the corporation and for the Commissioner.

HELVERING v. NAT. GROCERY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Twenty-four of the exhibits were introduced by the taxpayer; eleven by. the Commissioner. The taxpayer also
presented as witnesses Kohl and the treasurer of the
corporation, who testified orally to the history of tho business, its practices and aims; local bank officials who testified as experts to the wisdom of accumulating the profits;
and other experts who testified to the depreciation in 1930
of the market value of the securities held by the corpor2tion and of its real estate. The Board, by a bare majority,"
sustained the Commissioner's determination. In stating
its conclusions, it found as follows:
"We find as a fact that the petitioner's accumulation of
earnings was far in excess of the 'reasonable needs' of the
corporate business.
"We are also of opinion that the evidence of record does
not rebut the -prima facie presumption created by the
statute that the accumulation of earnings beyond the 'reasonable needs of the business' was for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its sole stockholder. ....

"Upon the evidence before us we have made the finding
that the petitioner was 'availed of' during the fiscal year
ended January 31, 1931, for the purpose of preventing the
imposition of the surtax upon its sole stockholder 'through
the medium of permitting its gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.' "
The corporation then petitioned for a review by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. it reversed the order of the
Board; and did so on the ground that there was before the
Board "no proof, substantial or otherwise, to support its
imposition of" the tax. Certiorari was sought by the
'Mr. Mellott, who stated the views of the minority, said: "This
being a 'fact case', it is with some reluctance that I reach a conclusion
at variance with that of the Member who heard the testimony of
the witnesses and had the advantage of observing their manner and
demeanor while testifying. .. "

Commissioner, who urged that in so deciding the court
had departed from the accepted and usual lourse of'judicial. proceedings. We granted certiorari because of the
importance in the administration of the revenue laws of
the matter presented.
The corporation makes here two contentions in support
of the judgment which were not discussed by the Court
of Appeals. It ehallenges the constitutionality of the
statute and also urges that in holding that there were
"gains and profits" the Commissioner and the Board of
Tax Appeals misconstrued the statuite. These contentions
will be considered before examining the alleged lack of
evidence to support the findings of the Board.
First. The National Grocery Company concedes that
ยง 104 is constitutional as applied to a corporation organized for the purpose of preventing the imposition of
surtaxes upon its shareholders ;2 but urges five reasons
why it should be held void as applied to alegitimate business corporation which is "availed of" for the forbidden
purpose. None'of tfiese reasons is sound.
1: It 'is
said that the statute violates the Tenth Amendment because it interferes with the power to declare or'
to withhold dividends--a power which the State conferred
upon the corporation. The statute in no way limits the
powers of the corporation. It merely, lays the tax upon
corporations which use their powers to prevent imposition upon their stockholders of the federal surtaxes.

feat obstructions to that incidence of taxes which it
chooses to impose." United Business Corp. v. Commissioner, 62 F. 2d 754, 756.
Kohl's personal income tax for the calendar year 1931

was $32,034.74. If he had included in his personal return
of taxable income the corporation's entire net income for
the fiscal year 1930-1931, an additional tax upon him of

over $115,000 would have been due; 8 and no tax would

have been assessable against the corporation under ยง 104.
For the statute expressly provides, in paragraph (d), that

the corporation shall not be so taxed, if the stockholders

amount so included in the gross income of a shareholder

distribution made by the corporation out of the earnings

or profits for such taxable year shall, if distributed to any
shareholder who has so included in his gross inconme his
distributive share, be exempt from tax in the amount of

the share so included."
'It is not possible to calculate what Kohl's exact additional surtax
liability would have been had he included the corporation's income
for 1930-1931 in his personal return for 1931, since that r(turn is
not in evidence. A minimum figure, however, may be obtainel. The
corporation's "net income," as defined in ยง 104, was $954,645.62.
There must be deducted from this $103,654.47 for corporation income
tax; and $100,000 was distributed as a dividend in 1931 and included
in computing the tax paid by Kohl in that year. Even assum ng that
the remaining $750,991.15 would have constituted his entire net income for 1931, and that the maximum deduction of 15% of this
amount for charitable, contributims could have been taken, a surtax
of $119,328.50 would have been due.

2. It is said that the statute is unconstitutional because
the liability imposed is not a tax upon income, but a penalty designed to force corporations to distribute earnings
in order to create a basis for taxation against the stockholders. If the business had been carried on by Kohl individually all the year's profits would have been taxable to
him. If, having a partner, the business had been carried
on as a partnership, all the year's profits would have been
taxable to the partners individually, although these had
been retained by the partnership undistributed. See
Heinerv. Mellon, ante, p. 271. Kohl, the sole owner of the
business, could not by conducting it as a corporation, prevent Congress, if it chose to do so, from laying on him
individually the tax on the year's profits.' If it preferred;
Congress could lay the tax upon the corporation, as was
done by ยง 104. The penal nature of the imposition does
'The first statute which provided for taxation where corporate
profits are accumulated for the purpose of preventing the imposition
of surtaxes upon stockholders was the Tariff Act of 1913, ยง 2A,
subdiv. 1, 38 Stat. 166. In that Act, in the Revenue Act of 1916, ยง 3,
39 Stat. 758, and in the Revenue Act of 1918, ยง 220, 40 Stat. 1072,
the tax was laid upon the shareholder. In all later Revenue Acts,
the tax is laid upon the corporation. 1921 Act, ยง 220, 42 Stat. 247;

The Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921, ยงยง 218 (e) and 218 (d), respectively, also taxed the shareholders of "personal service corporations" like partners. Section 112 (k) of the Revenue Act of 1932
and ยง 112 (i) of the Acts of 1934 and 1936 provide for the disregard
of the corporate entity in certain cases where foreign corporations
are used for the purpose of avoiding federal taxes. And ยง 201 of
the Revenue Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 818, provides that the adjusted
undistributed net income of foreign personal holding companies must
be included in the gross income of their United States shareholders.

not prevent its being valid, as the tax was otherwise permissible under the Constitution. Compare Helvering v.
Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391.
3. It -is said that ยง 104 is unconstitutional because the
liability is laid upon the mere purpose to prevent imposition of the surtaxes, not upon the accomplishment of that
purpose, and that, thus, it is a direct tax on the state of
mind. But this is not so. The tax is laid "upon the net
income of such corporation." The existence of the defined purpose is a condition precedent to the imposition of
the tax liability, but this does not prevent it from being
a true income tax within the meaning of the Sixteenth
Amendment. The instances are many in which purpose
or state of mind determines the incidence of an income
tax.5

unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious in that no stand'For example, ยง 293 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1928 provides that

Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391. Whether a payment received
is compensation within ยง 22 (a) or js a gift within ยง 22 (b) (3) is
largely a matter of intention. Compare Bogardus v. Commissioner,
302 U. S. 34, 45. Similarly, the deductibility of losses under ยง 23 (e)
may depend upon whether the taxpayer's motive in entering into
the transaction was primarily profit. Compare Heiner v. Tindle, 276

ard or formula is specified to guide the Commissioner in
assessing, or the corporate directors in avoiding, the additional tax; that it is assessed retroactively; and that it
is unfair to nuil-assenting minority stockholders. The
prescribed standard is not too vague. As Judge Learned
Hand said in United Business Corp. v. Commissioner, 62
F. 2d 754, 756:
"Standards of conduct, fixed no more definitely, are
common in the law; the whole law of torts is pervaded
by them; much of its commands are that a man must act
as the occasion demands, the standard being available to
all. The vice of fixing maximum prices is that it requires
recourse to standards beyond ascertainment by sellers, by
which therefore they cannot in practice regulate their
dealings. That is not true of the reasonable needs of a
business, which is immediately within the ken of the
managers, the supposititious standard, though indeed objective, being as accessible as those for example of the
prudent driving of a motor car, or of the diligence required
in making a ship seaworthy, or of the extent of proper
inquiry into the solvency of a debtor."
Clearly, retroactive assessment is no more objectionable
here than in the case of penalties for fraud or negligence.
Helvering v. Mitchell, supra. And since no minority stockholders are here involved, the last objection need not be
considered. Castillo v. McConnico, 168 U. S. 674, 680;
Atlantic Refining Co. v. Virginia, 302 U. S. 22, 27.
5. It is said that ยง 104 is void because it delegates to
the Commissioner legislative power. The statute provides that if the corporation is availed of for the forbidden
purpose, the tax "shall be levied, collected, and paid";
and certain facts are made prima facie evidence of the
existence of this purpose. No power is delegated to the
Commissioner save that of finding facts upon evidence.
Second. The corporation contends, as a matter of
statutory construction, that ยง 104 was not applicable

HELVERING v. NAT. GROCERY CO.
282

Opinion of the Court.

because there were no "gains and profits" within the tax
year. Conceding that net income of $863,787.22 was
earned,' it asserts that there were "no gains and profits"
because the depreciation in the securities owned, none
of which were sold, exceeded $2,000,000. The argument
is that the word "gains" was not used as synonymous
with "profits," but to express contemplated unrealized
increases or accession in net worth of the assets; and that
assessability under ยง 104 depends not upon gains or
profits-but upon the aggregate of gains (or losses) and
profits, since prudent directors would take these into consideration in determining whether a dividend should be
declared. Depreciation in any of the assets is evidence
to be considered by the Commissioner and the Board in
determining the issue of fact whether the accumulation
of profits was in excess of the reasonable needs of the
business. But obviously depreciation in the market
value of securities which the corporation continues to hold
does not, as matter of law, preclude a finding that the
accumulation of the year's profits was in excess of the
reasonable needs of the business.
Third. There was ample evidence to suppo; t the findings of the Board of Tax Appeals. The corporation held
on January 31, 1930, bonds and stocks valued at
$2,779,718.07; on January 31, 1931 it held $2,989,452.74an increase of $209,734.67. The list of these bonds and
stocks showed that they were in no way related to a
grocery business.' That there was no need of accumu"The corporation reported in its return an income of $863,471.67.
This was increased by the Commissioner to $863,787.22, and is not
now disputed.
'The stock held January 31, 1931, of the aggregate cost of
$2,676,061.47, consisted of issues of 147 different corporations. Of

lating any part of the year's earnings for the purpose of
financing the business was shown by the balance sheet.
Comparing the cash on hand with the outstanding indebtedness, it appears that the $1,332,332.28 cash on
hand January 31, 1930 exceeded the $1,161,121.96 accounts
payable, notes and mortgage, by $171,210.32. On January 31, 1931, the excess of cash over accounts payable
was $1,136,820.55. These were then only $269,140.49;
and the cash on hand was $1,405,961.04. The notes payable and the mortgage had been discharged.
That the purpose of accumulating this huge surplus
was to escape the imposition upon Kohl of surtaxes, was
indicated by the following facts. The $4,395,413.78
aggregate of bonds, stocks, and excess cash January 31,
1931, represents about four-fifths of the total accumulation of the surplus profits during the last ten years, which
amounted to $5,742,455.35.1 If the surplus profits of the
fiscal year 1930-1931 had been distributed as dividends,
thcE additional surtaxes payable thereon by Kohl in the
year 1931 would have been at least $90,744.56, and for
the preceding nine years would have aggregated

panies, 18. Of investment trusts, 13. Of banks and trust companies,

utility, industrial and miscellaneous bonds which cost $313,39127.
' The profits for these years (after deducting federal corporation
income taxes paid) are listed in note 9, infra.
"Kohl's individual returns were made on a calendar year cash
basis. For the fiscal year here in question, January 31, 1930 to January 31, 1931, the corporation's books showed a profit of $682,850.38
after deducting Kohl's salary and the 12% corporation income tax
paid. A dividend of $100,000 was paid in 1931. Had the remaining
$582,85038 been entirely distributed in that year, Kohl would have
incurred an additional surtax liability of $90,744.56, even if it be
assumed that the additional distribution would have constituted his
entire net income for that year and that the 15% maximum charitable
contributions deduction could have been taken. (It is impossible to
calculate what his exact surtax liability for 1931 would have been,

HELVERING v. NAT. GROCERY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Further evidence to support the Board's findings that
in the tax year dividends were omitted and the surplus
accumulated in order to enable Kohl to escape these surtaxes is furnished by the following facts: Kohl drew his
salary of $104,000 a year; and that sum, as an expense
of the business, was deducted before calculating the corporation's profit on which it paid taxes under ยง 13. He
needed personally further sums and took these in the
form of loans. In the tax year Kohl borrowed from the
corporation $140,000. His aggregate indebtedness on
January 31, 1931 for borrowings during seven years, was
$610,000. As was stated in UnitedBusiness Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, p. 755: "These loans are incompatible
with a purpose to strengthen the financial position of the
inasmuch as his personal return for that year is not in evidence.)
Compare note 3, supra.

Since Kohl was the sole owner of the corporation, the
business would have been as well protected against unexpected demands for capital, and assured of capital for
the purpose of any possible expansion, by his personal
ownership of the securities as by the corporation's owning
them. Moreover, no conceivable expansion could have
utilized so large a surplus.' The high taxes were first imposed in 1919.12 After that time no dividend was paid
until after the close of the taxable year here involved.
Thus, independently of the presumption prescribed in
ยง 104 (b) there was ample evidence to support the Board's
findings.
Fourth. The Court of Appeals, instead of limiting its
review to ascertaining whether there was evidence to support the Board's findings and decision, made on all the
evidence, as upon a trial de novo, in effect, an independent
determination of the matters which had been in issue before the Board. The court was without power to do so.
Helvering v. Rankin, 295 U. S. 123, 131-32. To draw
inferences, to weigh the evidence and to declare the result
was the function of the Board. Hulburd v. Commissioner,
Coifpare A. D. Saenger, Inc. v. Commissioner, 84 F. 2d 23
(C. C. A. 5); United States v. R. C. Tway Coal Co., 75 F. 2d 336,

340 (C. C. A. 6).
"In the ten years the number of stores in the chain had been increased from 358 to 815. Even on Kohl's own estimate that "including everything you have to have about $5000 per store," this expansion
could account for only $2,285,000 of the $5,742,45525 of profits
accumulated over that period.
"The Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, which was not enacted
until February 24, 1919, imposed a surtax of as much as 65% on
income in excess of $1,000,000. The maximum rate under the Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, was only 13% on income in excess of

$2,000,000.

Fifth. The court expressed the opinion -that the Board
failed to consider relevant and controlling facts, that it
relied upon improper evidence in reaching its conclusion,
and that it failed to make the findings required by the
statute. There is nothing in the record to justify that
view. The findings quoted above are specific. The Board
was not obliged to accept as true Kohl's statement of his
intention and purposes; or to accept as sound the opinion
of his experts. It was error to reverse the decision of the
Board. There is no occasion to remand the case to it for
further consideration.
Reversed.
