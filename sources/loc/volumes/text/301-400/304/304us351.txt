the parties were clearly defined and as no other detriment
or disadvantage is claimed to have ensued from the
Board's procedure the matter is not one calling for a reversal of the order. The Fifth Amendment guarantees
no particular form of procedure; it protects substantial
rights. Compare Morgan v. United States, 298 U. S. 468,
478. The contention that the respondent was denied a
full and adequate hearing must be rejected.
Ninth. The other contentions of the respondent are
overruled because foreclosed by earlier decisions of this

The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for further

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 746. Argued April 25, 1938.-Decided May 16, 193 3.

1. A decedent in her lifetime promised educational institut ons to
establish an endowment fund and to pay salaries of or hestral

musicians and a director of art.

The promises were a ;cepted

and acted upon, and under the state law were binding upon her
estate. Held that in valuing the estate for taxation under the
Revenue Act of 1926, the executor was not entitled to deduct
the amounts payable under the promises, as being claims contracted "for an adequate and full consideration in money or
money's worth," § 303 (a) (1), or as "transfers," to or for the
use of the promisee corporations, id. § 303 (a) (3). Pp. 355, 357.

2. The legislative and administrative history of § 303 (a) (1) of the
Revenue Act of 1926, shows that a promise by a decedent to
pay money to a charitable or educational institution, where the
only consideration was a stipulated application of the amount
received, does not. constitute a claim against the estate contracted
for an adequate hnd full consideration in money or money's
worth, notwithstanding the fact that under local law the promise
is enforceable. P. 355.
3. A binding promise by a decedent to pay money to a charitable
or educational institution, not attended by any allocation of funds
in decedent's lifetime, is not a "transfer" within the meaning of
§ 303 (a) (3), Revenue Act of 1926; and payment by the executor
does not make it such by relation. P. 357.
4. Only such transfers inter vivos as are testamentary in character
are deductible under subsection (3), supra. P. 358.

The question presented is whether the petitioner, as
executor, may deduct from the gross estate amounts payable pursuant to the decedent's binding promises as claims
against the estate incurred bona fide and for an adequate
and full consideration in money or money's worth within
the meaning of § 303 (a) (1)., or as transfers to charitable

Revenue Act of 1.926.' The deductions were of amounts
owing at the decedent's death upon the following contractual obligations.
By letter the decedent agreed with the University of
Cincinnati to establish a fund as a memorial to her husband, stating that she would make available to the trustees of the fund, whom she named, during the ensuing
year, $50,000, during the following year $75,000, and, in
each succeeding year, $100,000 or such other income as
might be derived from a fund of $2,000,000 which she
would ultimately transfer to the trustees. The letter
outlined the terms of the trust to which the income was
to be devoted. The offer was formally accepted by the
Board of Directors of the University and, pursuant to
the agreement, the decedent made payments to the trustees and her executor continued to pay sums on account
of interest and principal.' The University is an educational institution and no profit enures to anyone from its
operation.

Opinion of the Court.

304 U. S.

Being deeply interested in the Cincinnati Institute of
Fine Arts and its work, and having jointly with her husband and as an individual contributed large sums to this
work, the decedent, to obviate the necessity of reducing
the personnel of the orchestra the Institute conducts,
agreed with the Institute that if it would retain two
musicians she would pay their salaries under contracts
covering two years. In reliance upon her promise the
Institute re-engaged the two men. The decedent paid
the amount of their salaries prior to her death and petitioner, as executor, paid them to the end of the contract
term. The Institute would not have re-employed these
men except for the agreement. It is a charitable corporation organized for the maintenance of a symphony
orchestra and other activities, and no profit enures to
anyone from its operations.
The decedent agreed by letter addressed to the Cincinnati Institute of Fine Arts that if it would employ a
director of art she would contribute $10,000 towards his
salary. In reliance upon this undertaking the institution
engaged such a director at a salary of $10,000 per annum.
She paid the stipulated amount for one and one-half years
prior to her death and the petitioner, as executor, paid for
one year subsequent to her death. There were no available funds for the employment of a director except those
received from the decedent and the Institute would not
have employed one except for her agreement. It is an educational institution and does not operate for profit.
In 1930 the decedent agreed with the University of
Cincinnati that if it would engage a named person as professor to give a specified course of instruction she would
pay the University the amount of his salary. She had
made similar arrangements for prior years. The University employed the professor and would not have done
so except for her agreement. At the time of her death a

sum remained due according to her promise which the
petitioner paid.
The total claimed as deductible on account of these
obligations was &2.015,420. Under the law of Ohio, the
decedent's promises were and are legally binding and enforceable against her estate. The Commisioner ruled,
and the Board 2 and the court below 8 have held, that
the estate's obligations in question, though contracted
bona fide, were not incurred for an adequate and full con'ideration in money or money's worth as required by
clause (1), and payments of the sums promised are not
transfers to or for the use of any corporation organized
and operating exclusively for charitable or educational
purposes within the meaning of clause (3), of § 303 (a)
of the Act. We granted certiorari because of an alleged
4
conflict of decision.
1. The claims against the estate were not incurred or
contracted for an- adequate and full consideration in
money or money's worth within the meaning of the statute. The terms used, the legislative history of the section, and the regulations interpieting it, require this conclusion. The conditions imposed by the decedent as to
the expenditure of the money promised and the stipulation on the part of the payee to expend it in that fashion,
or its compliance with the conditions, do not constitute
an adequate or a full consideration in money or money's
worth within the meaning of the Act. li there were
doubt about the matter the legislative history of the
statute and the Treasury regulations would require us so

to hold. The Revenue Act of 1916 permitted the deduction of the amount of claims against the estate "allowed
by the laws of the jurisdiction .. . under which the
estate is being administered." ' The Acts of 1918 and
1921 contain like provisions.' Under these Acts the
claims in question would have been deductible as enforceable by state law irrespective of the nature of the consideration.' The Act of 1924 altered existing law and
authorized the deduction of claims against an estate only
to the extent that they were "incurred or contracted bona
fide and for a fair consideration in money or money's
worth."' Congress had reason to think that the phrase
"fair consideration" would be held to comprehend an instance of a promise which was honest, reasonable, and
free from suspicion whether or not the consideration for
it was, strictly speaking, adequate.9 The words "adequate
and full consideration" were substituted by § 303 (a) (1)
of the Act of 1926. There must have been some reason
for thE:se successive changes. It seems evident that the
purpose was to narrow the class of deductible claims, and
we are not at liberty to ignore this purpose.
The regulations of the Treasury promulgated under the
Act of 1924 and the first edition applicable to that of 1926,
paraphrased the statutory language.10 The 1929 edition
of Regulation 70, Art. 36, provides in part: "A pledge or a
subscription evidenced by a promissory note or otherwise,
even though enforceable against the estate, is deductible
only to the extent such pledge or subscription was made
for an adequate and full consideration in cash or its equiva'Revenue Act of 1916, § 203 (a) (1), 39 Stat. 756, 778.

lent received therefor by the decedent." 11 Since 1929
the regulations have excluded deductions such as those
in issue here. Meantime the estate tax provisions have
been amended four times and the section under which the
regulations were promulgated has been amended twice.
We must assume that Congress was familiar with the construction put upon the section by the Treasury and was
satisfied with it. The Board of Tax Appeals12 and the
courts,1 3 with the exception of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 4 have held that a promise to
pay money to a charitable or educational institution, where
the only consideration was a stipulated application of the
amount received, does not constitute a claim against the
estate contracted for an adequate and full consideration in
money or money's worth notwithstanding the fact that
under local law the promise is enforceable. In this view
we agree.
2. Payments pursuant to the promises are not transfers
within the meaning of § 303 (a) (3). The court below
excluded the payments from the operation of that section
upcn two grounds. Both, as we think, are valid. The
petitioner's payment, after the decedent's death, of a
sum promised during her life, is not appropriately designated a transfer. True the decedent has promised to
make a transfer but fulfillment of the promise by the
executor does not relate back to the time the promise was

made so as to convert her promise into a transfer by her.
Here the subject of the transfer was not identified by any
allocation of decedent's funds during her life. This fact
adds point to the view that she made no transfer.
Subsection (3) applies only to testamentary dispositions. The phrase is "the amount of all bequests, legacies,
devises, or transfers" to certain specified religious, charitable, scientific, literary or educational uses. The right
to the deduction is qualified by the provision "The
amount of the deduction under this paragraph for any
transfer shall not exceed the value of the transferred
property required to be included in the gross estate."
The only transfers required to be included in the gross
estate are those made in contemplation of death or to
take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death.15
In other words, only such transfers as are testamentary
in character are to be included in the gross estate, and
it follows that only those of that character are deductible
under subsection (3). Those here in question, were
clearly not such. There is no claim that the agreements
were made in contemplation of death or to take effect in'
possession or enjoyment at or after death.
3. The petitioner urges that all of the revenue acts have
granted liberal deductions in respect of income tax and
estate tax for contributions to charitable and educational
purposes.

He says that if the benefactions in question

had been made in the form of bequests or gifts to take
effect at death there would be no question of the right
to the claimed deductions. He urges, therefore, that we
. See § 302 (c), 44 Stat. 70. "The value of the gross estate of the
decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his
death of all property, .. . (c) To the extent of any interest therein

should adopt a liberal construction of the Act to effectuate
the intent of Congress even though the payments in ques-

tion do not fall within the strict meaning of the words
used. But we are not permitted to speculate as to the reasons why the policy evidenced with respect to other
forms of gift was not extended to claims upon promises
enforceable by state law. We are bound to observe the

alterations made in the successive acts which, in the plain

,meaning of the language employed, exclude deduction of
enforceable claims of the sort here involved, even though

the case be a hard one.

The testatrix was bound to bring

her transactions within the letter of the statutory provisions and the regulations at the risk that non-compliance
might deprive her estate of tax immunity as respects the
pledges.
