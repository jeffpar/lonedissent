DENVER UNION STOCK YARD- CO. v. UNITED
STATES

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO.

No. 798.

Argued April 27, 1938.-Decided May 31, 1938.

1. In fixing rates, property not used or useful in rendering the
services of the public utility need not be included in rate base.
P. 475.
2. In fixing rates of a stockyard company, the Secretary of Agriculture properly excluded from the rate base:
(a) Land and improvements used for an annual stock show but
not for the performance of the services covered by the rates
regulated. P. 475.
(b) Trackage and facilities, for unloading and loading livestock,
leased to railroad companies for substantial rentals, the stockyard
services being confined to the period between the end of unloading
and the beginning of loading. P. 476.
3. The facts that he had not dwelt in the locality and had never
appraised land in that vicinity or assembled or appraised any
large industrial tracts, did not disqualify a witness, otherwise
experienced in land valuation, from testifying to the value of
land of a stockyard company, in a proceeding by the Secre*ary
of Agriculture in which rates for stockyard services were fixed.
P. 477.
4. In valuing the property of a public utility, an allowance for
going-concern value need not be itemized separately but may be
included in the valuation of the physical elements. P. 478.
5. Where the practice of a stockyard company was to charge on sales
of 'livestock made at the ya'rd by producers, but not on resales
made there by traders who bought there from producers, it was
withih the province of the Secretary of Agriculture, in regulating
rates and in avoidance of discrimination, under the Stockyards Act,
to require that reasonable rates on such resales be charged the
traders. P. 481.
Such a requirement did not create unjust discrimination as
between producers, nor unlawfully invade the right of the company, as owner, to manage the yard and control its business
policy.

DENVER STOCK YARD CO. v. U. S.
470

Opinion of the Court.

6. Whether a stockyard company is entitled, as of constitutional
right, to have any of a number of contributions to local charities
and civic organizations, subscriptions etc. included in its operating
expenses in the fixing of its rates for the future, the Court finds
it unnecessary to consider, in view of the variability of its prospective income, its control over the items in controversy, and their
trivial amount. P. 482.
7. A claim that the costs and expenses of this litigation, amortized
over a reasonable period, should be included in the operating costs
of the appellant stockyard company, in determining the adequacy
of rates fixed by the Secretary of Agriculture, can not be considered, it not having been presented by the bill or in the request
for findings. P. 484.
8. The evidence is not sufficient to require or warrant a finding that
in the immediate future a return of six and one-half per cent.
on the value of the stockyard company's property will be inadequate. P. 485.
21 F. Supp. 83, affirmed.
APPEAL, from a decree of a District Court of three judges

Secretary of Agriculture prescribing maximum rates to be

charged by the appellant Stock Yard Company.
Mr. Robert G. Bosworth, with whom Mr. Winston S.

Howard was on the brief, for appellant.

MR. JUSTIcE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

November 8, 1934, the Secretary of Agriculture
initiated proceedings in which, February 17, 1937, after
extended investigation, taking of much evidence and full
hearing, he made findings of fact and an order, prescribing

maximum rates to be charged by appellant for services

rendered by it.- March 9, 1937, it commenced this suit 2
to set aside the order on the ground that the prescribed
rates are confiscatory and that enforcement of the order
would deprive the company of its property without due
process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The
case was submitted on stipulations and the evidence
before the Secretary. The court made findings of fact,
stated conclusions of law, announced opinion, 21 F. Supp.
83, and, entered decree dismissing the bill.
The challenged rates include marketing charges per
head; they are applicable only when sales are made, and
are the same without regard to the time the stock re.
mains in the pens. These are called "yardage charges."
Appellant makes no charge for use, as such, of pens or
other facilities; its charges for feed, bedding and other
services are regulated by the order. About three-fourths
of the total number of animals received at the yard are
sold there. Some are sold to traders, also called dealers
and speculators, and held in the yard until sold again.
'7 U. S. C. § 211. "Whenever after full hearing .. .the Secretary
is of the opinion that any rate, charge, regulation, or practice of a
stockyard owner or market agency, for or in connection with the furnishing of stockyard services, is or will be unjust, unreasonable, or
discriminatory, the Secretary"(a) May determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable rate or charge, or rates or charges, to be thereafter observed in
such case, or the maximum or minimum, or maximum and minimum,
to be charged, and what regulation or practice is or will be jud
reasonable, and nondiscriminatory to be thereafter followed; and
"(b) May make an order that such owner or operator (1) shall
cease and desist from such violation to the extent to which the Secretary finds that it does or will exist; (2) shall not thereafter publish,
demand, or collect any rate or charge for the furnishing of stockyard
services other than the rate or charge so prescribed, or in excess of
the maximum or less than the minimum so prescribed, as the case
may be; and (3) shall conform to and observe the regulation or practice so prescribed."
'7 U. S. C. § 217; 28 U. S. C. §§ 44, 47 (a).

DENVER STOCK YARD CO. v. U. S.
470

Opinion of the Court.

Appellant has never made any charge against traders for
resales or reweighing for sale except when the resale was
through commission men. For that service, the order
prescribes rates which for convenience may be referred
to as "yardage charges to traders." Appellant's activities
are not confined to services covered by the order. It unloads and loads livestock from and into cars of railroads
serving-the yard, and receives from the carriers compensation not regulated by the Secretary. If enforced, the
order will reduce revenue from charges for yardage services by about eight and one-half per cent, and from
charges for other services by about nineteen per cent;
miscellaneous revenues in a substantial amount are not
affected; total revenue will be reduced by about eight
and one-half per cent. 8
To ascertain the amount on which appellant is entitled
to earn a return, the Secretary determined what land and
structures were used and useful for performance of the
services, and to present value of land added cost of reproduction new less depreciation of structures, and allowances on account of a bridge and sewage disposal plant
being built, and working capital. The total is slightly
less than $2,792,700, which the Secretary adopted as rate
base. He found six and one-half per cent to be a reasonable rate of return, $530,117 the revenue procurable if
prescribed charges be put in effect, and $346,545 the operating expenses, leaving a net return of $183,572,
slightly more than six and one-half per cent on the value
of the property.
Appellant accepts as correct the Secretary's estimste
of cost of reproduction less depreciation of property found
to be used and useful, and also the allowances above men'The Secretary in his brief furnishes the Court the following statement. "The revenues produced from an application of the rates prescribed by the Secretary to the volume of business used by him as a

of the rates under investigation to the volume use& by the Secwetary

Opinion of the Court.

The rate"base. As of right safeguarded by the due
process clause of the Fifth Amendment, appellant is entitled to rates, not per se excessiv6 and extortionate, sufficient to yield a reasonable rate of return upon the value
of property used, at the time it is being used, to render
the services. Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U. S.
19, 41. Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 434. Bluefield Water Works Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 262
U. S. 679, 690. Board of Commissioners v. New York
Tielephone Co., 271 U. S. 23, 31. McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., 272 U. S. 400, 414. Los Angeles Gas Co.
v. Railroad Comm'n, 289 U. S. 287, 305. But it is not
entitled to have included any property not used and useful for that purpose. Cf. St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v.
United States, 298 U. S. 38, 56.
The stock show property excluded. The stock show is
held on property owned by appellant and is conducted by
an incorporated association not organized for pecuniary
profit. It continues for about one week in January of
each year. The Secretary found a part of that property,
which is operated by the Colorado Horse and Mule Company, to be used and useful for performance of services
covered by the rates regulated by him, and included it in
the rate base. He appraised the rest of. the show property, which consists of 2.633 acres and improvements
thereon, at $219,033, but excluded it as not used for the
performance of services covered by the rates he regulates.
For paymeimt of expenses of the show there is used the
money received for admission to it and to other events
on the property, and also some that is donated for that
purpose. Appellant assumes the carrying chares, including interest and taxes; when the show is unable to
pay rental sufficient to cover all charges, appellant ab-

sorbs the deficit. It requested findings in substance as
follows: Large quantities of livestock are entered in the
show and much is sold on the show property. Some is
sold in the yards operated by appellant. The show 4ttracts buyers and throughout the year widens the outlet
for producerS' stock, operates to increase receipts, makes
for improvement, of stock raised and for higher prices,
has educational value, and advertises the market. It is
supported by appellant in good faith and in the belief
that it stimulates its business and that of livestock producers. These facts are not in substantial conflict with
the Secretary's findings, and may be taken as established
by the evidence. But they are not sufficient to prove
that the property excluded is used and useful for the
performance of services covered by rates being regulated
by the Secretary. None of those services is performed
on or by the use of any of that property. The Secretary
rigltly says "If it is appellant's contention that the stock
show increases the stockyard business, then it should request that a reasonable allowance be made for advertising expense as a charge against its 'income," In support
of that view he adds "Advertising or developmental expenses to foster normal growth are legitimate charges
upon income for rate purposes if confined within the limits of reason. West Ohio Gas Co. v. Comm'n, 294 U. S.
63, 72." Appellant's contention that the court erred in
upholding the Secretary's exclusion of that item is not
sustained.
Trackage and unloading and loading facilities. The
Secretary appraised that property at $177,108. He excluded it as not Used for performance of any stockyard
service. Appellant leases the trackage to railroad carriers
for substantial rentals. It does not claim that exclusion
of that part of the item is confiscatory and fails to show it
prejudicipl. It follows that the court did not err in upholding the Secretary's determination. The unloading

DENVER STOCK YARD CO. v. U. S.
470

477

Opinion of the Court.

and loading facilities include ways between docks and the
pens where the stockyard services are rendered. Appellant uses these facilities to unload and load livestock.
That is a service for which the carriers pay appellant.
Stockyard services do not commence until unloading
ends; they end when loading begins. See Atchison, T.
& S. F. Ry. Co. v. United States, 295 U. S. 193, 198. The
court rightly refused to disturb the Secretary's ruling as
to these facilities.
Land value. The Secretary's finding depends on the appraisal and testimony of his valuation engineer. Appellant maintains that it is not supported by evidence
because the engineer was not a qualified expert witness.
It concedes that, if he was competent, tho valuation must
be sustained. To support its point, appellant relies on
the fact that the appraiser had. never lived in Denver or
previously appraised any land there or in that vicinity
or assembled or appraised any large industrial tracts.
The significance adverse to competency that might be
attributed to these facts if they stood alone is negatived
by others disclosed by the record. The appraiser is an
experienced civil engineer; he was long engaged in land
appraisal work under the Interstate Commerce Commission. He later had private practice as consulting engineer and in 1934 became principal valuation engineer
of the Packers and Stockyards Division, Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture; in that capacity he has given testimony in a number of rate proceedings. His report submitted to the Secretary discloses
elaborate investigation and consideration of prices paid
for land, of the Interstate Commerce Commission's appraisals of lands in the vicinity and of other facts material
to the ascertainment of value of the land in question. It
cannot reasonably be said that, because of his lack of
earlier knowledge of local conditions, the finding was
made without evidence.

Going concern value. Appellant maintains that, while
admitting it exists in the property, the Secretary failed to
include in rate base any allowance on account of it, and
that the evidence requires addition of at least $325,000
to cover that element.
In substance, the Secretary's findings state: The stockyard is a going concern; it has a long history of efficient
management and has won a reputation for good service;it has been financially successful. His valuation engineer
(whose figures and valuation are the basis of the Secretary's appraisal) considered going concern value but did
not include a separate amount for it. 'Inadopting the
value of the land and the cost of reproduction new less
depreciation of structures, consideration was given to the
element of going concern value. Adequate allowance
has been included, although no separate item on its
account has been set forth. The findings contain a "summary of the value of used and useful land, the cost of
reproduction new of structures and equipment, including
direct construction overheads, indirect overheads, interest
on used and useful land during construction, and working
.capital, and the cost of these, less depreciation where depreciation exists, of responident [appellant] as a going
concern.4 . . . It is found that the fair value of the property of respondeht as a going concern is $2,792,681 . .

DENVER STOCK YARD CO. v. U. S.
470

Opinion of the Court.

The substance of appellant's claim is that these figures
are exclusively attributable to physical elements. Assuming that to be true, it does not follow that the Secretary
failed to include proper allowance for going concern.
Dayton P. & L. Co. v. Comm'n, 292 U. S. 290, 309. The
value of appellant's property used in stockyard services is
single in substance. West v. Chesapeake & P. Tel. Co.,
295 U. S. 662, 672. While it may be considered as made
up of -tangible and intangible elements, it is not necessarily to be appraised by adding to cost figures attributable to mere physical plant something to cover the value
of the business. Kennebec Water Districtv. Waterville, 97
Me. 185, 220; 54 A. 6. Value depends upon use and is
measured, or at least significantly indicated, by the profitableness of present and prospective service rendered at
rates that are just and reasonable as between the owner of
and those served by the property. Cleveland, C., C. & St.
L. Ry Co. v. Backus, 154 U. S. 439, 445. National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City, 62 F. 853, 864-866. Omaha v.

Union Water Co., 246 U. S. 178, 192. Cf. Public Service
Comm'n v. Great Northern Utilities Co., '89 U. S. 130.
It is elementary that value of a going concern may be less
than, equal to, or more than, present cost of plant less
depreciation plus necessary supplies and working capital.
See Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, 258 U. S. 388,

Appellant's plant without business, present or prospective,
would be worth much less than the cost figures found by
the Secretary to represent value. Appellant's claim, that
the rate base includes nothing on account of going concern
value, is without foundation in fact.
The considerations upon which appellant claimed to
have established an amount to be added to rate base to

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

304 U. S.

cover going value may be summarily stated: (1) The
sales charge is for the privilege of the market. The
value of the market is not reflected in reproduction cost
of structures. It is over and above value of or investment in plant. (2) Appellant has spent large sums and
made gifts of money and land as a result of which large
packers have their plants at Denver and buy on appellant's market. (3) Cattle of various owners arriving at
the Denver market by rail for the same market session
from different shipping points may be sorted into uniform
carloads to move to another destination on the through
rate from point of shipment to point of destination. The
privilege is not open at Chicago or any Missouri River
market. (4) A high percentage of the stock received at
appellant's yard is sold there; this percentage has progressively increased. (5) Volume, appraised at $10 per
car, applied to the 35,000 cars annually received at the
yard.
None of these considerations has much, if any, bearing
on the ascertainment of going value or the application
of the rule that it is to be taken into account in confiscation cases. That element is not separate from or necessarily in excess of reasonable cost figures, attributable to
the plant. The Secretary considered its location, the
volume and flow of shipments, percentages of sales to receipts, privileges in transit, cost of service, past history,
future prospects, and other pertinent facts. Appellant
does not claim that its past operations clearly reflect excellence of service and low cost per unit in comparison
with results attained by other stockyards, or that conditions affecting performance give dependable assurance of
future growth and capacity to earn net returns at relatively low rates. See e. g. McCardle v. Indianapolis
Water Co., supra, 413-415. Its evidence falls far short
of condemning as arbitrary and confiscatory the Secre-

Opinion of the Court.

tary's refusal to add a separate amount to his rate base
to cover going concern value.
Yardage charges to traders. These are prescribed as
reasonable maximum rates to cover sales for which, as
above stated, appellant has made no charge. Its failure
so to do is found by the Secretary and the lower court
to be unreasonably and unjustly discriminatory, in that
it does make charges for, similar privileges it furnishes
producers and others selling in its market. The prescribed charges apply to animals sold by producers or
others to traders and by the latter resold or reweighed
for sale at the yard. On cattle, calves and hogs they are
50 per cent of those charged producers, on sheep and goats
40 per cent, and on horses, mules and pure-bred bulls,
100 per cent. The Secretary estimates that if appellant
exacts the prescribed charges to traders it will obtain
revenue from that source of $10,960 per year, and-he
includes that amount in his calculation of reasonable
return.
There is controversy between the parties as to space
assigned to traders and details of service attributable to
sales by them. But the evidence clearly shows that,
as found by the Secretary and lower courts, appellant
does provide them facilities and privileges similar to,
though not precisely the same as, those furnished to
others making sales in the market. These charges are
not discriminatory as between producers; they directly
bear but one charge. Assuming that the charge for selling by traders would operate to lessen prices obtainable
by producers from them, no unjust discrimination results,
for obviously charges for the two sales of the same
animals reasonably may be more than that exacted for
the first one. These rates are prescribed, and revenues
obtainable from them are included by the Secretary in
his estimate of appellant's income, to the end that it
may not exact from producers and others selling at the

yard charges sufficient to cover the part of its operating
expenses that is fairly attributable to the sales made by
traders. The statute denounces unjust discrimination
and requires appellant as a public market to charge, and
empowers the Secreta]'y to prescribe, rates that are nondiscriminatory. There is no ground for the appellant's
suggestion to the effect that the order unlawfully invades
its right as owner to manage the yard and control its
business policy. Cf. Interstate Commerce Comm'n v.
Chicago G. W. Ry. Co., 209 U. S. 108, 118. Norfolk &

Dues, donations and subscriptions. Appellant claims
an allowance in operating expenses of $3000 to $4000 a
year. The Secretary found that it has regularly made
disbursements ranging between those figures to local
charities, philanthropies, civic organizations, etc.5 He
held that only those of peculiar benefit to respondent's
employees and patrons should be included, and on that
basis allowed in estimated future operating expenses $325
a year. Appellant says that the exclusion leaves return
about $1000 short of six and one-half per cent, that no
contributions were made to charities which did not carry

on in the stockyards area, and that nearly all other items
were business expenses.
But decision here cannot be made to turn on an estimated margin relatively so small. Appellant's annual
receipts and sales at the yard vary considerably. Operating expenses may be less or more per head than the
estimates therefor. Property value may decline or advance. None of the expenditures in question is compulsory. Appellant may withhold dues, donations or
subscriptions as it sees fit. It was not, and probably
could not have been, proved that failure to respond
would adversely affect its revenue. The Secretary is not
required to prescribe rates so low as to be barely sufficient to withstand attack on the ground of confiscation,
but is at liberty within limits that he may find to be just

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

304 U. S.

Expenses of hearings under the Act. The Secretary
found it reasonable to include in estimated operating
costs some of the expenses incident to future hearings
under the Act, suggested that they will be less than heretofore, and allowed $100 a month. The court below
reached the same conclusion. Appellant does not attack
this allowance as insufficient to cover expense on account
of future hearings. Here, it complains that nothing is
included "to amortize over a reasonable future period
or at all the costs and expenses of the present litigation."
But we are not called on to decide that question. Appellant's bill challenges the Secretary's allowance, refers
to expenses theretofore incurred in rate investigations and
alleges that the allowance "is-wholly inadequate to permit petitioner [appellant] either to reimburse itself for
expenditures forced upon it by the Secretary gr to meet
probable reasonable expenditures for said purposes in the
future, and that the

ceding materiality of the facts, stipulated that expense
of the present :proceeding from its commencement, about
January 1, 1935, to the date of the order was $24,654.27
and that a reasonable estimate of the expense of litigation
in the lower court was $15,785. Appellant requested the
court to find that its average annual expense on account
of hearings under the Act for the five-year period ending
with 1934 was $8,786.88, and to find the facts stipulated
by the Secretary and that its average annual expense on
account of enforcement of the Act for the eleven-year
period ending with 1934 was $6,216.
The burden was on appellant by. direct allegations
plainly to set forth the facts on which it intended at the
trial to maintain that the rates are confiscatory. Aetna

Opinion of the Court.

States, 282 U. S. 74, 88-89. Missouri Pacific R. Co. v.
Norwood, 283 U. S. 249, 255. Its complaint failed to disclose the claim it now makes. It is that for each of the
five years following the effective date of the order, there
should be added to estimated cost of operation about
$8,000 to cover expenses of hearings before the Secretary
and of litigation in the district court. Its request for
finding was not sufficient to present the question. Probable expense of future hearings 'uting in issue, the Secretary's stipulation as to actual cost of past hearings and
probable expense of future litigation cannot be regarded
as consent to litigate the question of amortization not
raised by the bill. As the issue was not appropriately
presented below, appellant is not entitled to have it decided here.
Rate of return. Upon consideration of the testimony of
the Secretary's economist and a local investment banker
of high standing, who is also a stockholder and director
of appellant, the Secretary and lower court found that six
and one-half per cent per annum of the value of the
property is a reasonable return. We need not restate the
considerations to be taken into account in determining
a reasonable rate of return.' Plainly the evidence is not
sufficient to require or warrant a finding that in the immediate future a return of six and one-half per cent on
the value of the property will be confiscatory.
The judgment of the District Court must be
Affirmed.
