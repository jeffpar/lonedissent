Opinion of the Court.

PACIFIC NATIONAL CO. v. WELCH, FORMER
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPFALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 528. Argued March 3, 1938.-Decided May 2, 1938.
A taxpayer who, in his income tax return for 1928, reported income
from sales of property according to the deferred payment method,
although he might have used the installment method, is not entitled, upon a claim for refund, after the time for filing the return
has expired, to have the income computed according to the installment method, at least where it is not shown that the deferred payment method, rightly applied, does not dearly reflect his income.
P. 192.
91 F. 2d 590, affirmed.

CERTIORARI, 302 U. S. 679, to review the affirmance of
a judgment rejecting a claim for refund of income taxes.

Mr. Donald V. Hunter, with whom Mr. Melvin D. Wilson was on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Edward J. Ennis, with whom Acting Solicitor General Bell, Assistant Attorney General Morris, and Messrs.
J. Louis Monarch, F. E. Youngman, and Stephen M.
Farrandwere on the brief, for respondent.
MR.JUSTIcE BuTm= delivered the opinion of the Court.
March 14, 1929, petitioner filed its income tax ret irn
for 1928. The return reported $137,007.17 as profit resulting from sales of lots in that year. That figure was
arrived at by adding to the cash paid in 1928, on accoint
of the sales, the amounts later to be paid, and by deducting from the total the cost of lots and improvements and
expenses of the sales.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

304 U. S.

In 1931 petitioner filed a claim for refund of the entire
tax on the ground that the sales had been made on the
installment basis, but the profits had been reported as if
the sales were for cash, and that this was erroneous. The
claim was rejected. • Petitioner sued; trial by jury having
been waived, the district court made findings of fact and
held that petitioner reported income as authorized by the
Revenue Act of 1928 and applicable regulations, and
thereby made an election which became binding on the
expiration of the time allowed for filing the return. Accordingly it gave judgment for respondent. Upon the
same ground the circuit court of appeals affirmed. 91 F.
(2d) 590. The decision below being in conflict with that
of the Court of Claims in Kaplan v. United States, 18 F.
Supp. 965, we granted a writ of certiorari.
Under the applicable statutes and regulations, petitioner could have chosen either of two methods for the
ascertainment and report of gain or loss on the sales. The
Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, establishes both. Defining .one, the "deferred payment method," it declares
that gross income includes profits from sales, § 22 (a);
regulates the computation of gain or loss, § 22 (e) ; defines
gai to be the excess of the amount realized over the basis,
§§ 111 (a), 113; and provides that the "amount realized"
sh all be the sum of any money received plus the fair markco value of property (other than money) received, §
111 (c). Regulations 74, Art. 352. Defining the other,
the "installment method," it provides that, in the case of
a casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property for a price exceeding $1000 or in the case of sale or
other disposition of real property, if payments received
during the taxable year in which the sale was made do not
exceed 40 per cent. of the selling price, the income may,
under regulations prescribed, be returned on the installment method (§ 44 (b)); i. e., the taxpayer may return

in any taxable year that proportion of the installment payments actually received in that year which the gross profit
realized or to be realized when payment is completed bears
to total contract price. See § 44 (a).
Regulations 74 permit the vendor to return income
from installment sales on the straight accrual or cash
receipts basis; when so reported the sales are treated as
deferred payment sales not on the installment plan. Art..
353. In ascertaining the amount of profit or loss from
that class of sales, the obligations of the purchaser to
the vendor are taken at their fair market value; if they
have none, the payments in cash or other property having a fair market value shall be applied against and reduce the basis of the property sold, and if in excess of
such basis, shall be taxable to the extent of the excess.
Gain or loss is realized when the obligations are disposed
of or satisfied, the amount being the difference between
the reduced basis and the amount realized therefor.
Art. 354.
The question is whether, having filed a return according to the deferred payment method, the taxpayer by
filing 'claim for refund is entitled to have the pro:it from
the sales computed on the installment method.
Petitioner contends that the installment method alone
discloses its income from the sales of lots artd that
the deferred payment method failed clearly to reflect
income.
Conceding that its return might have been rade in
accordance with either method, petitioner says t at, being ignorant of both, it treated the sales as if rrade for
cash at figures mentioned in the contracts. Its argurment,
therefore, rests upon the assertion, which we as,,ume to
be true, that the promises of purchasers to pay installments were worth less than face value. But that fact

cation of the deferred payment method would clearly
reflect income, for that method permits installments to
be taken at market value and, if they have no market
value, allows postponement of ascertainment of gain or
loss until realized.* While petitioner's return may have
been an inept application of the deferred payment
method, there is nothing in it or the statement of claim
for refund that gives any support to the idea that, if
rightly applied, that method would not clearly reflect
income.
The parties agree that, if allowed to change to the installment method, petitioner would be entitled to a refund in some amount. But that fact has no tendency to
discredit the deferred payment method as inapplicable.
The amount of the tax for the year in question is only one
of many considerations that may be taken into account
by the taxpayer when deciding which method to employ.
The one that will produce a higher tax may be preferable
because of probable effect on amount of taxes in later
years. In case of overstatement and overpayment, the
taxpayer may obtain refund calculated according to the
method on which the return was made. Change from one
method to the other, as petitioner seeks, would require
recomputation and readjustment of tax liability for subsequent years and impose burdensome uncertainties upon
the administration of the revenue laws. It would operate
to enlarge the statutory period for filing returns (§ 53
(a)) to include the period allowed for recovering overpayments (§ 322 (b)). There is nothing to suggest that
Congress intended to permit a taxpayer, after expiration
of the time within which return is to be made, to have his
tax liability computed and settled according to the other
method. By reporting income from the sales in question
according to the deferred payment method, petitioner
