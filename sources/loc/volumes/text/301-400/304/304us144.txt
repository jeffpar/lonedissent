alleged repudiation was tentative and conditional, to
await negotiations with a stable Russian government
upon its recognition by the United States. If this contention be rejected, respondent insists that at least there
'is a conflict in the evidence and in the inferences which
may be drawn from it which, under the local practice,
should have been resolved by a full trial rather than
summarily on motion. As these questions were not
passed on by the Court of Appeals, the case will be remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

UNITED STATES v. CAROENE PRODUCTS CO.
.PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 640. Argued April 6, 1938.-Decided April 25, 1938.
The Filled Milk Act of Congress of Mar. 4, 1923, defines the term
Filled Milk' as meaning any milk, cream, or skimmed milk, whether
or not condensed or dried, etc., to which has been added, or which
has been blypded or compounded with, any fat or oil other than
milk fat, - that the resulting product is in imitation or semblance
of milk, cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed, dried,
etc.; it declares that Filled' Milk, as so defined, "is an adulterated
article of food, injurious to the public health, and its sale constitutes a fraud upon the public"; and it forbids and penalizes the
shipment of such Filled Milk in interstate commerce. Defendant
was indicted for shipping interstate certain packages of an article
described in the indictment as a compound of condensed skimmed
milk and coconut oil made in the imitation or semblance of condensed milk or cream, and further characterized by the indictment,
in the words of the statute, as "an adulterated article of food,
injurious to the public health." Held:

Opinion of the Court.

1. That upon its face, and as supported by judicial knowledge,
including facts found in the reports of the congressional committees, the Act is presumptively within the scope of the power to
regulate interstate commerce and consistent with due process. Demurrer to the indictment should have been overruled. Hebe Co.
v. Shaw, 248 U. S. 297. P. 147.
2. It is no valid objection that the prohibition of the Act does
not extend to oleomargarine or other butter substitutes in which
vegetable fats or oils replace butter. P. 151.
3. The statutory characterization of filled milk as injurious to
health and as a fraud upon the public may, for the purposes of this
case, be considered as a declaration of legislative findings deemed
to support the Act as a constitutional exertion of* the legislative
power, aiding informed judicial review by revealing the rationale
of the legislation, as do the reports of legislative committees.

The question for decision is whether the "Filled Milk

"Section 61. . . . (c) The term 'filled milk' means any milk,
cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed, evaporated,
concentrated, powdered, dried, or desiccated, to which has been
added, or which has been blended or compounded with, any fat or
oil other than milk fat, so that the resulting product is in
imitation or smblance of milk, cream, or skimmed milk, whether

Opinion of the Court.

304 U. S.

-interstate commerce of skimmed milk compounded with
any fat or oil other than milk fat, so as to resemble milk
or cream, transcends the power of Congress to regulate
interstate commerce or infringes the Fifth Amendment.
Appellee was indicted in the district court for southern
Illinois for violation of the Act by the shipment in inter.
state commerce of certain packages of "Milnut," a compound of condensed skimmed milk and coconut oil made
in imitation or semblance of condensed milk or cream.
The indictment states, in the words of the statute, that
Milnut "is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the
public health," and that it is not a prepared food product
of the type excepted from the prohibition of the Act.
The trial court sustained a demurrer to the indictment
on the authority of an earlier case in the same court,
United States v. Carolene-ProductsCo., 7 F. Supp. 500.
The case was brought here on appeal under the Criminal
Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1246, 18 U. S.
C. § 682. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
has meanwhile, in another case, upheld the Filled Milk
Act as an appropriate exercise of the commerce power in
Carolene Products Co. v. Evaporated Milk Assn., 93
F. (2d) 202.
Appellee assails the statute as beyond the power of
Congress over interstate commerce, and hence an invasion
of a field of action said to be reserved to the states by
the Tenth Amendment. Appellee also complains that the
or not condensed, evaporated, concentrated, powdered, dried, or
desiccated.
"Section 62. . . . It is hereby declared that filled milk, as
herein defined, is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the.
public health, and its sale constitutes a fraud upon the public. It
shall be unlawful for any person to . . . ship or deliver for
shipment in interstate or foreign commerce, any filled milk."
Section 63 imposes as penalties for violations "a fine of not more
than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than one year, or
both

statute denies to it equal protection of the laws and, in
violation of the Fifth Amendment, deprives it of its property without due process of law, particularly in that the
statute purports to make binding and conclusive upon
appellee the legislative declaration that appellee's product "is an adulterated article of food injurious to the public health and its sale constitutes a fraud on the public."
First.The power to regulate commerce is the power "to
prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed,"
Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196, and extends to the
prohibition of shipments in such commerce. Reid v. Colorado, 187 U. S. 137; Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321; United
States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366; Hope v.
United States, 227 U. S. 308; Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., 242 U. S. 311; United States v. Hill,
248 U. S. 420; McCormick & Co. v. Brown, 286 U. S. 131.
The power "is complete in itself, may be exercised to its
utmost extent and acknowledges no limitations other than
are prescribed by the Constitution." Gibbons v. Ogden,
supra, 196. Hence Congress is free to exclude from interstate commerce articles whose use in the states for which
they are destined it may reasonably conceive to be injurious to the public health, morals or welfare, Reid v.
Colorado, supra; Lottery Case, supra; Hipolite Egg Co.
v. United States, 220 U. S. 45; Hope v. United States,
supra, or which contravene the policy of the state of their
destination. Kentucky Whip & Collar Co. v. Illinois
Central R. Co., 299 U. S. 334. Such regulation is not a
forbidden invasion of state power either because its motive or its consequence is to restrict the use of articles of
commerce within the states of destination, and is not prohibited unless by the due .process clause of the Fifth
Amendment. And it is no objection to the exertion of the
power to regulate interstate commerce -that its exercise
is attended by the same incidents which attend'the exerl-"
cise of the police power of the states. Seven Cases v.
United States, 239 U. S. 510, 514; Hamilton v. Kentucky

Opinion of the Court.

Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U. S. 146, 156. The
prohibition of the shipment of filled milk in interstate
commerce is a permissible regulation of commerce, subject only to the restrictions of the Fifth Amendment.
Second. The prohibition of shipment of appellee's product in interstate commerce does not infringe the Fifth
Amendment. Twenty years ago this Court, in Hebe Co.
v. Shaw, 248 U. S. 297, held that a state law which forbids the manufacture and sale of a product assumed to be
wholesome and nutritive, made of condensed skimmed
milk, compounded with coconut oil, is not forbidden by
the Fourteenth Amendment. The power of the legislature to secure a minimum of particular nutritive elements
in a widely used article of food and to protect the public
from fraudulent substitutions, was not doubted; and the
Court thought that there was ample scope for the legislative judgment that prohibition of the offending article
was an appropriate means of preventing injury to the
public.
We see no persuasive reason for departing from that
ruling here, where the Fifth Amendment is concerned;
and since none is suggested, we might rest decision wholly
on the presumption of constitutionality. But affirmative
evidence also sustains the statute. In twenty years evidence has steadily accumulated of the danger to the public health from the general consumption of foods which
have been stripped of elements essential to the maintenance of health. The Filled Milk Act was adopted by
Congress after committee hearings, in the course of which
eminent scientists and health experts testified. An extensive investigation. was-made of the commerce in milk
compounds in which vegetable oils have 1 een substituted
for natural milk fat, and of the effect upon the public
health of the use of such compounds as a food substitute
for milk. The conclusions drawn from evidence'presented at the hearings were embodied in reports of the

U. S. v. CAROLENE PRODUCTS CO.
144

149

Opinion of the Court.

House Committee on Agriculture, H. R. No. 365, 67th
Cong., 1st Sess., and the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, Sen. Rep. No. 987, 67th Cong., 4th Sess.
Both committees concluded, as the statute itself declares,
that the use of filled milk as a substitute for pure milk is
generally injurious to health and facilitates fraud on the
public.2
There is nothing in the Constitution which compels a
legislature, either national or state, to ignore such evidence, nor need it disregard the other evidence which
amply supports the conclusions of the Congressional committees that the danger is greatly enhanced where an inferior product, like appellee's, is indistinguishable from
The reports may be summarized as follows: There is an extensive
commerce in milk compounds made of condensed milk from which
the butter fat has been extracted and an equivalent amount of
vegetable oil, usually coconut oil, substituted. These compounds
resemble milk in taste and appearance and are distributed in packages resembling those in which pure condensed milk is distributed.
By reason of the extraction of the natural milk fat the compounded
product can be manufactured and sold at a lower cost than pure
milk. Butter fat, which constitutes an important part of the food
value of pure milk, is rich in vitamins, food elements which are
essential to proper nutrition and are wanting in vegetable oils.
The use of filled milk as a dietary substitute for pure milk results,
especially in the case of children, in undernourishment, and induces
diseases which attend malnutrition. Despite compliance with the
branding and labeling requirements of the Pure Food and Drugs
Act, there is widespread use of filled milk as a food substitute for
pure milk. This is aided by their identical taste and appearance;rby
the similarity of the containers in which they are sold, by the practice of dealers in offering the inferior product to customers as being
as good as or better than pure condensed milk sold at a higher price,
by customers' ignorance of the respective food values ,of the two
products, and in many sections of the country by their inability to
read the labels placed on the containers. Large amounts of filled milk,
much of it shipped and sold in bulk, are purchased by hotels and
boarding houses, and by manufacturers of food products, such as
ice cream, to whose customers labeling restrictions afford no prokeetion.

a valuable food of almost universal use, thus making
fraudulent distribution easy and protection of the consumer difficult.'
'There is now an extensive literature indicating wide recognition by
scientists and dietitians of the great importance to the public
health of butter fat and whole milk as the prime source of vitamins,
which are essential growth producing and disease preventing elements
in the diet. See Dr. Henry C. Sherman, The Meaning of Vitamin A, in Science, Dec. 21, 1928, p. 619; Dr. E. V. McCollum et al.,

Opinion of the Court.

Here the prohibition of the statute is inoperative unless the product is "in imitation or semblance of milk,
cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed."
Whether in such circumstances the public would be adequately protected by the prohibition of false labels and
false branding imposed by the Pure Food and Drugs Act,
or whether it was necessary to go farther and prohibit a
substitute food product thought to be injurious to health
if used as a substitute when the two are not distinguishable, was a matter for the legislative judgment and not
that of courts. Hebe Co. v. Shaw, supra; South Carolina
v. Barnwell Bros. Inc., 303 U. S. 177. It was upon this
ground that the prohibition of the sale of oleomargarine
made in imitation of butter was held not to infringe the
Fourteenth Amendment in Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127
U. S. 678; Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, 183 U. S. 238.
Compare McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27, 63;
Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192.
Appellee raises no valid objection to the present statute
by arguing that its prohibition has not been extended to
oleomargarine or other butter substitutes in which vegetable fats or oils are substituted for butter fat. The
Fifth Amendment has no equal protection clause, and
even that of the Fourteenth, applicable only to the states,
does not compel their legislatures to prohibit all like
evils, or none. A legislature may hit at an abuse which
it has found, even though it has failed to strike at another. Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, 226 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Third. We may assume for present purposes that no
pronouncement of a legislature can fore'stall attack upon
the constitutionality of the prohibition which it enacts by
applying opprobrious epithets to the prohibited act, and
that a statute would deny due process which precluded the
disproof in judicial proceedings of all facts which would
show or tend to show that a statute depriving the suitor
,of life, liberty or property had a rational basis.
But such we think is not the purpose or construction of
the statutory characterization of filled milk as injurious
to health and as a fraud upon the public. There is no
need to consider it here as more than a declaration of the
legislative findings deemed to support and justify the action taken as a constitutional exertion of the legislative
power, aiding informed judicial review, as do the reports
of legislative committees, by revealing the rationale of
the legislation. Even in the absence of such aids the
existence of facts supporting the legislative judgment is
to be presumed, for regulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial transactions is not to be pronounced
unconstitutional unless in the light of the facts made
known or generally assumed it is of such a character as
to preclude the assumption that it rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the
legislators.' See Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v.
'There may be narrower scope for operation of the presumption
of constitutionality when legislation appears on its face to be within
a specific prohibition of the Constitution, such as those of the first
ten amendments, which are deemed equally specific when held to
be embraced within the Fourteenth. See Stromberg v. California,
283 U. S. 359, 369-370; Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 452.
.It is unnecessary to consider now whether legislation which restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to
bring about repeal Gf undesirable legislation, is to be subjected to
more exacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of
the Fourteenth Amendment than are most other types of legisla-

tion. On restrictions upon the right to vote, see Nixon v. Herndon,

U. S. v. CAROLENE PRODUCTS CO.
144

Opinion of the Court.

Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 584, and cases cited. The present
statutory findings affect appellee no more than the reports
of the Congressional committees; and since in the absence
of the statutory findings they would be presumed, their
incorporation in the statute is no more prejudicial than
surplusage.
Where the existence of a rational basis for legislation
whose constitutionality is attacked depends upon facts
beyond the sphere of judicial notice, such facts may properly be made the subject of judicial inquiry, Borden's
Farm Products Co. v. Baldwin, 293 U.

S. 194, and the

constitutionality of a statute predicated upon the exisence of a particular state of facts may be challenged by
showing to the court that those facts have ceased

o

exist. Chastleton Corporationv. Sinclair, 264 U. S. 543.
Similarly we recognize that the constitutionality of a
statute, valid on its face, may be assailed by proof of fa(ts
tending to show that the statute as applied to a part.c273 U. S. 536; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73; on restraints upon
the dissemination - of information, see Near v. Minnesota ex rel.
Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 713-714, 718-720, 722; Grosjean v. American
Press Co., 297 U. S. 233; Lovell v. Griffin, supra; on interferenoes
with political organizations, see Stromberg v. California, supra, 369;
Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U. S. 380; Whitney v. California, 274 U. S.
357, 373-378; Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242; and see Holmes, J.,
in Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 673; as to prohibition of
peaceable assembly, see De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353, 365.
Nor need we enquire whether similar considerations enter into
the review of statutes directed at particular religious, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, or national, Meyer v. Nebraska, 262
U. S. 390; Bartels v. Iowa, 262 U. S 404; Farrington v. Tokushige,,
273 U. S. 484, or racial minorities, Nixon v. Herndon, supra; Nixon
v. Condon, supra: whether prejudice against discrete and insular
minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied
upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly
more searching judicial inquiry. Compare McCulloch v. Maryland,
4 Wheat. S16, 428; South Carolina v. Barnwell Bros., 303 U. S. 177,
184, n. 2, and cases cited.

Opinion of the Court.

ular article is without support in reason because the article, although within the prohibited class, is so different
from others of the class as to be without the reason for
the prohibition, Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R.
Co., 295 U. S. 330, 349, 351, 352; see Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 379; cf. Morf v. Bingaman, 298 U. S.
407, 413, though the effect of such proof depends on the
relevant circumstances of each case, as for example the
administrative difficulty of excluding the article from the
regulated class. Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke
Co., 301 U. S. 495, 511-512; South Carolinav. Barnwell
Bros., 303 U. S. 177, 192-193. But by their very nature
such inquiries, where the legislative judgment is drawn
in question, must be restricted to the issue whether any
state of facts either known or which could reasonably be
assumed affords support for it. -Here the demurrer challenges the validity of the statute on its face and it is evident from all the considerations presented to Congress,
and those of which we may take judicial notice, that. the
question is at least debatable whether commerce in filled
milk should be left unregulated, or in some measure restricted, or wholly prohibited. As that decision was for
Congress, neither the finding of a court arrived at by
weighing the evidence, nor the verdict of a jury can be
substituted for it. Price v. Illinois, 238 U. S. 446, 452;
Hebe Co. v. Shaw, supra, 303; StandardOil Co. v. Marysville, 279 U. S. 582, 584; South Carolina v. Barnwell
Bros., Inc., supra, 191, citing Worcester County Trust
Co. v. Riley, 302 U. S. 292, 299.
The prohibition of shipment in interstate commerce of
appellee's product, as described in the indictment, is a
constitutional exercise of the power to regulate interstate
commerce. As the statute is not unconstitutional on its
face the demurrer should have been overruled and the
judgment will be
Reversed.
