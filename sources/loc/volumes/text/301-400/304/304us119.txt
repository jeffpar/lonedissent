UNITED STATES v. KLAMATH AND MOADOC
TRIBES OF INDIANS ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 707. Argued April 1, 4, 1938.-Decided April 25, 1b938.
1. In a treaty by which the Klamath and other tribes of Indians
ceded land which they had held in immemorial possession, part was
retained, "until otherwise directed by the President," to, be set
apart as a residence for the Indians and "held and regarded as an
Indian reservation." Part of the reserved land was subsequently
appropriated by the United States. Held:
(1) That the words quoted did not detract from the tribes' right
of occupancy. 1'. 122.
(2) In ascertaining just compensation for the land appropriated,
the value of the standing timber should be included. Id.
(3) While the United States has power. to control and manage
the affairs of its Indian wards in good faith for their welfare, that
power is subject to constitutional limitations, and 'does not enable
the United States without paying just compensation therefor to
appropriate lands of an Indian tribe to its own use or to hand them
over to others. P. 123.
(4) The taking of property by the United States in the exertion
of its power of eminent domain implies a promise to pay just compensation, i. e., value at the time of the taking plus an amount
sufficient to produce the full *equivalent of that value paid contemporaneously with the taking. Id.
2. Part of the unallotted portion of an Indian reservation was conveyed to a Road Company by the Secretary of the Interior. under
authority of Congress in exchange for a reconveyance of allotied
land which had previously been conveyed by mistake. Held a
valid exertion of the power of eminent domain, implying a promise
by the Government to pay just compensation to the Indians. P.-.
It was not a case of lands "wrongfully appropriated," as to which
the Act of May 26, 1920, which first conferred jurisdiction in this
case, confined the damages to value of the lands at time of appropriation. P. 124.
Congress, by"the Act of May 15, 1936, conferring additional
jurisdiction in this case upon the Court of Claims, intended to grant
to the Indians the right to have their claim for just compensation,
under the Constitution, for the land taken, judicially determined

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Congress, by Act of May 26, 1920,1 gave to the lower
court jurisdiction of claims of respondents against the
United States. They sued to recover the value of 87,000
acres of land alleged to have been taken from them by
the United States August 22, 1906. The Court of Claims
made special findings of fact, stated its conclusion of law
and dismissed the case. We affirmed on the ground that
the Act did not confer jurisdiction of released claims and
that this claim had been released. 296 U. S.244. Then,
by Act of May 15, 1936,2-the Congress enacted "That in
the suit numbered E-346 [this suit] heretofore instituted
in the Court of Claims by the Klamath and Modoc Tribes
and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians under an
Act . . . approved May 26, 1920, jurisdiction is hereby

instate and retry said case and to hear and determine the
claims of the plaintiffs on the merits, and to enter judgment thereon upon the present pleadings, evidenc, and
findings of fact, with the right of appeal, rather than by
certiorari, to the Supreme Court of the United States by
either party: Provided, That any payment- here-ofore
made to the said Indians by the United States in connection with any release or settlement shall be. charged
as an offset, but shall not be treated as an estoppel."
The findings show: In 1864 plailitiffs .held by immemorial possession more than 20,000,000 acres located
within what now constitutes Oregon and California. Byan Act ' of March 25 of that year the President was
authorized to conclude with them a treaty for the purchase of the country they occupied. The treaty was
made October 14 following.' A.proviso sets apart a tract
retained out of the country a park pf which was ceded,
-to be held until otherwise directed'y the President, as
a residence for plaintiffs, with specified privileges. Rights
of way for public roads were reserved." Shortly before
the treaty was made Congress granted Oregon, to aid
in the construction of a military road, the odd-numbered
sections for three in width on each .-Ldb of the proposed
road.,
Oregon accepted the grant and -issigned it to the
road company
which undertook to construct the road.
Congress recognized the assignment." Patents were
issued to the State and to the road company for in all
420,240.67 acres, title to which was later acquired by a
land company. Exclusive of right of way, 111,385 acres
so acquired by that company were within the boundaries

of the reservation and had been allotted in severalty to
members of the tribe. The United States brought suit
but failed to recover that area.8 Congress by Act of
June 21, 1906,1 authorized the Secretary of the Interior
to exchange unallotted lands in the. reservation for the
allotted lands by mistake earlier conveyed. lie made an
agreement with the land company pursuant to which,
on August 22, 1906, it conveyed the allotted lands back
to the United States and in return the latter conveyed
to the company 87,000 acres of unallotted lands. That
transfer was made without the knowledge or consent of
plaintiffs and without giving them any compensation
for the lands so taken from their reservation. Later,
however, the United States paid them. $108,750 for
which they released their claim.1" There was then upon
the land 1,713,000,000 board feet of merchantable timber
of the value of $1.50 per thousand; the value of the lands
including timber was $2,980,000. From that amount the
court subtracted the $108,750 and to the remainder added
5 per cent. per annum to date of judgment; from the
total took the amount it found the United States entitled to set off against plaintiff's claim (Act of May 26,
1920, 41 Stat. 623, ยง 2), and as of June 7, 1937, gave
judgment for the balance $5,313,347.32, with interest on
a part of that amount until paid.
1. The United States contends that the lower court
erred in including the value of the timber. The tract
taken was a part of the reservation retained by plaintiffs

sion, from which was made the cession by the treaty of
October 14, 1864. The clause declaring that the district
retained should, until otherwise directed by the President,
be set apart as a residence for the Indians and "held and
regarded as an Indian reservation" clearly did not detract
from the tribes' right of occupancy. The worth attributable to the timber was a part of the value of the land upon
which it was standing. Plaintiffs were entitled to have
that element of vllue included as a part of the compensation for the lands taken. United States v. Shoshone
Tribe, ante, p. 111.
2. The United States also contends that the lower
court erred in allowing interest against the United States
on the unpaid value of the 87,000 acres from the time of,
the exchange to the, date of the judgment, and to support
that contention argues that there was no exercise of the
power of eminent domain and that the jurisdictional Act
of 1920 limited recovery to the value of the land on the
date of the taking, without interest.
It is appropriate first to observe that while the United
States has power to control and manage the affairs of its
Indian wards in good faith for their welfare, that power
is subject to constitutional limitations, and does not enable
the United States without 1Saying just compensation
therefor to appropriate lands of an Indiai tribe to its
own use or to hand them over to others. Chippewa Indians v. United States, 301 U. S. 358, 375, and cases cited.
Nor is it quite accurate to say that interest as such is
added to value at the time of the taking in order to arrive
at just compensation subsequently ascertained and paid.
The established rule is that the taking of property by the
United States in the exertion of its power of eminent domain implies a promise to pay just compensation, i. e.,
value at the time of the taking plus an amount sufficient
to produce the full equivalent of that value paid contemporaneously with the taking. Jacobs v. United States,

290 U. S. 13, 16-17, 'and cases cited. The lands here in
question are not the allotted areas making up the 111,385
acres that the United States conveyed by mistake and
through error in the conduct of litigation, as its counsel
here says, failed to recover." Plaintiffs seek compensation for the 87,000 acres given to the land company in
exchange for the allotted areas which the latter then
owned.
Having been informed of the failure of the United
States to recover the allotted lands, Congress, by the Act
of March 3, 1905, directed the Secretary of the Interior
to ascertain "on what terms the said company will exchange such lands [the 111,385 acres of allotted lands]
for other lands, not allotted to Indians, within the original
boundaries of said reservation." " The Secretary having
reported, the Congress by the Act of June 21, 1906 authorized him to exchange 87,000 acres of the tribes' lands for
lands theretofore erroneously conveyed. The exchange
having been consummated, Congress by Act of April 30,
1908 18 appropriated $108,750 as compensation. That
amount was paid plaintiffs in accordance with the Act;
they gave the release here held valid, 296 U. S. 244. The
Act of May 15, 1936 followed.
The United States argues that the rule of just compensation does not apply because "the tract was lost by
mistake rather than taken by the power of eminent domain." But as to the 87,000 acres here involved there is
no foundation for that assertion. Unquestionably Congress had power to direct the exchange and for that purpose to authorize expropriation of plaintiffs' lands. The
validity of its enactments is not questioned. The taking
was to enable the Government to discharge its obligation,

whether legal or merely moral is immaterial, to make
restitution of the allotted lands. The taking Was in invitum, specifically authorized by law, a valid exertion of
the sovereign power of eminent domain. It therefore'
implied a promise on the part of the Government to pay
plaintiffs just compensation. Jacobs v. United States,
supra.
The provision of the Act of 1920 invoked by the United
States is: "That if it be determined by the Court of
Claims in the said suit herein authorized that the United
States Government has wrongfully appropriated any
lands belonging to the said Indians, damages therefor
shall be confined to the value of the said land at the time
of said appropriation. . . ." As shown above, the 87,000
acres were taken by valid exertion of the power of eminent domain. The taking was consummated pursuant to
the Act of 1906; it was ratified by appropriation and payment under the Act of 1908. It implied a promise to pay
just compensation. Clearly the lands in question were
not "wrongfully appropriated."
Moreover the Congress by the Act of May 15, 1936 intended to grant to the plaintiffs the right to have their
claim for just compensation under the Constitution for
the 87,000 acres judicially determined without regard to
the settlement and irrespective of the release." It speA letter of the Secretary of the Interior to the Committee on
Indian Affairs on the proposed Act of 1936 said in part: "The bill
now here seeks to authorize 'effective judicial determination' of the
claim of these i dians for the land taken from their reservation and
given to the California & Oregon Land Co., whibh the courts have
plainly indicated to have been for an inadequate consideration."
