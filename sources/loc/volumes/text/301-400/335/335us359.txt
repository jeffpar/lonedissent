GRAND RIVER DAM AUTHORITY v. GRANDHYDRO.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 6.

Argued October 12-13, 1948.-Decided November 22, 1948.

1. Petitioner is a public corporation created by Oklahoma to develop
and sell hydroelectric power. Respondent is an Oklahoma private
corporation with the usual powers of a public utility. In a condemonation proceeding in an Oklahoma state court, petitioner
sought a determination of the amount of compensation to which
respondent was entitled for land of respondent which was appropriated by petitioner for a hydroelectric project on the Grand
River in Oklahoma. Petitioner had a federal license, issued under
the Federal Power Act, for the project; respondent did not: In
the condemnation proceeding, petitioner did not rely on the Federal Power Act or on the federal license, but only on the state
law of condemnation. The State Supreme Court decided that,
in determining the amount of compensation to which the respondent was entitled, the value of the land for use as a power site
could be taken into consideration, and that expert testimony as
to that value was admissible. Held: The Federal Power Act has
not so far affected the use or value of the land for power site
purposes as to deprive it of all fair market value for those purposes
and thus deprive the evidence of such value of all probative
weight in this case. Pp.. 361-369, 372-373.
2. The fact that the state court purported to rest its decision largely
on state law does not dispense with the necessity of this Court's
6onsidering the question as to the effect of the Federal Power Act
presented by this record. P. 369.
3. It is for this Court to determine whether questions of federal law
were necessarily, although only impliedly, adjudicated by the state
court. Pp. 369-370.
4. The State Supreme Court's statement of the Oklahoma law as
to the proper measure of the value of the land in the state court
condemnation proceeding is accepted here. Pp. 370-372.
5. The Court expresses no opinion as to what would be the appropriate measure of value in a condemnation proceedjng brought by
the United States or by one of its licensees in reliance upon rights
derived under the Federal Power Act. P. 373.

6. A different result from that here reached is not required by provisions of the Federal Power Act relating to the (letermination
of the rate base of a federal licensee, nor by pro'isions of the Act
relating to recal)ture of a project by the United States upon
expiration of a federal license. Pp. 374-375.
7. There is nothing in the Federal Power Act which requires that
it be interpreted as superseding the state law of condemnation
and as restricting the measure of valuation which lawfully may
be used by the courts of Oklahoma in a condemnation proceeding
for the acquisition of land for power site purposes by an agency
of that State. P. 374.
8. No opinion is expressed upon issues which might arise in the
event the Federal Power Comninission passes upon a rate base
for the project or the United States proceeds to recapture the
project upon expiration of the federal license. Pp. 374-375.

A condemnation proceeding instituted by petitioner
in a state court of Oklahoma, to have determined the
amount of compensation to which the respondent was
entitled for land appropriated by petitioner for a hydroelectric 'project, resulted in a verdict and judgment for
a specified sum. The State Supreme Court reversed and
remanded for a new trial. 192 Okla. 693, 139 P. 2d 798.
The new trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for
an increased amount. The State Supreme Court affirmed. 200 Okla. 157, 201 P. 2d 225. This Court

Opinion of the Court.

S. Frank Fowler and Robert Dale Hudson argued the
cause and filed a brief for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The federal question in this action for condemnation
under Oklahomi, law is whether the Federal Power Act 1
had so far affected the use or value of certain land for
power site purposes as to render inadmissible expert
testimony which gave recognition to that land's availability for a power site. We hold that it had not. We
thus see no adequate reason to reverse the Supreme Court
of Oklahoma which had held that such testimony was
properly admitted in a state condemnation proceeding.
This action was brought by the petitioner, Grand River
Dam Authority, in the District Court for Mayes County,
Oklahoma, to condemn and to award damages for the
taking of 1,462.48 acres of that land from the respondent,
Grand-Hydro. Four hundred and seventeen of these
acres have been used by the petitioner as a site for its
hydroelectric project, near Pensacola, on the Grand River
in Oklahoma. The Commissioners, appointed by the
court to assess the damages sustained by the appropriation of these lands, awarded the respondent $281,802.74.
Each party, however, objected and demanded a jury trial.
That trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for $136,250.
On appeal, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma reversed the
judgment and remanded the case for a new trial in conformity with its opinion. That opinion is important in
determining the issues before us. 192 Okla. 693, 139 P.
2d 798. Six judges concurred in the opinion, one in
the result and two dissented.
In 1945, the new trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for $800,000, together with interest on $518,197.26

from January 19, 1940, which was the date on which
the amount fixed by the Commissioners had been paid
into court. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed
this judgment, seven to two. 200 Okla. 157, 201 P. 2d
225. We denied certiorari, 332 U. S. 841, but, on rehearing, granted it, 333 U. S. 852, because of the possible
significance of the case in relation to the Federal Power
Act. The United States filed a brief as amicus curiae,
at each stage of the proceedings, supporting the contentions of the petitioner.2
The petitioner is a conservation and reclamation district, created in 1935 by the Oklahoma Legislature. It
is a corporate agency of the State with power to develop
and sell water power and electric energy in the Grand
River Basin.3 The respondent is a private corlporation,
organized in 1929 under the laws of Oklahoma. It has
The United States has a further interest in the case because the
petitioner's project has been financed largely through a federal loan
and grant agreement. At the time of filing its brief in support of
the petition for certiorari, the Government held approximately
$14,000,000 of the petitioner's revenue bonds. See also, Act of July
31, 1946, 60 Stat. 743, as to the refinancing of these bonds.

the usual powers of a public utility, including the power
to develop and use the waters of the Giand River, construct dams, generate and distribute electricity and acquire by right of eminent domain, purchase or otherwise,
real and personal property for its purposes. The Grand
River is treated as a nonnavigable stream, tributary to
the Arkansas River which is a navigable stream.
Long prior to this litigation the respondent acquired
the acreage in question for use in its proposed development of hydroelectric power on the Grand River. In
1931, it obtained from the State Conservation Commission a state license and permit to apprQpriate the waters
of Grand River for beneficial use, to construct a dam
on that river, and there to develop hydroelectric power
for sale.4 The respondent, however, never has filed with
the Federal Power Commission any declaration of intention or application for a federal license relative to this
project.
In February, 1934, the City of Tulsa filed an action
in an Oklahoma court against the respondent and others
seeking an adjudication of certain water rights in Spavinaw Creek and in the Grand River near Pensacola.
During the pendency of that action the Oklahoma Legislature created the Grand River Dam Authority, petitioner
herein, and granted to it exclusive authority to develop
the Grand River in the manner described in the Act.
In effect, the petitioner thus acquired a state priority
over the respondent, although the respondent held title
to certain water rights and to the land needed for the project. The petitioner thereupon was made a party to the
Tulsa action. However, before filing its answer and crosspetition, the petitioner entered into an agreement for
the voluntary assignment to it by the respondent of the

latter's rights to appropriate certain river waters for the

project. It likewise secured from the respondent the
latter's title to 45 acres essential to the dam site. In
due course, Judgment was rendered awarding to the petitioner a prior right to control and appropriate the required water from the river and stating that the respondent had no right therein. The petitioner secured from
the respondent a voluntary conveyance of title to ten
additional acres and also of certain rights of entry uponJ
362 acres. These made up the 417 acres referred to as
the dam site. As later found by the Supreme Court of
Oklahoma"The conveyances of the land were made on condi-

tion that the consideration would later be determined
by agreement or condemnation and the assignment
was on the condition provided for therein:
" 'It is understood, however, that this assignment
and conveyance shall not, in any way, affect or imj)air the title of Grand-Hydro to any lands owned by
it, or any interests therein, and if any lands or interests therein owned by the said Grand-Hydro are
acquired by the Grand River Dam Authority by
purchase or condemnation, the value thereof or damage thereto* shall be ascertained and determined as
though this assignment and conveyance had never
been made.'" Grand River Dam Authority v.

The parties being unable to agree upon the price for
the land, the petitioner filed the present action in February, 1939. The petition made no reference to the
Federal Power Act or to rights claimed thereunder. The
petitioner, on the other hand, based its clain upon the

right to acquire the land by condemnation "in the manner
provided by general law with respect to condemnation"
which had been granted to the petitioner by the Grand
River Dam Authority Act.' The project was to be located on the upper reaches of the Grand (or Neosho)
River, near Pensacola, above the river's confluence with
Spavinaw Creek. In the meantime, on December 15,
1937, the petitioner had filed with the Federal Power
Commission a declaration of intention under § 23 (b) of
the Federal Power Act.7 In that declaration the jetitioner stated that"The -construction of said project will probably not
affect present or prospective navigation for the reason that the Grand River is not a navigable stream
in law or in fact, and the navigability of the Arkansas
and Mississippi rivers will not be appreciably affected thereby. The construction of said project will

under its authority to regulate commerce with foreign nitions and
among the several States shall before such construction file declaration of such intention with the Commission, whereupon the Coinmission shall cause immediate investigation of such proposed
construction to be made, and if upon investigation it shall find that
the interests of interstate or fore'ign commerce would be affected

have received a license under the provisions of this Act. If the

are affected, permission is hereby granted to construct such dam or
other project works in such stream upon compliance with State

United States, or the interests of interstate or foreign
commerce."
If the Commission had agreed with the foregoing statement, § 23 (b) would have permitted construction of the
dam merely upon petitioner's compliance with state laws.
However, on February 11, 1938, the Commission found
that"(c) The construction and operation of said project as proposed by the declarant will affect navigable
stages of the Arkansas River, a navigable water of
the United States, to which said Gian- River is
tributary;
"The Commission therefore finds that:
"The construction and operation of said project
in the manner proposed by the declarant will affect
the interests of interstate commerce."
Thereupon, the petitioner sought and, on July 26, 1939,
secured from the Commission the federal license required
for the project as one affecting navigable waters and
reservations of the United States. The petitioner, however, has not, by amendment or otherwise; based its right
of condemnation, in the present case upon the Federal
Power Act or upon any federal license issued thereunder.
This proceeding was brought in an Oklahoma court,
by a government agency of Oklahoma, to exercise a right
of condemnation granted by Oklahoma. It does not seek
to condemn or to award damages for water rights. It
seeksonly to condemn certain land and to assess damages
due to the taking of that land. At the original trial, the
court excluded from the jury evidence of thevalue of
the land insofar as such evidence was based upon the
availability of that land for a dam site. On appeal, the
Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that such exclusion
.,constituted reversible error and it remanded the case for

retrial in conformity, with its opinion. That opinion
stated the law of Oklahoma as follows:

fair market or cash value of the land condemned.

said:
" 'It is the market value that .is the test and not

not obliged to sell it, taking into consideration all

"With reference to the question of adaptability or

must be applied here. The condemnee is ordinarily

After retrial and on a second appeal to it, the Supreme
Court of Oklahoma reaffirmed the law of that State in
the following terms, and l)ointed to the federal question
which the petitioner and the United States, as amicus
curiae, now place before us:
"In this appeal the new or different facts and issues
presented consist of the competency of the testimony,
as presented in the last trial, of the expert witnesses
as to the market value of the dam site; the submis'sion of such testimony to the jury under proper instructions;, the effect of Grand-Hydro's lack of a
.pern-iit from the Federal Power Conmission; the
trial court's refusal to allow counsel to argue to the
jury that the condemned land had no dam site value
because of such fact; and the allowance of interest.
"Appellant contends that the passage of the act
creating the Authority was, in effect, a forfeiture of
'the Grand-Hydro [state] permit and therefore it
was not entitled to recover the dam site value of the

lands condemned. If such was the intent of the Legislature in passing the act, it was in violation of the
Constitution, art. 2,. sec. 24. The state cannot,
through its law-making body, remove the principal
value of private property and, through its established agency acquire the property by condemnation, basing the reimbursement to the owner on the
reduced value. If it were otherwise, it Would be
possible to circumvent the above section of our
Constitution ...

site value of the property and was in accord with our.

Power Act has so far affected the use or value of this
land for power site purposes as to deprive it of all fair
market value for those purposes and thus deprive the
evidence of ,such value of all probative weight in this

Power Act has superseded the state law and has set up
a new standard of valuation binding upon the state even
in a condemnation proceeding under state law. It is,
of course, for us to examine whether questions of federal
law were necessarily, although only impliedly, 'adjudicated by the state court. We accept the law of Oklahoma, set forth in the above quotations, as stating the
proper measure of the value to be given to this land in
this state proceeding. The respective parties have put
different interpretations upon this statement of the Oklahoma law but the Supreme Court of that State has settled the issue in favor of the respondent's interpretation;
The petitioner points to the following statement of the
Oklahoma court:
"The condemnee is ordinarily entitled to compensation measured not only by the value. cf the land for
the use to which he has applied it, but the -value
thereof for all possible purposes, present and prospective, to which he or his ordinary grantee might
legally apply the same." (Emphasis supplied.)
Grand-Hydro v. Grand River Dam Authority, 192
Okla. 693, 694, 139 P. 2d 798, 800.
The petitioner then argues that, by virtue of its special
act of incorporation, it holds a grant from Oklahoma
of the exclusive right to develop this power site insofar
as the State is concerned, and that it holds a grant from
the United States of the only federal license that has
been issued* for the development of this site. The respondent, on the other hand, holds neither a state permit
nor a federal license to use this land for a power site,
although it originally acquired the land for that purpose
and later conveyed it to the petitioner for that purpose,
under an agreement which has postponed, until now, the
determination of its purchase price. The petitioner, with
the help of the respondent's conveyance to it of this

land and of the irespondent's assignment to it of certain
water rights, has secured judicial recognition of a prior
right in itself to appropriate under state law certain
water from the river, and has secured from the Federal
Power Commission the above-mentioned license required
under the Federal Power Act. Thus equipped, the petitioner has erected its dam on the dam site.
Accordingly, if the correct interpretation of the law
of Oklahoma is that, in order for the respondent to introduce evidence of the value of the land for a dam site,
the respondent must show not only that the land is
reasonably and lawfully usable for that purpose, but also
that the respondent itself holds a valid state permit or
federal license for the construction of the dam on that
land, then it is clear that the evidence would not be
admissible. However, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma
has settled this issue in favor of the respondent by holding
that such a permit or license is not necessary in order
for the evidence to be considered. As to the state permit,
it has held expressly in its second opinion, as quoted
at pp. 368-369 of this opinion, that the Grand River Dam
Authority Act did not deprive the respondent of its right
to compensation from the petitioner for the value of the
dam site as such. In fact, the court there said that such
a result would violate the Constitution of Oklahoma.
In that same opinion, as quoted at p. 369 of this opinion,
that court settled the issue that possession of a federal
license by the respondent was not necessary in order
for the respondent to introduce evidence of the value
of this land as a dam site. The court so held when it
expressly approved the action of the trial court in admitting the evidence in question when offered on behalf of
the respondent in the absence of any federal license to
the respondent and in the face of the federal license
already issued to the petitioner.

OCTOBER TERM, 1948.
Opinion of the Court.

335 U. S.

The Supreme Court of Oklahoma stands squarely upon
the law of the case which it announced upon the first
appeal of this case. Its original statement as made at
that time and as further interpreted on the second appeal
holds that it was enough, for the present purposes, that the
use of the land for a dam site was a reasonable and lawful
use to which the land might be applied, without showing
that the respondent itself held a permit or license authorizing it to build the dam. It may be surmised that the
Supreme Court of Oklahoma, in approving the admission
of the testimony by the trial court, also treated the'petitioner as being the respondent's "ordinary grantee" of
the title to this land. It is not necessary foK us to determine whether that court relied upon one or the other,
or both, of these alternatives. Reliance on either would
make the disputed evidence admissible under the Oklahoma law.
Under this interpretation of the state law the answer
to the remaining federal question is obvious. It is clear
that the Federal Power Act cannot be said to have so far
affected the use of this land for a power site as to destroy
or otherwise render valueless the owner's right to use it for
that purpose. That Act merely has attached conditions
to the use of the land for a,power site. The Act seeks to
encourage rather than to prohibit the development of
power sites. It seeks to preserve or enhance, not to destroy, their value as such. While the Act has limited
the time and manner of the use of this particular land
for a power site, the Act has left great benefits available
to the owner from such a use of the land. The present
large development of this site by the petitioner under
a federal license is convincing proof of the value and
availability of the land for that purpose.
In a voluntary purchase of this land by the petitioner,
as a willing purchaser, from the respondent, as a willing

GRAND RIVER DAM v. GRAND-HYDRO.' 373
359

Opinion of the Court.

and unobligated seller, the value of it as a power site
inevitably would have entered into the negotiated price.
The petitioner and the respondent long have been competitors for the development of this site for power purposes. Each was granted, by state law, a right to condemn the land but the petitioner gained a priority over
the respondent by virtue of the Grand River Dam Authority Act. The petitioner's purchase amounts to an
acquisition of private property for a public use. The
petitioner makes no claim to any right to make use of
the natural asset of water power in the streams of the
State without paying the fair market value of the land
occupied for that purpose.
As between these two corporations seeking to determine
the sales price of this land, the Federal Power Act placed
no limitation upon 'their voluntary negotiations. The
present proceeding is in substance a part of their original
agreement for the sale of the land by the respondent
to the petitioner.
If either the United States, or its licensee as such, were
seeking to acquire this land under the Federal Power Act,
it might face different considerations from those stated
above. The United States enjoys special rights and
power in relation to navigable streams and also to streams
which affect interstate commerce. The United States,
however, is not a party to the present case. It is not
asserting its right to condemn this land. The petitioner,
likewise, is not seeking to enforce such rights as it might
have to condemn this land by'virtue of its federal license.9
Accordingly, we express no opinion upon what would be
the appropriate measure of value :in a condemnation action brought by the United States or by one of its
licensees in reliance upon rights derived under the Federal
Power Act.

It has been suggested that the provisions of the Federal
Power Act bearing upon the allowance of a valuation
for the project as part of the rate base of a federal licensee
may. be material in this case." Whatever the relation
of those provisions may be to this project, it is not such
as to change the Oklahoma law as to the fair market
value of the land between the 'parties to this case. It
may be that, at some later date when the petitioner,
as a federal licensee, shall be ready to sell power, the
Commission or other appropriate body will then give
consideration to the value to be allowed for this land
in the petitioner's rate base. There is, however, nothing
in the Federal Power Act that purports to prescribe the
price which a purchaser of laRd may pay voluntarily
and in. good faith for land which it later incorporates.
into a project.. There also is nothing in the Act which
prescribes that the seller, rather than the purchaser, or
that the condemnee, rather than the condemnor, of land
acquired for a project must absorb the reduction, if any,
which is to 3e made later in the allowance of value for
that land in the purchaser's rate base as compargd with
the original price paid for it by the purchaser in a negotiated purchase or in a state condemnation proceeding.
As to the question whether the Federal Power Act should
be interpreted as actually superseding 'the state law of
condemnation and as restricting the measure of valuation
which lawfully may be used by the courts of Oklahoma
in a condemnation action for the acquisition of land for

There also has .been a suggestion made of the possible
materiality in this case of those provisions of the Federal,
Power Act which relate to the price to be paid by the
United States in the event that it takes over the project
of a licensee upon or after the expiration of a federal
license.", The issues raised by that suggestion are comparable to those just discussed in relation to the rate base
of a federal project, except that such a recapture of the
project is even more remote than the determinationof a
rate base for the computation of rates to be charged for
its product. We accordingly express no opinion upon the
issues which'may arise when, as and if the above-mentioned proceedings may be taken.
For these reasons, the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Oklahoma is
Affirmed.

The result of this decision, no matter how it-is ration:alized, is to give the water-power value of the current
of a river to a private party who by reason of federal
law neither has nor can acquire any lawful claim to it.
The United States has asserted through the Federal
Power Act its'exclusive dominion and control over this
water power.' • That Act specifies how one may acquire
and procedure is to conform as nearly as may be with that in the
courts of the state where the property is situated. See 41 Stat. 1074,.

which the licensee must operate. See First Iowa Coop.
v. Federal Power Comm'n, 328 U. S. 152.
Petitioner has such a license. Respondent has none
and, for reasons unnecessary to relate here, concededly
cannot obtain one. Respondent therefore has no claim
to, the water-power value which the law can recognize,
tif the policy of the Federal Power Act is to be respected.
When respondent's claim is recognized, the effect is to
make petitioner pay a private claimant for a privilege
which only the United States can grant.
That is the bald result whether the condemnation takes
place in a state or a federal court. Whatever the procedure, the consequence is to give private parties an
entrenched property interest in the public domain, which
the Federal Power Act was designed to defeat.
The pubfic burden is the same and -the impairment
of the policy of the federal act is identical whether the
judgment is entered by a state or a federal court. -Never
before, I believe, has a federal right been allowed less
protection in a state court than it is entitled to receive
in the federal court.
