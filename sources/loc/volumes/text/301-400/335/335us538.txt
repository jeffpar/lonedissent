AMERICAN SASH & DOOR CO. ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ARIZONA.

No. 27. Argued November 8-10, 1948.-Decided January 3, 1949.
1. The amendment to the Arizona Constitution which provides. that
no person shall be denied the opportunity to obtain or retain
employment because of non-membership in a labor organization
and forbids anyone to enter into an agreement to do so does not
deny employers, labor unions or members of labor unions freedom
of speech, assembly or petition, or impair the. obligation oftheir
contracts, or deprive them of due process of law, contrary to the
Constitution of the United States. Lincoln Federal Labor Utiion
v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co., ante, p. 525. Pp. 539-54:
2. Nor does its failure to forbid like discrimination again3t union
members deny them equal protection of the laws contrary to the
Foujqteenth Amendment-especially irimiew of the fact that certain
Arizona statutes make it a misdemeanor for any person to coerce a
worker to make acontract "not to join or become a member of
a labor organization" as a condition of employment in Arizona and
make such contracts void and unenfor'ceable. Labor Board v.
--Jones & Laughlin Corp., 301 U. S.1. Pp. 540-54.2.
67 Ariz. 20, 189 P. 2d 912, affirmed.

In a suit by certain labor unions, an officer of one of
thexn and an employer for a declaratory judgment and
equitable relief against enforcement of the "Right-toWork Amendment" to the Arizona Constitution, an
Arizona trial court dismissed the'complaint on the ground
that the amendment did not violate the Constitution of
the United States. Th Supreme Court of Arizona
affirmed. 67 Ariz: 20, 189 P. 2d 912. On appeal to this
Court, affirmed, p. 542.

BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case is here on appeal fronk-the Supreme Court
of Arizona under § 237 of the Judicial Code as amended,
28 U. S. C. § 344 (now 28 U. S. C. § 1257). It involves
the constitutional validity of the following amendment to
the Arizona Constitution, adopted at the 1946 general
election:
"No person shall be denied the opportunity to obtain or retain employment because of non-membership in a labor organization, nor shall the state or
any subdivision thereof, or any corporation, 'individual or association of any kind enter into any
agreement, written or oral, which excludes any person
from employment or continuation of employment
because of non-membership in a labor organization."

United States Constitution"; that it impaired the obligations of existing contracts in violation- of Art. I, § 10, of
the United States Constitution; and that it deprived appellants of due process of law, and denied them equal
protection of the laws contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. All of these questions, properly reserved in the
state court, were decided against the appellants by the
State Supreme Court.! The same questions raised in the
state court are presented here.
For reasons given in two other cases decided today we
reject the appellants' contentions that the Arizona amendment denies them freedom of speech, Assembly ot petition,
impairs the obligation of their contracts, -or deprives them
of due process of law. Lincoln Federal Labor Union v.
Northwestern Iron & Metal Co. and Whitaker v. North
Carolina,ante, p. 525. A difference between the Arizona
amendment and the amendment and statute considered
in the Nebraska and North Carolina cases has made it
necessary for us to give separate consideration to the contention in this case that the Arizona amendment denies
appellants equal protection of the laws.
The language of the Arizona amendment
prohibits employment discrimination against non-union workers, but
it does not prohibit discrimination against union workers.
It is argued that a failure to provide the same protection
for union workers as that provided for non-union workers
places the union workers at a disadvantage, thus denying
unions and their members the equal protection of
Arizona's laws.
Although the Arizona amendment does not itself expressly prohibit discrimination against union workers,
that state has not left unions and union members without
protection from discrimination on account of union mem'American Federation of .Labor v. American Sash & Door Co.,

bership. Prior to passage of this constitutional amenament, Arizona made it a misdemeanor for any person to
coerce a worker to make a contract "not to join, become or
remain, a member of any labor organization" as a condition of getting or holding a job in Arizona. A section of
the Arizona Code made every such contract (generally
known as a "yellow dog contract") void and unenforceable.' Similarly, the Arizona constitutional amendment
makes void and unenforceable contracts under which an
employer agrees to discriminate against non-union workers.' Statutes implementing the amendment have provided as sanctions for its enforcement relief by injunction
and suits for damages for discrimination practiced in violation of the amendment
Whether the same kind of
sanctions would be afforded a-union worker against whom
an employer discriminated is not made clear by the opinion
of the State Supreme Court in. this case. But assuming
that Arizona courts would not afford a remedy by injunction or suit for damages, we are unable to find any indication that Arizona's amendment and statutes are
weighted on the side of non-union as against union
workers. We are satisfied that Arizona has. attemoted,
both in the inti-yellow-dog-contract law and in the antidiscrimination constitutional amendment to strike at
what were considered evils, to strike where those evils
were most felt, and to strike in a manner that would
effectively suppress the evils.
In Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin Corp., 301 U. S.
1, this Court considered a challenge to the National Labor
Relations Act on the ground that it applied restraints
,against employers but did not apply similar restraints
against wrongful conduct by. employees. We there

laws we have said that the existence of evils against which
the law should afford protection and the relative need of
different groups for that protection "is a matter for the
legislative judgment." West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,

Arizona, Nebraska, and North Carolina have passed
laws forbidding agreements to employ only union members. The United States Constitution is invoked against
these laws. Since the cases bring into question the
judicial process in its application to the Due Process
Clause, explicit avowal of individual attitudes towards
that process may elucidate and thereby strengthen adjudication. Accordingly, I set forth the steps by which I
have reached concurrence with my brethren on what I
deem the only substantial issue here, on all other issues
joining the Court's opinion.
.'The coming of the machine age tended to despoil
human personality. It turned men and women into
"hands." The industrial history of the early Nineteenth
Century demonstrated the helplessness of the individual
employee to achieve human dignity in a society so largely
affected by technological advances." Hence the trade
union made itself increasingly felt, not only as an indispensable weapon of self-defense on the part of work*[This is also a coneurrence in No. 47, Lincoln PederalLabor Union
v. Nor4thtestern Iron & Metal Co*, and No. 34, Whitaker v. North

ers but as an aid to the well-being of a society in which
work is an expression of life and not'merely the means
of earning subsistence. But unionization encountered
the shibboleths of a pre-machine age and these were reflected in juridical assumptions that survived the facts
on which they were based.. Adam Smith was treated as
though his generalizations had been imparted to him on
Sinai and-not as a thinker who addressed himself to the
elimination of restrictions which had become fetters
upon initiative and enterprise in his day. Basic human
rights expressed by the constitutional conception of "liberty" were equated with theories of laissez faire.' The
result was that economic views of confined validity were
treated by lawyers and judges as though th6 Framers had
enshrined them in the Constitution. This misapplication
of the notions of the classic economists and resulting disregard of the perduring reach of the Constitution led to
Mr. Justice Holmes' famous protest in the Lochner case
against measuring the Fourteenth Amendment by Mr.
Herbert Spencer's Social Statics. 198 U. S.45, 75, Had
not Mr. Justice Holmes' awareness of the impermanence
of legislation as against the permanence of the Constitution gradually prevailed, there might indeed have been
"hardly any limit but the sky" to the embodiment of "our'
economic or moral beliefs" in that Amendment's "prohibitions." Baldwin v. Missouri, 281 U. S.586, 595.
The attitude which regarded any legislative encroachment upon the existing economic order as infected with
unconstitutionality led to disrespect for legislative attempts to strengthen the wage-earner's bargaining power.
1 Of

course, theory never wholly. squared with the facts. Even
while laissez faire doctrines were dominant, State activity in economic
affairs was considerable. See Handlin, Commonwealth: A Study of
the Role of Government in the American Economy, Massachusetts,
1774-1861 (1947); Hartz, Economic Policy and Democratic Thought:
Pennsylvania, 1776-1860 (1948).

With that attitude as a premise, Adair v. United States,
208 U. S. 161, and Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U. S. 1,
followed logically enough; not even Truax v. Corrigan,
257 U. S. 312, could be considered unexpected. But when
the tide turned, it was not merely because circumstances
had changed and there had arisen a new order with new
claims to divine. origin. The opinion of Mr. Justice
Brandeis in Senn v. Tile Layers Union, 301 U. S. 468,
shows the current running strongly in the new directionthe direction not of social dogma but of increased deference to the legislative judgment. "Whether it was wise,"
he said, now speaking for the Court and not in dissent,
"for the State to permit the unions to [picket] is a question
of its public policy-not our concern." Id. at 481. Long
before that, in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254
U. S. 443, 488, he had warned:
"All rights are derived from the purposes of the
society in which they exist; above all rights rises duty
to the community. The conditions developed in
industry may be such that those engaged in it cannot
continue their struggle without danger to the community. But it is not for judges to determine
whether such conditions exist, nor is it their function. to set the limits of permissible contest and to
declare the duties which the new situation demands.
This is the function of the legislature which, while
\limiting individual and group. rights of aggression
'and defense, may substitute processes of justice for
the more primitive method of trial by combat."
Unfons are powers within the State. Like the power
of industrial and financial aggregations, the power of
organized labor springs from a group which is only a
fraction of the whole that Mr. Justice Holmes referred to
ashe one club to which we all belong." The power of
the former is subject to control, though, of course, the

particular incidence of control may be brought to test
at the bar of this Court. E. g., Northern Securities Co. v.
United States, 193 U, S. 197; North American Co. v.
S. E. C., 327 U. S. 686. Neither can the latter claim constitutional exemption. Even the Government-the organ
of the whole people-is restricted by the system of checks
and balances established by our Constitution, The designers of that system distributed authority among the
three branches "not to promote efficiency but to preclude
the exercise of arbitrary power." Mr. Justice Brandeis,
dissenting in Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 293.
Their concern for individual members of society, for whose
well-being government is instituted, gave urgency to the
fear that concentrated power would become arbitrary. It
is a fear that the history of such power, even when professedly employed for democratic purposes, has hardly
rendered unfounded.
If concern for the individual justifies incorporating in
the Constitution itself devices to curb public authority, a
legislative judgment that his protection requires the regulation of the private power of unions cannot be dismissed
as insupportable. A union is no more than a medium
through which individuals are able to act together; union
power was begotten of individual helplessness. But that
power can come into being only when, and continue to
exist only so long as, individual aims are seen to be
shared in common with the other members of the group.
There is a natural emphasis, however, on what is shared
and a resulting tendency to subordinate the inconsistent
interests and impulses of individuals. From this, it is
an easy transition to thinking of 'the union as an entity
having rights and purposes of its own. An ardent supporter of trade unions who is also no less a disinterested
student of society has pointed out that "As soon as we
personify the idea, whether it is a country or a church,
a trade union or an employers' association,. we obscure

individual responsibility by transferring emotional loyalties to a fictitious creation which then acts upon up
psychologically as an obstruction, especially in times of
crisis, to the critical exercise of a reasoned judgment."
Laski, Morris Cohen's Approach to Legal Philosophy,
15 U. of Chi. L. Rev. 575, 581 (1948).
The right-of association, like any other right carried to
its extreme, encounters limiting principles. See Hudson
County Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U. S.349, 355. At
the point where the mutual advantage of association demands too much individual disadvantage, a compromise
must be struck. See Dicey, Law and Public Opinion in
England 46566 (1905). When that point has been
reached-where the intersection should fall-iq plainly a
question within the special province of the legislature.
This Court has given effect to such a compromise in sustaining a legislative purpose to protect individual employees iagainst the exclusionary practices of unions. Steele v.

as unconstitu4ional what goes against the grain because
it offends what we may strongly believe to be socially
desirable, that resolution must be given respect.
It -is-urged that the compromise which this legislation
embodies is no compromise at all because fatal to the
survival of organized labor. But can it be said that the
legislators and the people of Arizona,. Nebraska, and
North Carolina could not in reason be sceptical of organized labor's insistence upon the necessity to its strength of
power to compel rather than to persuade the allegiance of
its reluctant members? In the past fifty years the total
number of employed, counting salaried workers and the
self-employed but not farmers or farm laborers, has not
quite trebled, while total union membership has increased
more than thirty-three times; at the time of the openshop -drive following the First World War, the ratio of
organized to unorganized non-agricultural workers was
about one to. nine, and now it is almost one to three."
However necessitous may have been the circumstances ,of
unionism in 1898 or even in 1923, its status in 1948 precludes constitutional condemnation of a legislative judgment, whatever we may think of it, that the need of this
type of regulation outweighs its detriments. It would be
arbitrary for this Court to deny the States the right to
experiment with such laws, especially in view of the fact

pressure of public opinion-these are questions on which
it is not for us to .express views. The very limited function of this Court is diicharged when we recognize, that
these issues are not so unrelated to the experience and
feelings of the community as to render legislation addressing itself to them wilfully destructive of cherished
rights. For these are not matters, like censorship of the
press or separation of Church and State, on which history,
through the Constitution, speaks-so decisively as to forbid
legislative experimentation.
But the policy which finds expression in the prohibition
of union-security agreements need not rest solely on a
legislative conception of the public interest which includes but transcends the special claims of trade unions.
The States are entitled to give weight to views combining
opposition to the "closed shop" with long-range concern
for the welfare of trade unions. Mr. Justice Brandeis,
for example, before he came to this Court, had been a
staunch promoter of unionism. In testifying before the
Commission on Industrial Relations, he said:
"I should say to those employers who stand for
the open shop, that they ought to recognize that it
is for their interests as well as that of the community"that unions should be powerful and responsible; that it is to their interests to build up the
union; to aid as far as they can in making them
stto'hger; and to create conditions under which the
unions shall be led by the ablest and most experienced men." 6
Sen. Doc. No. 415, 64th Cong., 1si Sess.-7681. For other expressions of Mr. Justice Brandeis' sympathy for the cause of trade unions,

Unions, in Business-A Profession 13 (1914); Industrial Co-operation, 3 Filene Co-operative Assc :iation Echo, No. 3, p. 1 (May, 1905),

Yet- at the same time he believed that "The objections,
legal, economic, and social, against the closed shop are '
so strong, and the ideas of the closed shop so antagonistic
to the American spirit, that the insistence upon it has
been a serious obstacle to union progress." Letter of
Sept. 6; 1910, to Lawrence F. Abbott of the Outlook.! On
another occasion he wrote, "But the American people
should not, and will not, accept unionism if it involves
the closed shop. They kvill not consent to the exchange
of the tyranny of th employer for the tyranny of the
employee." Letter of Feb. 26, 1912, to Lincoln Steffens.'
In summing up his views on unionism, he said:
"It is not true that the 'success of a labor union'
necessarily means a 'perfect monopoly'. The union,
in order to attain or preserve for its members industrial liberty, must be strong and stable. It need
not include every member of the trade. Indeed, it is
desirable for both the employer and the union that
it should not. Absolute power leads to excesses and
to weaknas: Neither our character nor our intelligence can long bear the strain of unrestricted
power. The union attains success when it reaches

the closed or union shop, Mr. Brandeis advocated the "preferential

Nebraska, and North Carolina laws. For accounts of the working

the trade outside its own ranks an appreciable number of men who are non-unionists. In any free community the diversity of character, of beliefs, of
taste-indeed mere selfishness-will insure such a
supply, if the enjoyment of this privilege of individualism is protected by law. Such a nucleus of unorganized labor will check oppression by the union as
the union checks oppression by the employer."
Quoted from Louis D. Brandeis' contribution to a discussion entitled Peace with Liberty and Justice in2 Nat. Civic Federation Rev., No. 2, pp. 1, 16 (May
15, 1905).
Mr. Brandeis on the long view deemed the preferential
shop a more reliable form of security both for unions
and for society. than the closed shop; that he did so
only serves to prove that these are pragmatic issues not
appropriate for dogmatic solution.
Whatever one may think of Mr. Brandeis' views, they
have been reinforced by the adoption of laws insuring
against that undercutting of union standards Which was
one of the most serious effects of a dissident minority
in a union shop. Under interpretations of the National
Labor Relations Act undisturbed by the Taft-Hartley
Act,' and of the Railway Labor Act, the bargaining
representative designated by a majority of employees has
exclusive power to deal with the employer on matters of
wages and working conditions. Individual contracts,
whether on more or less favorable terms than those obtained by the union, are barred. J. I. Case Co. v. Labor

J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325 U. S. 711, 737, n. 35. Under

Even where the social undesirability of a law may
be convincingly urged, invalidation of the law by a court
debilitates popular democratic government. Most laws
dealing with economic and social problems are matters of
trial and error."' That which before trial appears to be
demonstrably bad may belie prophecy in actual operation. It may not prove good, but it may prove innocuous. But even if a law is found wanting on trial, it is
better that its defects should be demonstrated and removed than that the law should be aborted by judicial
fiat. Such an assertion of judicial power deflects responsibility from those on whom in a democratic society it
ultimately rests-the people. If the proponents of unionsecurity agreements have confidence .in the arguments
addressed to the Court in their "economic brief," they
should address those arguments to the electorate. Its
endorsement would be a vindication that the mandate
of this Court could never give. That such vindication

recognized need were the bank-deposit guaranty laws passed in the
wake of the panic of 1907 by Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.
Despite serious doubts of their wisdom, the laws were sustained

against due-process attack in Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U. S.
104 and 575; Shallenberger v. First State Bank, 219 U. S. 114;
Assaria State Bank v. Dolley, 219 U. S. 121. Experience proved the
laws to be unworkable, see Robb, Guaranty of Bank Deposits in
2 Encyc. Soc. Sciences 417 (1930). But since no due-process obstacle
stood in the way, it remained possible to profit by past errors and
attempt a more mature solution of the problem on a national scale.

But there is reason for judicial restraint in matters of
policy deeper than the value of experiment: it is founded
on a recognition of the gulf of difference between sustaining and nullifying legislation. This difference is
theoretical in that the function of legislating is for legislatures who have also taken oaths to support the Constitution, while the function of courts, when legislation
is challenged, is merely to make sure that the legislature
has exercised an allowable judgment, and not to exercise
their own judgment, whether a policy is within or without
"the vague contours" of due process. Theory is reinforced by the notorious fact that lawyers predominate in
American legislatures." In practice also the difference
is wide. In the day-to-day working of our democracy it
is vital that the power of the non-democratic organ of
our Government be exercised with rigorous self-restraint.
Because the powers exercised by this Court are inherently
oligarchic, Jefferson all of his life thought .of the Court

ends. As history amply prove4, the judiciary is prone
to misconceive the public good by ,confounding private
notions with constitutional requirements, and such misconceptions are not subject to legitimute displacement

Judges appointed for life whose decisio s run counter

supplanted by men of views more consbnant with it.
They are even farther removed from democratic pressures by the fact that their deliberations are in secret
and remain beyond disclosure either by periodic reports
or by such a modem device for securing responsibility
to the e7 .ctorate as the "press conference." But a democracy need not rely on the courts to save it from its own
.unwisdom. If it is alert-and without alertness by the
people there can be no enduring democracy-unwise or
unfair legislation can readily be removed from the statute
books. It is by such vigilance over its representatives
that democracy proves itself.

17 In time, of course, constitutional obstacles may disappear or be
removed. Yet almost twenty years elapsed between invalidation of
the income tax in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 158 U. S.
601, and adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment.

And it took twenty

years to establish the constitutionality of a minimum wage for
women: it was put in jeopardy by an equally divided Court in
Stettler v. O'Hara, 243 U. S. 629, and found unconstitutional in
Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U. S. 525, which was not overruled until West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,300 U. S. 379, 400. The
frustration of popular government, moreover, is not confined to the

specific law struck down; its backwash drowns unnumbered projects
that might otherwise be put to trial.

into question. But the implications of 'that right and
the conditions for its exercise must constantly be kept
in mind and vigorously observed. Because the Court is
without power to shape measures for dealing with the
problems of society but has merely the power of negation over measures shaped by others, the indispensable
judicial requisite is intellectual humility, and such humility presupposes complete, disinterestedness. And so, in
the end, it is right that the Court should be indifferent to
public temper and popular wishes. Mr. Dooley's "th'
Supreme Coort follows th' iliction returns" expressed the
wit of cynicism, not the demand of principle. A court
which yields to the popular will thereby licenses itself
to practice despotism, for there can be no assurance that
it will not on another occasion indulge its own will.
Courts can fulfill their responsibility in a democratic
society only to the extent that they succeed in shaping
their judgments by rational standards, and rational standards are both impersonal and communicable. Matters
of policy, however, are by definition matters which
demand the resolution of conflicts of value, and the
elements of conflicting values are largely imponderable.
Assessment of their competing worth involves differences
of feeling; it is also an exercise in prophecy. Obviously
the proper forum for mediating a clash of. feelings and
rendering a prophetic judgment.is the body chosen for
those purposes by the people. Its functions can be
assumed by this Court only in disregard of the historic
limits of the Constitution.

violated the statute "by executing a written agreement
or contract" for a closed or union shop.1 There was
neither charge nor evidence that the employer, after the
statute became effective, had refused employment to any
person because he was not a member of a union. The
charge, therefore, and the conviction were limited to the
making of the contract. No other provision of the statute
is now involved, as the state's attorney general conceded,
indeed as he strongly urged, in the argument here. As.
against the constitutional objections raised to this application of the statute, I agree that the legislature has power
to proscribe the making of such contracts, and accordingly
join in the udgment affirming the convictions.

I am also in agreement with the Court's decision, but
subject to the following reservation. Because no strike
has been involved in any of the states of fact, no question has been presented in any of these cases immediately
involving the right to strike or concerning 'the effect of
the Thirteenth Amendment. Yet the issues so closely
approach touching that right as it exists or 'may exist
under that Amendment that the possible effect of the
decisions upon it hardly can be ignored.2 Strikes have
been called throughout union history in defense of the
right of union members not to work with nonunion men.
If today's decision should be construed to permit a state
to foreclose that right by making illegal the concerted
refusal of union members to work with nonunion workers,
*and more especially if the decision should be taken as
going so far as to permit a state to enjoin such a strike,8
I should want a complete and thorough reargument of
'these cases before deciding so momentous a question.
But the right to prohibit contracts for union security is
one thing. The right to force union members to work
with nonunion workers is entirely another. Because of
this difference, I expressly reserve judgment upon the
latter question until it is squarely .and inescapably presented. Although this reservation is not made expressly
by the Court, I do not understand its opinion to foreclose
this question.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY concurs in this opinion insofar
as it applies to Nos. 34 and 47.

See note 3.

The syllogism might well be: The decisions in the present cases
permit a state to make "illegal" any discrimination against nonunion
workers on account of that status in relation to securing or retaining
employment; strikes- for "illegal objects" are "unlawful"; "unlawful"
strikes may be enjoined; a strike by union members against working
with-nonunion employees is a strike for au "le-al ohl€oje theiefore
such a strike may be enjoined.-
