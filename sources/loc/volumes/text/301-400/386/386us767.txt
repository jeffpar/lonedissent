REDRUP v. NEW YORK.
CERTIORARI TO THE APPELLATE TERM OF THE SUPREME
COURT OF NEW YORK, FIRST JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.

No. 3.

Argued October 10, 1966.-Decided May 8, 1967.*

Petitioners in Nos. 3 and 16 were convicted for violating New York
and Kentucky laws, respectively, concerning the sale of allegedly
obscene publications. In No. 50 the Arkansas courts in a civil
proceeding declared certain issues of specific magazines to be
obscene, enjoined their distribution, and ordered their destruction.
Held: These cases can be and are decided upon their common
constitutional basis that the distribution of the publications is
protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments from governmental suppression.
No. 50, 239 Ark. 474, 393 S. W. 2d 219, and Nos. 3 and 16, reversed.

Sam Rosenwein argued the cause for petitioner in
No. 3. With him on the briefs were Stanley Fleishman
and Osmond K. Fraenkel. Mr. Fleishman argued the
cause and filed briefs for petitioner in No. 16. Emanuel
Redfield argued the cause and filed briefs for appellants
in No. 50.
H. Richard Uviller argued the cause for respondent in
No. 3. With him on the brief were Frank S. Hogan and
Alan F. Scribner. John B. Browning, Assistant Attorney
General of Kentucky, argued the cause for respondent in
No. 16. With him on the brief was Robert Matthews,
Attorney General. Fletcher Jackson, Assistant Attorney
General of Arkansas, argued the cause for appellee in
No. 50. With him on the brief were Bruce Bennett,
Attorney General, H. Clay Robinson, Assistant Attorney
General, and Jack L. Lessenberry.
*Together with No. 16, Austin v. Kentucky, on certiorari to the
Circuit Court of McCracken County, Kentucky, argued on' October
10-11, 1966, and No. 50, Gent et al. v. Arkansas, on appeal from
the Supreme Court of Arkansas, argued October 11, 1966.

Morris B. Abram and Jay Greenfield filed briefs for
the Council for Periodical Distributors Associations, Inc.,
as amicus curiae, urging reversal in all three cases.
Horace S. Manges filed a brief for American Book Publishers Council, Inc., as amicus curiae, urging reversal in
No' 50.
Charles H. Keating, Jr., and James J. Clancy filed
briefs for Citizens for Decent Literature, Inc., as amicus
curiae, urging affirmance in Nos. 3 and 16.
PER CURIAM.

These three cases arise from a recurring conflict-the
conflict between asserted state power to suppress the distribution of books and magazines through criminal or civil
proceedings, and the guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.
I.
In No. 3, Redrup v. New York, the petitioner was a
clerk at a New York City newsstand. A plainclothes
patrolman approached the newsstand, saw two paperback
books on a rack-Lust Pool, and Shame Agent--and
asked for them by name. The petitioner handed him
the books and collected the price of $1.65. As a result
of this transaction, the petitioner was charged in the
New York City Criminal Court with violating a state
criminal law.1 He was convicted, and the conviction was
affirmed on appeal.
In No. 16, Austin v. Kentucky, the petitioner owned
and operated a retail bookstore and newsstand in Paducah,
Kentucky. A woman resident of Paducah purchased two
magazines from a salesgirl in the petitioner's store, after
asking for them by name-High Heels, and Spree. As a
result of this transaction the petitioner stands convicted

in the Kentucky courts for violating a criminal law of
that State.'
In No. 50, Gent v. Arkansas, the prosecuting attorney
of the Eleventh Judicial District of Arkansas brought a
civil proceeding under a state statute,' to have certain
issues of various magazines declared obscene, to enjoin
their distribution and to obtain a judgment ordering their
surrender and destruction. The magazines proceeded
against were: Gent, Swank, Bachelor, Modern Man,
Cavalcade, Gentleman, Ace, and Sir. The County
Chancery Court entered the requested judgment after a
trial 'with an advisory jury, and the Supreme4 Court of
Arkansas affirmed, with minor modifications.
In none of the cases was there a claim that the statute
in question reflected a specific and limited state concern
for juveniles. See Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S.
158; cf. Butler v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380. In none was
there any suggestion of an assault upon individual privacy by publication in a manner so obtrusive as to make
it impossible for an unwilling individual to avoid exposure to it. Cf. Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622;
Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak, 343 U. S. 451. And in
none was there evidence of the sort of "pandering" which
the Court found significant in Ginzburg v. United States,
383 U. S. 463.

The Court originally limited
certain particularized questions,
the material involved in each
described as "obscene in the

review in these cases to

case was of a character

Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413, 418.' But
we have concluded that the hypothesis upon which the
Court originally proceeded was invalid, and accordingly
that the cases can and should be decided upon a common
and controlling fundamental constitutional basis, without
prejudice to the questions upon which review was originally granted. We have concluded, in short, that the
distribution of the publications in each of these cases
is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments
from governmental suppression, whether criminal or
civil, in persanam or in rem.8
Two members of the Court have consistently adhered
to the view that a State is utterly without power to suppress, control, or punish the distribution of any wrtings
or pictures upon the ground of their "obscenity."" A
third has held to the opinion that a State's power in
this area is narrowly limited to a distinct and clearly
identifiable class of material.' Others have subscribed
to a not dissimilar standard, holding that a State may not
constitutionally inhibit the distribution of literary material as obscene unless "(a) the dominant theme of the
material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest
in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it

6 In each of the cases before us, the contention that the publications involved were basically Protected by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments was timely but unsuccessfully asserted in the state
proceedings. In each of these cases, this contention was properly
and explicitly presented for review here.

case is reversed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins,
dissenting.
Two of these cases, Redrup v. New York and Austin v.
Kentucky, were taken to consider the standards governing the application of the scienter requirement announced
in Smith v. California,361 U. S. 147, for obscenity prosecutions. There it was held that a defendant criminally
charged with purveying obscene material must be shown
to have had some kind of knowledge of the character of
such material; the quality of that knowledge, however,
was not defined. The third case, Gent v. Arkansas, was
taken to consider the validity of a comprehensive Arkansas anti-obscenity statute, in light of the doctrines of
"vagueness" and "prior restraint." The writs of certiorari
in Redrup and Austin, and the notation of probable
jurisdiction in Gent, were respectively limited to these
issues, thus laying aside, for the purposes of these cases,
the permissibility of the state determinations as to the
obscenity of the challenged publications. Accordingly,
the obscenity vel non of these publications was not dis-

cussed in the briefs or oral arguments of any of the
parties.
The three cases were argued together at the beginning
of this Term. Today, the Court rules that the materials
could not constitutionally be adjudged obscene by the
States, thus rendering adjudication of the other issues
unnecessary. In short, the Court disposes of the cases
on the issue that was deliberately excluded from review,
and refuses to pass on the questions that brought the
cases here.
In my opinion these dispositions do not reflect well
on the processes of the Court, and I think the issues for
which the cases were taken should be decided. Failing
that, I prefer to cast my vote to dismiss the writs in
Redrup and Austin as improvidently granted and, in the
circumstances, to dismiss the appeal in Gent for lack of
a substantial federal question. I deem it more appropriate to defer an expression of my own views on the
questions brought here until an occasion when the Court
is prepared to come to grips with such issues.
