ET AL.

ON EXCEPTIONS TO SPECIAL MASTER'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDED DECREE.

No. 8, Original. Argued January 8-11, 1962.-Restored to calendar
for reargument June 4, 1962.-Reargued November 13-14,
1962.-Decided June 3, 1963.
This original suit was brought in this Court by the State of Arizona
against the State of California and seven of its public agencies.
Later Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and the United States became
parties. The basic controversy is over how much water each State
has a legal right to use out of the waters of the Colorado River and
its tributaries. A Special Master appointed by the Court conducted a lengthy trial and filed a report containing his findings,
conclusions and recommended decree, to which various parties took
exceptions. Held:
1. In passing the Boulder Canyon Project Act, Congress intended
to, and did, create its own comprehensive scheme for the apportionment among California, Arizona and Nevada of the Lower Basin's
share of the mainstream waters of the Colorado River, leaving
each State her own tributaries. It decided that a fair division of
the first 7,500,000 acre-feet of such mainstream waters would
give 4,400,000 acre-feet to California, 2,800,000 to Arizona, and
300,000 to Nevada, and that Arizona and California should each
get one-half of any surplus. Congress gave the Secretary of the
Interior adequate authority to accomplish this division by giving
him power to make contracts for the delivery of water and by providing that no person could have water without a contract. Pp.
546-590.
(a) Apportionment among the Lower Basin States of that
Basin's Colorado River water is not controlled by the doctrine of
equitable apportionment or by the Colorado River Compact. Pp.
565-567.
(b) No matter what waters the Compact apportioned, the
Project Act itself dealt only with water of the mainstream and reserved to each State the exclusive use of the waters of her own
tributaries. Pp. 567-575.

Syllabus.

(c) The legislative history of the Act, its language and the
scheme established by it for the storage and delivery of water show
that Congress intended to provide its own method for a complete
apportionment of the Lower Basin's share of the mainstream water
among Arizona, California and Nevada; and Congress intended the
Secretary of the Interior, through his contracts under § 5, both to
carry out the allocation of the waters of the main Colorado River
among the Lower Basin States and to decide which users within each
State would get water. Pp. 575-585.
(d) It is the Act and the contracts made by the Secretary of
the Interior under § 5, not the law of prior appropriation, that control the apportionment of water among the States; and the Secretary, in choosing between the users within each State and in settling
the terms of his contracts, is not required by §§ 14 and 18 of the
Act to follow state law. Pp. 585-586.
(e) Section 8 of the Reclamation Act does not require the
United States, in the delivery of water, to follow priorities laid
down by state law; and the Secretary is not bound by state law
in disposing of water under the Project Act. Pp. 586-587.
(f) The general saving language of § 18 of the Project Act
does not bind the Secretary by state law or nullify the contract
power expressly conferred upon him by § 5. Pp. 587-588.
(g) Congress has put the Secretary of the Interior in charge
of a whole network of useful projects constructed by the Federal
Government up and down the Colorado River, and it has entrusted
him with sufficient power, principally the § 5 contract power, to
direct, manage and coordinate their operation. This power must
be construed to permit him to allocate and distribute the waters
of the mainstream of the Colorado River within the boundaries set
down by the Act. Pp. 588-590.
2. Certain provisions in the Secretary's contracts are sustained,
with one exception. Pp. 590-592.
(a) The Secretary's contracts with Arizona and Nevada are
sustained, insofar as they provide that any waters diverted by
those States out of the mainstream above Lake Mead must
be charged to their respective Lower Basin apportionments; but he
cannot reduce water deliveries to those States by the amount
of their uses from tributaries above Lake Mead, since Congress
intended to apportion only the mainstream, leaving to each State
her own tributaries. Pp. 590-591.

OCTOBER TERM, 1962.

373 U. S.

(b) The fact that the Secretary has made a contract directly
with the State of Nevada, through her Colorado River Commission, for the delivery of water does not impair the Secretary's
power to require Nevada water users, other than the State, to
make further contracts. Pp. 591-592.
3. In case of water shortage, the Secretary is not bound to
require a pro rata sharing of shortages. He must follow the
standards set out in the Act; but he is free to choose among the
recognized methods of apportionment or to devise reasonable
methods of his own, since Congress has given him full power to
control, manage and operate the Government's Colorado River
works and to make contracts for the sale and delivery of water on
such terms as are not prohibited by the Act. Pp. 592-594.
4. With respect to the conflicting claims of Arizona and New
Mexico to water in the Gila River, the compromise settlement
agreed upon by those States and incorporated in the Master's
recommended decree is accepted by this Court. Pp. 594-595.
5. As to the claims asserted by the United States to waters in
the main river and some of its tributaries for use on Indian reservations, national forests, recreational and wildlife areas and other
government lands and works, this Court approves the Master's
decision as to which claims required adjudication, and it approves
the decree he recommended for the government claims he did
decide. Pp. 595-601.
(a) This Court sustains the Master's finding that, when the
United States created the Chemehuevi, Cocopah, Yuma, Colorado
River and Fort Mohave Indian Reservations in Arizona, California
and Nevada, or added to them, it reserved not only the land but
also the use of enough water from the Colorado River to irrigate
the irrigable portions of the reserved lands. Pp. 595-597.
(1) The doctrine of equitable apportionment should not be
used to divide the water .between the Indians and the other people
in the State of Arizona. P. 597.
(2) Under its broad powers to regulate navigable waters
under the Commerce Clause and to regulate government lands
under Art. IV, § 3, of the Constitution, the United States had power
to reserve water rights for its reservations and its property. Pp.
597-598.
(3) The reservations of land and water are not invalid
though they were originally set apart by Executive Order. P. 598.

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.

Syllabus.

(4) The United States reserved the water rights for the
Indians, effective as of the time the Indian reservations were
created, and these water rights, having vested before the Act
became effective in 1929, are "present perfected rights" and as such
are entitled to priority under the Act. Pp. 598-600.
(5) This Court sustains the Master's conclusions that
enough water was intended to be reserved to satisfy the future, as
well as the present, needs of the Indian reservations and that
enough water was reserved to irrigate all the practicably irrigable
acreage on the reservations, and also his findings as to the various
acreages of irrigable land existing on the different reservations.
Pp. 600-601.
(b) This Court disagrees with the Master's decision to determine the disputed boundaries of the Colorado River Indian Reservation and the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation, since it is not
necessary to resolve those disputes here. P. 601.
(c) This Court agrees with the Master's conclusions that the
United States intended to reserve water sufficient for the future
requirements of the Lake Mead National Recreational Area, the
Havasu Lake National Wildlife Refuge, the Imperial National
Wildlife Refuge and the Gila National Forest. P. 601.
(d) This Court rejects the claim of the United *States that
it is entitled to the use, without charge against its consumption, of
any waters that would have been wasted but for salvage by the
Government on its wildlife preserves. P. 601.
(e) This Court agrees with the Master that all uses of mainstream water within a State are to be charged against that State's
apportionment, which, of course, includes uses by the United
States. P. 601.

State of California and seven of its public agencies.
Later, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and the United States
were added as parties either voluntarily or on motion.'
The basic controversy in the case is over how much water
each State has a legal right to use out of the waters of the
Colorado River and its tributaries. After preliminary
pleadings, we referred the case to George I. Haight,
Esquire, and upon his death in 1955 to Simon H. Rifkind,
Esquire, as Special Master to take evidence, find facts,
state conclusions of law, and recommend a decree, all
"subject to consideration, revision, or approval by the
Court."' The Master conducted a trial lasting from
June 14, 1956, to August 28, 1958, during which 340 witnesses were heard orally or by deposition, thousands of
exhibits were received, and 25,000 pages of transcript were
filled. Following many motions, arguments, and briefs,
the Master in a 433-page volume reported his findings,
conclusions, and recommended decree, received by the
Court on January 16, 1961.' The case has been extensively
briefed here and orally argued twice, the first time about
16 hours, the second, over six. As we see this case, the
question of each State's share of the waters of the Colorado and its tributaries turns on the meaning and the scope
of the Boulder Canyon Project Act passed by Congress in

1928.6 That meaning and scope can be better understood
when the Act is set against its background-the gravity
of the Southwest's water problems; the inability of local
groups or individual States to deal with these enormous
problems; the continued failure of the States to agree
on how to conserve and divide the waters; and the
ultimate action by Congress at the request of the States
creating a great system of dams and public works
nationally built, controlled, and operated for the purpose
of conserving and distributing the water.
The Colorado River itself rises in the mountains of
Colorado and flows generally in a southwesterly direction
for about 1,300 miles through Colorado, Utah, and Arizona
and along the Arizona-Nevada and Arizona-California
boundaries, after which it passes into Mexico and empties
into the Mexican waters of the Gulf of California. On
its way to the sea it receives tributary waters from Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona.
The river and its tributaries flow in a natural basin
almost surrounded by large mountain ranges and drain
242,000 square miles, an area about 900 miles long from
north to south and 300 to 500 miles wide from east to
west-practically one-twelfth the area of the continental
United States excluding Alaska. Much of this large basin
is so arid that it is, as it always has been, largely dependent
upon managed use of the.waters of the Colorado River
System to make it productive and inhabitable. The
Master refers to archaeological evidence that as lofig as
2,000 years ago the ancient Hohokam tribe built and
maintained irrigation canals near what is now Phoenix,
Arizona, and that American Indians were practicing irrigation in that region at the time white men first explored
it. In the second half of the nineteenth century a group

Opinion of the Court.

of people interested in California's Imperial Valley conceived plans to divert water from the mainstream of the
Colorado to give life and growth to the parched and barren
soil of that valley. As the most feasible route was through
Mexico, a Mexican corporation was formed and a canal
dug partly in Mexico and partly in the United States.
Difficulties which arose because the canal was subject to
the sovereignty of both countries generated hopes in this
country that some day there would be a canal wholly
within the United States, an all-American canal.'
During the latter part of the nineteenth and the first
part of the twentieth centuries, people in the Southwest
continued to seek new ways to satisfy their water needs,
which by that time were increasing rapidly as new settlers
moved into this fast-developing region. But none of the
more or less primitive diversions made from the mainstream of the Colorado conserved enough water to meet
the growing needs of the basin. The natural flow of the
Colorado was too erratic, the river at many places in
canyons too deep, and the engineering and economic
hurdles too great for small farmers, larger groups, or even
States to build storage dams, construct canals, and install
the expensive works necessary for a dependable yearround water supply. Nor were droughts the basin's only
problem; spring floods due to melting snows and seasonal
storms were a recurring menace, especially disastrous in
California's Imperial Valley where, even after the Mexican canal provided a more dependable water supply, the
threat of flood remained at least as serious as before.
Another troublesome problem was the erosion of land
and the deposit of silt which fouled waters, choked irrigation works, and damaged good farmland and crops.

It is not surprising that the pressing necessity to transform the erratic and often destructive flow of the Colorado
River into a controlled and dependable water supply
desperately needed in so many States began to be talked
about and recognized as far more than a purely local
problem which could be solved on a farmer-by-farmer,
group-by-group, or even state-by-state basis, desirable
as this kind of solution might have been. The inadequacy of a local solution was recognized in the Report
of the All-American Canal Board of the United States
Department of the Interior on July 22, 1919, which detailed the widespread benefits that could be expected from
construction by the United States of a large reservoir on
the mainstream of the Colorado and an all-American
canal to the Imperial Valley.' Some months later, May
18, 1920, Congress passed a bill offered by Congressman
Kinkaid of Nebraska directing the Secretary of the
Interior to make a study and report of diversions which
might be made from the Colorado River for irrigation
in the Imperial Valley.9 The Fall-Davis Report," submitted to Congress in compliance with the Kinkaid Act,
began by declaring, "The control of the floods and
development of the resources of the Colorado River are
peculiarly national problems

. . ." "

and then went on

to give reasons why this was so, concluding with the statement that the job was so big that only the Federal Government could do it. 2 Quite naturally, therefore, the

Opinion of the Court.

Report recommended that the United States construct
as a government project not only an all-American canal
from the Colorado River to the Imperial Valley but also
a dam and reservoir at or near Boulder Canyon.'
The prospect that the United States would undertake
to build as a national project the necessary works to control floods and store river waters for irrigation was apparently a welcome one for the basin States. But it brought
to life strong fears in the northern basin States that additional waters made available by the storage and canal
projects might be gobbled up in perpetuity by faster growing lower basin areas, particularly California, before the
upper States could appropriate what they believed to be
their fair share. These fears were not without foundation, since the law of prior appropriation prevailed in
most of the Western States.'
Under that law the one
who first appropriates water and puts it to beneficial use
thereby acquires a vested right to continue to divert and
use that quantity of water against all claimants junior to
him in point of time." "First in time, first in right" is
the shorthand expression of this legal principle. In 1922,
only four months after the Fall-Davis Report, this Court
in Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, held that the
"3. It is a navigable river.

"4. Its waters may be made to serve large areas of public lands
naturally desert in character.
"5. Its problems are of such magnitude as to be beyond the reach
of other than national solution." Ibid.
13 Id., at 21.
14 This law prevails exclusively in all the basin States except California. See I Wiel, Water Rights in the Western States § 66 (3d ed.,
1911); Hutchins, Selected Problems in the Law of Water Rights in the
West 30-31 (1942) (U. S. Dept. of Agriculture Misc. Pub. No. 418).

doctrine of prior appropriation could be given interstate
effect." This decision intensified fears of Upper Basin
States that they would not get their fair share of Colorado River water." In view of California's phenomenal
growth, the Upper Basin States had particular reason to
fear that California, by appropriating and using Colorado
River water before the upper States, would, under the
interstate application of the prior appropriation doctrine,
be "first in time" and therefore "first in right." Nor were
such fears limited to the northernmost States. Nevada,
Utah, and especially Arizona were all apprehensive that
California's rapid declaration of appropriative claims
would deprive them of their just share of basin water
available after construction of the proposed United States
project. It seemed for a time that these fears would keep
the States from agreeing on any kind of division of the
river waters. Hoping to prevent "conflicts" and "expensive litigation" which would hold up or prevent the
tremendous benefits expected from extensive federal development of the river,18 the basin States requested and
Congress passed an Act on August 19, 1921, giving the

"'The upper state has but one alternative, that of using every

the upper state have reached their maximum. The states may avoid
this unfortunate situation by determining their respective rights by

permitting freedom of development in the lower state without injury

Opinion of the Court.

States consent to negotiate and enter into a compact for
the "equitable division and apportionment . . . of the
water supply of the Colorado River." '9
Pursuant to this congressional authority, the seven
States appointed Commissioners who, after negotiating
for the better part of a year, reached an agreement at
Santa Fe, New Mexico, on November 24, 1922. The
agreement, known as the Colorado River Compact,2"
failed to fulfill the hope of Congress that the States would
themselves agree on each State's share of the water. The
most the Commissioners were able to accomplish in the
Compact was to adopt a compromise suggestion of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, specially designated
as United States representative. 2 ' This compromise
divides the entire basin into two parts, the Upper Basin
and the Lower Basin, separated at a point on the river
in northern Arizona known as Lee Ferry. (A map showing the two basins and other points of interest in this
controversy is printed as an Appendix facing p. 602.)
Article III (a) of the Compact apportions to each basin in
perpetuity 7,500,000 acre-feet of water 22 a year from the
Colorado River System, defined in Article II(a) as "the
Colorado River and its tributaries within the United
States of America." In addition, Article III (b) gives
the Lower Basin "the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use 23 of such waters by one million acre-feet
per annum." Article III (c) provides that future Mex1942 Stat. 171 (1921).

ican water rights recognized by the United States shall
be supplied first out of surplus over and above the aggregate of the quantities specified in (a) and (b), and if
this surplus is not enough the deficiency shall be borne
equally by the two basins. Article III (d) requires the
Upper Basin not to deplete the Lee Ferry flow below an
aggregate of 75,000,000 acre-feet for any 10 consecutive
years. Article III (f) and (g) provide a way for further apportionment by a compact of "Colorado River
System" waters at any time after October 1, 1963.
While these allocations quieted rivalries between the
Upper and Lower Basins, major differences between the
States in the Lower Basin continued. Failure of the
Compact to determine each State's share of the water
left Nevada and Arizona with their fears that the law
of prior appropriation would be not a protection but a
menace because California could use that law to get for
herself the lion's share of the waters allotted to the Lower
Basin. Moreover, Arizona, because of her particularly
strong interest in the Gila, intensely resented the Compact's inclusion of the Colorado River tributaries in its
allocation scheme and was bitterly hostile to having
Arizona tributaries, again particularly the Gila, forced to
contribute to the Mexican burden. Largely for these
reasons, Arizona alone, of all the States in both basins,
refused to ratify the Compact. "
Seeking means which would permit ratification by all
seven basin States, the Governors of those States met at
Denver in 1925 and again in 1927. As a result of these
meetings the Governors of the upper States suggested, as
a fair apportionment of water among the Lower Basin
States, that out of the average annual delivery of water at

Arizona did ratify the Compact in 1944, after it had already

become effective by six-state ratification as permitted by the Boulder
Canyon Project Act.

Opinion of the Court.

Lee Ferry required by the Compact-7,500,000 acre-feetNevada be given 300,000 acre-feet, Arizona 3,000,000, and
California 4,200,000, and that unapportioned waters,
subject to reapportionment after 1963, be shared equally
by Arizona and California. Each Lower Basin State
would have "the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of
such tributaries within its boundaries before the same
empty into the main stream," except that Arizona tributary waters in excess of 1,000,000 acre-feet could under
some circumstances be subject to diminution by reason
of a United States treaty with Mexico. This proposal
foundered because California held out for 4,600,000 acrefeet instead of 4,200,000 25 and because Arizona held out
for complete exemption of its tributaries from any part
2
of the Mexican burden. 6
Betweeni 1922 and 1927 Congressman Philip Swing and
Senator Hiram Johnson, both of California, made three
attempts to have Swing-Johnson bills enacted, authorizing
construction of a dam in the canyon section of the Colorado River and an all-American canal."7 These bills
would have carried out the original Fall-Davis Report's
recommendations that the river problem be recognized
and treated as national, not local. Arizona's Senators and
Congressmen, still insisting upon a definite guaranty of
water from the mainstream, bitterly fought these proposals because they failed to provide for exclusive use of
her own tributaries, particularly the Gila, and for exemption of these tributaries from the Mexican burden.

373 U. S.

Finally, the fourth Swing-Johnson bill passed both
Houses and became the Boulder Canyon Project Act of
December 21, 1928, 45 Stat. 1057. The Act authorized
the Secretary of the Interior to construct, operate, and
maintain a dam and other works in order to control floods,
improve navigation, regulate the river's flow, store and
distribute waters for reclamation and other beneficial
uses, and generate electrical power.2" The projects authorized by the Act were the same as those provided for
in the prior defeated measures, but in other significant
respects the Act was strikingly different. The earlier bills
had offered no method whatever of apportioning the waters among the States of the Lower Basin. The Act as
finally passed did provide such a method, and, as we view
it, the method chosen was a complete statutory apportionment intended to put an end to the long-standing dispute over Colorado River waters. To protect the Upper
Basin against California should Arizona still refuse to
ratify the Compact,"8 § 4 (a) of the Act as finally passed
provided that, if fewer than seven States ratified within six
months, the Act should not take effect unless six States
including California ratified and unless California, by its
legislature, agreed "irrevocably and unconditionally . . .
as an express covenant" to a limit on its annual consumption of Colorado River water of "four million four hundred
thousand acre-feet of the waters apportioned to the lower

Compact, which had allocated the water between the two basins.
29 The Upper Basin States feared that, if Arizona did not ratify the

Compact, the division of water between the Upper and Lower Basins
agreed on in the Compact would be nullified. The reasoning was that
Arizona's uses would not be charged against the Lower Basin's apportionment and that California would therefore be free to exhaust that
apportionment herself. Total Lower Basin uses would then be more
than permitted in the Compact, leaving less water for the Upper
Basin.

basin States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado
River compact, plus not more than one-half of any excess
or surplus waters unapportioned by said compact." Congress in the same section showed its continuing desire
to have California, Arizona, and Nevada settle their own
differences by authorizing them to make an agreement
apportioning to Nevada 300,000 acre-feet, and to Arizona
2,800,000 acre-feet plus half of any surplus waters unapportioned by the Compact. The permitted agreement
also was to allow Arizona exclusive use of the Gila River,
wholly free from any Mexican obligation, a position Arizona had taken from the beginning. Sections 5 and 8 (b)
of the Project Act made prbvisions for the sale of the
stored waters. The Secretary of the Interior was authorized by § 5 "under such general regulations as he may prescribe, to contract for the storage of water in said reservoir
and for the delivery thereof at such points on the river
and on said canal as may be agreed upon, for irrigation and
domestic uses .

. . ."

Section 5 required these contracts

to be "for permanent service" and further provided,
"No person shall have or be entitled to have the use for
any purpose of the water stored as aforesaid except by
contract made as herein stated." Section 8 (b) provided
that the Secretary's contracts would be subject to any
compact dividing the benefits of the water between
Arizona, California, and Nevada, or any two of them,
approved by Congress on or before January 1, 1929, but
that any such compact approved after that date should
be "subject to all contracts, if any, made by the Secretary of the Interior under section 5 hereof prior to the
date of such approval and consent by Congress."
The Project Act became effective on June 25, 1929, by
Presidential Proclamation,"0 after six States, including
California, had ratified the Colorado River Compact and
3046 Stat. 3000 (1929).

the California legislature had accepted the limitation of
4,400,000 acre-feet " as required by the Act. Neither the
three States nor any two of them ever entered into any apportionment compact as authorized by §§ 4 (a) and 8 (b).
After the construction of Boulder Dam the Secretary of
the Interior, purporting to act under the authority of the
Project Act, made contracts with various water users in
California for 5,362,000 acre-feet, with Nevada for 300,000
acre-feet, and with Arizona for 2,800,000 acre-feet of
water from that stored at Lake Mead.
The Special Master appointed by this Court found that
the Colorado River Compact, the law of prior appropriation, and the doctrine of equitable apportionment-by
which doctrine this Court in the absence of statute resolves interstate claims according to the equities-do not
control the issues in this case. The Master concluded
that, since the Lower Basin States had failed to make a
compact to allocate the waters among themselves as authorized by §§ 4 (a) and 8 (b), the Secretary's contracts
with the States had within the statutory scheme of §§ 4 (a),
5, and 8 (b) effected an apportionment of the waters of
the mainstream which, according to the Master, were the
only waters to be apportioned under the Act. The Master
further held that, in the event of a shortage of water
making it impossible for the Secretary to supply all the
water due California, Arizona, and Nevada under their
contracts, the burden of the shortage must be borne
by each State in proportion to her share of the first
allocated to the Lower Basin, that is,

dations of the Special Master's report. These parties
agree that Congress did not leave division of the waters
to an equitable apportionment by this Court but instead
created a comprehensive statutory scheme for the allocation of mainstream waters. Arizona, however, believes
that the allocation formula established by the Secretary's contracts was in fact the formula required by the
Act. The United States, along with California, thinks
the Master should not have invalidated the provisions of
the Arizona and Nevada water contracts requiring those
States to deduct from their allocations any diversions
of water above Lake Mead which reduce the flow into
that lake.
California is in basic disagreement with almost all of
the Master's Report. She argues that the Project Act,
like the Colorado River Compact, deals with the entire
Colorado River System, not just the mainstream. This
would mean that diversions within Arizona and Nevada
of tributary waters flowing in those States would be
charged against their apportionments and that, because
tributary water would be added to the mainstream water
in computing the first 7,500,000 acre-feet available to the
States, there would be a greater likelihood of a surplus, of
which California gets one-half. The result of California's
argument would be much more water for California and
much less for Arizona. California also argues that the
Act neither allocates the Colorado River waters nor gives
the Secretary authority to make an allocation. Rather
she takes the position that the judicial doctrine of equitable apportionment giving full interstate effect to the
traditional western water law of prior appropriation
should determine, the rights of the parties to the water.
Finally, California claims that in any event the Act does
not control in time of shortage. Under such circumstances, she says, this Court should divide the waters
according to the doctrine of equitable apportionment or

the law of prior appropriation, either of which, she argues, should result in protecting her prior uses.
Our jurisdiction to entertain this suit is not challenged
and could not well be since Art. III, § 2, of the Constitution gives this Court original jurisdiction of actions in
which States are parties. In exercising that jurisdiction,
we are mindful of this Court's often expressed preference
that, where possible, States settle their controversies by
"mutual accommodation and agreement." 32 Those cases
and others 33 make it clear, however, that this Court does
have a serious responsibility to adjudicate cases where
there are actual, existing controversies over how interstate streams should be apportioned among States. This
case is the most recent phase of a continuing controversy
over the water of the Colorado River, which the States
despite repeated efforts have been unable to settle.
Resolution of this dispute requires a determination of
what apportionment, if any, is made by the Project Act
and what powers are conferred by the Act upon the Secretary of the Interior. Unless many of the issues presented
here are adjudicated, the conflicting claims of the parties
will continue, as they do now, to raise serious doubts as
to the extent of each State's right to appropriate water
from the Colorado River System for existing or new
uses. In this situation we should and do exercise our
jurisdiction.

Opinion of the Court.

create its own comprehensive scheme for the apportionment among California, Arizona, and Nevada of the Lower
Basin's share of the mainstream waters of the Colorado
River, leaving each State its tributaries. Congress decided that a fair division of the first 7,500,000 acre-feet of
such mainstream waters would give 4,400,000 acre-feet to
California, 2,800,000 to Arizona, and 300,000 to Nevada;
Arizona and California would each get one-half of any
surplus. Prior approval was therefore given in the Act
for a tri-state compact to incorporate these terms. The
States, subject to subsequent congressional approval, were
also permitted to agree on a compact with different terms.
Division of the water did not, however, depend on the
States' agreeing to a compact, for Congress gave the Secretary of the Interior adequate authority to accomplish the
division. Congress did this by giving the Secretary power
to make contracts for the delivery of water and by providing that no person could have water without a contract.
A. Relevancy of Judicial Apportionment and Colorado
River Compact.-We agree with the Master that apportionment of the Lower Basin waters of the Colorado River
is not controlled by the doctrine of equitable apportionment or by the Colorado River Compact. It is true that
the Court has used the doctrine of equitable apportionment to decide river controversies between States.3" But
in those cases Congress had not made any statutory apportionment. In this case, we have decided that Congress
has provided its own method for allocating among the
Lower Basin States the mainstream water to which they
are entitled under the Compact. Where Congress has so
exercised its constitutional power over waters, courts have
no power to substitute their own notions of an "equitable
apportionment" for the apportionment chosen by Con34 E. g., Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419 (1922); Nebraska v.
Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589 (1945).

gress. Nor does the Colorado River Compact control this
case. Nothing in that Compact purports to divide water
among the Lower Basin States nor in any way to affect
or control any future apportionment among those States
or any distribution of water within a State. That the
Commissioners were able to accomplish even a division of
water between the basins is due to what is generally
known as the "Hoover Compromise."
"Participants [in the Compact negotiations] have
stated that the negotiations would have broken up
but for Mr. Hoover's proposal: that the Commission
limit its efforts to a division of water between the
upper basin and the lower basin, leaving to each basin
the future internal allocation of its share." "
And in fact this is all the Compact did. However, the
Project Act, by referring to the Compact in several places,
does make the Compact relevant to a limited extent. To
begin with, the Act explicitly approves the Compact and
thereby fixes a division of the waters between the basins
which must be respected. Further, in several places the
Act refers to terms contained in the Compact. For example, § 12 of the Act adopts the Compact definition of
"domestic," " and § 6 requires satisfaction of "present
perfected rights" as used in the Compact." Obviously,
therefore, those particular terms, though originally formulated only for the Compact's allocation of water between
basins, are incorporated into the Act and are made applicable to the Project Act's allocation among Lower Basin
3 H. R. Doc. No. 717, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1948).

3,1"'Domestic' whenever employed in this Act shall include water
uses defined as 'domestic' in said Colorado liver compact."

Opinion of the Court.

States. The Act also declares that the Secretary of the
Interior and the United States in the construction, operation, and maintenance of the dam and other works and
in the making of contracts shall be subject to and
controlled by the Colorado River Compact.3" These
latter references to the Compact are quite different from
the Act's adoption of Compact terms. Such references,
unlike the explicit adoption of terms, were used only to
show that the Act and its provisions were in no way to
upset, alter, or affect the Compact's congressionally approved division of water between the basins. They were
not intended to make the Compact and its provisions control or affect the Act's allocation among and distribution
of water within the States of the Lower Basin. Therefore, we look to the Compact for terms specifically incorporated in the Act, and we would also look to it to resolve
disputes between the Upper and Lower Basins, were any
involved in this case. But no such questions are here.
We must determine what apportionment and delivery
scheme in the Lower Basin has been effected through the
Secretary's contracts. For that determination, we look
to the Project Act alone.
B. Mainstream Apportionment.-The congressional
scheme of apportionment cannot be understood without knowing what water Congress wanted apportioned.
Under California's view, which we reject, the first
7,500,000 acre-feet of Lower Basin water, of which California has agreed to use only 4,400,000, is made up of both
mainstream and tributary water, not just mainstream
water. Under the view of Arizona, Nevada, and the
United States, with which we agree, the tributaries are
not included in the waters to be divided but remain for
the exclusive use of each State. Assuming 7,500,000 acre38

feet or more in the mainstream and 2,000,000 in the tributaries, California would get 1,000,000 acre-feet more if
the tributaries are included and Arizona 1,000,000 less. 9
California's argument that the Project Act, like the
Colorado River Compact, deals with the main river and
all its tributaries rests on § 4 (a) of the Act, which limits
California to 4,400,000 acre-feet "of the waters apportioned to the lower basin States by paragraph (a) of
Article III of the Colorado River compact, plus not more
than one-half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said compact . . . ...And Article III (a),
referred to by § 4 (a), apportioned in perpetuity to the
Lower Basin the use of 7,500,000 acre-feet of water per
annum "from the Colorado River System," which was
defined in the Compact as "that portion of the Colorado
River and its tributaries within the United States of
America."
Arizona argues that the Compact apportions between
basins only the waters of the mainstream, not the mainstream and the tributaries. We need not reach that question, however, for we have concluded that whatever waters
the Compact apportioned the Project Act itself dealt only
with water of the mainstream. In the first place, the Act,
in § 4 (a), states that the California limitation, which is
in reality her share of the first 7,500,000 acre-feet of Lower
Basin water, is on "water of and from the Colorado River,"
not of and from the "Colorado River System." But more
importantly, the negotiations among the States and the
congressional debates leading to the passage of the Project
Act clearly show that the language used by Congress in the
Act was meant to refer to mainstream waters only. Inclusion of the tributaries in the Compact was natural in view
of the upper States' strong feeling that the Lower Basin
31Also, California would reduce Nevada's share of the mainstream
waters from 300,000 acre-feet to 120,500 acre-feet.

Opinion of the Court.

tributaries should be made to share the burden of any obligation to deliver water to Mexico which a future treaty
might impose. But when it came to an apportionment
among the Lower Basin States, the Gila, by far the most
important Lower Basin tributary, would not logically be
included, since Arizona alone of the States could effectively use that river.4 ' Therefore, with minor exceptions,
the proposals and counterproposals over the years, culminating in the Project Act, consistently provided for
division of the mainstream only, reserving the tributaries
to each State's exclusive use.
The most important negotiations among the States,
which in .fact formed the basis of the debates leading to
passage of the Act, took place in 1927 when the Governors
of the seven basin States met at Denver in an effort to
work out an allocation of the Lower Basin waters acceptable to Arizona, California, and Nevada. Arizona and
California made proposals, 41 both of which suggested giving Nevada 300,000 acre-feet out of the mainstream of the
Colorado River and reserving to each State the exclusive
use of her own tributaries. Arizona proposed that all
remaining mainstream water be divided equally between
herself and California, which would give each State
3,600,000 acre-feet out of the first 7,500,000 acre-feet of
mainstream water. California rejected the proposed
equal division of the water, suggesting figures that would
result in her getting about 4,600,000 out of the 7,500,000.
The Governors of the four Upper Basin States, trying to
bring Arizona and California together, asked each State to
reduce its demands and suggested this compromise: Nevada 300,000 acre-feet, Arizona 3,000,000, and California
40 Not only does the Gila enter the Colorado almost at the Mexican
border, but also in dry seasons it virtually evaporates before reaching
the Colorado.

4,200,000'-' These allocations were to come only out of
the mainstream, that is, as stated by the Governors, out
of "the average annual delivery of water to be provided
by the states of the upper division at Lees Ferry, under
the terms of the Colorado River Compact." The Governors' suggestions, like those of the States, explicitly
reserved to each State as against the other States the exclusive use of her own tributaries. Arizona agreed to the
Governors' proposal, but she wanted it made clear that
her tributaries were to be exempted from any Mexican
obligation. 4 California rejected the whole proposal,
insisting that she must have 4,600,000 acre-feet from the
mainstream, or, as she put it, "from the waters to be provided by the States of the upper division at Lee Ferry
under the Colorado River compact." " Neither in the
States' original offers, nor in the Governors' suggestions,
nor in the States' responses was the "Colorado River
System'"-mainstream plus tributaries-ever used as the
basis for Lower Basin allocations; rather, it was always
mainstream water, or the water to be delivered by the
upper States at Lee Ferry, that is to say, an annual average of 7,500,000 acre-feet of mainstream water.
With the continued failure of Arizona and California
to reach accord, there was mounting impetus for a congressional solution. A Swing-Johnson bill containing no
limitation on California's uses finally passed the House
in 1928 over objections by Representatives from Arizona
and Utah.45 When the bill reached the Senate, it was
amended in committee to provide that the Secretary in his
water delivery contracts must limit California to 4,600,000
acre-feet "of the water allocated to the lower basin by

only 400,000 acre-feet kept Arizona and California apart,
immediately suggested an amendment by which they
would split the difference, California getting 4,400,000
acre-feet "of the waters apportioned to the lower basin
States by the Colorado River compact," plus half of the
surplus."
It was this Bratton amendment that became
part of the Act as passed,"' which had been amended on the
floor so that the limitation referred to waters apportioned
to the Lower Basin "by paragraph (a) of Article III of
the Colorado River compact," instead of waters apportioned "by the Colorado River compact." .12

Statements made throughout the debates make it quite
clear that Congress intended the 7,500,000 acre-feet it
was allocating, and out of which California was limited
to 4,400,000, to be mainstream water only. In the first
place, the basin Senators expressly acknowledged as the
starting point for their debate the Denver Governors' proposal that specific allocations be made to Arizona, California, and Nevada from the mainstream, leaving the
tributaries to the States. For example, Senator Johnson,
leading spokesman for California, and Senator Hayden,
leading spokesman for Arizona, agreed that the Governors' recommendations could be used as "a basis for
discussion." 11 Hayden went on to observe that the
Committee amendment would give California the same
4,600,000 acre-feet she had sought at Denver. 4 Later,
Nevada's Senator Pittman stated that the committee "put
the amount in there that California demanded before the
four governors at Denver," and said that the Bratton
amendment would split the 400,000 acre-feet separating
the Governors' figure and the Committee's figure."
All
the leaders in the debate-Johnson, Bratton, King, Hayden, Phipps, and Pittman-expressed a common understanding that the key issue separating Arizona and
California was the difference of 400,000 acre-feet, 5 precisely the same 400,000 acre-feet of mainstream water

that had separated the States at Denver. Were we to
sustain California's argument here that tributaries must
be included, California would actually get more than she
was willing to settle for at Denver.
That the apportionment was from the mainstream only
is also strongly indicated by an analysis of the second
paragraph of § 4 (a) of the Act. There Congress authorized Arizona, Nevada, and California to make a compact
allocating to Nevada 300,000 acre-feet and to Arizona
2,800,000 plus one-half of the surplus, which, with California's 4,400,000 and half of the surplus, would under
California's interpretation of the Act exhaust the Lower
Basin waters, both mainstream and tributaries. But
Utah and New Mexico, as Congress knew, had interests
in Lower Basin tributaries which Congress surely would
have protected in some way had it meant for the tributaries of those two States to be included in the water to
be divided among Arizona, Nevada, and California. We
cannot believe that Congress would have permitted three
States to divide among themselves water belonging to five
States. Nor can we believe that the representatives of
Utah and New Mexico would have sat quietly by and
acquiesced in a congressional attempt to include their
tributaries in waters given the other three States.
Finally, in considering California's claim to share in the
tributaries of other States, it is important that from the
beginning of the discussions and negotiations which led to
the PrQject Act, Arizona consistently claimed that she
must have sole use of the Gila, upon which her existing
economy depended.5 ' Arizona's claim was supported by
the fact that only she and New Mexico could effectively
use the Gila waters, which not only entered the Colorado

River too close to Mexico to be of much use to any other
State but also was reduced virtually to a trickle in the
hot Arizona summers before it could reach the Colorado.
In the debates the Senators consistently acknowledged
that the tributaries-or at least the waters of the Gila,
the only major Arizona tributary-were excluded from
the allocation they were making. Senator Hayden, in
response to questions by Senator Johnson, said that the
California Senator was correct in stating that the Senate
had seen fit to give Arizona 2,800,000 acre-feet in addition to all the water in the Gila."6 Senator Johnson had
earlier stated, "[I] t is only the main stream, Senators will
recall, that has been discussed," and one of his arguments
in favor of California's receiving 4,600,000 acre-feet
rather than 4,200,000 was that Arizona was going to keep
all her tributaries in addition to whatever portion of the
main river was allocated to her." Senator Johnson also
argued that Arizona should bear more than half the Lower
Basin's Mexican burden because in addition to the
2,800,000 acre-feet allotted her by the Act she would get
the Gila, which he erroneously estimated at 3,500,000
acre-feet."
Senator Pittman, who had sat in on the Governors' conference, likewise understood that the water was
being allocated from "the main Colorado River." 61 And
other interested Senators similarly distinguished between
the mainstream and the tributaries.12 While the debates,
extending over a long period of years, undoubtedly contain statements which support inferences in conflict with
those we have drawn, we are persuaded by the legislative
history as a whole that the Act was not intended to give

the other Lower Basin States.
C. The Project Act's Apportionment and Distribution
Scheme.-The legislative history, the language of the Act,
and the scheme established by the Act for the storage and
delivery of water convince us also that Congress intended
to provide its own method for a complete apportionment
of the mainstream water among Arizona, California, and
Nevada.
First, the legislative history. In hearings on the House
bill that became the Project Act, Congressman Arentz of
Nevada, apparently impatient with the delay of this
much needed project, told the committee on January 6,
1928, that if the States could not themselves allocate the
water, "there must be some power which will say to California 'You can not take any more than this amount and
the balance is allocated to the other States.' " " Later,
May 25, 1928, the House passed the bill, 4 but it did not
contain any allocation scheme. When the Senate took
up that bill in December, pressure mounted swiftly for
amendments that would provide a workable method for
apportioning the waters among the Lower Basin States
and distributing them to users in the States. The
session convened on December 3, 1928, on the fifth
the Senate took up the bill,65 nine days later the bill
with significant amendments passed the Senate, 6 four
days after that the House concurred in the Senate's action,67 and on the twenty-first the President signed the
bill. " When the bill first reached the Senate floor, it had

a provision, added in committee, limiting California to
4,600,000 acre-feet, " and Senator Hayden on December 6
proposed reducing that share to 4,200,000.0 The next
day, December 7, Mr. Pittman, senior Senator from
Nevada, vigorously argued that Congress should settle the
matter without delay. He said,
"What is the difficulty? We have only minor
questions involved here. There is practically nothing involved except a dispute between the States of
Arizona and California with regard to the division
of the increased water that will be impounded behind the proposed dam; that is all. . . . Of the
7,500,000 acre-feet of water let down that river they
have gotten together within 400,000 acre-feet. They
have got to get together, and if they do not get
together Congress should bring them together." 1
The day after that, December 8, New Mexico's Senator
Bratton suggested an amendment splitting the difference
between the demands of Arizona and California by limiting California to 4,400,000 acre-feet.7 2 On the tenth, reflecting the prevailing sense of urgency for decisive action,
Senator Bratton emphasized that this was not a dispute
limited simply to two States:
"The two States have exchanged views, they have
negotiated, they have endeavored to reach an agreement, and until now have been unable to do so. This
controversy does not affect those two States alone.
It affects other States in the Union and the Government as well.
"Without undertaking to express my views either
way upon the subject, I do think that if the two

States are unable to agree upon a figure then that
we, as a disinterested and friendly agency, should
pass a bill which, according to our combined judgment, will justly and equitably settle the controversy.
I suggested 4,400,000 acre-feet with that in view. I
still hold to the belief that somewhere between the
two figures we must fix the amount, and that this
difference of 400,000 acre-feet should not be allowed
to bar and preclude the passage of this important
measure dealing with the enormous quantity of
15,000,000 acre-feet of water and involving seven
States as well as the Government." 73
The very next day, December 11, this crucial amendment
was adopted, 4 and on the twelfth Senator Hayden pointed
out that the bill settled the dispute over Lower Basin
waters by giving 4,400,000 acre-feet to California and
2,800,000 to Arizona:
"One [dispute] is how the seven and a half million
acre-feet shall be divided in the lower basin. The
Senate has settled that by a vote-that California
may have 4,400,000 acre-feet of that water. It follows logically that if that demand is to be conceded,
as everybody agrees, the remainder is 2,800,000
acre-feet for Arizona. That settles that part of the
controversy." "

with the whole water problem," summed up the feeling

of the Senate that the bill fixed a limit on California and
"practically allocated" to Arizona her share of the water:
"The Senate has already determined upon the division of water between those States. How? It has
determined how much water California may use, and
the rest of it is subject to use by Nevada and Arizona.
Nevada has already admitted that it can use only an
insignificant quantity, 300,000 acre-feet. That leaves
the rest of it to Arizona. As the bill now stands it
is just as much divided as if they had mentioned
Arizona and Nevada and the amounts they are to
get ....
"As I understand this amendment, Arizona to-day
has practically allocated to it 2,800,000 acre-feet of
water in the main Colorado River." 77
The Senator went on to explain why the Senate had found
it necessary to set up its own plan for allocating the water:
"Why do we not leave it to California to say how
much water she shall take out of the river or leave
it to Arizona to say how much water she shall take
out of the river? It is because it happens to become
a duty of the United States Senate to settle this
matter, and that is the reason." 78
Not only do the closing days of the debate show that
Congress intended an apportionrhent among the States

but also provisions of the Act create machinery plainly
adequate to accomplish this purpose, whatever contingencies might occur. As one alternative of the congressional
scheme, § 4 (a) of the Act invited Arizona, California,
and Nevada to adopt a compact dividing the waters along
the identical lines that had formed the basis for the congressional discussions of the Act: 4,400,000 acre-feet to
California, 300,000 to Nevada, and 2,800,000 to Arizona.
Section 8 (b) gave the States power to agree upon some
other division, which would have to be approved by Congress. Congress made sure, however, that if the States did
not agree on any compact the objects of the Act would
be carried out, for the Secretary would then proceed, by
making contracts, to apportion water among the States
and to allocate the water among users within each State.
In the first section of the Act, the Secretary was authorized to "construct, operate, and maintain a dam and
incidental works . . . adequate to create a storage reservoir of a capacity of not less than twenty million acrefeet of water . . ." for the stated purpose of "controlling
the floods, improving navigation and regulating the flow
of the Colorado River, providing for storage and for the
delivery of the stored waters thereof for reclamation of
public lands and other beneficial uses . . . ," and generating electrical power. The whole point of the Act was
to replace the erratic, undependable, often destructive
natural flow of the Colorado with the regular, dependable
release of waters conserved and stored by the project.
Having undertaken this beneficial project, Congress, in
several provisions of the Act, made it clear that no one
should use mainstream waters save in strict compliance
with the scheme set up by the Act. Section 5 authorized
the Secretary "under such general regulations as he may
prescribe, to contract for the storage of water in said
reservoir and for the delivery thereof at such points on the
river . . . as may be agreed upon, for irrigation and

domestic uses . .

. ."

373 U. S.

To emphasize that water could

be obtained from the Secretary alone, § 5 further declared,
"No person shall have or be entitled to have the use for
any purpose of the water stored as aforesaid except by
contract made as herein stated." The supremacy given
the Secretary's contracts was made clear in § 8 (b) of the
Act, which provided that, while the Lower Basin States
were free to negotiate a compact dividing the waters, such
a compact if made and approved after January 1, 1929,
was to be "subject to all contracts, if any, made by the
Secretary of the Interior under section 5" before Congress
approved the compact.
These several provisions, even without legislative history, are persuasive that Congress intended the Secretary of the Interior, through his § 5 contracts, both to
carry out the allocation of the waters of the main Colorado River among the Lower Basin States and to decide
which users within each State would get water. The general authority to make contracts normally includes the
power to choose with whom and upon what terms the
contracts will be made. When Congress in an Act grants
authority to contract, that authority is no less than the
general authority, unless Congress has placed some limit
on it.7" In this respect it is of interest that in an
earlier version the bill did limit the Secretary's contract
power by making the contracts "subject to rights of prior
appropriators.""
But that restriction, which preserved
the law of prior appropriation, did not survive. It was
19 In the debates leading to the passage of the bill, Seuator Walsh
observed that "to contract means a liberty of contract" and asked
if this did not mean that the Secretary could "give the water to them
[appropriators] or withhold it from them as he sees fit," to which
Senator Johnson answered "certainly." 70 Cong. Rec. 168 (1928).

stricken from the bill when the requirement that every
water user have a contract was added to § 5.81 Significantly, no phrase or provision indicating that the Secretary's contract power was to be controlled by the law of
prior appropriation was substituted either then or at
any other time before passage of the Act, and we are
persuaded that had Congress intended so to fetter the
Secretary's discretion, it would have done so in clear and
unequivocal terms, as it did in recognizing "present
perfected rights" in § 6.
That the bill was giving the Secretary sufficient power
to carry out an allocation of the waters among the States
and among the users within each State without regard to
the law of prior appropriation was brought out in a colloquy between Montana's Senator Walsh and California's
Senator Johnson, whose State had at least as much reason
as any other State to bind the Secretary by state laws.
Senator Walsh, who was thoroughly versed in western
water law and also had previously argued before this
Court in a leading case involving the doctrine of prior
appropriation," made clear what would follow from the
Government's impounding of the Colorado River waters
when he said, "I always understood that the interest that
stores the water has a right superior to prior appropriations that do not store." He sought Senator Johnson's
views on what rights the City of Los Angeles, which had
filed claims to large quantities of Colorado River water,
would have after the Government had built the dam and
impounded the waters. In reply to Senator Walsh's specific question whether the Government might "dispose of
the stored water as it sees fit," Senator Johnson said,

"Yes; under the terms of this bill." Senator Johnson
added that "everything in this scheme, plan, or design"
was "dependent upon the Secretary of the Interior contracting with those who desire to obtain the benefit
of the construction .

. .

."

He admitted that it was

possible that the Secretary could "utterly ignore" Los
Angeles' appropriations.83
In this same discussion, Senator Hayden emphasized
the Secretary's power to allocate the water by making
contracts with users. After Senator Walsh said that he
understood Senator Johnson to be arguing that the Secretary must satisfy Los Angeles' appropriations, Senator
Hayden corrected him, pointing out that Senator Johnson
had qualified his statement by saying that "after all, the
Secretary of the Interior could allow the city of Los
Angeles to have such quantity of water as might be determined by contract." Senator Hayden went on to say
that, where domestic and irrigation needs conflicted, "the
Secretary of the Interior will naturally decide as between
applicants, one who desires to use the water for potable
purposes in the city and another who desires to use it for
irrigation, if there is not enough water to go around, that
the city shall have the preference." 84 It is also signifi83 70 Cong. Rec. 168 (1928).
Other statements by Senator Johnson are less damaging to California's claims. For example, the Senator at another point in the colloquy with Senator Walsh said that
he doubted if the Secretary either would or could disregard Los
Angeles and contract with someone having no appropriation. Ibid.
It is likely, however, that Senator Johnson was talking about present
perfected rights, as a few minutes before he had argued that Los
Angeles had taken sufficient steps in perfecting its claims to make
them protected. See id., at 167. Present perfected rights, as we
have observed in the text, are recognized by the Act. § 6.
84 70 Cong. Rec. 169 (1928). At one point Senator Hayden seems
to say that the Secretary's contracts are to be governed by state law:
"The only thing required in this bill is contained in the amendment

Opinion of the Court.

cant that two vigorous opponents of the bill, Arizona's
Representative Douglas and Utah's Representative Colton, criticized the bill because it gave the Secretary of
the Interior "absolute control" over the disposition of the
stored waters."5
The argument that Congress would not have delegated
to the Secretary so much power to apportion and distribute
the water overlooks the ways in which his power is limited
and channeled by standards in the Project Act. In particular, the Secretary is bound to observe the Act's limitation of 4,400,000 acre-feet on California's consumptive
uses out of the first 7,500,000 acre-feet of mainstream
water. This necessarily leav es the remaining 3,100,000
acre-feet for the use of Arizona and Nevada, since they are
the only other States with access to the main Colorado
River. Nevada consistently took the position, accepted
by the other States throughout the debates, that her conceivable needs would not exceed 300,000 acre-feet, which,
of course, left 2,800,000 acre-feet for Arizona's use. Moreover, Congress indicated that it thought this a proper division of the waters when in the second paragraph of § 4 (a)
it gave advance consent to a tri-state compact adopting
that I have offered, that there shall be apportioned to each State its
share of the water. Then, who shall obtain that water in relative
order of priority may be determined by the State courts." Ibid.
But, in view of the Senator's other statements in the same debate,
this remark of a man so knowledgeable in western water law makes
sense only if one understands that the "order of priority" being talked
about was the order of present perfected rights-rights which Senator
Hayden recognized, see id., at 167, and which the Act preserves in § 6.
S 69 Cong. Rec. 9623, 9648, 9649 (1928). We recognize, of course,
that statements of opponents of a bill may not be authoritative, see
Schwegnann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U. S.384, 394395 (1951), but they are nevertheless relevant and useful, especially
where, as here, the proponents of the bill made no response to the
opponents' criticisms.

such division. While no such compact was ever entered
into, the Secretary by his contracts has apportioned the
water in the approved amounts and thereby followed the
guidelines set down by Congress. And, as the Master
pointed out, Congress set up other standards and placed
other significant limitations upon the Secretary's power
to distribute the stored waters. It specifically set out in
order the purposes for which the Secretary must use the
dam and the reservoir:
"First, for river regulation, improvement of navigation, and flood control; second, for irrigation and
domestic uses and satisfaction of present perfected
rights in pursuance of Article VIII of said Colorado
River compact; and third, for power." § 6.
The Act further requires the Secretary to make revenue
provisions in his contracts adequate to ensure the recovery
of the expenses of construction, operation, and maintenance of the dam and other works within 50 years after
their construction. § 4 (b). The Secretary is directed
to make water contracts for irrigation and domestic uses
only for "permanent service." § 5. He and his permittees,
licensees, and contractees are subject to the Colorado
River Compact, § 8 (a), and therefore can do nothing to
upset or encroach upon the Compact's allocation of Colorado River water between the Upper and Lower Basins.
In the construction, operation, and management of the
works, the Secretary is subject to the provisions of the
reclamation law, except as the Act otherwise provides.
§ 14. One of the most significant limitations in the Act
is that the Secretary is required to satisfy present perfected rights, a matter of intense importance to those who
had reduced their water rights to actual beneficial use at
the time the Act became effective. § 6. And, of course,
all of the powers granted by the Act are exercised by the
Secretary and his well-established executive department,

responsible to Congress and the President and subject to
judicial review.86
Notwithstanding the Government's construction, ownership, operation, and maintenance of the vast Colorado
River works that conserve and store the river's waters and
the broad power given by Congress to the Secretary of
the Interior to make contracts for the distribution of the
water, it is argued that Congress in §§ 14 and 18 of the
Act took away practically all the Secretary's power by
permitting the States to determine with whom and on
what terms the Secretary would make water contracts.
Section 18 states:
"Nothing herein shall be construed as interfering
with such rights as the States now have either to the
waters within their borders or to adopt such policies
and enact such laws as they may deem necessary with
respect to the appropriation, control, and use of
waters within their borders .... "
Section 14 provides that the reclamation law, to which
the Act is made a supplement, shall govern the management of the works except as otherwise provided, and § 8
of the Reclamation Act, much like § 18 of the Project Act,
provides that it is not to be construed as affecting or
interfering with state laws "relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation ... 87 In our view, nothing in any of these pro86 See, e. g., Ickes v. Fox, 300 U. S. 82 (1937); cf. Best v. Humboldt

intended to affect or to in any way interfere with the laws of any
State or Territory relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation, or any vested right acquired
thereunder, and the Secretary of the Interior, in carrying out the
provisions of such sections, shall proceed in conformity with such

visions affects our decision, stated earlier, that it is the
Act and the Secretary's contracts, not the law of prior
appropriation, that control the apportionment of water
among the States. Moreover, contrary to the Master's
conclusion, we hold that the Secretary in choosing between users within each State and in settling the terms of
his contracts is not bound by these sections to follow
state law.
The argument that § 8 of the Reclamation Act requires
the United States in the delivery of water to follow priorities laid down by state law has already been disposed
of by this Court in Ivanhoe Irr. Dist. v. McCracken, 357
U. S.275 .(1958), and reaffirmed in City of Fresno v. California, 372 U. S.627 (1963). In Ivanhoe we held that,
even though § 8 of the Reclamation Act preserved state
law, that general provision could not override a specific
provision of the same Act prohibiting a single landowner
from getting water for more than 160 acres. We said:
"As we read § 8, it merely requires the United States
to comply with state law when, in the construction
and operation of a reclamation project, it becomes
necessary for it to acquire water rights or vested interests therein. But the acquisition of water rights
must not be confused with the operation of federal
projects. As the Court said in Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra, at 615: 'We do not suggest that where
Congress has provided a system of regulation for
federal projects it must give way before an inconsistent state system.' . . . We read nothing in § 8
that compels the United States -to deliver water on
conditions imposed by the State." Id., at 291-292.
laws, and nothing .. . [herein] shall in any way affect any right of
any State or of the Federal Government or of any landowner, appropriator, or user of water in, to, or from any interstate stream or the
waters thereof." 43 U. S. C. § 383.

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
546

Opinion of the Court.

Since § 8 of the Reclamation Act did not subject the
Secretary to state law in disposing of water in that case,
we cannot, consistently with Ivanhoe, hold that the Secretary must be bound by state law in disposing of water
under the Project Act.
Nor does § 18 of the Project Act require the Secretary
to contract according to state law. That Act was passed
in the exercise of congressional power to control navigable
water for purposes of flood control, navigation, power
generation, and other objects,8" and is equally sustained
by the power of Congress to promote the general welfare
through projects for reclamation, irrigation, or other
internal improvements."9 Section 18 merely preserves
such rights as the States "now" have, that is, such rights
as they had at the time the Act was passed. While the
States were generally free to exercise some jurisdiction
over these waters before the Act was passed, this right
was subject to the Federal Government's right to regulate
and develop the river. ° Where the Government, as here,
has exercised this power and undertaken a comprehensive
project for the improvement of a great river and for the
orderly and beneficial distribution of water, there is no
room for inconsistent state laws. 1 As in Ivanhoe, where
the general provision preserving state law was held not
to override a specific provision stating the terms for disposition of the water, here we hold that the general saving

language of § 18 cannot bind the Secretary by state law
and thereby nullify the contract power expressly conferred
upon him by § 5.92 Section 18 plainly allows the States to
do things not inconsistent with the Project Act or with
federal control of the river, for example, regulation of the
use of tributary water and protection of present perfected
rights 9 3 What other things the States are free to do
can be decided when the occasion arises. But where the
Secretary's contracts, as here, carry out a congressional
plan for the complete distribution of waters to users, state
94
law has no place.
Before the Project Act was passed, the waters of the
Colorado River, though numbered by the millions of
acre-feet, flowed too haltingly or too freely, resulting in
droughts and floods. The problems caused by these conditions proved too immense and the solutions too costly
for any one State or all the States together. In addition,
the States, despite repeated efforts at a settlement, were
unable to agree on how much water each State should get.
With the health and growth of the Lower Basin at stake,
Congress responded to the pleas of the States to come to
their aid. The result was the Project Act and the
Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589 (1945), holds nothing to
the contrary. There the Court found it unnecessary to decide what
rights the United States had under federal law to the unappropriated
water of the North Platte River, since the water rights on which the
projects in that case rested had in fact been obtained in compliance
with state law.
93 See First Iowa Hydro-Elec. Coop. v. Federal Power Comm'n,
328 U. S. 152, 175-176 (1946), where this Court limited the effect of
§ 27 of the Federal Power Act, which expressly "saved" certain state
laws, to vested property rights.
94 By an Act of September 2, 1958, 72 Stat. 1726, the Secretary must
supply water to Boulder City, Nevada. It follows from our conclusions as to the inapplicability of state law that, contrary to the
Master's conclusion, Boulder City's priorities are not to be determined
by Nevada law.

harnessing of the bountiful waters of the Colorado to
sustain growing cities, to support expanding industries,
and to transform dry and barren deserts into lands that
are livable and productive.
In undertaking this ambitious and expensive project
for the welfare of the people of the Lower Basin States
and of the Nation, the United States assumed the responsibility for the construction, operation, and supervision
of Boulder Dam and a great complex of other dams and
works. Behind the dam were stored virtually all the
waters of the main river, thus impounding not only the
natural flow but also the great quantities of water previously allowed to run waste or to wreak destruction. The
impounding of these waters, along with their regulated and systematic release to those with contracts, has
promoted the spectacular development of the Lower
Basin. Today, the United States operates a whole network of useful projects up and down the river, including
the Hoover Dam, Davis Dam, Parker Dam, Headgate
Rock Dam, Palo Verde Dam, Imperial Dam, Laguna Dam,
Morelos Dam, and the All-American Canal System, and
many lesser works. It was only natural that the United
States, which was to make the benefits available and
which had accepted the responsibility for the project's
operation, would want to make certain that the waters
were effectively used. All this vast, interlocking machinery-a dozen major works delivering water according
to congressionally fixed priorities for home, agricultural,
and industrial uses to people spread over thousands of
square miles-could function efficiently only under unitary management, able to formulate and supervise a coordinated plan that could take account of the diverse,
often conflicting interests of the people and communities
of the Lower Basin States. Recognizing this, Congress
put the Secretary of the Interior in charge of these works

and entrusted him with sufficient power, principally the
§ 5 contract power, to direct, manage, and coordinate their
operation. Subjecting the Secretary to the varying, possibly inconsistent, commands of the different state legislatures could frustrate efficient operation of the project
and thwart full realization of the benefits Congress intended this national project to bestow. We are satisfied
that the Secretary's power must be construed to permit
him, within the boundaries set down in the Act, to allocate
and distribute the waters of the mainstream of the Colorado River.
II.

PROVISIONS IN

THE SECRETARY'S CONTRACTS.

A. Diversionsabove Lake Mead.-The Secretary's contracts with Arizona and Nevada provide that any waters
diverted by those States out of the mainstream or the
tributaries above Lake Mead must be charged to their
respective Lower Basin apportionments. The Master,
however, took the view that the apportionment was to be
made out of the waters actually stored at Lake Mead or
flowing in the mainstream below Lake Mead. He therefore held that the Secretary was without power to charge
Arizona and Nevada for diversions made by them from
the 275-mile stretch of river between Lee Ferry and Lake
Mead 95 or from the tributaries above Lake Mead. This
conclusion was based on the Master's reasoning that the
Secretary was given physical control over the waters
stored in Lake Mead and not over waters before they
reached the lake.
We hold that the Master was correct in deciding that
the Secretary cannot reduce water deliveries to Arizona
15 The location of Hoover Dam is a result of engineering decisions.
As Senator Pittman pointed out, "There is no place to impound the
flood waters except at the lower end of the canyon." 68 Cong. Rec.

Opinion of the Court.

and Nevada by the amount of their uses from tributaries
above Lake Mead, for, as we have held, Congress in the
Project Act intended to apportion only the mainstream,
leaving to each State its own tributaries. We disagree,
however, with the Master's holding that the Secretary is
powerless to charge States for diversions from the mainstream above Lake Mead. What Congress was doing in
the Project Act was providing for an apportionment
among the Lower Basin States of the water allocated to
that basin by the Colorado River Compact. The Lower
Basin, with which Congress was dealing, begins at Lee
Ferry, and it was all the water in the mainstream below
Lee Ferry that Congress intended to divide among the
States. Were we to refuse the Secretary the power to
charge States for diversions from the mainstream between
Lee Ferry and the damsite, we would allow individual
States, by making diversions that deplete the Lower
Basin's allocation, to upset the whole plan of apportionment arrived at by Congress to settle the long-standing
dispute in the Lower Basin. That the congressional apportionment scheme would be upset can easily be demonstrated. California, for example, has been allotted
4,400,000 acre-feet of mainstream water. If Arizona and
Nevada can, without being charged for it, divert water
from the river above Lake Mead, then California could

shall be delivered to users in Arizona, California and Nevada only if contracts have been made by the Secretary
of the Interior, pursuant to Section 5 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, for delivery of such water." While the
California contracts are directly with water users and the
Arizona contract specifically contemplates further subcontracts with actual users, it is argued that the Nevada con-

tract, made by the Secretary directly with the State of
Nevada through her Colorado River Commission, should
be construed as a contract to deliver water to the State
without the necessity of subcontracts by the Secretary directly with Nevada water users. The United States
disagrees, contending that properly construed the Nevada
contract, like the Secretary's general contract with Arizona, does not exhaust the Secretary's power to require
Nevada water users other than the State to make further
contracts. To construe the Nevada contract otherwise, the
Government suggests, would bring it in conflict with the
provision of § 5 of the Project Act that "No person shall
have or be entitled to have the use for any purpose of the
water stored as aforesaid except by contract [with the Secretary] made as herein stated." Acceptance of Nevada's
contention here would not only undermine this plain congressional requirement that water users have contracts
with the Secretary but would likewise transfer from the
Secretary to Nevada a large part, if not all, of the Secretary's power to determine with whom he will contract and
on what terms. We have already held that the contractual power granted the Secretary cannot be diluted
in this manner. We therefore reject Nevada's contention.
III.
APPORTIONMENT AND CONTRACTS IN TIME
OF SHORTAGE.

We have agreed with the Master that the Secretary's
contracts with Arizona for 2,800,000 acre-feet of water
and with Nevada for 300,000, together with the limitation
of California to 4,400,000 acre-feet, effect a valid apportionment of the first 7,500,000 acre-feet of mainstream
water in the Lower Basin. There remains the question
of what shall be done in time of shortage. The Master,
while declining to make any findings as to what future

Opinion of the Court.

supply might be expected, nevertheless decided that the
Project Act and the Secretary's contracts require the
Secretary in case of shortage to divide the burden
among the three States in this proportion: California

.3

water shortages'seems equitable on its face," more considered judgment may demonstrate quite the contrary.
Certainly we should not bind the Secretary to this formula.
We have held that the Secretary is vested with considerable control over the apportionment of Colorado River
waters. And neither the Project Act nor the water contracts require the use of any particular formula for apportioning shortages. While the Secretary must follow the
standards set out in the Act, he nevertheless is free to
choose among the recognized methods of apportionment
or tO devise reasonable methods of his own. This choice,
as we see it, is primarily his, not the Master's or even ours.
And the Secretary may or may not conclude that a pro
rata division is the best solution.
It must be remembered that the Secretary's decision
may have an effect not only on irrigation uses but also
on other important functions for which Congress brought
this great project into being-flood control, improvement
of navigation, regulation of flow, and generation and distribution of electric power. Requiring the Secretary to
prorate shortages would strip him of the very power of
choice which we think Congress, for reasons satisfactory
to it, vested in him and which we should not impair or
take away from him. For the same reasons we cannot
accept California's contention that in case of shortage
each State's share of water should be determined by the

Proration of shortage is the method agreed upon by the United

States and Mexico to adjust Mexico's share of Colorado River
water -should there be insufficient water to supply each country's
apportionment.

judicial doctrine of equitable apportionment or by the
law of prior appropriation. These principles, while they
may provide some guidance, are not binding upon the Secretary where, as here, Congress, with full power to do so,
has provided that the waters of a navigable stream shall
be harnessed, conserved, stored, and distributed through
a government agency under a statutory scheme.
None of this is to say that in case of shortage, the
Secretary cannot adopt a method of proration or that he
may not lay stress upon priority of use, local laws and
customs, or any other factors that might be helpful in
reaching an informed judgment in harmony with the
Act, the best interests of the Basin States, and the welfare
of the Nation. It will be time enough for the courts to
intervene when and if the Secretary, in making apportionments or contracts, deviates from the standards Congress has set for him to follow, including his obligation
to respect "present perfected rights" as of the date the
Act was passed. At this time the Secretary has made
no decision at all based on an actual or anticipated shortage of water, and so there is no action of his in this respect
for us to review. Finally, as the Master pointed out,
Congress still has broad powers over this navigable international stream. Congress can undoubtedly reduce or
enlarge the Secretary's power if it wishes. Unless and
until it does, we leave in the hands of the Secretary,
where Congress placed it, full power to control, manage,
and operate the Government's Colorado River works and
to make contracts for the sale and delivery of water on
such terms as are not prohibited by the Project Act.

that rises in New Mexico and flows through Arizona.
Having determined that tributaries are not within the
regulatory provisions of the Project Act the Master held
that this interstate dispute should be decided under the
principles of equitable apportionment. After hearing
evidence on this issue, the Master accepted a compromise
settlement agreed upon by these States and incorporated
that settlement in his findings and conclusions, and in
Part IV (A) (B) (C) (D) of his recommended decree. No
exceptions have been filed to these recommendations by
any of the parties and they are accordingly accepted by
us. Except for those discussed in Part V, we are not
required to decide any other disputes between tributary
users or between mainstream and tributary users.
V.
CLAIMS OF THE UNITED STATES.

In these proceedings, the United States has asserted
claims to waters in the main river and in some of the
tributaries for use on Indian Reservations, National Forests, Recreational and Wildlife Areas and other government lands and works. While the Master passed upon
some of these claims, he declined to reach others, particularly those relating to tributaries. We approve his decision as to which claims required adjudication, and likewise
we approve the decree he recommended for the government claims he did decide. We shall discuss only the
claims of the United States on behalf of the Indian
Reservations.
The Government, on behalf of five Indian Reservations
in Arizona, California, and Nevada, asserted rights to
water in the mainstream of the Colorado River.9" The

were created by Executive Orders and amendments to
them, ranging in dates from 1870 to 1907.1"' The Master
found both as a matter of fact and law that when the
United States created these reservations or added to them,
it reserved not only land but also the use of enough water
from the Colorado to irrigate the irrigable portions of
the reserved lands.. The aggregate quantity of water
which the Master held was reserved for all the reservations
is about 1,000,000 acre-feet, to be used on around 135,000
irrigable acres of land. Here, as before the Master, Arizona argues that the United States had no power to make
a reservation of navigable waters after Arizona became a
State; that navigable waters could not be reserved by
Executive Orders; that the United States did not intend
to reserve water for the Indian Reservations; that the
amount of water reserved should be measured by the reasonably foreseeable needs of the Indians living on the
reservation rather than by the number of irrigable acres;

Opinion of the Court.

tionment should be used to divide the water between the
Indians and the other people in the State of Arizona.
The last argument is easily answered. The doctrine of
equitable apportionment is a method of resolving water
disputes between States. It was created by this Court
in the exercise of its original jurisdiction over controversies in which States are parties. An Indian Reservation is not a State. And while Congress has sometimes
left Indian Reservations considerable power to manage
their own affairs, we are not convinced by Arizona's argument that each reservation is so much like a State that
its rights to water should be determined by the doctrine
of equitable apportionment. Moreover, even were we to
treat an Indian Reservation like a State, equitable apportionment would still not control since, under our view, the
Indian claims here are governed by the statutes and
Executive Orders creating the reservations.
Arizona's contention that the Federal Government had
no power, after Arizona became a State, to reserve waters
for the use and benefit of federally reserved lands rests
largely upon statements in Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3
How. 212 (1845), and Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1 (1894).
Those cases and others that followed them 101 gave rise
to the doctrine that lands underlying navigable waters
within territory acquired by the Government are held in
trust for future States and that title to such lands is automatically vested in the States upon admission to the
Union. But those cases involved only the shores of and
lands beneath navigable waters. They do not determine
the problem before us and cannot be accepted as limiting
the broad powers of the United States to regulate navigable waters under the Commerce Clause and to regulate

government lands under Art. IV, § 3, of the Constitution.
We have no doubt about the power of the United States
under these clauses to reserve water rights for its reservations and its property.
Arizona also argues that, in any event, water rights
cannot be reserved by Executive Order. Some of the
reservations of Indian lands here involved were made
almost 100 years ago, and all of them were made over
45 years ago. In our view, these reservations, like those
created directly by Congress, were not limited to land,
but included waters as well. Congress and the Executive have ever since recognized these as Indian Reservations. Numerous appropriations, including appropriations for irrigation projects, have been made by Congress.
They have been uniformly and universally treated as
reservations by map makers, surveyors, and the public.
We can give but short shrift at this late date to the argument that the reservations either of land or water are
invalid because they were originally set apart by the
Executive."'
Arizona also challenges the Master's holding as to the
Indian Reservations on two other grounds: first, that there
is a lack of evidence showing that the United States in
establishing the reservations intended to reserve water for
them; second, that even if water was meant to be
reserved the Master has awarded too much water. We
reject both of these contentions. Most of the land in
these reservations is and always has been arid. If the
water necessary to sustain life is to be had, it must come
from the Colorado River or its tributaries. It can be said
without overstatement that when the Indians were put
on these reservations they were not considered to be
located in the most desirable area of the Nation. It is
102 See United States v. Midwest Oil Co.., 236 U. S. 4 9, 469-475

Opinion of the Court.

impossible to believe that when Congress created the great
Colorado River Indian Reservation and when the Executive Department of this Nation created the other reservations they were unaware that most of the lands were of
the desert kind-hot, scorching sands-and that water
from the river would be essential to the life of the Indian
people and to the animals they hunted and the crops they
raised. In the debate leading to approval of the first congressional appropriation for irrigation of the Colorado
River Indian Reservation, the delegate from the Territory
of Arizona made this statement:
"Irrigating canals are essential to the prosperity of
these Indians. Without water there can be no production, no life; and all they ask of you is to give
them a few agricultural implements to enable them
to dig an irrigating canal by which their lands may
be watered and their fields irrigated, so that they may
enjoy the means of existence. You must provide
these Indians with the means of subsistence or they
will take by robbery from those who have. During
the last year I have seen a number of these Indians
starved to death for want of food." Cong. Globe,
38th Cong., 2d Sess. 1321 (1865).
The question of the Government's implied reservation of
water rights upon the creation of, an Indian Reservation
was before this Court in Winters v. United States, 207
U. S. 564, decided in 1908. Much the same argument
made to us was made in Winters to persuade the Court
to hold that Congress had created an Indian Reservation
without intending to reserve waters necessary to make
the reservation livable. The Court rejected all of the
arguments. As to whether water was intended to be
reserved, the Court said, at p. 576:
"The lands were arid and, without irrigation, were
practically valueless. And yet, it is contended, the

OCTOBER TERM, 1962.

373 U. S.

means of irrigation were deliberately given up by
the Indians and deliberately accepted by the Governme-nt. The lands ceded were, it is true, also arid;
and some argument may be urged, and is urged, that
with their cession there was the cession of the waters,
without which they would be valueless, and 'civilized
communities could not be established thereon.' And
this, it is further contended, the Indians knew, and
yet made no reservation of the waters. We realize
that there is a conflict of implications, but that which
makes for the retention of the waters is of greater
force than that which makes for their cession."
The Court in Winters concluded that the Government,
when it created that Indian Reservation, intended to deal
fairly with the Indians by reserving for them the waters
without which their lands would have been useless.
Winters has been followed by this Court as recently as
1939 in United States v. Powers, 305 U. S. 527. We follow it now and agree that the United States did reserve
the water rights for the Indians effective as of the time
the Indian Reservations were created. This means, as
the Master held, that these water rights, having vested
before the Act became effective on June 25, 1929, are
"present perfected rights" and as such are entitled to
priority under the Act.
We also agree with the Master's conclusion as to the
quantity of water intended to be reserved. He found that
the water was intended to satisfy the future as well as
the present needs of the Indian Reservations and ruled
that enough water was reserved to irrigate all the practicably irrigable acreage on the reservations. Arizona,
on the other hand, contends that the quantity of water
reserved should be measured by the Indians' "reasonably
foreseeable needs," which, in fact, means by the number

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
546

Opinion of the Court.

of Indians. How many Indians there will be and what
their future needs will be can only be guessed. We have
concluded, as did the Master, that the only feasible and
fair way by which reserved water for the reservations
can be measured is irrigable acreage. The various acreages
of irrigable land which the Master found to be on the
different reservations we find to be reasonable.
We disagree with the Master's decision to determine
the disputed boundaries of the Colorado River Indian
Reservation and the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation.
We hold that it is unnecessary to resolve those disputes
here. Should a dispute over title arise because of some
future refusal by the Secretary to deliver water to either
area, the dispute can be settled at that time.
The Master ruled that the principle underlying the
reservation of water rights for Indian Reservations was
equally applicable to other federal establishments such
as National Recreation Areas and National Forests. We
agree with the conclusions of the Master that the United
States intended to reserve water sufficient for the future
requirements of the Lake Mead National Recreation
Area, the Havasu Lake National Wildlife Refuge, the
Imperial National Wildlife Refuge and the Gila National
Forest.
We reject the claim of the United States that it is
entitled to the use, without charge against its consumption, of any waters that would have been wasted but for
salvage by the Government on its wildlife preserves.
Whatever the intrinsic merits of this claim, it is inconsistent with the Act's command that consumptive use
shall be measured by diversions less returns to the river.
Finally, we note our agreement with the Master that
all uses of mainstream water within a State are to be
charged against that State's apportionment, which of
course includes uses by the United States.

DECREE.

While we have in the main agreed with the Master,
there are some places we have disagreed and some questions on which we have not ruled. Rather than adopt
the Master's decree with amendments or append our own
decree to this opinion, we will allow the parties, or any
of them, if they wish, to submit before September 16,
1963, the form of decree to carry this opinion into effect,
failing which the Court will prepare and enter an appropriate decree at the next Term of Court.
It is so ordered.

I dissent from so much of the Court's. opinion as holds
that the Secretary of the Interior has been given authority

of California, Arizona, and Nevada, the waters of the
mainstream of the Colorado River below Lee Ferry. I
also dissent from the holding that in times of shortage
MR. JUSTICE STEWART

the Secretary has discretion to select or devise any "rea-

within these States are to bear the burden of that shortage. (In all other respects MR. JUSTICE STEWART and
I-but not MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAs-agree with and join
in the Court's opinion, though not without some misgivings regarding the amounts of water allocated to the
Indian Reservations.)
In my view, it is the equitable principles established by
the Court in interstate water-rights cases, as modified by
the Colorado River Compact and the California limitation, that were intended by Congress to govern the apportionment of mainstream waters among the Lower Basin
States, whether in surplus or in shortage. A fortiori,state
law was intended to control apportionment among users
within a single State.
I.
INTRODUCTION.

The Court's conclusions respecting the Secretary's
apportionment powers, particularly those in times of
shortage, result in a single appointed federal official being
vested with absolute control, unrestrained by adequate
standards, over the fate of a substantial segment of the
life and economy of three States. Such restraint upon
his actions as may follow from judicial review are, as will

OCTOBER TERM, 1962.

be shown, at best illusory. Today's result, I venture to
say, would have dumbfounded those responsible for the
legislation the Court construes, for nothing could have
been farther from their minds or more inconsistent with
their deeply felt convictions.
The Court professes to find this extraordinary delegation of power principally in § 5 of the Project Act, the
provision authorizing the Secretary to enter into contracts
for the storage and delivery of water. But § 5, as is
more fully shown below, pp. 615-621, infra, had no design
resembling that which the Court now extracts from it.
Rather, it was intended principally as a revenue measure,
and the clause requiring a contract as a condition of delivery was inserted at the insistence not of the Lower but
of the Upper Basin States in an effort to insure that nothing would disturb that basin's rights under the Colorado
River Compact. There was no thought that § 5 would
give authority to apportion water among the Lower Basin
States. Indeed, during the hearings on the third SwingJohnson bill when § 5 took its present form, one of its
principal proponents, Delph Carpenter of Colorado, specifically stated that the proposed condition of a contract
was intended to require
"that the persons who receive the water shall respect
and do so under the compact. It has nothing to do
with the interstate relations between Arizona and
California."'I (Emphasis added.)
And Representative Swing, coauthor of the bill, made virtually the same point in explaining the provision before
the House Rules Committee:
"The act says [in § 5] 'The Secretary of the Interior
is hereby authorized, under such general regulations

as he may prescribe, to contract for the storage of
water.' Whose water? It does not say. It might
be a community like Imperial Valley that has
already acquired a water right . . . or it may be
someone who hereafter will acquire a water right, but
that right will not be acquired under this bill; not
from the United States Government. He will acquire his water right, if he acquires one, from the
State and under the laws of the State, in which he
puts the water to a beneficial use. There is nothing
in this bill which puts the Government in conflict
with the water laws of Arizona or Utah or any other
State. As a matter of fact, the reclamation law is
adopted by section 13 of this bill [now § 14], and
section 8 of the reclamation act says that what the
Government does must not be in conflict with the
water laws of the States, so there can be no violence
done State laws on this score." 2 (Emphasis added.)
The Court concedes, as indeed it must in the face of
such unequivocal evidence, that this third Swing-Johnson
bill, like its predecessors, established "no method whatever
of apportioning the waters among the States of the Lower
Basin." Ante, p. 560. This concession, one would think,
would end this aspect of the controversy, since § 5 as ultimately adopted is virtually the same as that proposed in
the third bill.2 Yet a method of federal apportionment is
discovered in the fourth Swing-Johnson bill as finally
enacted, a method which ends by delegating to the Secre2

3 The only change that need be noted for present pkirposes is the

addition of a clause requiring contracts to conform to §4 (a), discussed below, as well as to the Compact.

tary of the Interior the awesome power over the "water"
destiny of three States. To what provision does the
Court attribute this startling metamorphosis? The fundamental change in approach is apparently found in
§ 4 (a), which as adopted contains provisions (1) conditioning the effectiveness of the Act on seven-state ratification of the Colorado River Compact or alternatively on
California's agreement to limit its annual consumption of
Colorado River water, together with six-state ratification
of the Compact; and (2) giving permission to California,
Arizona, and Nevada to enter a further compact apportioning certain waters to the latter two States pursuant to
a stated formula.
It is manifest that § 4 (a), on which the Court so
heavily relies, neither apportions the waters of the river
nor vests power in any official to make such an apportionment. The first paragraph does not grant any water to
anyone; it merely conditions the Act's effectiveness on
seven-state ratification of the Compact or on six-state
ratification, plus California's agreement to a limitation,
i. e., a ceiling, on her appropriations. The source of
authority to make such appropriations must be found
elsewhere. And the second paragraph of § 4 (a), suggesting a particular interstate agreement, similarly makes
no apportionment of water among the States and delegates no power to any official to make such an apportionment. Indeed, it was accepted by the Senator from California (Mr. Johnson) only after the following colloquy
with its proponent, Senator Pittman of Nevada:
"Mr. JOHNSON. . .. [WIhat I want to make
clear is that this amendment shall not be construed
hereafter by any of the parties to it or any of the
States as being the expression of the will or the demand or the request of the Congress of the United

Senator Johnson would surely have been surprised to
learn that the formula which was not even "the request of
Congress" was in truth one which the Secretary was
authorized to force down the throats of the States if they
did not voluntarily agree to it.
Even this brief summary, I think, casts the gravest
doubts upon the Court's construction of the Project Act
as abolishing state law and accepted principles of equitable apportionment in effecting allocations of water
among the States. A more detailed analysis will, I
believe, demonstrate the incorrectness of the Court's conclusions on this score and will reveal the constitutional
difficulties inherent in the uncontrolled delegation of
power resulting from those conclusions.
II.
THE BACKGROUND

OF THE BOULDER CANYON

PROJECT ACT.

Judicial apportionment of interstate waters was established long before the Project Act as an effective means
of resolving interstate water disputes. Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46. Its acceptability had never been
questioned. Priority of appropriation, the basic determinant of judicial apportionment as enunciated in Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S.419, was the law in six of the
Colorado Basin States, and senior appropriations were

respected in the seventh.' The law of appropriation,
which rests on the basic principle that a water right depends on beneficial use and which gives priority of right
to the appropriator first in time, had been repeatedly declared to be indispensable to the development of the arid
lands of the West.6
This backdrop of firm dedication to the principles of
appropriation and of judicial apportionment is critical to
an understanding of congressional purpose with respect
to the Project Act. It is also critical to recognize that
congressional compromise with these deeply respected
principles was only partial; the problems facing Congress
as a result of Wyoming v. Colorado were narrow. No
Senator or Representative ever suggested that judicial
apportionment was generally inappropriate; no Senator
or Representative ever inveighed against the law of appropriation as such. The first problem was simply this:
Interstate application of the doctrine of priority, unlimited by equitable considerations, threatened to deprive the
four Upper Basin States of their fair share of the Colorado
River because they were not so quick as California in
development. The purpose of the Compact was simply
to limit traditional doctrines to the extent necessary to

avoid this extreme and harsh result, and to eliminate long
and costly litigation.
It was perfectly plain that the Colorado River Compact
merely guaranteed to the upper States a specified quantity
of water immune from priorities below, subject to stated
delivery requirements; it did nothing whatever to interfere with the law of priorities or the principles of equitable
apportionment among the States of the Lower Basin."
It was precisely because it did not that Arizona refused to
approve either the Project Act or the Compact until something was done to safeguard her share of Lower Basin
water.' Similarly, the upper States feared that in the
absence of ratification by Arizona, California would be
free to appropriate all the Lower Basin's share under the
Compact, and Arizona, not limited by that document,
would be free to appropriate, as against the upper States,
water the Compact sought to apportion to the Upper
Basin .
The remaining problem, therefore, was that California's
acquisition of priorities as against Arizona and the upper
States had to be further limited. A ceiling had to be put
on her interstate appropriative priorities. Solution of
this narrow problem likewise did not require complete
abrogation of the principles of priority and interstate
judicial apportionment.
Still another, and profoundly significant, factor in
understanding the effect of the Project Act on the law
7Ward Bannister, Denver attorney and spokesman for the Upper
Basin States, said that "[tihe purpose of the compact is to provide
the three lower States with a fund of water from which they may
appropriate and the four upper States with a fund of water from
which they may appropriate." Hearings before House Committee on

of appropriation and judicial apportionment is the pervasive hostility that many westerners had to any form of federal control of water rights. Colorado's Delph Carpenter,
who was as much responsible as any man for both the
Compact and the contract requirement of § 5 of the
Project Act, testified in 1925 to what he termed an insidious and calculated policy of the National Government,
fostered particularly by the Departments of Interior and
Justice, to encroach upon state prerogatives and supersede state authority with respect to the distribution of
water. He made it clear, as did Wyoming's Senator
Kendrick, that he deemed this policy oppressive, destructive, and deplorable. 10 Utah's Senator King made the
same objection on the floor of the Senate. 69 Cong. Rec.
10262. When it was suggested that Congress might legislate to meet the problem of California's threatened preemption of the river, a storm of doubt arose as to its
constitutional power to do so. Upper Basin and Arizona
spokesmen-those who were to be benefited by limiting
appropriations-repeatedly insisted that the only constitutional ways of apportioning the river were by suit in
10 Hearings before Senate Committee on Irrigation and Reclama-

tion pursuant to S. Res. No. 320, 68th Cong., 2d Sess. 663-675. "It
was the oppression of the National Government strangling development, preventing development in the States. . . . These two experiences and others taught Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico
the extent to which a department of the United States would go in
overriding State authority and oppressing whole communities. ...
Thus it came to the attention of the States, that the United States
Government intended to supersede all State law and override State
authority on that river ....
[A]ny desire by a governmental bureau
to ultimately, by insiduous [sic] or other methods, take over the
control and dominion of the streams within the States and to override State authority at once becomes not only abhorrent but gives

Federal Government may go into a stream, whether it be the Colorado River, the Sacramento River, or a river in the State of Montana, and put its powerful hands down upon the stream and say,

statement, which concerned his authorization for a compact among
the three lower States, meant any such thing.
Senator PHIPPS: "I am firmly convinced that there must be voluntary ratification on the part of each interested State in order to
make the compact effective. This is the only method of settling

method; it is the only legal method to avoid proceedings in the
courts which would prove costly and almost interminable." 68 Cong.

Senator HAYDEN: "There are only two ways in which this controversy can be settled. Either the States can agree upon an equitable apportionment of waters of the Colorado River or, in the
absence of a compact, the Supreme Court of the United States can

or to reject, Congress was infringing upon state sovereignty. 70 Cong. Rec. 470-471.
Congress' entire approach to the problems of prior
appropriation was governed by this deep-seated hostility
to federal dictation of water rights. When plans for
development of the Lower Basin threatened the rights
of the upper States, they did not seek the simple (and
in my view constitutionally unobjectionable) solution of
a legislative apportionment. They employed instead
the cumbersome method of interstate compact, which
required authorization by Congress and by seven state
legislatures prior to negotiation and ratification by the
same eight bodies thereafter. When it began to appear
that Arizona would not ratify the Compact, Congress still
did not legislate a general apportionment. It built the
statute around the provisions of the Compact, insisting
on ratification by as many States as possible, even at the
cost of further delaying the already overdue Project Act.
It simply conditioned the use of government property
and of water stored behind the dam on compliance with
the Compact. Attempts to divide the Lower Basin water
by interstate agreement continued through the Denver
Conference called by the Upper Basin Governors in the
summer of 1927-nearly five years after negotiation of
by treaty ratified by the Congress of the United States, or by the
judicial branch of the Government; for the Congress has no power
to allocate any of the waters of this river or any other river where
the doctrine of prior appropriation is in force." Hearings, supra,

the Compact. Yet it was not until 1927 that an amendment was first offered to protect Arizona by a statutory
limitation on California's consumption, and it was not
until 1928 that the proposal was adopted into the bill.1 Finally, when Congress ultimately resigned itself to the
necessity of legislating in some way with respect to the division of Lower Basin waters, it used narrow words suitable to its narrow purpose and to its regard both for the
system of judicial apportionment and appropriation and
for the rights of the States. Even then Congress did not
attempt to legislate an apportionment of Lower Basin
water; it simply prescribed a ceiling for California. In
the words of Senator Johnson, "We write, then, that California shall use perpetually only a specific amount of
water, naming the maximum amount which may be used."
69 Cong. Rec. 7250. Even this, Congress was unwilling
to do directly. As reported from committee, the bill contained a provision directing the Secretary of the Interior
to limit California's consumption in the exercise of his
power of contract."3 But this was replaced by the present
provision, which reached the same result not via the
Secretary's contract authority but by the awkward device
of requiring California's legislature to consent to the limitation as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the
Project Act. And this was not all; to end the tale Congress added to § 4 (a) specific authorization to Arizona,
California, and Nevada to enter into an agreement to
complete the division of the Lower Basin water-the same
cumbersome substitute for direct congressional apportionment that had been abortively mooted for six years.
This history bears recapitulation. First, the law of
appropriation, basic to western water law, was greatly

respected, and the solution of interstate water disputes
by judicial apportionment in this Court was well established and accepted. Second, the problems created by
these doctrines as applied in Wyoming v. Colorado were
narrow ones, not requiring for their solution complete
abrogation of well-tried principles; existing law was quite
adequate to deal with all questions save those Congress
expressly solved by imposing a ceiling on California.
Third, Congress throughout the dispute exhibited great
reluctance to interfere with the division of water by legislation, because of a deep and fundamental mistrust of
federal intervention and a profound regard for state sovereignty, shared by many influential members. Finally,
when Congress was forced to legislate with respect to this
problem or face defeat of the entire Project Act, it chose
narrow terms appropriate to the narrow problem before it,
and even then acted only indirectly to require California's
consent to limiting her consumption.
It is inconceivable that such a Congress intended that
the sweeping federal power which it declined to exercise-a power even the most avid partisans of national
authority might hesitate to grant to a single administrator-be exercised at the unbridled discretion of an administrative officer, especially in the light of complaints
registered about "bureaucratic" and "oppressive" interference of the Department which that very officer
headed. 4 It is utterly incredible that a Congress unwilling because of concern for States' rights even to limit California's maximum consumption to 4,400,000 acre-feet
without the consent of her legislature intended to give
the Secretary of the Interior authority without California's consent to reduce her share even below that quantity
in a shortage.

THE

AUTHORITY

OF THE SECRETARY UNDER

SECTION

5

OF THE PROJECT ACT.

The Court holds that § 5 of the Project Act, which
empowers the Secretary to contract for water delivery and
forbids delivery of stored water without a contract, displaces the law of apportionment among the Lower Basin
States, giving the Secretary power to divide the water
by contract and to distribute the burden of shortages,
without respecting appropriations.
But it does not follow that because no user is entitled to
stored water without a contract the Secretary may award
or withhold contracts independently of priorities. In fact,
§ 5 reflects no such intention. The Secretary's power to
contract upon appropriate financial charges for water
delivery, not included in the early bills, was added during
the 1926 hearings in response to a request from Secretary
of the Interior Work that users of water, as well as of
power, be made to bear the cost of the project.15 At the
same time § 4 (b) for the first time provided that no work
under the Act should begin until these revenues were
assured by the Secretary's contracts. There was yet no
provision prohibiting deliveries without contracts.16
Thus originally purely a financial tool, the contract
power was later made to serve the additional purpose of
enforcing the Compact's provisions against Arizona in the
absence of her ratification. At the urging of the upper
States § 8 had been amended to subject the United 6tates
in operating the dam to the Compact, to condition the
enjoyment of the dam's benefits on compliance with the
Compact, and to require that contracts from the United

States should so provide.17 The upper States then insisted on inserting the requirement in § 5 that no one was
to receive stored water without a contract, expressly and
solely for the purpose of tying the Compact's enforcement
to the contract power. 8 There was no intent to confer
absolute power to grant or withhold. Indeed, to give
effect to priorities in time of shortage, up to the maximum quantities permitted California by § 4 (a), tends to
promote the stability of water uses, a policy Congress
sought to further in § 5 itself by requiring that contracts
be for permanent service. In short, disregard of appropriations in one State in favor of those in another, except
as required by the inter-basin apportionment of the
Compact or by the California limitation, was no part
of the purpose of this section; it was designed to insure
revenue and to enforce the Compact and the California
limitation ."

When the provision for water

"Contracts respecting water for

with the Colorado River compact." Hearings, supra, note 1, at 8.
18 See notes 1, 2, supra, and accompanying text.
Contracts were
later made subject also to the California limitation in § 4 (a).
19 It is significant to contrast the language giving the Secretary
authority to enter water delivery contracts with that in § 5 (c),
relating to the distribution of electrical power. The latter provision
explicitly gives the Secretary authority to resolve conflicts in applications, referring him for the governing standards to "the policy expressed in the Federal Water Power Act as to conflicting applications
for permits and licenses."

provision to apply to irrigation contracts as well as to
require, rather than simply to permit, that contracts be
for permanent service. 21 At the request of the upper
States, the phrase "subject to rights of prior appropriators" was deleted. 2 The Court concludes from this bit
of history that Congress considered but rejected the suggestion that the law of appropriation govern the distribution of water stored in Lake Mead. But deletion or rejection of a proposed amendment is not strong evidence of
legislative intention; the reasons for deletion may be any
of a great number, not the least frequent of which is that
the suggestion is redundant. Here it seems clear that
there was a further reason for the change. The phrase
was dropped at the same time the provision requiringeach
user to have a contract was added. Under the bill as it
stood prior to this no contract was required, and new contracts were made junior to all prior appropriators, even
those initiating or perfecting rights only after the statute
became effective. As amended the bill required a contract of every user of stored waters, and the deleted clause
was no longer in accord with the contractual plan. It is
surely stretching things to suggest that deletion of this
no longer accurate language signifies that the Secretary
may award contracts on his own authority, without regard
for priorities that would obtain under state law.
In support of its construction of § 5 the Court relies in
large part upon an exchange between Senator Johnson and
Senator Walsh of Montana. 70 Cong. Rec. 168. The
only thing this colloquy seems to make clear is that Senator Johnson had not comprehensively analyzed the relationship between § 5 and the law of appropriation. First
he thought the Secretary would be required to deliver
water to those who had appropriated it; then he said this

would be required "[i] f they contract"; then he agreed the
Secretary might withhold water "as he sees fit"; then he
"doubt [ed] very much" whether the Secretary could disregard Los Angeles' appropriations; finally he said "possibly" the Secretary might utterly ignore appropriations.
This shifting dialogue can scarcely be deemed an authoritative, or even useful, aid to construction of the statute.
Nor is there warrant for the Court's reliance on the
statements of such opponents of the bill as Utah's Representative Colton and Arizona's Representative Douglas.
Objections of opponents of a bill are seldom significant
guides to its construction. See Schwegmann Bros. v.
Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U. S.384, 394-395. And in
any event in this instance the opponents themselves were
23
far from consistent in their views.
Of far greater significance are the statements of the
bill's supporters, which confirm that no power to ignore
appropriations was given to the Secretary.2' Representative Swing, author of the bill, responded to Mr. Hayden's assertion that such a power was given with an
emphatic denial: "the distribution will either be by agree" Thus, almost in the same breath with which Representative
Colton made his then seemingly dire prediction of national control,
he declared that "Arizona is not a party at all to this compact. She
and her citizens may appropriate water at any time." 69 Cong. Rec.
9648. Arizona, as has already been pointed out, was busily opposing
the bill on the specific ground that it left California free to appropriate from the river.
24 The one apparent exception to the unanimity of view among
the bill's supporters is the statement in Representative Smith's report
of the third Swing bill to the House: "All rights respecting water or
power under the project are, under the terms of the bill, to be disposed of by contract by the Government. It is not reasonable to
assume that the Government will do anything of an unfair or prejudicial nature to Arizona." H. R. Rep. No. 1657, 69th Cong., 2d

ment between the States or under their respective laws."
House Hearings, supra,note 1, at 32. The following year
he explained that the United States would not dispose of
water rights under the bill; it would merely store water
belonging to persons acquiring their rights under state
law. See pp. 604-605, supra. In 1928, defending the
House bill against an Arizona witness' charge that California might appropriate the entire Lower Basin supply, Mr.
Swing did not dispute the statement as to California's
rights but reinforced it by declaring that Arizona was
free to make appropriations too. Hearings before House
Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation on H. R. 5773,
70th Cong., 1st Sess. 57-58. He later assured the House
that notwithstanding the bill Arizona "still has the benefit
of the law of prior appropriation, and she still has the right
to the beneficial use of any of the water she is able to put
to use." 69 Cong. Rec. 9781. Delph Carpenter, proponent of the § 5 contract requirement, said that it was
designed to burden storage water with the Compact, and
thus to protect the Upper Basin, and that "[i]t has nothing to do with the interstate relations between Arizona and
California." 5 Senator Johnson, sponsor of the Senate

See note 1, supra, and accompanying text.

Mr. Carpenter's re-

marks also included the following: "'Except by contract made as
herein stated' means this: If the flow of the Colorado River is controlled and regulated by the construction of the Black Canyon Dam,
and any person in the State of Arizona attempt to take any water
out of the stream which has been discharged from the reservoir and
is being carried in the stream bed, as a natural conduit, for delivery
to lower users, this law would be brought into effect and he would
be prevented from using any of that water independent of the Colorado River compact but unincumbered by any other condition for

the benefit of California and Nevada. In other words, the compact
does not disturb the rights between Arizona, California, and Nevada,
inter sese, as to their portion of the water." Hearings, supra, note

bill, told the Senate the bill was made a part of the reclamation law, which "specifically protects each State in its
water rights and in the rights of the citizens of those
States to water." 68 Cong. Rec. 4292. Senator Pittman insisted there was nothing in the bill (prior to the
California limitation) to prevent either Arizona or California from appropriating all the water she could use."6
Senator Phipps, whose amendment became the California
limitation, declared that any dispute over the relative
rights of Arizona and of Los Angeles would be resolved by
the Secretary in accordance with priority of appropriation
and the
normal preference for domestic over agricultural
27
use.
Of further weight in supporting the view that Congress
did not construe § 5 to destroy the law of appropriation
and apportionment is the fact that the entire controversy
over the California limitation took place after §5 was
added to the bill. Utah was so certain that Arizona
remained free to appropriate water despite § 5 that she
26

"If a dam shall be built at Boulder Canyon it will impound

certain waters and equate the flow below. The water below will be
subject to appropriation and use by both California and Arizona ....
In other words, there is nothing in this proposed legislation that
could prevent Arizona from appropriating from the Colorado River
within her borders all of the water she could use for irrigation." 68
Cong. Rec. 4412.
27 "It
seems to me that in resolving such a difficulty, should it
arise, there would be taken into consideration the fact that water
for domestic use should take priority over water intended for purposes of irrigation. Aside from that, these filings are first in point
as compared with those to which the Senator from Arizona referred.
They are for a superior use, and, in addition thereto, the applicant
who has made the filing has pursued the proper course in developing
the manner of appropriation or the manner of diverting the water
and putting it to the highest beneficial use. I do not anticipate
any difficulty on that score in resolving the question of priority by
the Secretary of the Interior." 70 Cong. Rec. 169.

repealed her ratification of the six-state Compact thereafter. 8 While the original committee amendment to the
Act would have required the Secretary to limit California's appropriations, the debates evidence no conviction
that the Secretary had even a permissive authority to do
so by virtue of the unamended § 5.
IV.
THE BEARING OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE
PROJECT ACT.

Nothing in the Project Act expressly gives the Secretary power to ignore appropriations so long as financial
conditions are met and the Compact and limitations are
observed. Senators Hayden and Pittman, as the Court
notes, did indicate that § 4 (a) provided for an apportionment of the water, although even they did not suggest
that § 4 (a) gave any authority to the Secretary to make
an apportionment by his contracts or to allocate the
burdens in time of shortage. But in any event, as already
noted, pp. 606-607, supra, § 4 does not by its terms make
an apportionment; rather it simply requires six-state
ratification of the Compact and an agreement by California to limit her share as conditions on the effectiveness
of the Act, and authorizes an apportionment by the
States themselves. In the words of Senator Johnson, the
provision
does not divide the water between Arizona and
California. It fixes a maximum amount beyond
which California can not go." 70 Cong. Rec. 385.
Nor does § 6, which requires that the dam be operated
for the satisfaction of "present perfected rights" among

other purposes, indicate by negative implication that the
Secretary may ignore all other appropriations. This provision was drafted by the Upper Basin States in order
to insure that the condition of the Compact had been
met to relieve them from the claims of perfected users
below.29 That condition was the construction of an adequate storage reservoir against which those claims could
be asserted; the Compact has nothing to do with whether
rights perfected under state law since 1929 may be ignored
by the Secretary in awarding contracts. Section 8 (b),
which subjects the United States and all users of the
Project to any compact allocating among the Lower Basin
States "the benefits, including power, arising from the use
of water accruing to said States," and which subjects such
an agreement, if made after January 1, 1929, to any delivery contracts made prior to its approval, is similarly
no authority for the Court's conclusion. Legislative
history is virtually silent as to the reason for giving such
contracts precedence, but the provision seems simply to
have been intended to promote the entering of contracts
by insuring their permanence in accordance with the requirement of § 5.10 There is no indication in § 8 (b)
whether or not the Secretary is free in awarding contracts
to ignore existing appropriations; it merely evidences a
policy that rights so perfected as to have been reduced
to a contract for delivery at a consideration, whatever the
basis on which they should be awarded, ought not to be
destroyed by a subsequent interstate agreement.
If the statute were completely silent as to whether the
Secretary may disregard appropriations, the normal inference would be that Congress did not mean to displace

existing law. Enough has been said of the statute's history to buttress this inference beyond question. Moreover, the statute is by no means silent on this matter.
The references in § 8 (a) and (b) to "appropriators" of
water stored or delivered by the Project, and in § 4 (a)
to the taking of steps "to initiate or perfect any claims
to the use of water" made available by the dam, are only
the least evidence." Section 14 provides that the Reclamation Act shall govern the operation of Hoover Dam
except as the Project Act otherwise provides. Section 8
of the Reclamation Act, 32 Stat. 390, 43 U. S. C. § 383,
directs the Secretary of the Interior in carrying out his
duties under the Act to proceed in accordance with state
and territorial laws and declares that nothing in the federal act "shall in any way affect any right of any State
or of the Federal Government or of any landowner, appropriator, or user of water in, to, or from any interstate
stream or the waters thereof."
Both Representative Swing and Senator Johnson emphasized that this provision was deliberately incorporated
into the Project Act to safeguard from federal destruction the rights of the States to their shares of the water.2
This Court made clear in Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S.
419, 463, that by thus protecting the rights of any State
in an interstate stream Congress intended to leave untouched the law of interstate equitable apportionment.

supremacy.

Reclamation Act, 32 Stat. 389, 43 U. S. C. § 431-that

background and legislative history, there can, I think, be
no doubt of the answer.
V.
THE LACK OF STANDARDS DEFINING THE LIMITS OF THE
SECRETARY'S POWER.

The Secretary,-the Court holds, has already apportioned
the waters of the mainstream by his contracts with Arizona and Nevada and has done so in accordance with the
formula suggested as a basis for an interstate agreement
in § 4 (a). This holding may come as a surprise to those
33Nor is anything said in City of Fresno v. California, 372 U. S.

627, relevant here, since the Court there stated only that if the
Government exercises its power of eminent domain, "the effect of
§ 8 in such a case is to leave to state law the definition of the property
interests, if any, for which compensation must be made." 372 U. S.,
at 630. Fresno did not consider the question now presented: the
effect of § 8 in the absence of any exercise of the federal power of
eminent domain.

responsible for a statement such as that in the Arizona
contract, which provides that its terms are
"... without prejudice to, any of the respective
contentions of said states and water users as to . . .
(5) what limitations on use, rights of use, and relative
priorities exist as to the waters of the Colorado River
system .... "
But whether the quantum of the Secretary's apportionment was intentional or inadvertent, the Court holds that
such an apportionment has been made, and the relevant
question for the future is the one that is perhaps primarily
responsible for this litigation: How is the burden of any
shortage to be borne by the Lower Basin States? This
question is not decided; the Court simply states that the
initial determination is for the Secretary to make.
What yardsticks has Congress laid down for him to
follow? There is, it is true, a duty imposed on the Secretary under § 6 to satisfy "present perfected rights," and
if these rights are defined as those perfected on or before
the effective date of the Act, it has been estimated that
California's share amounts to approximately 3,000,000
acre-feet annually. This, then, would be the floor provided by the Act for California, assuming enough water
is available to satisfy such present perfected rights. And
the Act also has provided a ceiling for California: the
4,400,000 acre-feet of water (plus one-half of surplus)
described in § 4 (a).
But what of that wide area between these two outer
limits? Here, when we look for the standards defining
the Secretary's authority, we find nothing." Under the
34 Nor, I submit, does the Court suggest any standards. Certainly,
there is nothing in the enumeration of purposes in § 6 which will be of
any assistance in helping the Secretary allocate the burden of shortages among competing irrigation and domestic uses within and among
the Lower Basin States.

OCTOBER TERM, 1962.
Opinion of

HARLAN,

373 U. S.

Court's construction of the Act, in other words, Congress
has made a gift to the Secretary of almost 1,500,000 acrefeet of water a year, to allocate virtually as he pleases in
the event of any shortage preventing the fulfillment of
all of his delivery commitments.
The delegation of such unrestrained authority to an
executive official raises, to say the least, the gravest
constitutional doubts. See Schechter Poultry Corp. v.
United States, 295 U. S. 495; Panama Refining Co. v.
Ryan, 293 U. S. 388; cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.
v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 587-589. The principle that
authority granted by the legislature must be limited by
adequate standards serves two primary functions vital to
preserving the separation of powers required by the Constitution. 3'

First, it insures that the fundamental policy

decisions in our society will be made not by an appointed
official but by the body immediately responsible to the
people.

Second, it prevents judicial review from becom-

ing merely an exercise at large by providing the courts
with some measure against which to judge the official
action that has been challenged.
The absence of standards under the Court's construction is an instructive illustration of these points. The
unrestrained power to determine the burden of shortages
is the power to make a political decision of the highest
order. Indeed, the political pressures that will doubtless
be brought to bear on the Secretary as a result of this
decision are disturbing to contemplate. Furthermore,
whatever the Secretary decides to do, this Court will
surely be unable effectively to review his actions, since it
will not know what guides were intended by Congress to
govern those actions.
These substantial constitutional doubts do not, of
course, lead to the conclusion that the Project Act must

be held invalid. Rather, they buttress the conviction,
already firmly grounded in the Act and its history, that
no such authority was vested in the Secretary by Congress. Its purpose instead was to leave these matters to
state law, and developed principles of equitable apportionment, subject only to the explicit exceptions provided
in the Act.
For these reasons I respectfully dissent from the construction which the Court puts upon this aspect of the
Act.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

dissenting.
I.

This case, I think, has been haunted by several irrelevancies. First, is the fact that the only points from
which California can take the water of the Colorado River
System are on the mainstream above Laguna Dam, there
being no tributaries in that State. This fact, I think,
leads the Court to the inference that the tributaries which
come in below Laguna Dam contain waters to which
California has no rights. The controversy does concern
the waters of the lower tributaries, but only indirectly.
California does not seek those waters. She merely seeks
to have them taken into consideration in the formula that
determines the allocation between her and Arizona.
Another irrelevancy is the fact that only 2 % of
the Colorado River drainage basin is in California, although 90% of the water which California appropriates
leaves the basin never to return. If we were dealing
with problems of equitable apportionment, as we were
in Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589, that factor would
be relevant to our problem. And it would be relevant in
case we were dealing with litigation concerning waters in
excess of the amount granted California under the Project
Act. But it is irrelevant here because the only justiciable

question that involves the volume of water is one that
concerns the source of supply out of which California's
4,400,000 acre-feet will be satisfied-a matter which I
think Congress resolved differently than has the Court.
Third, is a mood about the controversy that suggests
that here, as in the cases involving multipurpose federal
dams, federal control of navigable streams controls this
litigation. The right of the Federal Government to the
flow of the stream is not an issue here. We deal with a
very unique feature of the irrigation laws of the 17
Western States.
The question is not what Congress has authority to do,
but rather the kind of regime under which Congress has
built this and other irrigation systems in the West. Heretofore those regimes have been posited on the theory that
state law determines the allotment of waters coming
through the irrigation canals that are fed by the federal
dams.
Much is written these days about judicial lawmaking;
and every scholar knows that judges who construe statutes
must of necessity legislate interstitially, to paraphrase
Mr. Justice Cardozo. Selected Writings (1947 Hall ed.),
p. 160. The present case is different. It will, I think,
be marked as the baldest attempt by judges in modern
times to spin their own philosophy into the fabric of the
law, in derogation of the will of the legislature. The
present decision, as MR. JUSTICE HARLAN shows, grants
the federal bureaucracy a power and command over water
rights in the 17 Western States that it never has had, that
it always wanted, that it could never persuade Congress to
grant, and that this Court up to now has consistently refused to recognize. Our rulings heretofore have been consistent with the principles of reclamation law established
by Congress both in nonnavigable streams (Ickes v. Fox,
300 U. S. 82, 94-96) and in navigable ones. Nebraska v.
Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589, 612. The rights of the United

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

States as storer of waters in western projects have been
distinctly understood to be simply that of "a carrier and
distributor of the water." Ickes v. Fox, supra, p. 95. As
we stated in Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra, p. 614:
"The property right in the water right is separate
and distinct from the property right in the reservoirs,
ditches or canals. The water right is appurtenant to
the land, the owner of which is the appropriator.
The water right is acquired by perfecting an appropriation, i. e., by an actual diversion followed by an
application within a reasonable time of the water to
a beneficial use."
And that result was reached even though under those
other projects, as under the present one, the Secretary had
broad powers to make contracts governing the use and disposition of the stored water. See, e. g., 43 U. S. C. §§ 389,
440.
The men who wrote the Project Act were familiar with
western water law. Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419,
had recently been decided, holding that priority of appropriation was the determining factor in reaching an equitable apportionment between two Western States. Id.,
at 470. Yet, S. Rep. No. 654, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. 26-27,
contains no suggestion that Congress, by § 5, was displacing a doctrine as important to these Western States
as the doctrine of seizin has been to the development of
Anglo-American property law. Instead, only 25 lines of
that report are devoted to § 5, and those lines clearly support MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S conclusion that the section

was designed primarily as a financial tool.
The principle that water priorities are governed by
state law is deep-seated in western reclamation law. In
spite of the express command of § 14 of the Project Act,
which makes the system of appropriation under state law
determine who has the priorities, the Secretary of the

Interior is given the right to determine the priorities by
administrative fiat. Now one can receive his priority
because he is the most worthy Democrat or Republican,
as the case may be.
The decision today, resulting in the confusion between
the problem of priority of water rights and the public
power problem, has made the dream of the federal bureaucracy come true by granting it, for the first time, the
life-and-death power of dispensation of water rights long
administered according to state law.
II.
At issue on the other main phase of the case is the
meaning of the California limitation contained in § 4 (a)
of the Project Act. The Court, however, does not use
the present litigation as an occasion to determine Arizona's and California's rights under that Act, but as a
vehicle for making a wholly new apportionment of the
waters in the Lower Basin and turning over all unresolved problems to the Secretary of the Interior. The
Court accomplishes this by distorting both the history
and language of the Project Act.
The Court relies heavily on the terms and history of a
proposed tri-state compact, authorized by § 4 (a) but
never adopted by the States concerned, viz., Arizona, California and Nevada. The proposed tri-state compact provided for a division of tributary waters identical to that
made by the Court, insofar as the Gila is awarded to
Arizona. The Court in reality enforces its interpretation
of the proposed tri-state compact and imposes its terms
upon California.
The Court, however, cannot find in the proposed tristate compact (the one that was never approved) an allocation of the tributaries other than the Gila; and in order
to justify their allocation to Arizona it is forced to turn
to the terms of "proposals and counterproposals over the

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.

years," instead of to the language of the Project Act. The
result is the Court's, not that of Congress, whose intent
we have been called upon to discover and effectuate. The
congressional intent is expressed in § 4 (a), which provides
that California shall be limited to the use of 4,400,000
acre-feet "of the waters apportioned to the lower basin
States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado
River compact" (the compact that was approved) and to
not more than half of "any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said compact."' These waters are defined
in the Colorado River Compact as system waters, and not
as waters in the mainstream. Yet the Court restricts
California to mainstream waters. That is the essence of
the difference between us.
III.
As I read the Colorado River Compact and § 4 (a) of
the Project Act, California is entitled to add all uses of
system waters by Lower Basin States in the, tributaries
to those waters available in the mainstream to determine
(1) how much water she can take out of the first 7,500,000
acre-feet apportioned to the Lower Basin States by
Article III (a), and (2) whether there are excess or surplus system waters, including Article III (b) waters, of
which California has a right to no more than one-half.
I disagree with the Court's conclusion that § 4 (a)
of the Project Act refers only to the water flowing in the
mainstream below Lee Ferry. The Project Act speaks
clearly, and only, in terms of the waters apportioned to
the Lower Basin States by Article III (a) of the Compact,
viz., California may take no more than 4,400,000 acre-feet
"of the waters apportioned to the lower basin States
by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River

compact." Article III (a) of the Compact apportions
"from the Colorado River System in perpetuity to the
Upper Basin and to the Lower Basin, respectively, the
exclusive beneficial consumptive use of 7,500,000 acre-feet
of water per annum." The term "Colorado River System" is defined in Article II (a) as including the entire
mainstream and the tributaries.2
There is, moreover, not a word in Senate Report No.
592, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., reporting the Project Act,
that indicates, suggests, or implies that the Colorado
River is to be divided and California or any other Lower
Basin State restricted to mainstream water. The Report
indeed speaks of "enthroning the Colorado River compact" (id., p. 16), which embraces the entire river system
in the United States, not just the mainstream. See Article II (a). Arizona's fears that California would take
5,400,000 acre-feet from the first 7,500,000 acre-feet, if the
entire system were used as the source, are, I think, unfounded. Out of the first 7,500,000 acre-feet of system
water, California would be entitled only to 4,400,000 acrefeet. Out of the balance or 3,100,000 acre-feet, California
would be excluded.
How much of this 3,100,000 acre-feet should go to Arizona and how much to Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah
cannot be determined on this record, the relevant findings
not being made in light of the construction which has
been given to the Project Act, the Compact, and the Limitation Act. We cannot take as a guide the provisions in
the second paragraph of §4 (a) of the Project Act, viz., the
300,000 acre-feet proposed for Nevada and the 2,800,000
acre-feet proposed for Arizona, because those provisions
come into play only if Arizona, California, and Nevada
enter a compact, which to date they have not done. The
division of 3,100,000 acre-feet should, I think, be made

among Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah pursuant
to the principles of equitable apportionment. Nebraska
v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589.
The evidence is clear that the dependable Lower Basin
supply does not exceed 8,000,000 acre-feet if the river system is taken as a whole. By Article III (b) of the Compact the Lower Basin States can increase their beneficial
use by 1,000,000 acre-feet, if additional water is available. By § 4 (a) of the Project Act California is entitled
to not more than one-half of any excess that is "unapportioned by said compact." The amount apportioned
to the Lower Basin States by the Compact is 8,500,000
acre-feet, viz., Article III (a) waters in the amount of
7,500,000 "in perpetuity" plus Article III (b) waters,
which are highly contingent. After the Upper Basin is
given its 7,500,000 acre-feet, the "unapportioned" excess
described in Article III (b) would be available. As noted,
the present permanent supply for the Lower Basin would
not exceed 8,000,000 acre-feet from the mainstream and
the tributaries. As I read the Compact and the Project
Act, California would get out of the 8,000,000 acre-feet
4,400;000 acre-feet plus not more than one-half of Article
III (b) waters, which, under the foregoing assumption,
would amount to one-half of 500,000 acre-feet. If there
is a further surplus (either in the sense of Article III (b) or
in the more remote sense in which § 4 (a) of the Project Act
uses that word), 3 the division between the Lower Basin

waters, one-half of which is to go to California, the other to Arizona,
is meaningless if read literally. That turns on the meaning of the
words "excess or surplus waters unapportioned" by the Compact.
They mean, it is said, all waters unapportioned by Article III (a)
and (b), because Article III (c) defines or speaks of surplus in
such manner as to indicate that surplus is only that water over
and above Article III (a) and (b) water. This is true, at least
for the limited purpose of Article III (c). From that premise it
is reasoned that § 4 (a), literally construed, would allow Arizona
and California to split equally all waters over 16,000,000 acre-feet,

States should follow the principles of equitable apportionment which we applied in Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S.
589. If § 4 (a) is to be read as referring to system waters,
California's total rights in available Lower Basin waters
would amount to not more than 4,650,000 acre-feet annually (4,400,000 plus 250,000). She would also have a
right, albeit highly contingent, to any additional Article
III (b) waters that become available to the Lower Basin
and to such share of the waters in both Basins over
16,000,000 acre-feet (7,500,000 to Upper Basin, 7,500,000
to Lower Basin under Article III (a), plus 1,000,000 to
Lower Basin under Article III (b))
Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra.

as is equitable.

Under the Court's reading of § 4 (a), however, a far
different division is made.

The Court says that the

that is after 7,500,000 acre-feet went to each of the Basins, and after
the Lower Basin received an additional 1,000,000 acre-feet under
the provisions of Article III (b). If that is true and if California and
Arizona were allowed to divide up the rest, the Upper Basin States
would forever be limited to their initial 7,500,000 acre-feet, something
not contemplated by Article III (f), which specifically provides for
apportionment of waters in excess of 16,000,000 between the Upper
and Lower Basins. Thus, it is argued that the words "excess or
surplus waters" as used in § 4 (a) are meaningless and in hopeless
conflict with the terms of the Compact if read literally.
This interpretation is ill-founded. The first paragraph of § 4 (a)
contains only a limitation; it apportions no water. The tri-state
compact authorized by the second paragraph of § 4 (a) has never
been made. But, even if it had been made, it could affect only the
rights of its signatories vis-a-vis each other. For § 4 (a) explicitly
provides "that all of the provisions of said tri-State agreement shall
be subject in all particulars to the provisions of the Colorado River
compact."
The words "excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said compact" mean, I think, Article III (b) waters plus all waters in the
entire System in excess of 16,000,000 acre-feet. Not only does this
interpretation allow the Project Act and the Colorado River Compact to be construed as a harmonious whole, but it is also compelled
by the legislative history. See 70 Cong. Rec. 459-460.

language of § 4 (a) limiting California to 4,400,000 acrefeet "of the waters apportioDed to the lower basin
States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado
River compact" (7,500,000 acre-feet per annum) is just
a "shorthand" way of saying that California is limited to
4,400,000 acre-feet of the water available in the mainstream. According to the Court, California has no rights
in system waters, as this would include rights in the tributaries, and the Court has decided that the tributaries
belong exclusively to Arizona. Thus, if California is to
obtain any "excess or surplus" waters, the surplus must
be flowing in the mainstream. That is, California can
assert her right to "surplus" waters only when the flow
of the mainstream is more than 7,500,000 acre-feet per
year. But if, as the evidence shows, the dependable
Lower Basin supply of system waters is only 8,000,000
acre-feet per annum, 2,000,000 of which are in the tributaries, California can look only to 6,000,000 acre-feet
in the mainstream. Thus, California will never be entitled to any of the additional Article III (b) waters
(500,000 acre-feet) in the Lower Basin system. Those
"surplus" waters would necessarily be in the tributaries,
and under the Court's interpretation they belong exclusively to Arizona, § 4 (a) to the contrary notwithstanding.
As a practical matter, the only place California can get
system waters is from the mainstream, there being no
tributaries of the Colorado River in California. The
question to be decided is whether or not under § 4 (a) of
the Project Act California can take into consideration
Arizona's uses on her tributaries in determining her (California's) right to divert water from the mainstream. The
Court says California cannot, because when the Project
Act refers to her rights in system waters as the measuring rod, it really means her rights in mainstream
waters. With due respect, the majority achieves that
result by misreading the Colorado River Compact, the

Project Act, and by misreading the legislative history
leading up to the California Limitation Act. An analysis
of the legislative history will show, as already noted, that
the Court's analysis is built mainly upon statements made
by the various Senators in arguing the terms of a proposed
tri-state compact that was never made.
IV.
The Project Act needs the Compact to achieve a settlement of the issue of the apportionment of water involved
in this case. It is argued that an apportionment, constitutionally, can be achieved only in one of two waysby an interstate compact or by a decree of equitable
apportionment. That proposition need not, however, be
resolved here, because (apart from a contingency not
relevant here) the Project Act by the express terms of
4
§ 4 (a) is dependent on the ratification of the Compact.
If the Compact is ratified, it and the Project Act are
to supply the measure of waters which California may
claim.5
4 Under

§ 4 (a) of the Project Act it is provided that if all seven
States fail to ratify the Compact in six months (which in fact they
did fail to do), the Project Act shall not take effect until six of the
States, including California, ratify the Compact and waive the provisions of Article XI of the Compact (which required approval of all

seven States) and the President has so declared by public proclamation. A further condition was the passage of California's Limitation
Act. The Presidential Proclamation is dated June 25, 1929. 46
Stat. 3000; and California's Limitation Act was approved March 4,
1929, and became effective August 14, 1929.

5The Colorado River Compact is referred to many times in the
Project Act-§ 1, § 4 (a), § 6, § 8, § 12, § 13, § 18, and § 19.
By § 18 the rights of the States to waters within their borders are
not interfered with "except as modified by the Colorado River
compact or other interstate agreement."
By § 8 (a) "all users and appropriators" of water are "subject to
and controlled by said Colorado River compact . . . anything in

this Act to the contrary notwithstanding . ..

."

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA.
546

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

The overall accounting of the waters is provided for in
Article III of the Compact. By Article III (a) "the
exclusive beneficial consumptive use of 7,500,000 acrefeet of water per annum" is apportioned "in perpetuity to
the Upper Basin and to the Lower Basin, respectively,"
meaning that each basin gets 7,500,000 acre-feet. By
Article III (b) the Lower Basin is given the right to
increase its beneficial consumptive use by 1,000,000 acrefeet per annum. By Article III (c) any deficiency owed
Mexico "shall be equally borne by the Upper Basin
and the Lower Basin." The Lower Basin by definition
includes California. Article II (g). Tributary uses in
Arizona diminish California's right under Article III (c)
to require the Upper BasinStates to supply water to satisfy Mexico. California is to be charged with water from
the Gila when the accounting is made with Mexico. That
is, California is presumed to enjoy the waters from the
Lower Basin tributaries for purposes of Article III (c)
of the Compact. It is manifestly unfair to charge her
with those waters under Article III (c) of the Compact and to say that she is entitled to none of them in
computing the 4,400,000 acre-feet which the Limitation
Act and the Project Act give her out of the waters of
Article III (a) of the Compact.
Section 1 of the Project Act authorizes the Secretary of
the Interior to construct and operate the Boulder Dam
"subject to the terms of the Colorado River compact."
By § 4 (a) the Project Act is not to be operative unless
and until the seven States "shall have ratified the Colorado River compact"; and if they do not, then "the provisions of the first paragraph of Article XI of said compact"
must be waived. Moreover, the 4,400,000 acre-feet
allotted to California by § 4 (a) are described in terms "of
the waters apportioned to the lower basin States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River compact."
Section 4 (a) describes the "excess or surplus" waters in

terms of those "unapportioned by said compact"; and it
makes all "uses always to be subject to the terms of said
compact." The compact is, indeed, the underpinning of
the Project Act.
The Compact apportions the waters "from the Colorado River System," which by definition includes the
mainstream and its tributaries in the United States
And California's Limitation Act, containing the precise
language of the allocation of waters in § 4 (a) of the
Project Act, describes the 4,400,000 acre-feet in terms "of
the waters apportioned to the lower basin states by paragraph 'a' of article three of the said Colorado river
compact." 6
So it seems that the Compact is the mainspring from
which all rights flow. The 7,500,000 acre-feet of water
apportioned by Article III (a) of the Compact "from the
Colorado River System" to the Lower Basin is the supply
out of which California's 4,400,000 acre-feet is to be taken.
To repeat, the words "excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said compact," as used in § 4 (a) of the Project
Act, mean, in my view, all waters available in the Lower
Basin in excess of the first 7,500,000 acre-feet covered by
Article III (a) of the Compact.
The additional 1,000,000 acre-feet described in Article
III (b) was added to the Compact "to compensate for the

the Limitation Act incorporates the Compact:
"It may be true that the Boulder Canyon Project Act leaves in
doubt the apportionment among the states of the lower basin of
the waters to which the lower basin is entitled under Article III (b).
But the Act does not purport to apportion among the states of the
lower basin the waters to which the lower basin is entitled under the
Compact. The Act merely places limits on California's use of waters
under Article III (a) and of surplus waters; and it is 'such' uses
which are 'subject to the terms of said compact.'"

V.
While the legislative history of the California limitation contained in § 4 (a) looks several ways, much of
it is legislative history made with a view to its favorable
use in the future-a situation we have noticed on other
occasions. See Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Corp., 341
U. S. 384. I think an objective reading of that history
shows that the tri-state compact authorized by § 4 (a)
of the Project Act (a compact never made) was the one
and only way visualized by that Act through which
Arizona could get the exclusive use of the waters of the
Gila River. For the second paragraph of § 4 (a) of the
Project Act states that the tri-state compact, if made,
shall give Arizona "the exclusive beneficial consumptive
use of the Gila River and its tributaries" within the
boundaries of Arizona. Fears that this appropriation
would injure New Mexico are not relevant to our problem, since the proposed tri-state compact would not hurt
New Mexico unless she agreed to it. The legal rights of
States not parties to the Compact would be unimpaired,
as Arizona v. California,283 U. S.423, 462, holds. The
same applies to any concern that Upper Basin rights would
be imperiled by the tri-state compact.
After much discussion, the amendment allocating
4,400,000 acre-feet to California by § 4 (a) of the Project
Act was finalized by Senator Phipps, Chairman of the
Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation, who identified

those 4,400,000 acre-feet as system waters. He made it
unmistakably clear by adding to § 4 (a) the words "by
paragraph (a) of Article III" of the Compact which in his
words "show that that allocation of water refers directly
to the seven and one-half million acre-feet of water"
described by Article III (a) of the Compact. 70 Cong.
Rec. 459. That amendment was agreed to without a roll
call. 70 Cong. Rec. 473. Prior to that time Senator
Phipps had proposed that California receive 4,600,000
acre-feet. Id., p. 335.
The following colloquy took place:
"Mr. HAYDEN. Under the circumstances I
should like to inquire of the Senator from Colorado
how he arrives at the figure 4,600,000 acre-feet of
water instead of 4,200,000 acre-feet as proposed in
my amendment?
"Mr. PHIPPS. It was just about as difficult for
me to arrive at 4,600,000 acre-feet as it would have
been to arrive at 4,200,000 acre-feet. The arguments
pro and con have been debated in the committee for
quite a period of time. The contentions made by
the Senators from Arizona have not been conclusive
to my mind. For instance, I will refer to the fact
that Arizona desires to eliminate entirely all waters
arising in the watershed and flowing out of the Gila
River.
"Mr. HAYDEN. There is nothing of that kind
in the Senator's amendment.
"Mr. PHIPPS. There is nothing of that kind in
the Senator's amendment, but that has been one of
the arguments advanced by California as being an
offset to the amount to which Arizona would try
to limit California.
"Mr. HAYDEN. If the Senator thought there
was force in that argument, I should think that he

would have included in his amendment a provision
eliminating the waters of the Gila River and its
tributaries, as my amendment does.
"Mr. PHIPPS. I do not consider it necessary
because the bill itself, not only the present substitute measure but every other bill on the subject, ties
this question up with the Colorado River compact.
"Mr. HAYDEN. My amendment does that.
"Mr. PHIPPS. Yes; that is true, but under estimates of engineers-one I happen to recall being
made, I think, by Mr. La Rue-notwithstanding all
of the purposes to which water of the Gila may be
put by the State of Arizona, at least 1,000,000 acrefeet will return to the main stream. Yet Arizona
contends that that water is not available to California; whereas to-day and for years past at least
some of the waters from the Gila River have come
into the canal which is now supplying the Imperial
Valley.
"It is not a definite fixed fact that with the enactment of this proposed legislation the all-American
canal is going to be built within the period of seven
years; as a matter of fact, it may not be built at all;
we do not know as to that. But I do not think that
the water from the Gila River, one of the main tributaries of the Colorado, should be eliminated from
consideration. I think that Californiais entitled to
have that counted in as being a part of the basic
supply of water." (Italics added.)
It is plain from this, colloquy that Senator Phipps
thought that his amendment, limiting the amount California can claim, "ties this question up with the Colorado
River compact" and that the Gila River (below Lake
Mead) should be "counted in as being a part of the

basic supply of water" which California is entitled to
have included in the computations for the Lower Basin
States.
The word of Senator Phipps, who was chairman of the
committee and who offered the amendment, is to be taken
as against those in opposition or those who might be
making legislative history to serve their ends. Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Corp., supra, pp. 394-395: "The
fears and doubts of the opposition are no authoritative
guide to the construction of legislation. It is the sponsors
that we look to when the meaning of the statutory words
is in doubt."
If California were restricted by the Project Act to the
use of 4,400,000 acre-feet out of the mainstream, it is
difficult to believe that Senator Ashurst of Arizona would
have expressed his bitter minority views in the Report
on the Project Act. S. Rep. No. 592, 70th Cong., 1st
Sess., pt. 2. He said that the bill "sedulously and intentionally proposes to sever Arizona's jugular vein" (id.,
p. 3), that "the amount of water apportioned to California . . . is not warranted in equity, law, justice, or
morals" (id., p. 4), that the bill is "a reckless and relentless assault upon Arizona." Id., p. 38. He apparently
never imagined that the proposed legislation would confine California to mainstream water. He indeed charged
that the bill "authorizes California, which comprises only
21/2 per cent of the Colorado River Basin and contributes
no water, to appropriate . . . over 38 per cent of the
estimated constant water supply available in the main
Colorado River for all seven States in the basin and for
Mexico." Id., p. 5.
Like Senator Ashurst and like the Chairman of the
Senate Committee, Senator Phipps, I too read the Project
Act to speak in terms of the entire Colorado River System
in the United States.

part:
"This Act shall not take effect and no authority shall
be exercised hereunder and no work shall be begun and no
moneys expended on or in connection with the works or
structures provided for in.this Act, and no water rights
shall be claimed or initiated hereunder, and no steps shall
be taken by the United States or by others to initiate or
perfect any claims to the use of water pertinent to such
works or structures unless and until (1) the States of
Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico,
Utah, and Wyoming shall have ratified the Colorado River
compact, mentioned in section 13 hereof, and the President by public proclamation shall have so declared, or (2)
if said States fail to ratify the said compact within six
months from the date of the passage of this Act then, until
six of said States, including the State of California, shall
ratify said compact and shall consent to waive the provisions of the first paragraph of Article XI of said compact,
which makes the same binding and obligatory only when
approved by each of the seven States signatory thereto,
and shall have approved said compact without conditions,
save that of such six-State approval, and the President
by public proclamation shall have so declared, and, further, until the State of California, by act of its legislature,
shall agree irrevocably and unconditionally with the
United States and for the benefit of the States of Arizona,
Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, as
an express covenant and in consideration of the passage
of this Act, that the aggregate annual consumptive use

the Colorado River for use in the State of California,
including all uses under contracts made under the provisions of this Act and all water necessary for the supply of
any rights which may now exist, shall not exceed four million four hundred thousand acre-feet of the waters apportioned to the lower basin States by paragraph (a) of
Article III of the Colorado River compact, plus not more
than one-half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said compact, such uses always to be subject to
the terms of said compact.
"The States of Arizona, California, and Nevada are
authorized to enter into an agreement which shall provide
(1) that of the 7,500,000 acre-feet annually apportioned
to the lower basin by paragraph (a) of Article III of the
Colorado River compact, there shall be apportioned to
the State of Nevada 300,000 acre-feet and to the State
of Arizona 2,800,000 acre-feet for exclusive beneficial
consumptive use in perpetuity, and (2) that the State of
Arizona may annually use one-half of the excess or surplus waters unapportioned by the Colorado River compact, and (3) that the State of Arizona shall have the
exclusive beneficial consumptive use of the Gila River
and its tributaries within the boundaries of said State, and
(4) that the waters of the Gila River and its tributaries,
except return flow after the same enters the Colorado
River, shall never be subject to any diminution whatever
by any allowance of water which may be made by treaty
or otherwise to the United States of Mexico but if, as
provided in paragraph (c) of Article III of the Colorado
River compact, it shall become necessary to supply water
to the United States of Mexico from waters over and above
the quantities which are surplus as defined by said compact, then the State of California shall and will mutually
agree with the State of Arizona to supply, out of the main
stream of the Colorado River, one-half of any deficiency
which must be supplied to Mexico by the lower basin,

and ... (6) that all of the provisions of said tri-State
agreement shall be subject in all particulars to the provisions of the Colorado River compact . ...
By § 1 of the California Limitation Act it was provided that when the seven States approved the Compact
and its approval is proclaimed by the President that:
"... the State of California as of the date of such
proclamation agrees irrevocably and unconditionally with
the United States and for the benefit of the states of
Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and
Wyoming as an express covenant and in consideration
of the passage of the said 'Boulder canyon project act'
that the aggregate annual consumptive use (diversions
less returns to the river) of water of and from the Colorado
river for use in the State of California including all uses
under contracts made under the provisions of said
'Boulder canyon project act,' and all water necessary
for the supply of any rights which may now exist, shall
not exceed four million four hundred thousand acre-feet
of the waters apportioned to the lower basin states by
paragraph 'a' of article three of the said Colorado river
compact, plus not more than one-half of any excess or
surplus waters unapportioned by said compact, such uses
always to be subject to the terms of said compact."
Article III of the Compact provides in relevant part:
"(a) There is hereby apportioned from the Colorado
River System in perpetuity to the Upper Basin and to
the Lower Basin, respectively, the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of 7,500,000 acre-feet of water per annum,
which shall include all water necessary for the supply of
any rights which may now exist.
"(b) In addition to the apportionment in paragraph
(a), the Lower Basin is hereby given the right to increase
its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by one
million acre-feet per annum.

"(c) If, as a matter of international comity, the United
States of America shall hereafter recognize in the United
States of Mexico any right to the use of any waters of
the Colorado River System, such waters shall be supplied
first from the waters which are surplus over and above
the aggregate of the quantities specified in paragraphs (a)
and (b); and if such surplus shall prove insufficient for
this purpose, then, the burden of such deficiency shall be
equally borne by the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin,
and whenever necessary the States of the Upper Division
shall deliver at Lee Ferry water to supply one-half of the
deficiency so recognized in addition to that provided in
paragraph (d).
"(d) The States of the Upper Division will not cause
the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to be depleted below
an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre-feet for any period of ten
consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series
beginning with the first day of October next succeeding
the ratification of this compact."
