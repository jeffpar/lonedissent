DANIEL v. GOLIDAY
Per Curiam

DANIEL, DIRECTOR, COOK COUNTY DEPART-

MENT OF PUBLIC AID,
GOLIDAY ET AL.

ET AL. V.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS

No. 1211.

Decided May 25, 1970

District Court should consider bearing of Goldberg v. Kelly, 397
U. S. 254, and Wheeler v. Montgomery, 397 U. S. 280, on question
of entitlement of welfare recipients to notice and hearing before
reduction of benefits.
305 F. Supp. 1224, vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

The court below has held that the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to provide a recipient of public welfare benefits with notice
and a hearing prior to "termination, suspension, or
reduction" of benefits. This Court's subsequent decisions in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, and Wheeler
v. Montgomery, 397 U. S. 280, decided March 23, 1970,
dealt only with termination and suspension, not reduction, of benefits. We think that the bearing of those
decisions on the treatment of benefit reductions should
be determined in the first instance by the District Court
on a record developed by the parties with specific attention to that issue. Accordingly, the judgment is vacated
and the case is remanded to the District Court for
further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

JUSTICE STEWART dissent.
