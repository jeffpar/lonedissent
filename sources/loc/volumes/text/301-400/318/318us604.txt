applications of a similar kind, and thereby enforce those
rigorous standards in this Court's judicial administration
which alone will give us the freshness and vigor of thought
and spirit that are indispensable for wise decisions in the
causes committed to us.
MR. JUSTICE REED is of the opinion that this Court has
jurisdiction to grant the writ requested, Ex parte United
States, 287 U. S. 241, but concurs in this dissent on the
ground that application for the writ sought should have
been made first to the Circuit Court of Appeals.

REVENUE, v. SPROUSE.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 22. Argued November 10, 12, 1942.-Decided April 5, 1943.
1. Where a corporation having but two classes of stock, voting common
and non-voting common, distributes to all the shareholders of both
classes, in proportion to their respective holdings, a dividend of
non-voting common, the fair market value of which is its par
value, and which is backed by earnings and profits available for distribution in excess of its total value, neither the voting rights of
the voting common nor its right to share in dividends or in liquidation being altered by the distribution, so that the relations previously
existing between all the shareholders, or between the particular shareholder and the corporation, are in no wise disturbed by the distribution, the dividend is not subject to income tax. Const., Amendment
XVI; Revenue Act of 1936, ยง 115 (f) (1). P. 606.
2. Where the sole owner of the common stock of a corporation which
had common stock only, received a dividend of non-voting preferred
stock authorized by a charter amendment and the value of which

the opinion of the Court.
Certiorari was granted because the decisions below in
the two cases conflict. They arise under ยง 115 (f) (1) of
the Revenue Act of 1936:'
"A distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders in its stock or in rights to acquire its stock shall
not be treated as a dividend to the extent that it does not
constitute income to the shareholder within the meaning
of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution."

Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S.

No. 22
The respondent owned voting common stock in an
Oregon corporation which paid a ten per cent stock dividend in shares of non-voting common stock. The company had outstanding but two classes of stock: voting
common, of a par value of $397,471.25; and non-voting
common, of a par value of $819,333.06. The dividend
was of non-voting common of a par of $121,680.43 and was
distributed to holders of the voting and non-voting common. The' fair market value of the stock distributed as a
dividend was its par value, and the earnings or profits
available for distribution were in excess of its total value.
Neither the voting rights of the voting common, nor its
right to share in dividends and in liquidation, was altered
by the distribution.
The respondent, who owned no non-voting common,
received 200 shares of that class of stock. In his return
for 1936, he did not report the dividend as income. The
Commissioner determined a deficiency by including the
value of the dividend as income, and the Board of Tax
Appeals sustained him.2 The Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed, holding that the dividend was not constitutionally the subject of income tax if it was distributed
to holders of both classes of outstanding stock in proportion to their respective holdings. It accordingly remanded
the case to the Board to find the facts and to apply the
rule announced.'

HELVERING v. SPROUSE.

Opinion of the Court.

Voting Preferred Stock, of $100 par value, was authorized.
The directors voted a distribution to -stockholders of
$5,000 par of the preferred stock; and the petitioner, as
sole stockholder, received fifty shares as a stock dividend.
The earnings available for dividends were in excess of
the value of this stock. Petitioner still holds the preferred
stock and no dividends have been paid upon it. The
petitioner failed to return the stock dividend as income,
the respondent determined a deficiency, and the Board of
Tax Appeals affirmed his action. The Circuit of Appeals
affirmed the Board's decision.We think the judgment in No. 22 was right and that in
No. 66 erroneous. The cases are ruled by Helvering v.
Griffiths, ante, p. 371. While the petitioner in No. 66
received a dividend in preferred stock, the distribution
brought about no change whatever in his interest in the
corporation. Both before and after the event he owned
exactly the same interest in the net value of the corporation as before. At both times he owned it all and
retained all the incidents of ownership he had enjoyed
before.
In No. 22, the respondent insists that the distribution
of the dividend in nowise disturbed the relationship previously existing amongst all the stockholders, or that
previously existing between the respondent and the corporation. The court below has held that, if this is true,
the dividend did not constitute income.
We think Koshland v. Helvering, 298 U. S. 441, distinguishable. That was a case where there were both
preferred and common stockholders, and where a dividend
in common was paid on the preferred. We held, in the
circumstances there disclosed, that the dividend was income, but we did not hold that any change whatsoever in
the character of the shares issued as dividends resulted in

the receipt of income. On the contrary, the decision was
that, to render the dividend taxable as income, there must
be a change brought about by the issue of shares as a dividend whereby the proportional interest of the stockholder
after the distribution was essentially different from his
former interest.
No. 2 affirmed.
No. 66 reversed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 319.

Argued February 9, 10, 1943.-Decided April 5, 1943.

1. In the light of the character and history of the business of the insolvent corporation in this case, held that its petition for reorgauization under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act should have been
dismissed as not filed in "good faith" within the meaning of ยง 146
(3), (4), since it was unreasonable to expect that the company could
be reorganized as a going concern, and since the interests of creditors
would be best subserved in prior proceedings pending in state courts.

2. Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act may not be availed of merely
for the purpose of liquidation. P. 621.
