AGUILAR v. STANDARD OIL CO.
724

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The question presented by these cases is whether a shipowner is liable for wages and maintenance and cure to a
seaman who, having left his vessel on authorized shore
leave, is injured while traversing the only available route
between the moored ship and a public street. The injury
in No. 582 occurred while the seaman was departing
for his leave. That in No. 454 occurred while he was
returning.
The complaint in No. 582 discloses that the plaintiff,
respondent here, was a messman on the Steamship Beauregard, owned by defendant. On January 16, 1941, the
vessel, which apparently was engaged in the coastwise
trade between New Orleans and East Coast and Gulf
ports, was moored to Pier C, Port Richmond, Philadelphia. At about 6 p. m. plaintiff left the ship on shore
leave. As he was proceeding through the pier toward
the street, all the lights were extinguished. In the ensuing darkness, he fell into an open ditch at a railroad
siding. This caused injuries which required treatment
and prevented him from resuming his usual duties. This
action follbwed, for maintenance and cure and wages. On
defendant's motion, the District Court dismissed the complaint. The ground assigned was that, at the time of his
injury, plaintiff was not ashore on the ship's business.
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded (130 F. 2d 797), holding that, on the facts stated
in the complaint, defendant was liable for maintenance
and cure and wages.
The stipulation of facts in No. 454 discloses that on
April 18, 1938, the defendant's vessel, the Steamship E. M.
Clark, was lying docked at the premises of the Mexican
Petroleum Company, in Carteret, New Jersey, which defendant neither owned, operated, nor controlled. Petitioner, a member of the crew, obtained permission from

the master and went ashore on his own personal business.
In order to reach the vessel on returning from shore leave,
he had to pass through the premises of the Mexican Petroleum Company. After he had gone through the entrance gate 'and while he was walking on the roadway of
those premises about a half mile from the ship, he was
struck and injured by a motor vehicle which was neither
owned, operated, nor controlled by the defendant. Petitioner brought this action to recover $10,000, the expense
of his maintenance and cure for the injuries so incurred.
The District Court dismissed the complaint, and on appeal the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 130
F. 2d 154. Both courts acted on the ground that in going
ashore on personal business the plaintiff left the service
of the ship and therefore no liability for maintenance and
cure attached.
The cases were brought here to resolve the conflict thus
presented on an important question of maritime law.
All admit the shipowner is liable if the injury occurs
while the seaman is "in the service of the ship," and the
issue is cast in these ambiguous terms, the parties giving
different meanings to the ancient phrase.
The claimants say it includes the whole period of service covered by the seaman's articles; and, if he is injured
during this time, the right is made out, unless it is shown
by way of defense he has forfeited it by misconduct causing the injury. Since the injuries here took place during
the period and there
was admittedly no misconduct, it
r
is said the claims are established. Corollaries of this view
are that recovery is not conditioned on showing the injury
was received while the seaman was at work or doing some
errand for the employer, and that going ashore with leave,
or returning from it, is part of being "in the service of the
ship," whether or not it was to perform such an errand.
The shipowners regard the phrase more narrowly. In
their view, it requires the seaman to be injured, if ashore,

AGUILAR v. STANDARD OIL CO.
724

Opinion of the Court.

while he is "on duty" or at work, doing some task connected with the vessel's business. Going ashore simply
for diversion and relief from its routine and discipline, or
for any matter personal to the seaman, takes him out of
the service of the ship; and the departure is made the moment he steps off deck and onto the dock or pier, perhaps
as he descends the gangplank or ladder. Cf. The President Coolidge, 23 F. Supp. 575 (D. C.). Likewise, return
is not made until he is on board again. Cf. Lilly v. United
States Lines Co., 42 F. Supp. 214 (D. C.). In this view,
it is of no moment whether the injury results from the
seaman's fault or misconduct or from causes entirely
beyond his control.
It will aid in determining the scope of the liability to
consider its origin and nature.
From the earliest times, maritime nations have recognized that unique hazards, emphasized by unusual tenure
and control, attend the work of seamen. The physical
risks created by natural elements, and the limitations of
human adaptability to work at sea, enlarge the narrower
and more strictly occupational hazards of sailing and operating vessels. And the restrictions which accompany
living aboard ship for long periods at a time combine with
the constant shuttling between unfamiliar ports to deprive the seaman of the comforts and opportunities for
leisure, essential for living and working,1 that accompany
most land occupations. Furthermore, the seaman's unusual subjection to authority adds the weight of what
would be involuntary servitude for others to these extraordinary hazards and limitations of ship life.
Accordingly, with the combined object of encouraging
marine commerce and assuring" the well-being of seamen,
maritime nations uniformly have imposed broad responsibilities for their health and safety upon the owners of

ships.' In this country these notions were reflected early,
and have since been expanded, in legislation designed to
secure the comfort and health of seamen aboard ship,8 hos2 As Mr. Justice Story, then on circuit, observed in Harden v. Gordon, 2 Mason 541, 11 Fed. Cas. No. 6047 (C. C.), at 483, "Seamen
are by the peculiarity of their lives liable to sudden sickness from
change of climate, exposure to perils, and exhausting labour. They
are generally poor and friendless, and acquire habits of gross indulgence, carelessness, and improvidence. If some provision be not made
for them in sickness at the expense of the ship, they must often in
foreign ports suffer the accumulated evils of disease, and poverty, and
sometimes perish from the want of suitable nourishment ....
If
these expenses are a charge upon the ship, the interest of the owner will
be immediately connected with that of the seamen. The master will
watch over their health with vigilance and fidelity. He will take the
best methods, as well to prevent diseases, as to ensure a speedy recovery from them. He will never be tempted to abandon the sick to
their forlorn fate; but his duty, combining with the interest of his
owner, will lead him to succor their distress, and shed a cheering kindness over the anxious hours of suffering and despondency. Beyond
this, is the great public policy of preserving this important class of
citizens for the commercial service and maritime defence of the nation. Every act of legislation which secures their healths, increases
their comforts, and administers to their infirmities, binds them more
strongly to their country; and the parental law, which relieves them
in sickness by fastening their interests to the ship, is as wise in policy,
as it is just in obligation. Even the merchant himself derives an
ultimate benefit from what may seem at first an onerous charge. It
encourages seamen to engage in perilous voyages with more promptitude, and at lower wages. It diminishes the temptation to plunderage upon the approach of sickness; and urges the seamen to encounter
hazards in the ship's service, from which they might otherwise be disposed to withdraw."

pitalization at home 4 and care abroad.' The statutes are
uniform in evincing solicitude that the seaman shall have
at hand the barest essentials for existence. They do this
in two ways. One is by recognizing the shipowner's duty
to supply them, the other by providing for care at public
expense. The former do not create the duty. That existed long before the statutes were adopted. They merely
recognize the preexisting obligation and put specific legal
sanctions, generally criminal, behind it. Compare Harden v. Gordon, 2 Mason 541, 11 Fed. Cas. No. 6047
(C. C.); The George, 1 Sumn. 151, 10 Fed. Cas. No. 5329
(C. C.); The Forest, 1 Ware 429, 9 Fed. Cas. No. 4936
(D. C.). The provisions for public assistance were not intended to relieve the shipowner of his duty. On the contrary, their purpose was to make sure the seaman would
have care, if the employer should fail to give it and in the
rarer cases to which his obligation does not extend. The
legislation therefore gives no ground for making inferences
adverse to the seaman or restrictive of his rights. Cf.
Reed v. Canfield, 1 Sumn. 195, 20 Fed. Cas. No. 11,641
(C. C.). Rather it furnishes the strongest basis for regarding them broadly, when an issue concerning their
scope arises, and particularly when it relates to the general character of relief the legislation was intended to

secure.

Among the most pervasive incidents of the responsibility anciently imposed upon a shipowner for the health
and security of sailors was liability for the maintenance
and cure of seamen becoming ill or injured during the period of their service.' In the United States this obligation
has been recognized consistently as an implied provision in

liability,
unlike that for incontract of employment,

is predicated on the fault or negligence of the shipowner.
Whether by traditional standards he is or is not responsible for the injury or sickness, he is liable for the expense
of curing it as an incident of the marine employer-employee relationship.' So broad is the shipowner's obliga6See, e. g., Laws of Oleron, Articles VI, VII; Laws of Wisbuy, Articles

Gordon, supra.
The Laws of Oleron are typical of the provision for injuries: "If any
of the mariners hired by the master of any vessel, go out of the ship
without his leave, and get themselves drunk, and thereby there happens contempt to their master, debates, or fighting and quarrelling
among themselves, whereby some happen to be wounded: in this case
the master shall not be obliged to get them cured, or in any thing to
provide for them, but may turn them and their accomplices out of the

ship; .

. but if by the master's orders and commands any of the

ship's company be in the service of the ship, and thereby happen to
be wounded or otherwise hurt, in that case they shall be cured and
provided for at the costs and charges of the said ship." Article VI.

on the seaman's part will not relieve him of the responsibility. Peterson v. The Chandos, 4 F. 645 (D. C.); see
also The J. F. Card, 43 F. 92 (D. C.); The Ben Flint, 1
Abb. (U. S.) 126, 3 Fed. Cas. No. 1299 (D. C.). Conceptions of contributory negligence, the fellow-servant
doctrine, and assumption of risk have no place in the
liability or defense against it. Only some wilful misbehavior or deliberate act of indiscretion suffices to deprive
the seaman of his protection. The Ben Flint, supra.

classic predisposition of sailors ashore." Other recent
cases, however, disclose a tendency to expand these traditional exceptions. 1

ployer nor wholly free to dispose of his leisure as he sees
fit. Of necessity, during the voyage he must eat, drink,
lodge and divert himself within the confines of the ship.
In short, during the period of his tenure the vessel is not
merely his place of employment; it is the framework of
his existence. For that reason, among others, his employer's responsibility for maintenance and cure extends beyond injuries sustained because of, or while engaged in,
activities required by his employment. In this respect it
is a broader liability than that imposed by modern workmen's compensation statutes." Appropriately it covers
all injuries and ailments incurred without misconduct on
the seaman's part amounting to ground for forfeiture, at
least while he is on the ship, "subject to the call of duty
as a seaman, and earning wages as such." The Bouker

xieither with the liberality which courts of admiralty traditionally have

Opinion of the Court.

When he leaves the ship contrary to orders, however, the
owner's duty is ended." Between these extremes are the
instant cases, raising for the fir§t time here the question of
the existence and scope of the shipowner's duty when the
seaman is injured while on shore leave but without specific
chore for the ship. Liability in that circumstance was
obscured in the first maritime codes,"8 and although early
suggested has been recognized only implicitly in lower
federal courts. 9 Very recently it has been explicitly denied in several district courts.2 0
We think that the principles governing shipboard injuries apply to the facts presented by these cases. To
relieve the shipowner of his obligation in the case of injuries incurred on shore leave would cast upon the seaman
hazards encountered only by reason of the voyage. The
assumption is hardly sound that the normal uses and
purposes of shore leave are "exclusively personal" and
have no relation to the vessel's business. Men cannot
live for long cooped up aboard ship, without substantial
impairment of their efficiency, if not also serious danger to
discipline. Relaxation beyond the confines of the ship is
Montezuma, 19 F. 2d 355 (C. C. A.); Gomes v. Pereira,42 F. Supp. 328

(D. C.).
17 Sound reasons of discipline long have impelled this rule. Cf., e. g.,

Laws of Oleron, Art. VII; Marine Ordinances of Louis XIV, suprla;
Laws of Wisbuy, supra; and compare Pierce v. Patton,supra,note 10.
18 Thus, while the Laws of Oleron and the Marine Ordinances of
Louis XIV, supra, relieve from liability for injuries incurred while on
shore without leave, they say nothing on the question here involved.
Similarly, the Laws of Wisbuy, supra, are ambiguous on this point.
The Laws of the Hanse Towns suggest that any injuries received otherwise than in the ship's service are not within the right to maintenance
and cure.

necessary if the work is to go on, more so that it may move
smoothly. No master would take a crew to sea if he could
not grant shore leave, and no crew would be taken if it
could never obtain it. Even more for the seaman than for
the landsman, therefore, "the superfluous is the necessary
. . . to make life livable"

21

and to get work done. In

short, shore leave is an elemental necessity in the sailing
of ships, a part of the business as old as the art, not merely
a personal diversion.
The voyage creates not only the need for relaxation
ashore, but the necessity that it be satisfied in distant and
unfamiliar ports. If, in those surroundings, the seaman,
without, disqualifying misconduct, contracts disease or
incurs injury, it is because of the voyage, the shipowner's
business. That business has separated him from his usual
places of association. By adding this separation to the
iestrictions of living as well as working aboard, it forges
dual and unique compulsions for seeking relief wherever
it may be found. In sum, it is the ship's business which
subjects the seaman to the risks attending hours of relaxation in strange surroundings. Accordingly, it is but reasonable that the business extend the same protections
against injury from them as it gives for other risks of the
employment.
It was from considerations of exactly this character that
the liability for maintenance and cure arose. From them,
likewise, its legal incidents were derived. The shipowner
owes the protection regardless of whether he is at fault;
the seaman's fault, unless gross, cannot defeat it; unlike
the statutory liability of employers on land, it is not limited to strictly occupational hazards or to injuries which
have an immediate causal connection with an act of labor.
An obligation which thus originated and was shaped in response to the needs of seamen for protection from the
21

Opinion of the Court.

hazards and peculiarities of marine employment should
not be narrowed to exclude from its scope characteristic
and essential elements of that work. And, indeed, no decision has been found which so narrows the shipowner's
parallel obligation in the case of sickness or disease.
Rather, the implications of existing authority point the
other way. Cf. The Bouker No. 2, supra.22 The considerations, including those of public interest adverted to by23
Mr. Justice Story, which support the liability for illness,
or for injuries received aboard ship, likewise sustain it for
injuries incurred on shore leave, as were those now in
issue. To exclude such injuries from the scope of the
liability would ignore its origins and purposes.
There is strong ground, therefore, for regarding the right
to maintenance and cure as covering injuries received
without misconduct while on shore leave. Certainly the
nature and foundations of the liability require that it be
not narrowly confined or whittled down by restrictive and
artificial distinctions defeating its broad and beneficial
purposes. If leeway is to be given in either direction, all
the considerations which brought the liability into being
dictate it should be in the sailor's behalf. In this view,
22

See also Holmes v. Hutchinson, Gilp. 447, 12 Fed. Cas. No. 6639
(D. C.); The Forest, 1 Ware 429, 9 Fed. Cas. No. 4936 (D. C.); The
Nimrod, 1 Ware 1, 18 Fed. Cas. No. 10,267 (D. C.); and see cases
cited supra, note 10.
23At the argument, it was suggested that a reason which might
sustain the imposition of liability for sickness innocently contracted on
shore leave, but not for injuries so incurred, would be the difficulty of
proving origin ashore. The difficulty undoubtedly would exist in some
cases, but hardly in all. No authority has been found which suggests
this explanation. Rather, cases of illness, which are within the reason
and policy of the liability, are indistinguishable from cases of injury
received without misconduct. The risk of incidence is not less in
the one case than in the other. The afflicted seaman is made as helpless and dependent by injury as by illness. His resources for meeting
the catastrophe and his employer's burden are not greater because he is
hurt rather than ill.

wholly foreign in aim and effect. The sailor departing for'
or returning from shore leave is, sensibly, no more beyond
the broad protection of his right to maintenance and cure
than is the seaman quitting the ship on being discharged
or boarding it on first reporting for duty. Cf. The Michael
Tracy, 295 F. 680 (C. C. A.); The Scotland, 42 F. 925

(D. C.).
Plaintiffs here were injured while traversing an area
between their moored ships and the public streets by an
appropriate route. It is true that in No. 454 the area consisted of the extensive premises of the Mexican Petroleum
Company, at whose dock the ship was moored. And it is
said the shipowner should not be liable because he had
no control over the premises. But it was the shipowner's
business which required the use of those facilities. And
his obligation to care for the seaman's injuries is, as has
been shown, in no sense a function of his negligence or
fault. While his ability to control conditions aboard'
ship may be to some extent an element in creating his
responsibility, it is only one of many, is not definitive, and
by no means determines the occasions on which his obligation arises. Consequently, the fact that the shipowner
might not be liable to the seaman in damages for the

Opinion of the Court.

dock-owner's negligence, cf. Todahl v. Sudden & Christenson, 5 F. 2d 462 (C. C. A.), does not relieve him of his
duty of maintenance and cure. We can see no significant
difference, therefore, between imposing the liability for
injuries received in boarding or quitting the ship and enforcing it for injuries -incurred on the dock or other premises which must be traversed in going from the vessel to
the public streets or returning to it from them. That
much, at least, is within the liability. How far it extends
beyond that point we need not now determine. And, in
view of the ground on which we rest the decision, it is not
necessary to consider the effects of the Shipowners' Liability Convention of 1936,24 other than to state that it in
no way alters the conclusion here reached.
24 By presidential proclamation the Convention became effective for
the United States and its citizens on October 29, 1939 (54 Stat. 1693).
Article 2 provides:
"1. The shipowner shall be liable in respect of(a) sickness and injury occurring between the date specified in
the articles of agreement for reporting for duty and the
termination of the engagement;
(b) death resulting from such sickness or injury.
"2. Provided that national laws or regulations may make exceptions
in respect of:
(a) injury incurred otherwise than in the service of the ship;
(b) injury or sickness due to the wilful act,' default or misbehaviour of the sick, injured or deceased person;
(c) sickness or infirmity intentionally concealed when the engagement is entered into.
"3. National laws or regulations may provide that the shipowner
shall not be liable in respect of sickness, or death directly attributable
to sickness, if at the time of the engagement the person employed refused to be medically examined."

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of

STONE, C. J.

318 U. S.

The judgment in No. 582 is affirmed; that in No. 454
is reversed and remanded to the District Court for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
No. 582 affirmed.
No. 454 reversed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

did not participate in the consid-

eration or decision of this case.

The CHIEF JUSTICE thinks that the judgment in No. 454,
Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., should be affirmed for the
reasons stated in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals below, 130 F. 2d 154. In No. 582, Waterman Steamship Corp. v. Jones, he concurs in the result on the ground
that the recovery was authorized by the Shipowners' Liability Convention, 54 Stat. 1695, which became effective
before the date of respondent's injury. He is of opinion
that Article 2, Clause 1 of the treaty authorizing the recovery is self-executing, and that the exceptions permitted
by Clause 2 are not operative in the absence of Congressional legislation giving them effect. (See letter of Secretary of State to the President, dated June 12, 1939,
