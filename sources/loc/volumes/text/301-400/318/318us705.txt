Opinion of the Court.

.MR. JUSTICE MURPHY

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This petition for certiorari presents the questions
whether certain lands held by respondent Indians, subject
to restrictions against alienation and encumbrance without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, were
exempt from Oklahoma real estate taxes for the year 1937
by virtue of the Act of June 20, 1936, 49 Stat. 1542; '
whether a portion of those lands were exempt for subsequent years by virtue of the Act of 1936 as amended by the
Act of May 19, 1937, 50 Stat. 188; 2 and whether the Acts
of 1936 and 1937, so applied, are constitutional.
The facts are agreed. Prior to 1931, the Secretary of
the Interior purchased three tracts of land, two rural and
one urban, in Creek County, Oklahoma, for Wosey John
Deere, an enrolled, full-blood member of the Creek Tribe
of Indians. The purchase price was paid out of restricted
royalties from an oil and gas lease of her restricted allot' Section 2 of this Act provides:
"All lands the title to which is now held by an Indian subject to
restrictions against alienation or encumbrance except with the consent or approval of the Secretary of the Interior, heretofore purchased out of trust or restricted funds of said Indian, are hereby declared to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government and shall
be nontaxable until otherwise directed by Congress."
2 The 1937 Act amended ยง 2 of the 1936 Act to read as follows:
"All homesteads, heretofore purchased out of the trust or restricted
funds of individual Indians, are hereby declared to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government and shall be nontaxable until otherwise
directed by Congress: Provided, That the title to such homesteads
shall be held subject to restrictions against alienation or encumbrance
except with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior: And provided further, That the Indian owner or owners shall select, with
the approval of the Secretary of te Interior, either the agricultural
and grazing lands, not exceeding a total of one hundred and sixty
acres, or the village, town or city property, not exceeding in cost
$5,000, to be designated as a homestead."

ted land. She was given title subject to a condition
against alienation or encumbrance without approval of
the Secretary prior to April 26, 1931.1 Before that date,
with the approval of the Secretary, she reserved a life estate and conveyed the fee to her children, full-blood but
un-enrolled Creeks and respondents here, subject to a like
condition against alienation or encumbrance without the
approval of the Secretary with the exception that the restriction had no definite time limitation. On December
10, 1937, Wosey John Deere conveyed her life estate to
respondents so that they became full owners subject to a
restriction against alienation or encumbrance without the
approval of the Secretary. Both conveyances were in
consideration of love and affection. Thereafter, on December 16, 1937, respondents designated the two rural
tracts, totalling eighty-seven and one-half acres, as a tax
exempt homestead under the provisions of the Act of
May 19, 1937, and the Secretary approved this designation on March 24,1938.
Before the Act of June 20,. 1936, the lands were subject
to Oklahoma real estate taxes.' Thereafter all three
tracts were continued on the tax rolls of Creek County,
and respondents, to avoid the accumulation of penalties
and interest and a sale of the lands for taxes, paid the

Sunderland v. United States, 266 U. S. 226, it was held that the

Secretary of the Interior had power to impose such a restriction
against alienation or encumbrance with respect to lands purchased
for Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes (of which the Creeks are
one) with the proceeds from sales of their restricted allotted lands.
We think it clear that he also has authority to impose such restrictions upon lands purchased with restricted funds from leases of restricted allotted lands (see Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276
U. S. 575, and United States v. Brown, 8 F. 2d 564 at 568), and to
make those restrictions run with the lands in the hands of Indian
grantees. Cf. Drummond v. United States, 34 F. 2d 755, 758-59;

taxes for the years 1936, 1937, 1938, and part of 1939.
On July 26, 1940, they filed this action in federal district
court for the recovery of the 1936 and 1937 taxes paid
on all three tracts, for the recovery of the 1938 and 1939
taxes paid on the two rural tracts designated as homestead
lands, and for a declaration that the homestead lands were
tax exempt. The district court gave judgment as prayed.
38 F. Supp. 731. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed
for the most part but reversed with respect to the 1936
taxes on the ground that liability for them became fixed
on the assessment date, January 1, 1936, before the enactment of the Act of June 20, 1936. Interest on the taxes
paid was also disallowed. 130 F. 2d 663. The importance
of the case in the administration of Indian affairs and its
impact upon state finances caused us to grant the County's
petition for certiorari. Respondents have not cross-petitioned for review of the adverse decision on the 1936 taxes
and the allowance of interest, so it is unnecessary to consider those questions.
We hold that the 1936 Act extended tax immunity to
all three tracts for the year 1937, that thereafter the 1937
Act exempted the designated homestead lands, and that
both Acts, so applied, are constitutional.
Section 2 of the 1936 Act conditions tax immunity upon
two requirements: (1) "title" to the lands must be "held
by an Indian subject to restrictions against alienation or
encumbrance except with the consent or approval of the
Secretary of the Interior"; and, (2) the lands must have
been "heretofore purchased out of trust or restricted funds
of said Indian." Both requirements are met here with
respect to all three tracts. These lands were purchased
from the restricted royalties received from an oil and gas
lease of the restricted allotted lands of Wosey John Deere,
and, on the assessment day, January 1, 1937, ' she held

title to a freehold life estate in all the parcels, subject to
restrictions against alienation and encumbrance which
were validly imposed by the Secretary of the Interior.'
Petitioners advance two arguments against the applicability of the 1936 Act. First, they contend, from remarks made by the sponsor of the 1936 Act in the Senate,7
that the Act applied only to lands purchased for landless
Indians, and thus did not extend to lands purchased from
the restricted funds of Wosey John Deere, who held allotted land. We do not read those remarks as limiting
the scope of the 1936 Act to landless Indians; they do
not deal in terms of exclusiveness. But if they are to be
interpreted as petitioners contend, we do not accept them
as definitive, because they are opposed to the clear words
of the Act, the reasons for its enactment,8 its contemporary
taxes are levied as of July 1. See Board of Commissioners v. Central
Baptist Church, 136 Okla. 99, 276 P. 726; In re Sinclair PrairieOil Co,
175 Okla. 289, 53 P. 2d 221; In re Champlin Refining Co., 186 Okla.
625, 99 P. 2d 880. For the purposes of this case, we assume without
deciding that the status of the property on the assessment date is
determinative.
"See Note 3, ante.
7Senator Thomas said in part: "Formerly the Congress authorized
the Secretary of the Interior to buy land for landless Indians. The
Secretary proceeded to buy the lands and assigned the Indians to reside
upon such lands. The recommendation or assertion was made to the
Indians that the land would be theirs and they would have no taxes to
pay. . . . In some cases tax warrants have been issued and the
Indians have been threatened with dispossession. The Department
believes that, in order to keep faith with the Indians, the tax warrants
and tax assessments should be paid and the title to the lands cleared.
The bill authorizes the appropriation of money for that purpose.
"Section 2 provides that the lands so secured shall hereafter be nontaxable." 80 Cong. Rec. 9159.
8 The Meriam Report to the Secretary of the Interior on the Problem
of Indian Administration (Brookings Institute, 1928), pp. 795-98,
pointed out that allotments were often unsuitable for homes, that other
lands had to be purchased, and that while restricted allotted lands and
the trust proceeds thereof had been held immune from state taxation,

administrative interpretation,' and its subsequent Congressional history." Secondly, petitioners assert that the
exemption of the 1936 Act was personal and extended only
to lands the title to which was held by the Indian whose
restricted funds were used to purchase the lands. This
position finds some support in the language of the Act,
referring to "lands the title to which is held by an Indian
I purchased out of trust or restricted funds of said
Indian," but it is unnecessary to determine whether the
purpose of Congress was such that the Act should be more
broadly construed than its technical terms might indicate.
For, even assuming arguendo that petitioners are correct
in saying that the 1936 Act afforded only a personal exemption, Wosey John Deere, whose restricted funds purchased the three tracts, held a restricted life estate in each
tract on January 1, 1937, the assessment date. As the life
the tax status of property purchased with trust funds from sale or lease
of allotted lands was in doubt. Legislation conferring tax exemption
was recommended to protect the Indians against inability to pay or
their insufficient sense of public responsibility, and to keep faith since
officials of the federal government had expressly or impliedly represented that lands so purchased were tax exempt. The House and
Senate reports show that this was the problem at which the 1936 Act
was aimed. H. Rep. 2398, S. Rep. 2168, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. See also
Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law (1942), pp. 260-61.
" The Acting Attorney General and the Solicitor of the Department
of th Interior both ruled that the 1936 Act applied to lands purchased
from the restricted funds of individual Osage Indians who were not
landless. 38 Op. A. G. 577; 56 I. D. 48.

Act, the House Committee on Indian Affairs said: "It will be observed
from the language of section 2, . . . that it applies to all lands pur-

chased by restricted Indian funds, and the Attorney General so held."
H. Rep. 562, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. (emphasis supplied). The Senate

238 P. 491; Waldon v. Baker, 184 Okla. 492, 495, 88
P. 2d 352. Since the 1936 Act was concerned with a tax
exemption, the proper test of whether an Indian purchaser
had "title," within the meaning of the Act, must be
whether he had retained such a property interest that, but
for the Act, he would be subjected to the tax. Here
Wosey John Deere retained such a title, and the three
tracts were clearly within the 1936 Act, even accepting
petitioners' construction.
Likewise, the two rural parcels comply with the description contained in the 1937 Act, which provides in part:
"All homesteads, heretofore purchased out of the trust or
restricted funds of individual Indians, . . . shall be nontaxable until otherwise directed by Congress: Provided,
That the title to such homesteads shall be held subject to
restrictions . . ." Those parcels were purchased from
the restricted funds of an individual Indian, Wosey John
Deere; respondents hold them subject to valid restrictions;"' and they were properly designated by respondents as homestead lands on December 16, 1937, prior to
the 1938 assessment date.12 In view of the legislative history of the 1937 Act, summarized in Note 10, supra, petitioners' argument that the 1937 Act applies only to lands
purchased for landless Indians must be rejected.
It has been suggested that the tax exemption granted
by the 1937 Act is personal to the Indian whose restricted
funds were used to purchase the land, or else that it extends to the land in the hands of restricted Creek Indian
grantees only until 1956, consonantly with the statutes

governing the tax status of restricted allotted lands of the

Creeks." The Act does not say, however, and there is
not a word to suggest that upon transfer of the lands to
Indian heirs or grantees, subject to restrictions, the exemption is either to terminate or else extend only until
1956. If Congress had intended either result, it could
easily have expressed those purposes. It did neither, but
provided instead that the lands while restricted were to
remain nontaxable until it directed otherwise. In the
absence of explicit Congressional direction, we do not
think we should hold the exemption personal or attempt
to derive an applicable principle from the complicated
and admittedly ambiguous statutes governing the tax status of restricted allotted Creek lands. Respondents received the land, which they have designated as a homestead, subject to restrictions of indefinite duration which
the Secretary of the Interior had authority to impose. 4
It seems only fair, as the clear words of the 1937 Act provide, that the tax exemption should follow the restrictions
and continue so long as they do, unless Congress meanwhile provides to the contrary. Even if the 1937 Act
were ambiguous, we think this interpretation should be
taken. Cf. United States v. Reily, 290 U. S. 33, 39.
It is argued, however, that the 1936 Act created only a
personal exemption, and the 1937 Act gave no more because it was an amendment to the 1936 Act intended
solely to limit the unnecessarily broad exemption of that
Act. It is true that this was the avowed purpose of the
1937 Act," but it does not follow that the 1937 Act grants

but a personal exemption or else allows the exemption only
until 1956. While the question need not be decided, it is
appropriate to notice that the purpose of the 1936 Act
makes it at least doubtful whether that Act afforded only a
personal exemption. Assuming, however, that it did, there
is nothing to indicate that the 1937 Act, contrary to its
terms, incorporated the same limitation. The applicable
committee report sheds no light one way or another. 6
There is no inconsistency between the object of the 1937
Act to limit the sweeping exemption of all lands, granted
by the 1936 Act, to homestead lands, and a purpose to enlarge the exemption accorded to the relatively small
amount of homestead lands so that it would apply to restricted homesteads passing to Indian heirs or grantees.
The fact that extensive changes in language were made in
the 1937 Act is persuasive, moreover, that a change in
sense from the presumed personal exemption of the 1936
Act was intended. If the only object of the 1937 Act was
to limit the application of the 1936 Act (with its assumed
personal exemption) to homesteads, that purpose could
have been accomplished simply by substituting the word
"homesteads" for the word "lands." We cannot accept
the view that the substantial changes in language were
only matters of style. Furthermore, it has not been suggested that respondents, as takers from the original purchaser, were incompetent to designate the lands as a
homestead under the 1937 Act. If they could do that, as
we and apparently the Secretary of the Interior think they
could,' it would seem to follow that, having properly
designated their homestead under the Act, they are entitled to the tax exemption afforded restricted homesteads
by the Act until Congress otherwise directs.

See Note 12,

BOARD OF COMM'RS v. SEBER.
705

Opinion of the Court.

The Acts of 1936 and 1937 are constitutional. From
almost the beginning, the existence of federal power to
regulate and protect the Indians and their property
against interference even by a state has been recognized.
Cf. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515. This power is not
expressly granted in so many words by the Constitution,
except with respect to regulating commerce with the
Indian tribes, but its existence cannot be doubted. In
the exercise of the war and treaty powers, the United
States overcame the Indians and took possession of their
lands, sometimes by force, leaving them an uneducated,
helpless and dependent people, needing protection against
the selfishness of others and their own improvidence. Of
necessity, the United States assumed the duty of furnishing that protection, and with it the authority to do all that
was required to perform that obligation and to prepare
the Indians to take their place as independent, qualified
members of the modern body politic. This was classically
summarized in United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375,
384-85:
"From their [the Indians'] very weakness and helplessness, so largely due to the course of dealing of the Federal
Government with them and the treaties in which it has
been promised, there arises the duty of protection, and
with it the power. This has always been recognized by
the Executive and by Congress, and by this court, whenever the question has arisen.
"The power of the General Government over these remnants of a race once powerful, now weak and diminished
in numbers, is necessary to their protection, . . . It
must exist in that government, because it never has existed anywhere else, because the theater of its exercise is
within the geographical limits of the United States, because it has never been denied, and because it alone can
enforce its laws on all the tribes."

After 1871, Congress turned from regulating Indian
affairs by treaties to regulation by agreement and legislation. The plenary character of this legislative power over
various phases of Indian affairs has been recognized on
many occasions."8 One aspect of this legislative program
commenced with the General Allotment Act of 1887, 24
Stat. 388, followed by various other allotment acts dealing with specific tribes," whereby Congress embarked
upon a policy of assimilating the Indians through dissolution of tribal governments and the compulsory individualization of Indian land. ' To lessen the difficulty of the
period of transition and to protect the allottees' interest
in their lands, Congress, by the device of the trust patent
or a restricted fee, denied them the power to alienate or
encumber their lands for fixed periods of time, subject to
extension-denials which were sustained as proper exercises of Congressional power. Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 310-17; Brader v. James, 246

of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 984, and by the Oklahoma Welfare Act of

June 26, 1936, 49 Stat. 1967. These and other recent statutes reflect
a change in policy, the theory of which is that Indians can better
meet the problems of modern life through corporate, group, or tribal
action, rather than as assimilated individuals.

U. S. 88, 96; Sunderland v. United States, 266 U. S. 226,
233-34. The obligation and the power of the United
States to protect and preserve those restricted allotted
lands for the Indian owners has been recognized, Heckman v. United States, 224 U. S. 413, and they were held
immune from state taxation as instrumentalities by which
the United States provided for the welfare and education
of its Indian wards. Rickert v. United States, 188 U. S.
432.1 It has also been held by the lower federal courts
that proceeds from the sale or lease of restricted allotted
lands are immune from state taxation. See United States
v. Thurston County, 143 F. 287; National Bank of Commerce v. Anderson, 147 F. 87. When this Court came to
consider the tax status of lands of the character here involved, that is, lands purchased for an Indian from the
trust or restricted proceeds of his restricted allotted land,
it said that, "In a broad sense all lands which the Indians
are permitted to purchase out of the taxable lands of the
state in this process of their emancipation and assumption of the responsibility of citizenship, whether restricted
or not, may be said to be instrumentalities in that process." Lands so purchased, however, were held to fall
within that class of "instrumentalities which, though Congress may protect them from state taxation, will nevertheless be subject to that taxation unless Congress
speaks." Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U. S.
575, 580-81.
As a result of the Shaw decision, Congress spoke in the
Act of 1936 and the amendment of 1937, which were intended to protect the Indians in their land purchases
from restricted funds and to keep faith with them because
of the implied or express representations that those lands

than a restricted fee. The power of Congress over both types of
allotments, however, is the same. See United States v. Ramsey, 271

were tax exempt.2" The clear implication of the Shaw
case is that those Acts are valid exercises of Congressional
power, and we so hold. They are appropriate means by
which the federal government protects its guardianship
and prevents the impairment of a considered program
undertaken in discharge of the obligations of that guardianship. The fact that the Acts withdraw lands from
the tax rolls and may possibly embarrass the finances of
a state or one of its subdivisions is for the consideration
of Congress, not the courts. Cf. Federal Land Bank v.
Bismarck Co., 314 U. S. 95, 104. Also, it is immaterial
that respondents are citizens, because it is settled that the

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE:

I concur in the result and also in the opinion except as it
relates to the taxes for 1938 and thereafter, levied and
collected under the 1937 Act. I agree that the exemption extended for these years to Wosey John Deere's grantees, but for different reasons and with the limitation,
which I think should be stated, that under presently effective legislation the exemption extends only to 1956.
As I understand the ruling, the opinion grounds the
exemption for grantees squarely on the 1937 Act, without
reference to whether they were also exempt under the
1936 Act, a question not decided. With that I cannot
agree. The later statute amended the earlier one. Both
its terms and its legislative history' show it had only one
purpose. That was to cut down the amount of land exempted. "All homesteads" took the place of "all lands."
There were other changes in language, but they were matters of style, not of substance. There is not a word in the
Act of 1937 itself, or in the Committee reports to Congress, to show that any other change was in mind. I find,

therefore, no evidence of purpose to enlarge the protected
class at the same time the amount of land exempted was
being reduced. Nor is mere absence of language expressly
limiting the exemption to a class defined in the Act a sufficient basis for implying an intent to enlarge the protected class. Nullifying the power of a state to tax land
within its borders held by or for private individuals is
too important and delicate a matter to hang on such an
implication. In my opinion, therefore, the sole purpose
and effect of the 1937 Act was to reduce the quantity of
land for which exemption could be claimed. Consequently, if grantees were within the benefit, it was because
they were so by virtue of the 1936 Act.
A literal reading of that Act possibly would lead to the
conclusion that grantees were excluded and the protection
was personal to the Indian with whose funds the lands
were purchased. But the language is not absolutely conclusive to this effect, and, in my opinion, the legislative
history 2 shows that the purpose again was not to enlarge
or restrict the classes to which the benefit applied, but
rather was to bring within the scope of preexisting exemptions lands not covered by them. Any other view would
create as to the lands covered by the 1936 Act, which were
acquired with restricted funds, a different and a preferred
exemption as compared with that applicable to originally
allotted lands, from the sale of which in large part the
funds were derived. No intent can be imputed to Congress to give the substituted lands preferential treatment
as compared with original allotments. The language
does not require this, and nothing in the legislative history gives a basis for believing it was intended. There
is no sufficient reason in either for thinking that Congress

intended to create new classes of beneficiaries or new kinds
of exemptions, whether in duration or otherwi'se. There
was a preexisting and defined general policy in both respects, no problem of either sort was presented by the
situation the Act was intended to cure, and the sole purpose, in my opinion, was to make sure the preexisting exemptions would extend to the lands specified in the Act.
Accordingly, whether grantees were exempted and, if so,
for how long is to be determined not by implication or construction from the terms of the 1936 Act alone, but by
reference to the law as it existed in respect of grantees of
original allottees prior to 1936.
/ There is no need to go back of 1928, except to say that,
for our purposes, the effect of prior legislation was that
grantees of original allottees were not within the existing
tax exemptions,' which were, for the most part, to expire
at the latest in 1931.' In some instances, restrictions extended to lands held by heirs of allottees, but for the limited period.' In 1928, Congress extended existing restrictions on some lands-both allotted and inherited-to 1956,
but at the same time removed existing restrictions on
others. 45 Stat. 495. The existing tax exemption was
cut down in scope to one hundred sixty acres of each Indian's holding, but was also extended more clearly to cover
the land in the hands of "any full blood Indian heir or
devisee," though not beyond 1956. 45 Stat. 495, as
amended by 45 Stat. 733-4.
In 1933, probably by reason of the discovery of oil on
Indian lands, consequent sale or lease of original allotments under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior,

and numerous suits by Indians claiming the proceeds free
from his restrictive power, Congress enacted another
statute, 47 Stat. 777, which made all Indian funds then in
or later coming to the Secretary's hands restricted. It
contained the following proviso, which is the last word, for
our purposes, on exemption of Five Civilized Tribe Indian
lands prior to 1936:
"Provided,That where the entire interest in any tract of
restricted and tax-exempt land belonging to members of
the Five Civilized Tribes is acquired by inheritance, devise, gift, or purchase, with restricted funds, by or for restricted Indians, such land shall remain restricted and taxexempt during the life of and as long as held by such restricted Indians, but not longer than April 26, 1956 ...
Provided further, That such restricted and tax-exempt
land held by anyone, acquired as herein provided, shall
not exceed one hundred and sixty acres."
In a number of respects, the meaning of the provision is
unclear. But, without attempt to clarify them, the general purpose seems to have been to exempt lands belonging to members of the Five Civilized Tribes during their
lives, but not beyond 1956 and not exceeding 160 acres, if
"acquired by inheritance, devise, gift, or purchase, with
restricted funds, by or for such restricted Indians." The
proviso is awkwardly drawn, and some of the language
could be taken to limit the exemption to the Indian with
whose restricted funds the lands are acquired. But other
language contradicts this and the legislative history shows
it was contemplated the exemption would extend to heirs,
devisees, donees and purchasers with restricted funds.' In
short, as to the lands covered, Indian heirs, devisees, donees and grantees were within the protection. That the
proviso covers directly the lands in question in the hands

of Wosey John Deere's grantees may be doubted." But,
whether or not the statute applies specifically to this case,
it shows the latest phase of Congressional policy, prior to
1936, as to the kind of exemption given to members of
the Creek Nation and the persons entitled to its benefit.
In this background, the 1936 Act was adopted. In my
opinion, it incorporated the previously existing exemption, as it related to duration and grantees, but extended
it to "all lands" rather than merely the homestead. The
1937 Act returned to the homestead limit, but without
change in other respects. In my view, therefore, and for
these reasons, the grantees of Wosey John Deere were entitled to the benefit of the exemption, but, unless it is extended further by Congress, only to 1956.
MR.

JUSTICE ROBERTS

joins in this opinion.

They are homestead lands. They were bought with her restricted
funds. She, if anyone, was a "restricted Indian," though that term
is new in this Act and unclear. She acquired the lands by purchase. Her children took them by deed, whether by gift or by
"purchase" is not material. They, too, were "restricted Indians," if
she was. At any rate, they were full blood. All these things would
fit the statute to the present case. On the other hand, the tax exemption in the proviso apparently extends only to newly acquired lands
which prior to their acquisition were tax exempt and restricted. See
75 Cong. Rec. 8170. Nothing in the record indicates that the lands
here involved were either tax exempt or restricted when Wosey John
Deere purchased them. However, the precise significance of the apparent requirement that the lands shall have been tax exempt before

they were acquired is obscured by the context of the proviso in a
statute addressed primarily to the problem of restricting funds (in the
hands of the Secretary) obtained largely from the sale of interests
in restricted lands.
