proof made at the trial. There is no reason to believe,
therefore, that confessions which came before the jury as
an organic tissue of proof can be severed and given distributive significance by holding that they had a major
share in the conviction of some of the petitioners and
none at all as to the others. Since it was error to admit
these confessions, we see no escape from the conclusion
that the convictions of all the petitioners must be set

MARICOPA COUNTY ET AL. v. VALLEY NATIONAL
BANK OF PHOENIX.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 449.

Argued February 2, 1943.-Decided March 1, 1943.

1. Under the Constitution, Congress has exclusive authority to determine whether and to what extent its instrumentalities, such as the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation, shall be immune from state
taxation. P. 361.
2. The Act of March 20, 1936, provided that shares of preferred stock
of national banks "heretofore or hereafter acquired by" the Recunstruction Finance Corporation "shall not, so long as Reconstruction
Finance Corporation shall continue to own the same, be subject to
any taxation . . . by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, whether now, heretofore, or hereafter imposed, levied,
or assessed, and whether for a past, present, or future taxing period."
Held:
(1) In withdrawing pro tanto the consent which by R. S. § 5219 it
had previously given to state taxation of shares of stock of national
banks, Congress did not invade powers reserved to the States by the
Tenth Amendment. P. 361.

(2) As applied to taxes in respect of which liens had attached
prior to its passage, the Act operates as a withdrawal of the consent
of the United States to be sued. P. 362.
A proceeding against property in which the United States has
an interest is a suit against the United States.
(3) The prior grant of the privilege to tax the shares was analogous to a gratuity or bounty, and the withdrawal of the privilege
invaded no rights protected by the Fifth Amendment. P. 362.

trict and municipal taxes for the years 1935 and 1936 and
invoked the jurisdiction of the United States District
Court for the District of Arizona under § 24 (1) (a) of
the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 41 (1) (a).
Respondent has two classes of shares of capital stock
outstanding-common and preferred. Prior to March 9,
1933, national banks were not authorized to issue preferred shares. On that day they were given such authority and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was
authorized to subscribe for such shares. Act of March 9,
1933, 48 Stat. 1, Title III, as amended by § 2 of the Act of
March 24, 1933, 48 Stat. 20, 12 U. S. C. § 51a, § 51d. On
February 11, 1935; respondent issued to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation some 198,400 shares of its preferred stock with a par value of $1,240,000. By § 5219 of
the Revised Statutes, 12 U. S. C. § 548, Congress consented on certain conditions to state taxation of shares
of stock of national banking associations. Arizona taxes
shares of stock of banking corporations. The tax is paid
in the first instance by the bank which is entitled to reimbursement from the shareholder on whom the tax liability ultimately rests. Ariz. Code (1939) § 73-204,
§ 73-205. The Arizona statutes also provide that a lien
for all taxes levied shall attach as of the first Monday in
January of each year on the property assessed. § 73-506.
Assessments of personal property are made by the county
assessor between the first Monday in January and the
first day in May of each year. § 73-402. State and local
taxes levied on the basis of this assessment are collected
by the county treasurer as ex officio tax collector.
§ 73-605, § 73-702. Petitioners' assessments for 1935 included respondent's preferred shares owned and held by
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. On the basis
of those assessments, taxes were levied in 1935 against respondent which thereupon filed its bill of complaint in
the federal District Court. While the cause was pend513236-43-vol. 818-27

ing this Court decided Baltimore National Bank v. State
Tax Comm'n, 297 U. S. 209, which held that preferred
shares of a national bank held by the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation were subject to state taxation by
reason of the consent given by Congress in § 5219 of the
Revised Statutes. That decision was rendered on February 3, 1936. On March 20, 1936, Congress enacted a
statute providing that shares of preferred stock of national banks "heretofore or hereafter acquired by" the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation "shall not, so long
as Reconstruction Finance Corporation shall continue to
own the same, be subject to any taxation by the United
States, by any Territory, dependency, or possession
thereof, or the District of Columbia, or by any State,
county, municipality, or local taxing authority, whether
now, heretofore, or hereafter imposed, levied, or assessed,
and whether for a past, present, or future taxing period."
49 Stat. 1185, 12 U. S. C. § 51d. On the authority of that
Act, the District Court, after finding that respondent's
remedy at law was inadequate, issued a permanent injunction against the collection by petitioners of that portion of the 1935 taxes levied on respondent's preferred
stock owned by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
A permanent injunction was also issued in a like cause of
action based on taxes for the year 1936 which were levied
after March 20, 1936. The judgments in the two suits
were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 130 F.
2d 356. The case is here on a petition for writ of certiorari which we granted because of the public importance
of the questions raised. Pursuant to the Act of August
24, 1937, 50 Stat. 751, 28 U. S. C. § 401, the case was
certified to the Attorney General as involving the constitutionality of the Act of March 20, 1936. In response to
that certification the United States submitted a brief as
amicus curiae.

MARICOPA COUNTY v. VALLEY BANK. 361
357

Opinion of the Court.

Petitioners contend that the Act of March 20, 1936,
violates the Fifth and the Tenth Amendments. They
further argue that the word "person" as used in the Fifth
Amendment includes counties and states; and that they
may raise the Tenth Amendment issue since they are
asserting the authority of the state of Arizona in assessing
and in attempting to collect the taxes in question. We
need not decide the last two questions. For even if we
assume, arguendo, that petitioners are right in those contentions, we are of the view that the judgment below
must be affirmed.
Little need be said in answer to the argument that the
Act violates the Tenth Amendment. The authority by
which the taxes in question were levied did not stem from
the powers "reserved to the States" under the Tenth
Amendment. It was conferred by Congress which has
under the Constitution exclusive authority to determine
whether and to what extent its instrumentalities, such as
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, shall be immune
from state taxation. Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust
Co., 255 U. S. 180, 211-213; Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, 261 U. S. 374; Pittman v. Home Owners' Loan Corp.,
308 U. S. 21, 33; Federal Land Bank v. Bismarck Lumber
Co., 314 U. S. 95. Hence when Congress withdrew the
privilege which it had previously granted, it was not curtailing any political power which the Constitution had
reserved to Arizona. See Owensboro National Bank v.
Owensboro, 173 U. S. 664; Des Moines National Bank v.
Fairweather,263 U. S. 103, 106, and cases cited.
The argument that the Act of March 20, 1936, violates
the Fifth Amendment is based on its retrospective feature.
Petitioners contend that since the liens of the taxes were
impressed before the effective date of the Act, they were
property rights which Congress could not destroy. We
need not consider the case where prior to the withdrawal

of the privilege the tax had been collected or the tax lien
foreclosed and the property reduced to the possession of
the taxing authority. In the instant case the state taxing
authorities are asserting rights which if recognized can
be enforced by the maintenance of a suit to establish and
foreclose a lien on property of a federal instrumentality,
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Cf. New York
v. Maclay, 288 U. S. 290. But even a "proceeding against
property in which the United States has an interest is a
suit against the United States." United States v. Alabama, 313 U. S. 274, 282. No such suit may be maintained without the consent of the United States. Such
consent, though previously granted, has now been withdrawn. And the power to withdraw the privilege of suing
the United States or its instrumentalities knows no limitations. Lynch v. UnitedStates, 292 U. S. 571, 581-582, and
cases cited. Nor did the prior grant of the privilege to
tax the shares rise to a higher level than a gratuity or
bounty. Nothing was given in exchange. Cf. Christ
Church v. Philadelphia Co., 24 How. 300, 302. When
Congress authorized the states to impose such taxation,
it did no more than gratuitously grant them political
power which they theretofore lacked. Its sovereign power
to revoke the grant remained unimpaired, the grant of
the privilege being only a declaration of legislative policy
changeable at will. Cf. Dodge v. Board of Education,302
U. S. 74. Hence, as in the case of the recall of other
gratuities (Frisbie v. United States, 157 U. S. 160, 166;
Cummings v. Deutsche Bank, 300 U. S. 115, 122-124), the
withdrawal of this privilege invaded no rights protected
by the Fifth Amendment.
Affirmed.
