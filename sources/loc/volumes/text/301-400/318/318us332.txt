McNABB ET AL. V. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 25. Argued October 22, 1942.-Decided March 1, 1943.
1. The power of this Court upon review of convictions in the federal
courts is not limited to the determination of the Constitutional
validity of such convictions. P. 340.
2. Judicial supervision of the administration of criminal justice in the
federal courts implies the duty of establishing and maintaining
civilized standards of procedure and evidence. P. 340.
3. The principles governing the admissibility of evidence in criminal
cases in the federal courts are not restricted to those derived solely
from the Constitution. P. 341.
4. In the exercise of its authority over the administration of criminal
justice in the federal courts, this Court, from its beginning, has
formulated applicable rules of evidence; and has been guided therein
by considerations of justice not limited to strict canons of evidentiary
relevance. P. 341.
5. The circumstances (detailed in the opinion) under which federal
officers obtained incriminating statements from the defendants in
this case, together with the flagrant disregard of Acts of Congress
requiring that accused persons arrested by federal officers be taken
before a United States Commissioner or other judicial officer, rendered the evidence thus obtained inadmissible in a criminal prosecution in a federal court, and convictions resting upon such evidence
must be set aside. P. 341.
6. Although Congress has not explicitly forbidden the use of evidence
so procured, yet to permit such evidence to be made the basis of a
conviction in the federal courts would stultify the policy which Congress has enacted into law. P. 345.

Assistant Attorney General Berge, with whom Solicitor
GeneralFahy and Messrs. Oscar A. Provost and Archibald
Cox, and Miss Melva M. Graney were on the brief, for the
United States.
MR. JUSTIcE FRANKFURTER delivered, the opinion of the

Court.
The petitioners are under sentence of imprisonment
for forty-five years for the murder of an officer of the
Alcohol Tax Unit of the Bureau of Internal Revenue engaged in the performance of his official duties. (18 U. S.
C. ยง 253.) They were convicted of second-degree murder
in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, and on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit the convictions were sustained. 123 F. 2d
848. We brought the case here because the petition for
certiorari presented serious questions in the administration of federal criminal justice. 316 U. S. 658. Determination of these questions turns upon the circumstances
relating to the admission in evidence of incriminating
statements made by the petitioners.
On the afternoon of Wednesday, July 31, 1940, information was received at the Chattanooga office of the Alcoholic
Tax Unit that several members of the McNabb family
were planning to sell that night whiskey on which federal
taxes had not been paid. The McNabbs were a clan of
Tennessee mountaineers living about twelve miles from
Chattanooga in a section known as the McNabb Settlement. Plans were made to apprehend the McNabbs while
actually engaged in their illicit enterprise. That evening
four revenue agents, accompanied by the Government's
informers, drove to the McNabb Settlement. When they
approached the rendezvous arranged between the McNabbs and the informers, the officers got out of the car.
The informers drove on and met five of the McNabbs, of
whom three-the twin brothers Freeman and Raymond,
and their cousin Benjamin-are the petitioners here.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

(The two others, Emuil and Barney McNabb, were acquitted at the direction of the trial court.) The group
proceeded to a spot near the family cemetery where the
liquor was hidden. While cans containing whiskey were
being loaded into the car, one of the informers flashed a
prearranged signal to the officers who thereupon came
running. One of these called out, "All right, boys, federal
officers!", and the McNabbs took flight.
Instead of pursuing the McNabbs, the officers began
to empty the cans. They heard noises coming from the
direction of the cemetery, and after a short while a large
rock landed at their feet. An officer named Leeper ran
into the cemetery. He looked about with his flashlight
but discovered no one. Noticing a couple of whiskey cans
there, he began to pour out their contents. Shortly afterwards the other officers heard a shot; running into the
cemetery they found Leeper on the ground, fatally
wounded. A few minutes later-at about ten o'clockhe died without having identified his assailant. A second
shot slightly wounded another officer. A search of the
cemetery proved futile, and the officers left.
About three or four hours later-between one and two
o'clock Thursday morning-federal officers went to the
home of Freeman, Raymond, and Emuil McNabb and
there placed them under arrest. Freeman and Raymond
were twenty-five years old. Both had lived in the Settlement all their lives; neither had gone beyond the fourth
grade in school; neither had ever been farther from his
home than Jasper, twenty-one miles away. Emuil was
twenty-two years old. He, too, had lived in the Settlement all his life, and had not gone beyond the second
grade.
Immediately upon arrest, Freeman, Raymond, and
Emuil were taken directly to the Federal Building at
Chattanooga. They were not brought.before a United
States commissioner or a judge. Instead, they were
placed in a detention room (where there was nothing they

Opinion of the Court.

could sit or lie down on, except the floor), and kept there
for about fourteen hours, from three o'clock Thursday
morning until five o'clock that afternoon. They were
given some sandwiches. They were not permitted to see
relatives and friends who attempted to visit them. They
had no lawyer. There is no evidence that they requested
the assistance of counsel, or that they were told that they
were entitled to such assistance.
Barney McNabb, who had been arrested early Thursday morning by the local police, was handed over to the
federal authorities about nine or ten o'clock that morning. He was twenty-eight years old; like the other McNabbs he had spent his entire life in the Settlement, had
never gone beyond Jasper, and his schooling stopped at
the third grade. Barney was placed in a separate room
in the Federal Building where he was questioned for a
short period. The officers then took him to the scene of
the killing, brought him back to the Federal Building,
questioned him further for about an hour, and finally removed him to the county jail three blocks away.
In the meantime, direction of the investigation had been
assumed by H. B. Taylor, district supervisor of the Alcohol
Tax Unit, with headquarters at Louisville, Kentucky.
Taylor was the Government's chief witness on the central
issue of the admissibility of the statements made by the
McNabbs. Arriving in Chattanooga early Thursday
/morning, he spent the day in study of the case before
beginning his interrogation of the prisoners. Freeman,
Raymond, and Emuil, who had been taken to the county
jail about five o'clock Thursday afternoon, were brought
back to the Federal Building early that evening. According to Taylor, his questioning of them began at nine
o'clock. Other officers set the hour earlier.1
I Officer Burke testified that the questioning Thursday night began
at 6 P. M., Officer Kitts, at 7 P. M., and Officer Jakes, at "possibly
6 or 7 o'clock."

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S.

Throughout the questioning, most of which was done
by Taylor, at least six officers were present. At no time
during its course was a lawyer or any relative or friend
of the defendants present. Taylor began by telling "each
of them before they were questioned that we were Government officers, what we were investigating, and advised
them that they did not have to make a statement, that
they need not fear force, and that any statement made by
them would be used against them, and that they need not
answer any questions asked unless they desired to do so."
The men were questioned singly and together.
As
described by one of the officers, "They would be brought
in, be questioned possibly at various times, some of them
half an hour, or maybe an hour, or maybe two hours."
Taylor testified that the questioning continued until one
o'clock in the morning, when the defendants were taken
back to the county jail.'
The questioning was resumed Friday morning, probably
sometime between nine and ten o'clock.' "They were
brought down from the jail several times, how many I
don't know. They were questioned one at a time, as
we would finish one he would be sent back and we would
try to reconcile the facts they told, connect up the statements they made, and then we would get two of them
together. I think at one time we probably had all five
together trying to reconcile their statements . . . When

again Taylor's testimony is at variance with that of other
Officer Kitts estimated that the questioning Thursday night

ended at 10 P. M., Officer Burke, at 11 P. M., and Officer Jakes, at
midnight. No officer testified that the questioning that night lasted
less than three hours.
' Taylor testified that the McNabbs were brought back Friday morning "probably about nine or nine-thirty." None of the other officers
could recall the exact time. Officer Burke thought "it must have been
after nine o'clock," while Officer Jakes guessed that it was "somewhere around ten or eleven o'clock in the morning."

McNABB v. UNITED STATES.
332

Opinion of the Court.

I knew the truth I told the defendants what I knew. I
never called them damned liars, but I did say they were
lying to me. . . . It would be impossible to tell all the
motions I made with my hands during the two days of
questioning, however, I didn't threaten anyone. None of
the officers were prejudiced towards these defendants nor
bitter toward them. We were only trying to find out who
killed our fellow officer."
Benjamin McNabb, the third of the petitioners, came
to the office of the Alcohol Tax Unit about eight or nine
o'clock Friday morning and voluntarily surrendered.
Benjamin was twenty years old, had never been arrested
before, had lived in the McNabb Settlement all his life,
and had not got beyond the fourth grade in school. He
told the officers that he had heard that they were looking
for him but that he was entirely innocent of any connection with the crime. The officers made him take his
clothes off for a few minutes because, so he testified, "they
wanted to look at me. This seared me pretty much."'
He was not taken before a United States Commissioner
or a judge. Instead, the officers questioned him for about
five or six hours. When finally in the afternoon he was
confronted with the statement that the others accused
him of having fired both shots, Benjamin said, "If they
are going to accuse me of that, I will tell the whole truth;
you may get your pencil and paper and write it down."
He then confessed that he had fired the first shot, but
denied that he had also fired the second.
Because there were "certain discrepancies in their
stories, and we were anxious to straighten them out," the
4Taylor
testified that the reason for having Benjamin remove his
clothes was that "I was informed that he had gotten an injury running
through the woods or that he had been hit by a stray shot. We didn't
know whether or not this was true, and asked him to take his clothe
off in order to examine him and find out."

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

318 U. S.

defendants were brought to the Federal Building from
the jail between nine and ten o'clock Friday night. They
were again questioned, sometimes separately, sometimes
together. Taylor testified that "tVe had Freeman McNabb on the night of the second [Friday] for about three
and one-half hours. I don't remember the time but I remember him particularly because he certainly was hard to
get anything out of. He would admit he lied before, and
then tell it all over again. I knew some of the things about
the whole truth and it took about three and one-half hours
before he would say it was the truth, and I finally got him
to tell a story which he said was true and which certainly
fit better with the physical facts and circumstances than
any other story he had told. It took me three and onehalf hours to get a story that was satisfactory or that I believed was nearer the truth than when we started."
The questioning of the defendants continued until about
two o'clock Saturday morning, when the officers finally
"got all the discrepancies straightened out." Benjamin
did not change his story that he had fired only the first
shot. Freeman and Raymond admitted that they were
present when the shooting occurred, but denied Benjamin's charge that they had urged him to shoot. Barney
and Emuil, who were acquitted at the direction of the trial
court, made no incriminating admissions.
Concededly, the admissions made by Freeman, Raymond and Benjamin constituted the crux of the Government's case against them, and the convictions cannot
stand if such evidence be excluded. Accordingly, the
question for our decision is whether these incriminating
statements, made under the circumstances we have summarized,5 were properly admitted. Relying upon the

guarantees of the Fifth Amendment that no person "shall
be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law," the petitioners contend that the
Constitution itself forbade the use of this evidence against
them. The Government counters by urging that the
Constitution proscribes only "involuntary" confessions,
and that judged by appropriate criteria of "voluntariness"
the petitioners' admissions were voluntary and hence
admissible.
It is true, as the petitioners assert, that a conviction in
the federal courts, the foundation of which is evidence obtained in disregard of liberties deemed fundamental by
the Constitution, cannot stand. Boyd v. United States,
116 U. S. 616; Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383;
Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. 298; Amos v. United

the jury. After hearing the evidence (consisting principally of the
testimony of the defendants and the officers), the court concluded
that the statements were admissible. An exception to this ruling was
taken. When the jury was recalled, the witnesses for the Government
repeated their testimony. The defendants rested upon their claim
that the trial court erred in admitting these statements, and stood
on their constitutional right not to take the witness stand before the
jury. At the conclusion of the Government's case the defendants
moved to exclude from the consideration of the jury the evidence relating to the admissions made by them. This motion was denied. The
motion was renewed at the conclusion of the defendants' case, and
again was denied. The court charged the jury that the defendants'
admissions should be disregarded if found to have been involuntarily
made. The issue of law which was decided by the trial court in admitting the statements made by the petitioners did not become,
therefore, a question of fact foreclosed by the jury's general verdict
of guilty. Under these circumstances we have treated as facts only
the testimony offered on behalf of the Government and so much of
the petitioners' evidence as is neither contradicted by nor inconsistent
with that of the Government.

States, 287 U. S. 124. And this Court has, on Constitutional grounds, set aside convictions, both in the federal
and state courts, which were based upon confessions "secured by protracted and repeated questioning of ignorant
and untutored persons, in whose minds the power of officers was greatly magnified," Lisenba v. California, 314
U. S. 219, 239-40, or "who have been unlawfully held incommunicado without advice of friends or counsel,"
Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547, 555, and see Brown v. Mississippi,297 U. S. 278; Chambersv. Florida,309 U. S. 227;

U. S. 530; Lomax v. Texas, 313 U. S. 544; Vernon v. Alabama, 313 U. S. 547.
In the view we take of the case, however, it becomes
unnecessary to reach the Constitutional issue pressed
upon us. For, while the power of this Court to undo convictions in state courts is limited to the enforcement of
those "fundamental principles of liberty and justice,"
Hebert v. Louisiana,272 U. S. 312, 316, which are secured
by the Fourteenth Amendment, the scope of our reviewing power over convictions brought here from the federal
courts is not confined to ascertainment of Constitutional
validity. Judicial supervision of the administration of
criminal justice in the federal courts implies the duty of
establishing and maintaining civilized standards of procedure and evidence. Such standards are not satisfied
merely by observance of those minimal historic safeguards
for securing trial by reason which are summarized as "due
process of law" and below which we reach what is really
trial by force. Moreover, review by this Court of state
action expressing its notion of what will best further its
own security in the administration of criminal justice
demands appropriate respect for the deliberative judgment of a state in so basic an exercise of its jurisdiction.
Considerations of large policy in making the necessary
accommodations in our federal system are wholly irrele-

vant to the formulation and application of proper standards for the enforcement of the federal criminal law in
the federal courts.
The principles governing the admissibility of evidence
in federal criminal trials have not been restricted, therefore, to those derived solely from the Constitution. In
the exercise of its supervisory authority over the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts, see
Nardone v. United States, 308 U. S. 338, 341-42, this
Court has, from the very beginning of its history, formulated rules of evidence to be applied in federal criminal
prosecutions. E. g., Ex parte Bollman & Swartwout, 4
Cranch 75, 130-31; United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat.
610, 643-44; United States v. Furlong, 5 Wheat. 184, 199;
United States v. Gooding, 12 Wheat. 460, 468-70; United
States v. Wood, 14 Pet. 430; United States v. Murphy,
16 Pet. 203; Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371; Wolfle
v. United States, 291 U. S. 7; see 1 Wigmore on Evidence
(3d ed. 1940) pp. 170-97; Note, 47 Harv. L. Rev. 853.
And in formulating such rules of evidence for federal
criminal trials the Court has been guided by considerations of justice not limited to the strict canons of evidentiary relevance.
Quite apart from the Constitution, therefore, we are
constrained to hold that the evidence elicited from the
petitioners in the circumstances disclosed here must be
excluded. For in their treatment of the petitioners the
arresting officers assumed functions which Congress has

"The rules of evidence on which we practise today have mostly grown
up at the hands of the judges; and, except as they may be really
something more than rules of evidence, they may, in the main, properly enough be left to them to be modified and reshaped." J. B.

explicitly denied them. They subjected the accused to
the pressures of a procedure which is wholly incompatible
with the vital but very restricted duties of the investigating and arresting officers of the Government and which
tends to undermine the integrity of the criminal proceeding. Congress has explicitly commanded that "It
shall be the duty of the marshal, his deputy, or other
officer, who may arrest a person charged with any crime
or offense, to take the defendant before the nearest United
States commissioner or the nearest judicial officer having
jurisdiction under existing laws for a hearing, commitment, or taking bail for trial . . ." 18 U. S. C. ยง 595.
Similarly, the Act of June 18, 1934, c. 595, 48 Stat. 1008,
5 U. S. C. ยง 300a, authorizing officers of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation to make arrests, requires that "the person
arrested shall be immediately taken before a committing
officer." Compare also the Act of March 1, 1879, c. 125,

when arrests are made of persons in the act of operating an
illicit distillery, the arrested persons shall be taken forthwith before some judicial officer residing in the county
where the arrests were made, or if none, in the county
nearest to the place of arrest. Similar legislation, requiring that arrested persons be promptly taken before
a committing authority, appears on the statute books of
nearly all the states.

Opinion of the Court.

The purpose of this impressively pervasive requirement
of criminal procedure is plain. A democratic society, in
which respect for the dignity of all men is central, naturally guards against the misuse of the law enforcement
process. Zeal in tracking down crime is not in itself an
assurance of soberness of judgment. Disinterestedness in
law enforcement does not alone prevent disregard of cherished liberties. Experience has therefore counseled that
safeguards must be provided against the dangers of the
overzealous as well as the despotic. The awful instruments of the criminal law cannot be entrusted to a single
functionary. The complicated process of criminal justice
is therefore divided into different parts, responsibility for
which is separately vested in the various participants upon
whom the criminal law relies for its vindication. Legisla1935, ยง 62-610; Kentucky-Code, 1938, ยงยง 45-46; Louisiana--Code of

tion such as this, requiring that the police must with
reasonable promptness show legal cause for detaining
arrested persons, constitutes an important safeguardnot only in assuring protection for the innocent but also in
securing conviction of the guilty by methods that commend themselves to a progressive and self-confident society. For this procedural requirement checks resort to
those reprehensible practices known as the "third degree"
which, though universally rejected as indefensible, still
find their way into use. It aims to avoid all the evil implications of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime.
It reflects not a sentimental but a sturdy view of law enforcement. It outlaws easy but self-defeating ways in
which brutality is substituted for brains as an instrument
of crime detection. 8 A statute carrying such purposes is
expressive of a general legislative policy to which courts
should not be heedless when appropriate situations call
for its application.
The circumstances in which the statements admitted
in evidence against the petitioners were secured reveal a
plain disregard of the duty enjoined by Congress upon federal law officers. Freeman and Raymond McNabb were
arrested in the middle of the night at their home. Instead of being brought before a United States commissioner or a judicial officer, as the law requires, in order to
determine the sufficiency of the justification for their de8 "During the discussions which took place on the Indian Code of
Criminal Procedure in 1872 some observations were made on the

reasons which occasionally lead native police officers to apply torture
to prisoners. An experienced civil officer observed, 'There is a great
deal of laziness in it. It is far pleasanter to sit comfortably in the
shade rubbing red pepper into a poor devil's eyes than to go about
in the sun hunting up evidence.' This was a new view to me, but I
have no doubt of its truth." Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, A History
of the Criminal Law of England (1883), vol. 1, p. 442 note. Compare

tention, they were put in a barren cell and kept there for
fourteen hours. For two days they were subjected to unremitting questioning by numerous officers. Benjamin's
confession was secured by detaining him unlawfully and
questioning him continuously for five or six hours. The
McNabbs had to submit to all this without the aid of
friends or the benefit of counsel. The record leaves no
room for doubt that the questioning of the petitioners
took place while they were in the custody of the arresting
officers and before any order of commitment was made.
Plainly, a conviction resting on evidence secured through
such a flagrant disregard of the procedure which Congress
has commanded cannot be allowed to stand without making the courts themselves accomplices in willful disobedience of law. Congress has not explicitly forbidden the
use of evidence so procured. But to permit such evidence
to be made the basis of a conviction in the federal courts
would stultify the policy which Congress has enacted into
law.
Unlike England, where the Judges of the King's Bench

1In 1912 the Judges of the King's Bench, at the request of the Home
Secretary, issued rules for the guidance of police officers. See Rex v.
Voisin, L. R. [1918] 1 K. B. 531, 539. These rules were amended in
1918, and in 1930 a circular was issued by the Home Office, with the
approval of the Judges, in order to clear up difficulties in their construction. 6 Police Journal (1933) 352-56, containing the texts of
the Judge's Rules and the Circular. See Report of the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Procedure (1929) Cmd. 3297. Although
the Rules do not have the force of law, Rex v. Voisin, supra, the English courts insist that they be strictly observed before admitting
statements made by accused persons while in the custody of the police.

provisions of law governing federal law enforcement officers in procuring evidence from persons held in custody.
But the absence of specific restraints going beyond the
legislation to which we have referred does not imply that
the circumstances under which evidence was secured are
irrelevant in ascertaining its admissibility. The mere fact
that a confession was made while in the custody of the
police does not render it inadmissible. Compare Hopt v.
Utah, 110 U. S. 574; Sparf v. United States, 156 U. S. 51,
55; United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U. S.
149, 157; Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14. But
where in the course of a criminal trial in the federal courts
it appears that evidence has been obtained in such violation of legal rights as this case discloses, it is the duty
of the trial court to entertain a motion for the exclusion
of such evidence and to hold a hearing, as was done here,
to determine whether such motion should be granted or
denied. Cf. Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S.298, 31213; Amos v. United States, 255 U. S. 313; Nardone v.
United States, 308 U. S. 338, 341-42. The interruption of
the trial for this purpose should be no longer than is
required for a competent determination of the substantiality of the motion. As was observed in the Nardone
case, supra, "The civilized conduct of criminal trials cannot be confined within mechanical rules. It necessarily
demands the authority of limited direction entrusted to
the judge presiding in federal trials, including a wellestablished range of judicial discretion, subject to appropriate review on appeal, in ruling upon preliminary questions of fact. Such a system as ours must, within the

Regard to the Interrogation by the Police of Miss Savidge (1928),

fairness and courage of federal trial judges." 308 U. S. at

In holding that the petitioners' admissions were improperly received in evidence against them, and that having been based on this evidence their convictions cannot
stand, we confine ourselves to our limited function as the
court of ultimate review of the standards formulated and
applied by federal courts in the trial of criminal cases. We
are not concerned with law enforcement practices except
in so far as courts themselves become instruments of law
enforcement. We hold only that a decent regard for the
duty of courts as agencies of justice and custodians of
liberty forbids that men should be convicted upon evidence secured under the circumstances revealed here. In
so doing, we respect the policy which underlies Congressional legislation. The history of liberty has largely been
the history of observance of procedural safeguards. And
the effective administration of criminal justice hardly requires disregard of fair procedures imposed by law.

MR. JUSTICE REED,

dissenting:

I find myself unable to agree with the opinion of the
Court in this case. An officer of the United States was
killed while in the performance of his duties. From the
circumstances detailed in the Court's opinion, there was
obvious reason to suspect that the petitioners here were
implicated in firing the fatal shot from the dark. The
arrests followed. As the guilty parties were known only
to the McNabbs who took part in the assault at the bury-

ing ground, it was natural and proper that the officers
would question them as to their actions.'
The cases just cited show that statements made while
under interrogation may be used at a trial if it may fairly
be said that the information was given voluntarily. A
frank and free confession of crime by the culprit affords
testimony of the highest credibility and of a character
which may be verified easily. Equally frank responses
to officers by innocent people arrested under misapprehension give the best basis for prompt discharge from
custody. The realization of the convincing quality of a
confession tempts officials to press suspects unduly for
such statements. To guard accused persons against the
danger of being forced to confess, the law admits confessions of guilt only when they are voluntarily made.
While the connotation of voluntary is indefinite, it affords
an understandable label under which can be readily classified the various acts of terrorism, promises, trickery and
threats which have led this and other courts to refuse
admission as evidence to confessions.2 The cases cited
in the Court's opinion show the broad coverage of this
rule of law. Through it those coerced into confession
have found a ready defense from injustice.
Were the Court today saying merely that in its judgment the confessions of the McNabbs were not voluntary,
there would be no occasion for this single protest. A notation of dissent would suffice. The opinion, however,
does more. Involuntary confessions are not constituIHopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 584; Sparf and Hansen v. United
States, 156 U. S. 51, 55; Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355;
Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 623; cf. Bilokumsky v. Tod,
263 U. S. 149, 157.

made freely, voluntarily and without compulsion or inducement of any
sort." Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 623; Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 239.

tionally admissible because violative of the provision of
self-incrimination in the Bill of Rights. Now the Court
leaves undecided whether the present confessions are
voluntary or involuntary and declares that the confessions must be excluded because in addition to questioning
the petitioners, the arresting officers failed promptly to
take them before a committing magistrate. The Court
finds a basis for the declaration of this new rule of evidence in its supervisory authority over the administration of criminal justice. I question whether this offers
to the trial courts and the peace officers a rule of admissibility as clear as the test of the voluntary character of
the confession. I am opposed to broadening the possibilities of defendants escaping punishment by these more
rigorous technical requirements in the administration of
justice. If these confessions are otherwise voluntary, civilized standards, in my opinion, are not advanced by setting aside these judgments because of acts of omission
which are not shown to have tended toward coercing the
admissions.
Our police officers occasionally overstep legal bounds.
This record does not show when the petitioners were taken
before a committing magistrate. No point was made of
the failure to commit by defendant or counsel. No opportunity was given to the officers to explain. Objection
to the introduction of the confessions was made only on
the ground that they were obtained through coercion.
This was determined against the accused both by the
court, when it appraised the fact as to the voluntary character of the confessions preliminarily to determining the
legal question of their admissibility, and by the jury. The
court saw and heard witnesses for the prosecution and the
defense. The defendants did not take the stand before
the jury. The uncontradicted evidence does not require
a different conclusion. The officers of the Alcohol Tax
Unit should not be disciplined by overturning this
conviction.
