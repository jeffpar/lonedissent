Opinion of the Court.

JEROME v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 325. Argued January 7, 1943.-Decided February 1, 1943.
In § 2 (a) of the federal Bank Robbery Act, which provides that "whoever shall enter or attempt to enter any bank, or any building used
in whole or in part as a bank, with intent to commit in such bank
or building, or part thereof, so used, any felony or larceny" shall
be subject to the penalty therein prescribed, the word "felony"
embraces only offenses which are felonies under federal law and
affect banks protected by the Act. P. 108.
130 F. 2d 514, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 317 U. S. 606, to review the affirmance of a
conviction for violation of the federal Bank Robbery Act.

GeneralFahy and Messrs. Robert S. Erdahland Archibald

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Sec. 2 (a) of the Bank Robbery Act (48 Stat. 783, 50 Stat.
749, 12 U. S. C. § 588b) provides in part that "whoever shall
enter or attempt to enter any bank,1 or any building used
in whole or in part as a bank, with intent to commit in
such bank or building, or part thereof, so used, any felony
or larceny, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or impris'The term "bank" is defined in § 1 of the Act (12 U. S. C. § 588a) to
include "any member bank of the Federal Reserve System, and any
bank, banking association, trust company, savings bank, or other banking institution organized or operating under the laws of the United
States and any insured bank as defined in subsection (c) of Section 12B,
of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended."

oned not more than twenty years, or both." Petitioner
was indicted under that section for entering a national
bank in Vermont with intent to utter a forged promissory
note and thereby to defraud the bank. He was convicted
after trial before a jury and was sentenced to imprisonment for one year and a day. The utterance of a forged
promissory note is a felony under the laws of Vermont
(P. L. 1933, § 8485, § 8750) but not under any federal
statute. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction by a divided vote, holding that "felony" as used
in § 2 (a) includes offenses which are felonies under state
law. 130 F. 2d 514. We granted the petition for a writ
of certiorari because of the importance of the problem
in the administration of justice and because of the diversity
of views which have developed as respects the meaning
of "felony" in § 2 (a). Compare with the decision below
Hudspeth v. Melville, 127 F. 2d 373; Hudspeth v. Tornello, 128 F. 2d 172.
Prior to 1934, banks organized or operating under federal
law were protected against embezzlement and like offenses
by R. S. 5209, 40 Stat. 972, 12 U. S. C. § 592. But such
crimes as robbery, burglary, and larceny 2 directed against
such banks were punishable only under state law. By
1934 great concern had been expressed over interstate
operations by gangsters against banks-activities with
which local authorities were frequently unable to cope.
H. Rep. No. 1461, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2. The Attorney
General, in response to that concern, recommended legislation embracing certain new federal offenses. S. 2841,
73d Cong., 2d Sess. And see 78 Cong. Rec. 5738. Sec.
3 of that bill made it a federal crime to break into or attempt to break into such banks with intent to commit "any
offense defined by this Act, or any felony under any law
the extent that acts constituting larceny would not also constitute a federal crime under R. S. 5209. See United States v. Northway, 120 U. S. 327, 335.

of the United States or under any law of the State, District,
Territory, or possession" in which the bank was located.
Sec. 2 made it an offense to take or attempt to take money
or property belonging to or in the possession of such a
bank without its consent or with its consent obtained "by
any trick, artifice, fraud, or false or fraudulent representation." This bill was reported favorably by the Senate
Judiciary Committee (S. Rep. No. 537, 73d Cong., 2d
Sess.) and passed the Senate. 78 Cong. Rec. 5738. The
House Judiciary Committee, however, struck out § 2,
dealing with larceny, and § 3, dealing with burglary.
H.. Rep. No. 1461, supra, p. 1. And the bill was finally
enacted without them. But it retained the robbery provision ' now contained in the first clause of § 2 (a) of the
Bank Robbery Act.
In 1937 the Attorney General recommended the enlargement of the Bank Robbery Act "to include larceny and
burglary of the banks" protected by it. H. Rep. No. 732,
75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1. The fact that the 1934 statute
was limited to robbery was said to have produced "some
incongruous results-a "striking instance" of which was
the case of a man who stole a large sum from a bank but
who was not guilty of robbery because he did not display
force or violence and did not put any one in fear. Id., pp.
1-2. The bill as introduced (H. R. 5900, 75th Cong., 1st
Sess., 81 Cong. Rec. 2731) added to § 2 (a) two new
clauses-one defining larceny and the other making it a
federal offense to enter or attempt to enter any bank with
intent to commit therein "any larceny or other depredation." For reasons not disclosed in the legislative history,
3 "Whoever, by force and violence, or by putting in fear, feloniously

takes, or feloniously attempts to take, from the person or presence of
another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging
to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any
bank shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than
twenty years, or both."

the House Judiciary Committee substituted "any felony
or larceny" for "any larceny or other depredation." H.
Rep. No. 732, supra, p. 2. With that change and with an
amendment to the larceny clause' distinguishing between
grand and petit larceny (81 Cong. Rec. 5376-5377), § 2 (a)
was enacted in its present form.
We disagree with the Circuit Court of Appeals. We
do not think that "felony" as used in § 2 (a) incorporates
state law.
At times it has been inferred from the nature of the
problem with which Congress was dealing that the application of a federal statute should be dependent on state
law. Examples under federal revenue acts are common.
Douglas v. Willcuts, 296 U. S. 1; Helvering v. Stuart, 317
U. S. 154, and cases cited. But we must generally assume,
in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, that
Congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law. That
assumption is based on the fact that the application of
federal legislation is nationwide (United States v. Pelzer,
312 U. S. 399, 402) and at times on the fact that the federal program would be impaired if state law were to
control. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, 233 U. S. 492,
503. When it comes to federal criminal laws such as the
present one, there is a consideration in addition to the
desirability of uniformity in application which supports
the general principle. Since there is no common law offense against the United States (United States v. Hudson,
4". . .whoever shall take and carry away, with intent to steal or
purloin, any property or money or any other thing of value exceeding
$50 belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or
possession of any bank, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; or whoever shall take and
carry away, with intent to steal or purloin, any property or money or
any other thing of value not exceeding $50 belonging to, or in the care,
custody, control, management, or possession of any bank, shall be fined
not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both."

JEROME v. UNITED STATES.
101

Opinion of the Court.

7 Cranch 32; United States v. Gradwell, 243 U. S. 476,
485), the administration of criminal justice under our
federal system has rested with the states, except as criminal offenses have been explicitly prescribed by Congress.
We should be mindful of that tradition in determining
the scope of federal statutes defining offenses which duplicate or build upon state law. In that connection it should
be noted that the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth
Amendment does not stand as a bar to federal prosecution
though a state conviction based on the same acts has
already been obtained. See United States v. Lanza, 260
U. S. 377; Hebert v. Louisiana,272 U. S. 312. That consideration gives additional weight to the view that where
Congress is creating offenses which duplicate or build upon
state law, courts should be reluctant to expand the defined offenses beyond the clear requirements of the terms
of the statute.
There is no plain indication in the legislative history
of § 2 (a) that Congress used "felony" in a sense sufficiently broad to include state offenses. Though the legislative data are meager, the indications are to the contrary. In the first place, the 1934 bill expressly provided,
as we have noted, that state felonies were included in the
definition of the new federal offense of burglary. That
provision was stricken in the House. The 1934 bill also
defined larceny to include larceny by trick or fraud. That
provision was likewise eliminated in the House. The
1934 Act was passed without either of them. The 1937
bill did not renew the earlier proposals to include them
but substituted "any larceny or other depredation." Larceny, like robbery, is defined in § 2 (a). And "depredation" is not devoid of meaning in such a setting (cf. Deal
v. United States, 274 U. S. 277, 283) apart from any special significance which it may have in local law. It is
difficult to conclude in the face of this history that Congress, having rejected in 1934 an express provision making

318 U. S.

state felonies federal offenses, reversed itself in 1937, and,
through the phrase "any felony or larceny," adopted the
penal provisions of forty-eight states with respect to acts
committed in national or insured banks. It is likewise
difficult to believe that Congress, through the same clause,
adopted by indirection in 1937 much of the fraud provision which it rejected in 1934. Cf. UnitedStates v. Patton,
120 F. 2d 73.
In the second place, Congress defined in §2 (a) robbery,
burglary, and larceny but not felony. We can hardly believe that, having defined three federal offenses, it went
on in the same section to import by implication a miscellaneous group of state crimes as the definition of the fourth
federal offense. In this connection it should be noted that
when Congress has desired to incorporate state laws in
other federal penal statutes, it has done so by specific reference or adoption.' The omission of any such provision
in this Act is a strong indication that it had no such purpose here. Cf. UnitedStates v. Coppersmith,4 F. 198, 207.
The Act extends protection to hundreds of banks located
in every state. If state laws are incorporated in § 2 (a),
Congress has gone far toward putting these banks on a
basis somewhat equivalent to "lands reserved or acquired
for the use of the United States" as described in § 272 of
the Criminal Code, 18 U. S. C. § 451. In such a case all
violations of penal laws of the state within which the
lands are located become federal offenses. Criminal Code
§ 289, 18 U. S. C. § 468. Such an expansion of federal
criminal jurisdiction should hardly be left to implication
and conjecture.
Moreover, the difficulty of giving "felony" in § 2 (a) a
state law meaning is emphasized when we turn to the law
1See e. g., Act of March 4,1909,35 Stat. 1137, 49 Stat. 380, 18 U. S. C.
§ 392; Act of May 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 782, 18 U. S. C. § 408e; Act
of June 11, 1932, 47 Stat. 301, 18 U. S. C. § 662a; Act of February 22,
1935, 49 Stat. 31, 15 U. S. C. § 715b; Act of June 25, 1936, 49 Stat.
1928, 27 U. S. C. § 223.

of such a state as New Jersey. There we find crimes classified as "misdemeanors" and "high misdemeanors." Rev.
Stat. (1937) § 2:103-5, § 2:103-6. See United States v.
Slutzky, 79 F. 2d 504, 505. Uttering a promissory note
with a forged endorsement is a "high misdemeanor." Rev.
Stat. (1937) § 2:132-lb. The inference is strong that if
Congress had designed § 2 (a) to include the more serious
state offenses committed in or against national or insured
banks or only such state offenses as affected those banks
(Hudspeth v. Melville, supra, p. 376), it would have used
language which would have afforded that protection in
all the states.
Finally, the inclusion of state crimes in the word "felony" neither comports with the scheme of the Act nor is
necessary to give the Act meaning and vitality. As we
have noted, the purpose of the 1934 Act was to supplement
local law enforcement in certain respects. And the 1937
amendments were designed "to include larceny and burglary of the banks protected by this statute." H. Rep. No.
732, supra, p. 1. But there is not the slightest indication
that the interstate activities of gangsters against national
and insured banks had broken down or rendered ineffective enforcement of state laws covering all sorts of felonies.
On the contrary, the bill introduced in 1937 was much
more selective and revealed no purpose to make a comprehensive classification of all crimes against the banks.
Moreover, the run of state felonies-forgery, rape, adultery, and the like-would seem to have little or no relevancy to the need for protection of banks against the
wholesale activities of the gangsters of that day. A related
objection could of course be made if "felony" as used in
§ 2 (a) were taken to mean any federal felony so as to
bring within the scope of the Bank Robbery Act miscellaneous federal felonies ranging from the sale of narcotics

to white slave traffic.6 But as indicated by Judge Frank in

his dissenting opinion below, § 2 (a) is not deprived of
vitality if it is interpreted to exclude state felonies and to
include only those federal felonies which affect the banks'
protected by the Act. That is in our opinion the correct

construction.
Reversed.

6It has frequently been held that when a federal statute uses a term
which it does not define but which was a common law offense, it will
be given its common law meaning. United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat.
610, 630; United States v. Smith, 5 Wheat. 153, 160; Harrisonv. United
States, 163 U. S. 140, 142. In this case, however, Congress has not
punished an offense by its common law name. Moreover, at common
law murder, manslaughter, arson, burglary, robbery, rape, sodomy, mayhem, and larceny were felonies. Wharton, Criminal Law (12th ed.)
§ 26. And see Bannon v. United States, 156 U. S. 464, 467. Since
those miscellaneous crimes as a group do not suggest on their face
that they constitute an appropriate base on which to build a federal
criminal code for protection of national and insured banks, we will not
readily infer that Congress used the word "felony" in its common law
meaning. That conclusion is fortified by the further circumstance
that Congress has defined numerous offenses in other federal penal
statutes and has classified such offenses as felonies or misdemeanors according to the severity of the punishmeint. Criminal Code § 335, 18
U. S. C. § 541. Hence we need not look elsewhere for the meaning
of the term. Cf. Reagan v. United States, 157 U. S. 301, 303. As
stated in Adams v. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, nt. 2, the term "felony"
is a "verbal survival which has been emptied of its historic content."
Thus we conclude that the word "felony" as used in § 2 (a) takes its
meaning from federal statutes rather than from the common law.
Forgery at common law was a misdemeanor. Wharton, supra, § 861.
7One such instance would be violation of the National Stolen Property Act, 48 Stat. 794, 53 Stat. 1178, 18 U. S. C. § 413, especially 18
U. S. C. § 416.
