That the reciprocals save for their members from 25 to 50
per cent of the cost of ordinary commercial insurance and
that the members are well satisfied with the system they
have created is not controverted by counsel for the state
of New York. However persuasive such arguments might
be if addressed to the state legislature, they present no
constitutional barrier which prevents New York from

HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. AMERICAN DENTAL CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 303.

Argued January 5, 6, 1943.-Decided March 1, 1943.

1. The finding of the Board of Tax Appeals that the cancellation of
indebtedness in question occurred in 1937 is accepted here. P. 324.
2. The term "gift" in § 22 (b) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1936 denotes
the receipt of financial advantages gratuitously. P. 330.

3. A cancellation of items of indebtedness owed by a corporation (rent
and interest on notes), though the items had been accrued and
served to offset income in prior years, and though the corporation
was solvent, held, under § 22 (b) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1936, a
"gift" exempt from federal income tax, P. 330.
4. A finding of the Board of Tax Appeals that the debt cancellation
in question was not a "gift" within the meaning of § 22 (b) (3) of
the Revenue Act of 1936 is not conclusive here, because the Board

reached its conclusion by application of erroneous legal standards.
P. 330.
5. That the motives for cancellation of indebtedness were those of
business, or even selfish, is of no significance in determining whether
there was a "gift" under § 22 (b) (3). P. 331.

CERTIORARI, 317 U. S. 612, to review the reversal of a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 44 B. T. A. 425,
sustaining a determination of deficiency in income tax.
Mr. Samuel H. Levy, with whom Solicitor General
Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Messrs.
Sewall Key and Newton K. Fox, and Miss Helen R. Carloss were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. John E. Hughes, with whom Mr. James A. O'Callaghan was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTIcE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
This writ of certiorari brings here for review the question of the taxability, as income, of rent and interest on
accounts owed by the taxpayer which were cancelled by
its creditors.
The taxpayer, a corporation, respondent here, owed
certain past due bills for merchandise. This indebtedness was represented by interest-bearing notes. Interest
upon these notes had been accrued for the years prior to
1937 and deducted in the taxpayer's income tax returns,
to the amount of $11,435.22. In November, 1936, the
creditors agreed to cancel all interest accruing after January 1, 1932. The first entry on the taxpayer's books
which records the cancellation appears in December, 1937,
the tax year here involved, when over $16,000 was
credited.
The taxpayer in December, 1933, also owed back rent
amounting to $15,298.99. This back rent had been accrued as an expense. A new lease was negotiated at that

time and the lessor promised to make an adjustment of
the accumulated obligation. The following April the
lessor advised the taxpayer that he would accept $7,500
in payment of the back rent and would cancel the rest.
The reduced sum was paid in February, 1937, by cash and
notes which were met the same year. In 1937 the first
entries were made on both the lessor's and the taxpayer's
books, showing the partial forgiveness of the back rent.
The date of the book entries of the cancellations and
the deduction of the interest for the whole of 1936 by
the taxpayer led the Board of Tax Appeals to uphold the
Commissioner's determination that the cancellation of all
items of indebtedness involved here took place in 1937.
This determination is accepted by us. Wilmington
Trust Co. v. Commissioner,316 U. S. 164, 168.
The taxpayer credited the total amount of the cancelled
debts, $25,219.65, to earned surplus.' It did not return
any of the sum as taxable income. No proof appears of
the insolvency of the taxpayer before or after the cancellation. Its balance sheets show assets exceeding liabilities
at the opening and close of 1937 with net assets greater
than the asserted adjustment of income. Under these
circumstances the Commissioner increased the taxpayer's
reported income by $19,234.21, the sum of the items of the
cancelled indebtedness which the Board of Tax Appeals
found had served to offset income in like amounts in prior
years. The taxpayer had accrued the rent and interest
in former years. No claim for additional taxes is made
by the Commissioner.
The taxpayer sought a redetermination on the ground
that the cancellations were exempt gifts and that it was
not enriched beyond the tax advantages gained by the
deductions in former tax returns. The Board of Tax
There is an unexplained and immaterial variance between the sum
of the items cancelled and the total credited to surplus.

Opinion of the Court.

Appeals found that the cancellations were not gifts, concluded that the tax benefits in dollars obtained by the
deductions of former years did not limit the 1937 tax
springing from the cancellation and affirmed the Commissioner's determination of a deficiency. The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the cancellations
constituted exempt gifts. 128 F. 2d 254. On account
of a variety of views in the circuits as to the taxability
of similar adjustments of indebtedness, we granted
certiorari. 2
The applicable statutory provisions are § 22 (a) and
(b) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1936.' The general definition of gross income has varied little in the successive
revenue acts, and, from the earliest, gifts have been excluded by substantially identical statutory language. Act

Art. 22 (a)-14, covered cancellation of indebtedness.'
This regulation first appeared in Regulations 86 under
the 1934 Act. It marked a change in the Treasury's concept of the tax effect of debt forgiveness. The old article
as it appeared in Regulations 77, relating to the 1932 Act,
read in part:
"If, however, a creditor merely desires to benefit a debtor
and without any consideration therefor cancels the debt,
the amount of the debt is a gift from the creditor to the
debtor and need not be included in the latter's gross
income." 1
4 "Art. 22 (a)-14. Cancellation of indebtedness-The cancellation
of indebtedness, in whole or in part, may result in the realization of
income. If, for example, an individual performs services for a creditor,
who in consideration thereof cancels the debt, income in the amount
of the debt is realized by the debtor as compensation for his services.
A taxpayer realizes income by the payment or purchase of his obligations at less than their face value. (See article 22 (a)-18.) If a shareholder in a corporation which is indebted to him gratuitously forgives
the debt, the transaction amounts to a contribution to the capital of
the corporation. Income is not realized by a taxpayer by virtue
of the discharge of his indebtedness as the result of an adjudication
in bankruptcy, or by virtue of a composition agreement among his
creditors, if immediately thereafter the taxpayer's liabilities exceed
the value of his assets."
The article relating to the exclusion of gifts from gross income is
not helpful. It merely says gifts are exempt from the income tax.
Art. 22 (b) (3)-1.
5 The whole article was as follows:
"Art. 64. Forgiveness of indebtedness.-The cancellation and forgiveness of indebtedness may amount to a payment of income, to a
gift, or to a capital transaction, dependent upon the circumstances.
If, for example, an individual performs services for a creditor, who in
consideration thereof cancels the debt, income to that amount is realized by the debtor as compensation for his services. If, however, a
creditor merely desires to benefit a debtor and without any consideration therefor cancels the debt, the amount of the debt is a gift from
the creditor to the debtor and need not be included in the latter's gross
income. If a shareholder in a corporation which is indebted to him

Opinion of the Court.

The same language appeared in the former Regulations.
In fields closely related to the cancellation of indebtedness which we are considering here, this Court has treated
gains in net assets as income. In United States v. Kirby
Lumber Co., 284 U. S. 1, the taxpayer purchased its own
bonds at a discount. It was held taxable on the increase
in net assets which resulted." This holding was confirmed
by Helvering v. American Chicle Co., 291 U. S. 426. See
also Commissioner v. Coastwise Transp. Corp., 71 F. 2d
104. Forfeiture or surrender of a lease by which the lessor
gains property or money makes such gain taxable. Helvering v. Bruun, 309 U. S. 461; Hort v. Commissioner,313
U. S.28. The narrow line between taxable bonuses and
tax free gifts is illuminated by Bogardusv. Commissioner,
302 U. S.34, on the one side and upon the other by Noel
v. Parrott,15 F. 2d 669, as approved in Old Colony Trust
Co. v. Commissioner,279 U. S.716, 730.
Normally cancellations of indebtedness occur only when
the beneficiary is insolvent or at least in financial straits.
Possibly because it seems beyond the legislative purpose to
exact income taxes for savings on debts, the courts have
been astute to avoid taxing every balance sheet improvement brought about through a debt reduction. Where the
indebtedness has represented the purchase price of property, a partial forgiveness has been treated as a readjustgratuitously forgive- the debt, the transaction amounts to a contribution to the capital of the corporation."

Regulations 65, Art. 49 (1924), for individuals; Regulations 62, Art.
50 (1922), for individuals; Regulations 45 (1920 ed.), Art. 51, for
individuals.
When the gift tax was revived in 1932, the House Report gave as
an example of a gift "the forgiveness or payment by A of B's indebtedness." H. Rep. No. 708, 72nd Cong., 1st Sess., p. 28 (5).
7 The fact that the purchase was made in the taxable year of issue
is immaterial. Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., 282 U. S. 359, 364,

v. Auto Strop Safety Razor Co., 74 F. 2d 226.8
The uncertainties of the effect of the remission of indebtedness on income tax brought about legislation to
clarify the problems. The Chandler Bankruptcy Act of
June 22, 1938, instituted adjustments deemed desirable.'
The provisions of Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act relating to corporate reorganizations are typical. They declare
that no income should be recognized "in respect to the
adjustment of the indebtedness of a debtor" under reorganization proceedings § 268, 52 Stat. 904, provided that
the basis of the property should be reduced correspondingly
as specified in § 270 as amended July 1, 1940, 54 Stat. 709.
The basis requirements do not appear throughout the sections, e. g., Chapter XV. The Revenue Act of 1939 "0
amended the Internal Revenue Code, §§ 22 (b) and
113 (b), so as to extend similar relief to all corporate taxpayers "in an unsound financial condition." "

Opinion of the Court.

It was provided that § 215 should not apply to any discharge of indebtedness occurring prior to the enactment
of the Revenue Act of 1939. No further explanation for
this limitation appears beyond the language of the House
Report:
"The amendments made by section 215 of the bill are applicable only to taxable years beginning after December
31, 1938. They are not applicable to discharges of corporate indebtedness occurring prior to the date of the enactment of the bill. They are also not applicable to a
discharge occurring in any taxable year beginning after
December 31, 1942. They likewise do not apply to any
discharge of corporate indebtedness occurring in any proceeding under section 77B, or under chapter X or XI, of
the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, as amended, since such discharges are governed by other provisions of law." P. 25.
The Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 798, 811, § 114,
amended § 22 (b) (9) of the Internal Revenue Code so as
to make the exclusion from gross income of income arising
from discharge of indebtedness applicable generally to all
corporations, whether or not financially sound."2
In the light of these views upon gain, profit and income,
we must construe the meaning of the statutory exemption
of gifts from gross income by § 22 (b) (3). The broad import of gross income in § 22 (a)' 3 admonishes us to be chary
See S. Rep. No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 77; 26 U. S. C. § 22:

of extending any words of exemption beyond their plain
meaning. Cf. Heiner v. Colonial Trust Co., 275 U. S. 232,
235; United States v. Stewart, 311 U. S. 60, 63. "Gifts,"
however, is a generic word of broad connotation, taking
coloration from the context of the particular statute in
which it may appear. Its plain meaning in its present
setting denotes, it seems to us, the receipt of financial
advantages gratuitously.
The release of interest or the complete satisfaction of
an indebtedness by partial payment by the voluntary act
of the creditor is more akin to a reduction of sale price
than to financial betterment through the purchase by a
debtor of its bonds in an arm's-length transaction. In
this view, there is no substance in the Commissioner's
differentiation between a solvent or insolvent corporation or the taxation of income to the extent of assets freed
from the claims of creditors by a gratuitous cancellation
of indebtedness. Lakeland Grocery Co. v. Commissioner,
36 B. T. A. 289. Cf. Madison Railways Co. v. Commissioner, 36 B. T. A. 1106; Spokane Office Supply Co. v.
Commissioner, B. T. A. Docket No. 86762, memo. op. of
April 29, 1939; Model Laundry v. Commissioner, B. T. A.
Docket No. 93493, memo. op. of January 15, 1940. See
also Haden Co. v. Commissioner, 118 F. 2d 285, which
supports the Commissioner.
The Board of Tax Appeals decided that these cancellations were not gifts under § 22 (b) (3). It was said:
"No evidence was introduced to show a donative intent
upon the part of any creditor. The evidence indicates,
on the contrary, that the creditors acted for purely business reasons and did not forgive the debts for altruistic
reasons or out of pure generosity." 44 B. T. A. 425, 428.
With this conclusion we cannot agree. We do not feel
bound by the finding of the Board because it reached its
conclusions, in our opinion, upon an application of erroneous legal standards. Section 22 (b) (3) exempts

HELVERING v. AMER. DENTAL CO.

gifts. This does not leave the Tax Court of the United
States free to determine at will or upon evidence and
without judicial review the tests to be applied to facts
to determine whether the result is or is not a gift. The
fact that the motives leading to the cancellations were
those of business or even selfish, if it be true, is not significant. The forgiveness was gratuitous, a release of
something to the debtor for nothing, and sufficient to
make the cancellation here gifts within the statute.

took no part in the considera-

tion or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER,

dissenting:

When Congress wished to exempt income "attributable
to the discharge . . . of any indebtedness" it did so explicitly. It defined such exemption with particularity
and only to a limited extent, as illustrated by the various
enactments, including § 114 of the Revenue Act of 1942,
all of which appear to throw light leading away from and
not towards the conclusion drawn from them by the Court.
In the absence of such specific exemption of what as a
practical matter may be income, determination of whether
it is or is not income should be left to the tribunal whose
special business it is to ascertain the controverted facts
and the reasonable inferences from them. In deciding
that, in the circumstances of the present case, the debt
cancellations were not gifts and therefore taxable, the
Board of Tax Appeals (now the Tax Court of the United
States) did not invoke wrong legal standards. It knew
well enough the difference between taxable income
and gifts. It applied these legal concepts to its interpretation of the facts. That its judgment should not be
upset is counselled by wise fiscal as well as judicial
administration.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON joins in

this dissent.
