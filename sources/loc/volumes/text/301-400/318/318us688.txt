I think the order should be treated as binding until modified or set aside in the manner provided by federal law.
NEW YORK EX REL. WHITMAN v. WILSON,
WARDEN.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 72. Argued February 1, 1943.-Decided April 12, 1943.
Since the present proceeding must be dismissed if habeas corpus is not
an appropriate remedy under the state law, and since this Court

is unable to determine that question with finality, or to resolve the
contentions with respect to it, in advance of a controlling decision
by the state courts, the judgment appealed from is vacated and the

cause is remanded to the state court for further proceedings. P. 690.
263 App. Div. 908, 924, 32 N. Y. S. 2d 29, 1023, vacated.

CERTIORARI, 317 U. S. 615, to review a judgment affirming the dismissal of a writ of habeas corpus. Leave to
appeal to the highest court of the State was denied, 263
App. Div. 924; 287 N. Y. 856; and an appeal taken as of
right was dismissed, 290 N. Y. 670.
Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Jr., with whom Mr. Curtiss E.
Frank was on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. BernardL. Alderman, with whom Messrs.Nathaniel
L. Goldstein, Attorney General of New York, Orrin G.
Judd, Solicitor General, and Wendell P. Brown, Assistant
Attorney General, were on the brief, for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of the State

of New York, Washington County. He alleged that his
conviction had been procured through the use of perjured
testimony knowingly used by the prosecution, and that
under Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S.103, his commitment
was in deprivation of his constitutional rights under the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The
writ of habeas corpus was dismissed by the Supreme
Court; its order was affirmed by the Appellate Division,
263 App. Div. 908, 32 N. Y. S. 2d 29; leave to appeal to
the Court of Appeals was denied by both the Appellate
Division and the Court of Appeals. 263 App. Div. 924,
32 N. Y. S. 2d 1023; 287 N. Y. 856, 40 N. E. 2d 649. We
granted certiorari, 317 U. S.615, and, because petitioner
was a poor person without counsel of his own selection, we
appointed counsel to represent him. Since the argument
in this Court, the Court of Appeals has entered a further
order dismissing petitioner's attempted appeal to that
court as of right, stating that "the case is one where appellant is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus under
Section 1231" of the New York Civil Practice Act.
290 N. Y. 670.
In his brief and argument in this Court, the Attorney
General of the State of New York, on respondent's behalf,
took the position that New York law makes the writ- of
habeas corpus available to test the constitutional validity,
under the Due Process Clause, of petitioner's detention.
In support of this contention, the Attorney General relied
upon a number of cases in the New York courts, which
appear to sustain his position. People ex rel. Moore v.
Hunt, 258 App. Div. 24, 16 N. Y. S. 2d 19; People ex rel.
Harrisonv. Wilson, 176 Misc. 1042, 29 N. Y. S. 2d 809;
People ex rel. Kruger v. Hunt, 257 App. Div. 917, 12

Div. 1039, 13 N. Y. S. 2d 797.
After the oral argument in this Court, the Court of Appeals on March 4, 1943, decided the case of Lyons v. Gold-

stein, 290 N. Y. 19. It there held that, despite the lapse
of time, a state court in which a judgment of conviction
has been entered retains jurisdiction, analogous to the
common law jurisdiction upon writ of error coram nobis,
to set aside the conviction on a showing that a plea of
guilty had been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation
on the part of a prosecuting official. The opinion rests
in part on the requirement of the Due Process Clause
that a prisoner be granted a hearing on the merits of such
a contention; it cites Mooney v. Holohan, supra, and also
Walker v. Johnston, 312 U. S. 275, and Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101, 104-05, in which this Court sustained
the use in the federal courts of habeas corpus to that end.
The opinion does not expressly consider or otherwise
allude to the question whether, under New York practice,
habeas corpus may be used as either an alternative or a
cumulative remedy in such a case.
In his latest submission to us, the Attorney General
now contends that, in the light of the decision in Lyons v.
Goldstein, supra, the remedy by a proceeding coram nobis
in the court where the judgment of conviction was entered
(here the Court of General Sessions, New York County) is
exclusive; and that habeas corpus accordingly is not available to petitioner in the state courts, even if on the merits
petitioner has set forth a prima facie case. Petitioner
takes the contrary position.
If habeas corpus is not an appropriate remedy under the
state law, the present proceeding must be dismissed. But
we are unable to decide this question with finality, or to
resolve the contentions with respect to it, in advance of a
controlling decision of the New York courts. In view of
the changed situation resulting from the decision in Lyons
v. Goldstein after we granted certiorari, we think it appropriate to vacate the judgment and to remand the cause
to the state court for its determination in the light of that
decision, and for such further or other proceedings as may

So ordered.
MR.JUSTICE RUTLEDGE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER:

Petitioner's claim is that the State of New York has
denied him the right which, according to our decision in
Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S.103, is his under the Constitution of the United States. As in the Mooney case,
"Petitioner urges that the 'knowing use' by the State of
perjured testimony to obtain the conviction and the deliberate suppression of evidence to impeach that testimony constituted a denial of due process of law. Petitioner further contends that the State deprives him of his
liberty without due process of law by its failure, in the circumstances set forth, to provide any corrective judicial
process by which a conviction so obtained may be set
aside." 294 U. S. at 110.
Unless I misapprehend the controlling decisions of the
New York Court of Appeals and the authoritative commentary thereon by the Chief Judge of that Court, in a
submission before us, New York recognizes the right
which petitioner seeks to vindicate here by providing a
procedure for asserting it different from that which petitioner has pursued. Petitioner has sought to prove his
claim in the New York courts through the writ of habeas
corpus. But ยง 1231 of the New York Civil Practice Act,
providing that "a person is not entitled to" habeas corpus
"where he has been committed or is detained by virtue of
the final judgment or decree of a competent tribunal of
civil or criminal jurisdiction," does not allow the use of

the writ to raise such a claim. That writ in New York
merely tests the legality of a detention according to the
face of the record. As, for instance, where one under
sentence is transferred from a reformatory to a state prison
and there detained under a void order, People ex rel. Saia
v. Martin, 289 N. Y. 471, 46 N. E. 2d 890, or where a relator is held in custody under the provisions of a statute
claimed to be unconstitutional. See People ex rel. Bryant
v. Zimmerman, 241 N. Y. 405, 150 N. E. 497; 278 U. S.
63. New York recognizes the constitutional duty to provide a remedy for such a claim as arises under the doctrine
of Mooney v. Holohan, supra. But New York's remedy
for testing such a claim is not by habeas corpus but by
appropriate motion before the court in which the sentence
of conviction was rendered. Lyons v. Goldstein, 290 N. Y.
19, 25, 47 N. E. 2d 425.
Since the argument in this case, the New York Court of
Appeals formally dismissed petitioner's appeal to that
court from the order of the Appellate Division denying
him habeas corpus, on the ground that "the case is one
where appellant is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus
under Section 1231 of the Civil Practice Act." But inasmuch as "the constitutional questions which appellant
asked the court to review are substantial," to use the language of Chief Judge Lehman, he could, under New York
practice, have gone to the Court of Appeals as of right if
habeas corpus were the proper remedy. The merits of
petitioner's constitutional claim have therefore never been
passed on by, because never presented in an appropriate
proceeding to, the highest available New York court.
Consequently, it cannot be entertained here. Since petitioner has misconceived the mode by which his constitutional claim may properly be brought before the New
York courts, this petition should be dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS and MR. JUSTICE REED join in

this opinion.
