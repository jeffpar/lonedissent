LEISHMAN v. ASSOCIATED ELECTRIC CO.

Counsel for Parties.

That the defendant's senior counsel, a lawyer of long
experience in federal criminal practice, did not take exception to the manner in which Judge Maris tempered concern for the proper administration of justice with solicitude for the rights of the defendant, indicates not "waiver"
of a right which had been denied but recognition that the
action of the trial judge was unexceptionable. The claim
that the trial was conducted improperly is obviously an
afterthought. Only after conviction and in an effort to
upset the jury's verdict on appeal was the fair conduct of
the trial court sought to be distorted into an impropriety.

LEISHMAN v. ASSOCIATED WHOLESALE
ELECTRIC CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 332. Argued February 2, 1943.-Decided February 15, 1943.
1. Where a motion under Rule 52 (b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure
(made within an enlargement of time under Rule 6 (b)) to amend
and supplement the findings and conclusions relates to matters of
substance and would, if granted, require an amendment of the
judgment to conform thereto, even though amendment of the judgment was not specifically requested, the time for taking an appeal
from the judgment (28 U. S. C. § 230) runs from the date of the
order disposing of the motion. P. 205.
2. Rule 59 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, relating to new trials, held
inapplicable. P. 206.
128 F. 2d 204, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 317 U. S. 612, to review a decree dismissing

an appeal for want of jurisdiction.
Mr. John Flam for petitioner.
Mr. Samuel E. Darby, Jr., with whom Mr. Marston
Allen was on the brief, for respondent.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S

MR. JusTicE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question in this case is whether petitioner appealed
to the Circuit Court of Appeals within the time provided
by law (28 U. S. C. § 230).
This is a suit brought by petitioner for infringement of
certain claims of a reissue patent. The district court made
findings of fact that the claims in issue did not embody any
invention over the prior art and entered judgment dismissing the complaint on May 1, 1941. On May 28,1941, after
securing an enlargement of time under Rule 6 (b) of the
Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U. S. C. A. following § 723c),
petitioner filed a motion under Rule 52 (b)' asking that
the findings "be amended and supplemented." Petitioner
requested that some of the findings relating to non-invention be amended in certain respects set out in the motion
so as to show invention and to include a specific finding
that the claims in issue did define invention over the prior
art. Supplemental findings, intended to dispose of various
other defenses asserted by respondent but not passed upon
by the court, were also requested. The motion concluded
with the statement that: "Consistently with these findings,
the conclusions of law should be amended to state that the
claims . . . in suit, are valid; that an injunction shall

issue in the usual form, and that there be an accounting
for past infringement." This motion was denied on June
9,1941.
On September 4, 1941, petitioner filed his notice of appeal in the district court.2 The Circuit Court of Appeals
sua sponte held it had no jurisdiction because the appeal
was taken more than three months after the entry of
'So far as is here material Rule 52 (b) provides: "Upon motion of a
party made not later than 10 days after entry of judgment the court
may amend its findings or make additional findings and may amend the
judgment accordingly."
2This is the proper method of taking an appeal. Rule 73 (a).

Opinion of the Court.

judgment, contrary to 28 U. S. C. § 230. In so holding
that 'court recognized the general rule that where a petition for rehearing, a motion for a new trial, or a motion
to vacate, amend, or modify a judgment is seasonably
made and entertained, the time for appeal does not begin
to run until the disposition of the motion.' But this case
was differentiated on the ground that the instant motion
was not one to amend the judgment but merely one to
amend and supplement the findings and conclusions. 128
F. 2d 204. We granted certiorari to settle the important
question of practice presented under the Rules of Civil
Procedure.
We think that petitioner's time to appeal did not begin
to run until the disposition of his motion under Rule
52 (b) on June 9, 1941, and accordingly that his appeal
was timely. The motion was not addressed to mere matters of form but raised questions of substance since it
sought reconsideration of certain basic findings of fact
and the alteration of the conclusions of the court. In
short the necessary effect was to ask that rights already
adjudicated be altered. Consequently it deprived the
judgment of that finality which is essential to appealability. Cf. Zimmern v. United States, 298 U. S. 167;
Department of Banking v. Pink, 317 U. S. 264. It is immaterial that petitioner did not specifically request the
amendment of the judgment, and the distinction based on
this failure to request by the court below is artificial and
untenable. If the motion had been granted and the requested amended and supplemental findings made, the

judgment would have to be amended or altered to conform
to those findings and the conclusions resulting from them.
We conclude that a motion under Rule 52 (b) such as the
cinstant one which seeks to amend or supplement the findings of fact in more than purely formal or mechanical
aspects tolls the appeals statute, and that the time for
taking an appeal runs from the date of the order disposing of the motion. Cf. Continental Oil Co. v. United
States, 299 U. S. 510.
The motion was not one for a new trial under Rule 59
and respondent's argument, based on that premise, that it
was not filed in time," is not pertinent.
The judgment below is
Reversed.

ELECTRIC CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

1. A permit granted by the Secretary of the Interior under § 4 of the
Act of March 3, 1901, to the State of Oklahoma to open and establish
a public highway over Indian allotted lands, is to be construed, in the
absence of any governing administrative ruling, statute, or Congressional policy to the contrary, as authorizing the State to license the
erection and maintenance of a rural electric service line, a proper
use of the highway under state law. P. 209.

"reservation" as used in the Acts of February 15, 1901, and March
4, 1911. P. 215.
127 F. 2d 349, affirmed.
