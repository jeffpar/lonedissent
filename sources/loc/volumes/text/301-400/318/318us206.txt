judgment would have to be amended or altered to conform
to those findings and the conclusions resulting from them.
We conclude that a motion under Rule 52 (b) such as the
cinstant one which seeks to amend or supplement the findings of fact in more than purely formal or mechanical
aspects tolls the appeals statute, and that the time for
taking an appeal runs from the date of the order disposing of the motion. Cf. Continental Oil Co. v. United
States, 299 U. S. 510.
The motion was not one for a new trial under Rule 59
and respondent's argument, based on that premise, that it
was not filed in time," is not pertinent.

Reversed.
UNITED STATES v. OKLAHOMA GAS &
ELECTRIC CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 171.

Argued December 9, 1942-Decided February 15, 1943.

1. A permit granted by the Secretary of the Interior under § 4 of the
Act of March 3, 1901, to the State of Oklahoma to open and establish
a public highway over Indian allotted lands, is to be construed, in the
absence of any governing administrative ruling, statute, or Congressional policy to the contrary, as authorizing the State to license the
erection and maintenance of a rural electric service line, a proper
use of the highway under state law. P. 209.
2. The Indian allotted lands involved in this case were not within a
"reservation" as used in the Acts of February 15, 1901, and March
4, 1911. P. 215.
127 F. 2d 349, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Valentine Brookes argued the cause, and Solicitor
General Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Littell, and
Mr. Vernon L. Wilkinson were on the brief, for the United
States.
Mr. Streeter B. Flynn, with whom Mr. R. M. Rainey
was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JuSTIcE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The United States sued the Oklahoma Gas and Electric
Company in the United States District Court asking a
declaratory judgment that the Company illegally occupies
with its pole line certain Indian land, and a mandatory
injunction to terminate such occupation. The case turns
on whether permission to the State of Oklahoma to establish a highway over allotted Indian land given under § 4
of the Act of March 3, 1901,1 includes the right to permit
maintenance of rural electric service lines within the
highway bounds.
The United States at all relevant times held title to half
of a quarter section of land in Oklahoma in trust for Shepah-tho-quah, a Mexican Kickapoo Indian allottee thereof; and since her death, for her heirs. The State of Oklahoma applied to the Secretary of the Interior "to grant
permission in accordance with § 4 of the Act of March 3,
1901 (31 Stat. L. 1058, 1084), to open and establish a
public highway" across the land in question. The highway width was 80 feet, and it extended 2,577 feet on these
lands, occupying 4.55 acres thereof. The State paid therefor $1,275 as compensation to the heirs of She-pah-thoquah, and on January 20, 1928, the map of definite
location was on behalf of the Secretary endorsed "Approved subject to the provisions of the Act of March 3,
1901 (31 Stat. L. 1058, 1084), Department regulations

thereunder; and subject also to any prior valid existing
right or adverse claim."
Section 4 of the Act of March 3, 1901, under which
the application was specifically made and granted,
provides:
"That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized
to grant permission, upon compliance with such requirements as he may deem necessary, to the proper State or
local authorities for the opening and establishment of public highways, in accordance with the laws of the State or
Territory in which the lands are situated, through any
Indian reservation or through any lands which have been
allotted in severalty to any individual Indians under any
laws or treaties but which have not yet been conveyed
to the allottees with full power of alienation."
Apparently the Secretary has never issued a regulation
applicable to this case. Cf. 25 Code of Federal Regulations § 261.1 et seq.
The highway was opened, and in 1936 the Oklahoma
State Highway Commission, with statutory authority to
act in the matter,' granted respondent the license under
which it occupies a portion of the highway with its rural
electric service line. The license is in terms revocable at
will, provides for location of the poles 38 feet from the
center of the highway, and requires all lines to be kept in
good repair. The licensee assumes all liability for dam,age, and the license recites that it is "granted subject to
any and all claims made by adjacent property owners as
compensation for additional burden on such adjacent and
abutting property."
The Secretary considered this use of the property not
warranted by his permission to the State to establish a
highway under § 4 of the Act of March 3, 1901. He demanded that the Company apply to him under the Acts
2

Opinion of the Court.

of February 15, 1901 and March 4, 1911 1 for permission to
maintain its lines and, when the Company refused, instituted this action. The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit affirmed. 37 F. Supp. 347, 127 F. 2d 349. The
question appeared important to the administration of
Indian affairs, and we granted certiorari.
It is not denied that under the laws of Oklahoma the use
made of the highway by respondent, the State's licensee, is
a lawful and proper highway use, imposing no additional
burden for which a grantor of the highway easement would
be entitled to compensation. But the Government denies
that the Act of March 3, 1901, providing "for the opening
and establishment of public highways, in accordance with
the laws of the State or Territory in which the lands are
situated," submits the scope of the highway use to state
law. Its interpretation gives the Act a very limited meaning and substantially confines state law to governing procedures for "opening and establishment" of the highway.
It offers as examples of what is permitted to state determination, whether a state or county agency builds the road,
whether funds shall be raised by bond issue or otherwise,
and the terms and specifications of the construction contract. The issue is between this narrow view of the State's
authority and the broader one which recognizes its laws as
determining the various uses which go to make up the
"public highway," opening and establishment of which are
authorized.
We see no reason to believe that Congress intended to
grant to local authorities a power so limited in a matter
so commonly subject to complete local control.
It is well settled that a conveyance by the United States
of land which it owns beneficially or, as in this case, for
831 Stat. 790, 43 U. S. C. § 959; 36 Stat. 1235, 1253, 43 U. S. C.
§ 961. These are set out and discussed infra, pp. 213 et seq.

the purpose of exercising its guardianship over Indians,
is to be construed, in the absence of any contrary indication of intention, according to the law of the State where
the land lies.' Presumably Congress intended that this
case be decided by reference to some law, but the Government has cited and we know of no federal statutory or
common-law rule for determining whether the running of
the electric service lines here involved was a highway use.
These considerations, as well as the explicit reference in
the Act to state law in the matter of "establishment" as
well as of "opening" the highway, indicate that the question in this case is to be answered by reference to that law,
in the absence of any governing administrative ruling,
statute, or dominating consideration of Congressional
policy to the contrary. We find nonelof these.
Apparently the Secretary has never sought to solve the
problem of this ca~e by an administrative ruling, and
whether he might do so is a question which the parties
have neither raised nor discussed, and upon which we intimate no opinion.
In construing this statute as to the incidents of a highway grant we must bear in mind that the Act contemplated a conveyance to a public body, not to a private
interest. There was not the reason to withhold continuing control over the uses of the strip that might be withheld wisely in a grant of indefinite duration to a private
grantee. It is said that the use here permitted by the
State is private and commercial, and so it is. But a
license to use the highway by a carrier of passengers for
hire, or by a motor freight line, would also be a private

and commercial use in the same sense. And it has long
been both customary and lawful to stimulate private selfinterest and utilize the profit motive to get needful services performed for the public. The State appears to be
doing no more than that.
This is not such a transmission line as might endanger
highway travel or abutting owners with no compensating
advantage. It is a rural service line, and to bring electric
energy in to the countryside is quite as essential to modern
life as many other uses of the highway. The State has
granted nothing not revocable at will, has alienated nothing obtained under the Act, has permitted no use that
would obstruct or interfere with the use for which the
highway was established, and has not purported to confer
any right not subsidiary to its own or which would survive
abandonment of the highway.
The interpretation suggested by the Government is not
shown to be necessary to the fulfillment of the policy of
Congress to protect a less-favored people against their
own improvidence or the overreaching of others; nor is it
conceivable that it is necessary, for the Indians are subjected only to the same rule of law as are others in the
State, and then only by permission of the Secretary, subject to compliance with "such requirements as he may
deem necessary."
Oklahoma is spotted with restricted lands held in trust
for Indian allottees. Complications and confusion would
follow from applying to highways crossing or abutting
such lands rules differing from those which obtain as to
lands of non-Indians. We believe that if Congress had intended this it would have made its meaning clear.
The Government relies, however, on the Acts of February 15, 1901, and of March 4, 1911, which it says require
the Secretary's consent to cross Indian land with electric
lines, regardless of the prior grant of permission for the

highway. We believe that they are inapplicable to the
land in suit, and therefore need not determine what would
be their effect if they did apply.
The Act of February 15, 1901, "An Act Relating to
rights of way through certain parks, reservations, and
other public lands," I authorizes the Secretary of the Interior "to permit the use of rights of way through the
public lands, forest and other reservations of the United
States, and the Yosemite, Sequoia, and General Grant
national parks, California, for electrical plants, poles, and
lines for the generation and distribution of electrical
power, and for telephone and telegraph purposes . . . to
the extent of . . . not to exceed fifty feet on each side of
the center line of such . . .electrical, telegraph, and telephone lines and poles . . .:Provided, That such permits
shall be allowed within or through any of said parks or any
forest, military, Indian, or other reservation only upon the
approval of the chief officer of the Department under
whose supervision such park or reservation falls and upon
a finding by him that the same is not incompatible with
the public interest: Provided further, That all permits
given hereunder for telegraph and telephone purposes
shall be subject to the provision of title sixty-five of the
Revised Statutes of the United States, and amendments
thereto, regulating rights of way for telegraph companies
over the public domain: And provided further, That any
permission given by the Secretary of the Interior under
the provisions of this Act may be revoked by him or his
successor in his discretion, and shall not be held to confer
any right, or easement, or interest in, to, or over any public
land, reservation, or park." 6
I H. R. Rep. No. 1850, 56th Cong., 1st Sess., indicates that the title
of the Act, referring to public lands, was advisedly chosen.

Opinion of the Court.

For all present purposes the Act of March 4, 1911 is the
same as the above Act
Neither statute makes any reference whatever to lands
allotted to Indians in which the United States holds title
in trust only to prevent improvident alienation. Their
general tenor and particularly the second proviso of the
Act of February 15, 1901, repel any inference that they
736 Stat. 1235, 1253, 43 U. S. C. § 961, providing:
"That the head of the department having jurisdiction over the lands
be, and he hereby is, authorized and empowered, under general regulations to be fixed by him, to grant an easement for rights of way, for
a period not exceeding fifty years from the date of the issuance of
such grant, over, across, and upon the public lands, national forests,
and reservations of the United States for electrical poles and lines for
the transmission and distribution of electrical power, and for poles and
lines for telephone and telegraph purposes, to the extent of twenty
feet on each side of the center line of such electrical, telephone and
telegraph lines and poles, to any citizen, association, or corporation
of the United States, where it is intended by such to exercise the right
of way herein granted for any one or more of the purposes herein
named: Provided, That such right of way shall be allowed within or
through any national park, national forest, military, Indian, or any
other reservation only upon the approval of the chief officer of the
department under whose supervision or control such reservation falls,
and upon a finding by him that the same is not incompatible with the
public interest: Provided, That all or any part of such right of way
may be forfeited and annulled by declaration of the head of the department having jurisdiction over the lands for nonuse for a period
of two years or for abandonment."
See 40 L. D. 30, 31: "It will be observed that this act, which
authorizes the granting of easements for electrical power transmission, and telephone and telegraph lines for stated periods not to exceed
50 years, follows, as closely as is possible in the accomplishment of
its purposes, the language of the act of February 15, 1901 (31 Stat.,
790), which authorizes mere revocable permits or licenses for such
lines, and for other purposes. This act, therefore, merely authorizes
additional or larger grants and does not modify or repeal the act of
1901, and should be construed and applied in harmony with it."

were intended to govern the grant of rights of way over
such lands. The effect of this proviso was to make any
telephone or telegraph company which availed itself of
the Act subject, as to Government business, to the rates
set by the Postmaster General, and to make "all the...
lines, property, and effects" of such a company subject to
purchase by the Government at a value to be ascertained
by an appraisal of five persons, two selected by the Postmaster General, two by the company, and one by the four
so chosen.8 It is rather difficult to believe that Congress
ever intended to exact such conditions as part of the price
of running a line across land in which the Government is
interested only to the extent of holding title for the protection of an individual Indian allottee. It is particularly
difficult in the context of the Acts, for if such were the intent it was defeated by giving an option to obtain the same
rights by condemnation under state law and free of such
restrictions. § 3 of the Act of March 3, 1901V
The Government seeks to repel the force of these implications by asserting that the word "reservation" as employed in these Acts includes such land.
Section 4 of the Act of March 3, 1901 authorizes permission to run a highway "through any Indian reservation or
through any lands which have been allotted in severalty
to any individual Indians under any laws or treaties but
which have not been conveyed to the allottees with full
power of alienation." The Act in § 3 also refers to "lands
allotted in severalty," after already employing the word
"reservation." If it included allotted lands without these
words, Congress was employing language to no discernible
purpose. We think Congress employed this language in
the Act of March 3, 1901, to a purpose and with a clear
distinction between reservations and allotted lands. Sec8

tion 3 made allotted lands, but not reservations, subject
to condemnation for any public purpose; § 4 made both
reservations and allotted lands subject to highway permits
by the Secretary. We think that the almost contemporaneous Act of February 15, 1901, in authorizing permits
for electric companies through reservations, but not
allotted lands, meant just what it said.
We have no purpose to decide anything more than the
case before us. We do not say that "reservation" may
never include allotted lands; all we hold is that if there is
a distinction in fact, that distinction is carried into the
Act. So we turn to the question whether these particular allotted lands were in fact within or without a
"reservation."
She-pah-tho-quah, the allottee, was of the Kickapoo
Tribe. In earlier times the Kickapoo Tribe occupied a
treaty reservation in Kansas." They became torn by internal dissensions. One faction remained on the old reservation in Kansas and received allotments there.1 Others
migrated, chiefly in 1852 and 1863, to Mexico and located
on a reservation set apart for them by that Government.
The Oklahoma Kickapoos comprise those who left Mexico,
mostly in 1873, and returned to the United States. Ten
years later a reservation was established for them by Executive Order in what was then Indian Territory, now
Oklahoma. United States v. Reily, 290 U.S. 33, 35-36.
In 1891, however, these restless people negotiated a sale
of their reservation to the Government "except the Commissioners insist on the Indians taking lands in allotment,
while the Indians insist on taking an equal amount of land
as a diminished reservation, the title to be held in common." 12 This disagreement was submitted to the SecreTreaties of October 24, 1832, 7 Stat. 391; May 18, 1854, 10 Stat.

tary of the Interior and he decided that the "Indians take
their lands in allotment and not to be held in common." 1 '
The Kickapoo Tribe thereupon, on September 9, 1891 did
"cede, convey, transfer, and relinquish, forever, and absolutely, without any reservation whatever, all their claim,
title, and interest" to the reservation lands." In consideration each of the Kickapoos, estimated at about 300 in
number, was allotted 80 acres of such land with a per capita
cash payment.' The transaction was ratified, and carried
out on the part of the United States and the land acquired
by the United States was opened to settlement." Thus,
the Kickapoo reservation was obliterated, the tribal lands
were no more, and only individual allotments survived.
We think it clear that the term "reservation" as used in
the statutes in question had no application to such
lands.
It is true that the opinion in United States v. Reily,
supra, at 35, used the term "Kickapoo Reservation" to
describe a region of Oklahoma as of a time subsequent to
the dissolution. It is clear from the context of the opinion, however, that this term was used in a geographical
and not a legal sense, much as one still speaks of the
Northwest Territory. Congress has frequently referred to
the "Kickapoo Reservation" in Kansas.' 7 And it has
often, usually in the same statute, referred to the Kickapoo Indians of Oklahoma; but never since the dissolution
has it referred to a Kickapoo Reservation as existing in

in this case, we think that the usage of Congress
preponderates.
The dissolution of the reservation distinguishes the
situation before us from that before the court relating to
allotted lands within the Tulalip -Reservation, United
States v. Celestine, 215 U. S. 278; allotted lands within
the Yakima Reservation, United States v. Sutton, 215
U. S. 291; those within the Colville Reservation, United
States v. Pelican, 232 U. S. 442; and the many situations
in which the departmental rulings have held that the
phrase "Indian, or other reservation" includes individual
allotments."9
On the argument inquiry was made of counsel whether
a consistent departmental practice existed in reference to
grants of permission to electric companies to maintain
lines along established highways. Both have called attention to a few instances of applications and grants, or of
assurances none were necessary, said to favor their respective positions." We find no consistent departmental

is part. of the record; and it is incomplete, and in no sense satisfactory

FEDERAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATOR v.
QUAKER OATS CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 424. Argued February 4, 5, 1943.-Decided March 1, 1943.
The Federal Security Administrator, acting under §§ 401 and 701 (e)
of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, promulgated regulations establishing "standards of identity" for various milled wheat
products, excluding vitamin D from the defined standard of "farina"
and permitting it only in "enriched farina," which was required to
contain vitamin B., riboflavin, nicotinic acid and iron. The validity
of the regulations was challenged as applied to the respondent, who
for ten years had manufactured and marketed, under an accurate
and informative label, a food product consisting of farina, as defined
by the Administrator's regulations, but with vitamin D added.
Under the Act as supplemented by the regulations, respondent's
product could not be marketed as "farina," since, by reason of the
presence of vitamin D as an ingredient, it would not conform to the
standard of identity prescribed for "farina"; nor could it be
marketed as "enriched farina" unless the prescribed minimum
quantities of vitamin B,, riboflavin, nicotinic acid and iron were
added. Held, that the Administrator did not depart from statutory
requirements in choosing the standards of identity for the purpose
of promoting "fair dealing in the interest of consumers"; that the
standards which he selected are adapted to that end; and that they
are adequately supported by findings and evidence. Pp. 220, 235.
1. Upon review of an order of the Federal Security Administrator issuing regulations under § 401 of the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act, the findings of the Administrator as to the facts
are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. P. 227.
