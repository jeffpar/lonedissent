Statement of the Case.

that Act in providing for the payment of interest where
the withholding results from an erroneous belief in the
existence of a cross-indebtedness applies with equal force
where the withholding results from an attempt to determine ownership of a claim. But the immunity of the
United States from liability for interest is not to be waived
by policy arguments of this nature. Courts lack the power
to award interest against the United States on the basis
of what they think is or is not sound policy. We reiterate
that only express language. in a statute or contract can
justify the imposition of such interest. Such language is
absent in this instance.
We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of
Claims in No. 94 to the extent that it includes an award
of interest. And since it becomes unnecessary to consider the merits-of the cross-claims, the writ of certiorari
previously issued in No. 96 is dismissed.
So ordered.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN.

No. 140. Argued January 6, 1947.-Decided February 3, 1947.
On the same day that an information was filed in a state court charging him with murder, a 17-year-old defendant was arraigned, convicted on his plea of guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment.
He had no counsel and none was offered or assigned; the court did

PER CURIAM.

In conformity with Michigan procedure, petitioner
moved for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial in
the court in which he had been convicted of first-degree
murder. Serious impairment of his constitutional rights
at the arraignment and trial were asserted as grounds for
the motion. The trial court denied the motion, and the
Supreme Court of Michigan on appeal affirmed that ruling. 313 Mich. 548, 21 N. W. 2d 849. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the constitutional issues
presented.
The facts are not in dispute. On May 16, 1932, an
information was filed in the Circuit Court of Lenawee
County, Michigan, charging petitioner, then seventeen
years of age, and one Virgil Scott with the crime of murder.
On the same day, petitioner was arraigned. tried, convicted
of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.
The record indicates that petitioner was without legal
assistance throughout all these proceedings and was never
advised of his right to counsel. The court did not explain
the consequences of the plea of guilty, and the record indicates considerable confusion in petitioner's mind at the
time of the arraignment as to the effect of such a plea. No

evidence in petitioner's behalf was introduced at the trial
and none of the State's witnesses were subjected to crossexamination.
After reviewing the foregoing facts, the Supreme Court
of Michigan determined that the record revealed no deprivation of petitioner's constitutional rights. The court
indicated that it had given consideration to the case of
Hawk v. Olson, 326 U. S. 271 (1945), and the authorities
cited therein, but concluded that the rule of the Michigan
cases was determinative. See People v. Williams, 225
Mich. 133, 195 N. W. 818 (1923). In this there was
error.
Here a seventeen-year-old defendant, confronted by a
serious and complicated criminal charge, was hurried
through unfamiliar legal proceedings without a word being
said in his defense. At no time was assistance of counsel
offered or mentioned to him, nor was he apprised of the
consequences of his plea. Under the holdings of this
Court, petitioner was deprived of rights essential to a fair
hearing under the Federal Constitution. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S.45 (1932); Williams v. Kaiser, 323 U. S.
471 (1945); Tomkins v. Missouri, 323 U. S.485 (1945);
White v. Ragen, 324 U. S. 760 (1945); Hawk v. Olson,
supra. See Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942).
