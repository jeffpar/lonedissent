UNITED STATES v. THAYER-WEST POINT
HOTEL CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 106.

Argued December 20, 1946.-Decided January 20, 1947.

The Act of March 30, 1920 authorized the Secretay of War to lease
land on a military reservation for the construction and operation
of a hotel. The Act provided that the lease should contain a provision for "just compensation" to the lessee for the construction of
the hotel, etc., upon termination of the lease. A lease was entered
into pursuant to the Act; the hotel was constructed and operated
for a time. Later the Secretary cancelled the lease. Held:
1. The Court of Claims is precluded by § 177 (a) of the Judicial
Code from including interest in its award of "just compensation"
upon the claim of the lessee, since the case was not one of eminent
domain and neither the Act nor the lease contained an express provision for the payment of interest. P. 588.
2. The fact that "just compensation" includes interest in the
eminent domain setting does not necessarily mean that the term
must be given the same scope in other situations. P. 589.
3. References in the Act and in the lkase to "just compensation,"
without more, are not to be construed as an express provision for
the payment of interest. P. 589.
106 Ct. Cl. 60, 64 F. Supp. 565, reversed in part.

Respondent brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover upon a claim arising out of the termination of a
lease executed pursuant to the Act of March 30, 1920.
The Court of Claims allowed recovery and included interest in its award. 106 Ct. Cl.60, 64 F. Supp. 565. This
Court granted certiorari, 329 U. S. 698. Judgment reversed so far as it included interest, p. 591.

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The decision here turns upon the power of the Court
of Claims, in light of § 177 (a) of the Judicial Code,' to
include interest in its award of "just compensation" to
a lessee for the construction of a hotel and other buildings
pursuant to the provisions of the Act of March 30,1920.2
The Act of March 30, 1920, authorizes the Secretary of
War to lease land on the United States Military Reservation at West Point, N. Y., to any person for a term not
exceeding 50 years upon whichto erect a hotel and other
necessary buildings in connection therewith. The lease
is to contain such conditions, terms, reservations and covenants as may be agreed upon and is to provide "for just
compensation to the lessees for the construction of said
hotel, appurtenances, and equipments, to be paid to said
lessees at the termination of said lease."
On October 17, 1924, the Secretary of War duly made
a lease under this Act to one Williams for a period of 50
years. The lease provided, among other things, that it
might be canceled at any time by the Secretary if the lessee
should fail to observe all the covenants and conditions in
the lease. One of the covenants was that the lessee was
to "keep the said hotel open for business every day during
the continuance of this lease, except at such times as permission to close may be given in writing by the Superintendent, U. S. M. A." Upon a cancellation of the lease,
"just compensation" was to be paid to the lessee for the
construction of the hotel, appurtenances and equipment,
and title thereto was to pass at once to the United States.

UNITED STATES v. HOTEL CO.
585

Opinion of the Court.

Similar provisions were made in connection with the termination of the lease on the expiration of the 50-year
term. The lease also set forth numerous restrictions and
requirements as to the operation of the hotel-such restrictions and requirements being primarily for the benefit
of the Military Academy.
The lease was assigned to a corporation and a hotel and
other buildings were subsequently erected. Through a
series of events which need not be detailed here, the respondent took over the leasehold and the hotel properties
in 1930 with the approval of the Superintendent of the
Military Academy. Respondent began operating the
hotel on January 1, 1931, and continued under the terms
of the lease until March 10, 1943.
On January 5, 1943, respondent wrote to the Secretary
of War that conditions then existing made continued operation of the hotel impossible and that to avoid a curtailment of operations or a closing down of the hotel "the
properties should be owned and operated by the Government." It was accordingly suggested that the Secretary
declare the lease forfeited upon the closing of the hotel
by respondent, a default contemplated by the lease. The
Secretary agreed to this proposal. The respondent then
gave notice of its intention to close the hotel on the morning of March 10, 1943. The agents of the Secretary immediately took over the possession, management and operation of the hotel on March 10 and shortly thereafter the
Secretary declared the lease annulled.
The parties were unable to agree on the amount of "just
compensation" due under the lease. Respondent then
brought this suit in the Court of Claims, praying for a
judgment in the sum of $1,932,000. That court found
that the "total of just compensation to the plaintiff for
construction of the hotel, its appurtenances, and equipments, is therefore $867,682, as of March 10, 1943." 106

329 U. S.

Ct. Cl.60, 80, 64 F. Supp. 565, 568. The court then added
interest at the rate of 4% per annum from March 10, 1943,
to the date of payment as "additional allowance to make
compensation a just one as of the date of payment." The
sole question before us concerns the propriety of adding
the 4% interest from March 10, 1943.
The pertinent part of § 177 (a) of the Judicial Code
provides that "No interest shall be allowed on any claim
up to the time of the rendition of judgment by the Court
of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for
the payment of interest . . ." Section 177 (a) thus embodies the traditional rule that interest cannot be recovered
against the United States upon unpaid accounts or claims
in the absence of an express provision to the contrary in
a relevant statute or contract. Tillson v. United States,
100 U. S. 43, 47; United States v. North American Co.,
253 U. S. 330, 336; United States v. Goltra, 312 U. S. 203,
207. This rule is inapplicable, however, where the United
States takes property under its power of eminent domain;
in such cases it has consistently been held that the Fifth
Amendment's reference to "just compensation" entitles
the property owner to receive interest from the date of the
taking to the date of payment as a part of his just compensation. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, 261
U. S. 299, 306; Brooks-Scanlon Corp. v. United States,
265 U. S. 106, 123; Phelps v. United States, 274 U. S. 341,
344.
Since it is clear in the instant case that the United.
States did not exercise its power of eminent domain and
that there was no taking of the hotel properties in the
legal sense, we can put to one side the eminent domain
situation. There is nothing more here than an ordinary
contractual relationship between the United States and
the respondent. That relationship was voluntarily entered into by respondent's predecessor and was severed at
respondent's suggestion. The Government's liability to

pay for the construction of the hotel properties was fixed
by the Act of March 30, 1920, and by the lease, not by the
Constitution. The sole issue thus becomes whether there
is any express provision in the Act or in the lease permitting the recovery of interest under the circumstances.
Only if there is such a provision can respondent avoid the
traditional rule set forth in § 177 (a).
Respondent's claim in this respect rests upon the references in the Act and in the lease to the payment of "just
compensation" for the construction of the hotel, appurtenances and equipment. "Just compensation," it is said,
is to be given the same meaning here as in the case of a
taking under the power of eminent domain, thereby entitling respondent to the full value of the properties down
to the date of payment. From this viewpoint, the Court
of Claims could use interest at the rate of 4% as the
measure of the value of the use of the hotel properties from
the time when the Government took possession on March
10, 1943, to the time of payment and include such interest
as a component part of just compensation. The conclusion is reached that the term "just compensation," as used
in the Act and in the lease, constitutes an express provision for interest so that the bar of § 177 (a) is removed.
We cannot agree.
The fact that "just compensation" includes interest in
the eminent domain setting does not necessarily mean that
the term must be given the same scope in other situations.
United States v. Goltra, supra. It may or it may not
imply an obligation to pay interest. For example, interest
conceivably may not be contemplated where the term
refers to compensatory damages for a tort or a breach of
contract, or where it has reference to the price to be paid
for the exchange or sale of property at a future date.
Hence, in the absence of constitutional connotations, "just
compensation" is not a term of art so far as interest is

concerned. The inclusion or exclusion of interest depends
upon other contractual provisions, the intention of the
parties and the circumstances surrounding the use of the
term.
But in order to override the historical rule codified in
§ 177 (a), something more is necessary than an equivocal
use of the term "just compensation." It is not enough
that the term might be construed to include the payment
of interest. As § 177 (a) itself indicates, there must be a
provision in the contract "expressly stipulating for the
payment of interest." That provision must be affirmative, clear-cut, unambiguous; and an unexpressed intention by the parties that the term "just compensation" be
construed to include interest is insufficient. Likewise,
where a statute is relied upon to overcome the force of
§ 177 (a), the intention of Congress to permit the recovery
of interest must be expressly and specifically set forth in
the statute. Tillson v. United States, supra, 46; United
States ex rel. Angarica v. Bayard, 127 U. S. 251, 260. Mere
use of the term "just compensation," without more, is no
substitute for an express provision for interest.
Here neither the Act of March 30, 1920, nor the lease
under which respondent operated contains an express provision for the payment of interest, either in addition to or
as a part of the "just compensation" to be paid to respondent. If the United States had desired to provide by statute
or to contract in the lease for the payment of interest, it
would have been easy to have said so in express terms.'
Because it did not say so, we are led irresistibly to the conclusion that it did not intend to negative., the effect of
§ 177 (a) in this instance. Tillson v. United States,
supra.
$Congress has expressly provided for the payment of interest in

other instances. See Judicial Code, § 177 (b), 28 U. S. C. § 284 (b);
Contract Settlement Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 649, 654, § 6 (f), 41 U. S. C.,

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

Nos. 97 and 98.

Argued January 6, 7, 1947.-Decided February

3, 1947.
1. A release filed by a land-grant railroad pursuant to § 321 (b) of
the TranspOrtation Act of 1940, as a condition to collecting commercial rates on transportation for the Government, extinguishes

the right of the railroad to select lands in lieu of lands originally
acquired under the Act of 1866 in aid of construction but relinquished under the Acts of 1874 and 1904. Pp. 596-597.
2. Congress intended by the 1940 Act that a release filed pursuant
thereto should bar any future claims arising out of any or all of the
land-grant acts, so far as such claims arise from originally granted,
indemnity or lieu lands. P. 598.
153 F. 2d 305, reversed.

Respondent railroad company brought two suits in the
District Court to compel the Secretary of the Interior to
determine respondent's right to "lieu" lands, without regard to a release filed by respondent pursuant to § 321 (b)
of the Transportation Act of 1940. The District Court
dismissed the complaints on the merits. 57 F. Supp. 984.
The Court of Appeals reversed. 80 U. S. App. D. C. 360,
153 F. 2d 305. This Court granted certiorari. 328 U. S.
