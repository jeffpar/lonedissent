CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

Nos. 97 and 98.

Argued January 6, 7, 1947.-Decided February

3, 1947.
1. A release filed by a land-grant railroad pursuant to § 321 (b) of
the TranspOrtation Act of 1940, as a condition to collecting commercial rates on transportation for the Government, extinguishes

the right of the railroad to select lands in lieu of lands originally
acquired under the Act of 1866 in aid of construction but relinquished under the Acts of 1874 and 1904. Pp. 596-597.
2. Congress intended by the 1940 Act that a release filed pursuant
thereto should bar any future claims arising out of any or all of the
land-grant acts, so far as such claims arise from originally granted,
indemnity or lieu lands. P. 598.
153 F. 2d 305, reversed.

Respondent railroad company brought two suits in the
District Court to compel the Secretary of the Interior to
determine respondent's right to "lieu" lands, without regard to a release filed by respondent pursuant to § 321 (b)
of the Transportation Act of 1940. The District Court
dismissed the complaints on the merits. 57 F. Supp. 984.
The Court of Appeals reversed. 80 U. S. App. D. C. 360,

Lawrence H. Cake argued the cause and filed a brief for
respondent.
delivered the opinion of the Court.
In the first half of the Nineteenth Century the United
States acquired a vast new area of sparsely populated lands
in the South and West. Settlement and absorption of
this territory into the older part of the country became
a national problem which demanded for its solution a more
rapid and extensive means of transportation of goods and
people than was provided by wagons, stagecoaches, and
waterways. The building of railroads largely provided
the answer. They made it possible for the frontier homesteads and communities to be established on the lands of
the new territory and yet maintain live contact with the
national economy and culture. To encourage a rapid railroad building program, Congress chose to make public
grants of a large proportion of the new lands to underwrite
and subsidize the participation of private individuals and
privately owned companies in the program.1 In this congressional program of land grants "in aid of construction"
were sown the seeds of the present lawsuit.
Enormous areas of public lands were granted railroads,
almost equal to the acreage of the New England States,
New York and Pennsylvania combined. Execution of
the land-grant program was marked by innumerable complex and unforeseen difficulties; its course has been beset
by claims and counterclaims asserted by and between

settlers, railroads, and Government.' Congress, the executive agencies, and the courts have been repeatedly called
upon to help resolve these conflicting claims. The lapse
of nearly a century since the program was instituted has
not resolved all of them. This lawsuit requires consideration of old and recent congressional efforts to settle these
persistently recurring controversies.
One substantial field of railroad-government controversy has been the terms of the original land-grant acts
which required the railroads to carry government goods
and personnel free of tolls. By reason of judicial interpretation of these terms, as supplemented by periodic legislation,' land-grant railroads for more than half a century
immediately prior to 1940 transported for the Government
at one-half of the standard commercial rates. During the
depression years beginning in the late 1920's and immediately following, railroad earnings declined considerably,
and a movement began to relieve the roads of their landgrant rate obligations. Studies by some governmentselected agencies recommended legislation for outright
repeal of the provisions for rate concessions to the Government.' Bills to accomplish this in the 75th and 76th
Congresses failed to pass. But § 321 of the Transpor3

tation Act of 1940 7 provided that land-grant roads could,
by compliance with specified conditions,8 collect from the
Government full commercial rates, except for the transportation of military and naval freight and personnel. In
brief, it required that a railroad, to qualify for full rates,
must execute, within a year after passage of the Act, a
release of any claim it might have "against the United
States to lands, interests in lands, compensation, or reimbursement on account of lands or interests in lands which
have been granted, claimed to have been granted, or which
it is claimed should have been granted to such carrier or
any . . . predecessor in interest under any grant to such

Section 321 (b) provides that

"If any carrier by railroad . ..or any predecessor in interest, shall
have received a grant of lands from the United States to aid in the
construction of any part of the railroad operated by it, the provisions
of law with respect to [reduced rate] compensation for such a transportation shall continue to apply to such transportation as though
subsection (a) of this section had not been enacted until such carrier
shall file with the Secretary oi the Interior, in the form and manner
prescribed by him, a release of any claim it may have against the
United States to lands, interests in lands, compensation, or reimbursement on account of lands or interests in lands which have been
granted, claimed to have been granted, or which it is claimed should
have been granted to such carrier or any such predecessor in interest
under any grant to such carrier or such predecessor in interest as
aforesaid. Such release must be filed within one year from the date
of the enactment of this Act. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring any such carrier to reconvey to the United States
lands which have been heretofore patented or certified to it, or to
prevent the issuance of patents confirming the title to such lands as
the Secretary of the Interior shall find have been heretofore sold
by any such carrier to an innocent purchaser for value or as preventing the issuance of patents to lands listed or selected by such carrier,
which listing or selection has heretofore been fully and finally approved
by the Secretary of the Interior to the extent that the issuance of
such Datents may be authorized by law."

carrier or such predecessor in interest as aforesaid."
(Italics supplied.)
Shortly after passage of this Act respondent took advantage of it, and gave the Government a release framed substantially in the words of the statute. Its predecessor in
interest had obtained a grant of lands in Arizona and New
Mexico, under an Act of 1866 containing the usual governmental rate-concession terms. 14 Stat. 292, 297.10 The
1866 Act had specifically recited that if the Government,
because of prior settlement of part of the granted lands by
homesteaders, could not give possession to some of the
lands granted to the railroad, it could select, under the
direction of the Secretary of the Interior, other public
lands in lieu 6f them as an indemnity. Respondent had
large outstanding claims against the Government for these
"indemnity" lands when it signed the release and concedes
that the release extinguishes these claims.

and existing by virtue of an Act of Congress approved March 3, 1897
(29 Stat. 622), with office and principal place of business at New York,

of Part II of Title III of the Transportation Act of 1940, and the rules
and regulations issued thereunder by the Secretary of the Interior,
relinquishes, remises and quitclaims to the United States of America
any and all claims of whatever description to lands, interests therein,
compensation or reimbursement therefor on account of lands or interests granted, claimed to have been granted, or claimed should have
been granted by any act of the Congress to Santa Fe Pacific Railroad
Company or to any predecessor in interest in aid of the construction
of any portion of its railroad.
"This release does not embrace the rights of way or station grounds
of this company, lands sold by the company to innocent purchasers
for value prior to September 18, 1940, lands embraced in selections
made by the company and approved by the Secretary of the Interior
prior to September 18, 1940, or lands which have been patented or

But it had other so-called lieu land claims against the
Government which it asserts were not extinguished. The
railroad urges that these claims are not covered by the Act
or by the release. They, allegedly, are not claims "on
account of" or "under any grant" of lands, but rest on con-

tractual exchanges of lands made under the Acts of 1874
and 1904. 18 Stat. 194; 33 Stat. 556. These Acts largely
represented a congressional effort to settle conflicts among
railroads, Government, and settlers, which arose by reason
of settlement by homesteaders on railroad-granted lands
after the grants had been made. Both Acts provided that
where settlers had so occupied railroad-granted lands, the
railroad could, upon relinquishment of its title to them,
select other lands in lieu of them. The procedure for
selecting the lieu lands under the 1874 and 1904 Acts was
substantially identical to the original procedure provided
by the Acts for selection of indemnity lands. Before the
1940 Act respondent had, under the 1874 and 1904 Acts,
relinquished title to the Government to certain lands previously granted. In August 1940, and subsequently in
March 1943, respondent filed applications with the Secretary of the Interior to select its lieu lands. After the respondent signed the release, and because of it, the Secretary rejected the applications. The railroad then filed
this suit in a Federal District Court for relief by injunction
or by way of mandamus to require the Secretary and other
Interior Department officials to pass on its applications
without regard to the release. The District Court dismissed the bill on the merits, holding that the statute and
release barred the claims. It read the 1940 Act as defining
a congressional purpose "to wipe the slate clean of such
claims by any railroad which enjoyed the benefits of the
rate concessions made by the Transportation Act . . ."

ent urges in this Court, that the 1940 Act did not apply to
the type of claims involved here. 80 U. S. App. D. C. 360,
153 F. 2d 305. Importance of the question decided caused
us to grant certiorari.
We agree with the District Court. We think, as it held,
that the Secretary of the Interior's construction of the 1940
Act was clearly right. Therefore, we do not discuss the
Government's contention that, since the Secretary's construction was a reasonable one, it was an allowable exercise
of his discretion which should not be set aside by injunction or relief in the nature of mandamus. See Santa Fe
P. R. R. v. Work, 267 U. S. 511, 517; cf. Santa Fe P. R. R.
v. Lane, 244 U. S. 492.
The respondent argues the case here as though the 1940
Act applied only to claims for "lands under any grant."
The language is not so narrow. It also required railroads
to surrender claims for "compensation, or reimbursement
on account of lands or interests in lands which have been
granted, claimed to have been granted, or which it is
claimed should have been granted . . . under any grant."
(Italics supplied.) This language in itself indicates a
purpose of its draftsmen to utilize every term which could
possibly be conceived to give the required release a scope
so broad that it would put an end to future controversies,
administrative difficulties, and claims growing out of land
grants. Beyond a doubt, the words "compensation" and
"reimbursement" as ordinarily understood would describe
a payment to railroads in money or in kind for the surrender of lands previously acquired by them "under a
grant.""
If they do not have this meaning, their use in
the Act would have been hardly more than surplusage.
And when viewed in the context of the historical controversies and claims under the land grants, the conclusion

Opinion of the Court.

329 U. S.

that the 1940 Act covers claims such as respondent's seems
inescapable.
The legislative history of the Act shows that Congress
was familiar with these controversies. In 1929 it passed
an Act intended to authorize and require judicial determination of land-grant claims of the Northern Pacific Railroad in order finally and completely to set them at rest.
46 Stat. 41. The suit authorized by that Act was tried in
a Federal District Court and was pending in this Court
when the 1940 Act was passed. United States v. Northern
Pac. Ry., 311 U. S. 317. Our decision in it shows the complexity and ramifications of the numerous questions involved in land-grant controversies. Reference to this case
was made by Government officials in urging Congress to
include in the predecessors of the 1940 Act a requirement
that the railroad surrender all claims arising out of land
grants as a prerequisite to any Government rate concessions'
Here, as in the 1929 Act, which applied to the
claims of only one railroad, we think Congress intended
to bar any future claims by all accepting railroads which
arose out of any or all of the land-grant acts, insofar as
those claims arose from originally granted, indemnity or
lieu lands. All the Acts here involved, the Acts of 1866,
1874, 1904 and 1940, relate to a continuous stream of interrelated transactions and controversies, all basically stemming from one thing-the land grants. We think Congress wrote finis to all these claims for all railroads which
accepted the Act by executing releases.
