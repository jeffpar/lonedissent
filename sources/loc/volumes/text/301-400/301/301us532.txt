STONE ET AL., TRUSTEES, v. WHITE, FORMER
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 202 (October Term, 1935). Argued April 29, 1937.-Decided
May 24, 1937.
1. A statutory action for a refund of taxes erroneously collected is
in the nature of a common law action for money had and received
and like it is governed by equitable principles. P. 534.
2. Where the income from a trust, belonging to the sole beneficiary,
was erroneously taxed to and collected from the trustees when it
should have been taxed to the beneficiary, in an action by the
trustees for a refund the collector may set up in defense that the
Government has the right to retain the money, by way of equitable recoupment, although collection from the beneficiary is barred
by the statute of limitations. P. 535.
3. Sections 275 (a), 607 and 609, Revenue Act, 1928, limit the collection of a tax, and prevent the retention of one paid after it is
barred by the ]statute. They preclude, in a suit by the taxpayer
against the collector or the Government, reliance on a claim against
the taxpayer, barred by statute, as a set-off or counterclaim; but
they do not deprive the Government of defenses based on special
equities establishing its right to withhold a refund from the demanding taxpayer. P. 538.
78 F. (2d) 136, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 300 U. S. 643, to review the reversal of a
recovery by the present petitioners in their action against
the Collector of Internal Revenue.

By leave of Court, Mr. J. M. Richardson Lyeth filed a
brief, as amicus curiae, urging reversal of the judgment
below.

STONE v. WHITE.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question for decision is whether the petitioners,
testamentary trustees, who have paid a tax on the income
of the trust estate, which should have been paid by the
beneficiary, are entitled to recover the tax, although the
government's claim against the beneficiary has been
barred by the statute of limitations. The present suit to
recover the tax, brought by petitioners against respondent, the Collector, in the District Court for Massachusetts, resulted in a judgment for petitioners, 8 F. Supp.
354, which was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit, 78 F. (2d) 136. We granted certiorari because of the conflict of the decision below with that of the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, United States v.
Arnold, 89 F. (2d) 246.
Testator, by his will, left property in trust, to pay over
the net income to his wife as sole beneficiary, at such
times and in such amounts as she should deem best, during her natural life. She elected to take the bequest under the will in lieu of her dower or statutory interest. At
that time several circuit courts of appeals had held that
in these circumstances, the income payments to the widow
are annuities purchased by surrender of the dower interest and not taxable as income to her, until they equal the
value of the dower interest. Warner v. Walsh, 15 F. (2d)
367; United States v. Bolster, 26 F. (2d) 760; Allen v.
Brandeis, 29 F. (2d) 363. In conformity to the ruling of
these 'decisions, the beneficiary did not include, in her
1928 tax return, any portion of the income received by
her from the trust. A deficiency against thie trustees
was assessed by the Commissioner before, and was paid
by them, under protest, from income of the trust, after
collection from the beneficiary had been barred by the
statute of limitations. After the statute had run, this
Court held in Helvering v. Butterworth, 290 U. S. 365
(interpreting § 219, Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat.

253, 275, corresponding to §§ 161, 162 of the Revenue
Act of .1928, c. 852; 45 Stat. 791, 838, under which the
present tax was assessed) that the income was taxable to
the beneficiary and not to the trustees.
In the present suit, brought by the trustees to recover
the tax as erroneously collected, the Collector interposed
the defense, sustained by the court below, that the tax
which should have been paid by the beneficiary exceeded
that paid by petitioners, and that, as any recovery would
inure. to the advantage of the beneficiary, the defendant
could set off the tax debt due from her. One judge concurred, denying the right of set off in view of the bar of
the statute, but holding the petitioners not entitled, in
equity and good conscience, to recover.
The action, brought to recover a tax erroneously paid,
although an action at law, is equitable in its function. It
is the lineal successor of the common count in indebitatus
assumpsit for money had and received. Originally an action for the recovery of debt, favored because more convenient and flexible than the common law action of debt,
it has been gradually expanded as a medium for recovery
upon every form of quasi-contractual obligation in which
the duty to pay money is imposed by law, independently
of contract, express or implied in fact. Ames, The History of Assumpsit, 2 Harv. L. Rev. 53; Woodward, Law
of Quasi-Contracts,. § 2.
Its use to recover upon rights equitable in nature to
avoid unjust enrichment by the defendant at the expense
of the plaintiff, and its control in every case by equitable
principles, established by Lord Mansfield in Moses v.
Macferlan, 2 Burr. 1005 (K. B. 1750), have long been
recognized in this Court. See Nash v. Towne, 5 Wall. 689,
'702; Gaines v. Miller, 111 U. S. 395, 397; Atlantic Coast
Line R. Co. v. Florida,295 U. S. 301, 309. It is an appropriate remedy for the recovery of taxes erroneously colleeted, Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137, 156; Cary v.

STONE v. WHITE.

Opinion of the Court.

Curtis, 3 How. 236, 246-250. The statutes authorizing
tax refunds and suits for their recovery are predicated
upon the same equitable principles that underlie an action in assumpsit for money had and received. United
States v. Jefferson Electric Co., 291 U. S. 386, 402. Since,
in this type of action, the plaintiff must recover by virtue
of a right measured by equitable standards, it follows that
it is open to the defendant to show any state of facts
which, according to those standards, would deny the right,
Moses v. Macferlan, supra, at 1010; Myers v. Hurley Motor Co., 273 U. S. 18, 24; cf. Winchester v. Hackley, 2
Cranch 342, even without resort to the modern statutory
authority for pleading equitable defenses in actions which
are more strictly legal, Jud. Code, § 274b; 28 U. S. C.
§ 398.
In the present case it is evident that but a single tax
was due upon the particular income assessed and that
petitioners' demand arises from the circumstance that
the tax was paid from the income by the trustees when it
should have been paid by the beneficiary. If the court.
may have regard to the fact that so far as the equitable.
rights of the parties are concerned petitioners, in seeking
recovery of the tax, are acting for the account of the beneficiary, it would seem clear that the case is not one in
which the petitioners are entitled to recover ex aequo et
bono; for under the construction of the will by the court
below, which we adopt, any recovery in this action will
be income to the beneficiary, and will deprive the government of a tax to which-it is justly entitled and enable the
beneficiary to escape a tax which she should have paid.
It is said that as the revenue laws treat the trustee and
the beneficiary as distinct tax-paying entities, a court of
equity must shut its eyes to the fact that in the realm of
reality it was the beneficiary's money which paid the tax
and it is her money which the petitioners ask the government to return. Formerly, trustee and cestui que. trust

were likewise distinct in the eyes of the law, as they are
today for many purposes. But whenever the trustee
brings suit in a court which is free to consider equitable
rights and duties, his right to maintain the suit may be
enlarged or diminished by reference to the fact that the
suit, though maintained in the name of the trustee alone,
is for the benefit and in the equitable interest of the
cestui.
He can sue to set aside his own voluntary conveyance
and impeach it as a breach of trust known to the transferee, because the action, brought to recover property for
the trust estate, will inure to the advantage of the innocent beneficiary. Wetmore v. Porter, 92 N. Y. 76; Zimmerman v. Kinkle, 108 N. Y. 282, 15 N. E. 407; Atwood
v. Lester, 20 R. I. 660, 665, particularly at 669; 40 Atl.
866, 868, 870; Franco v. Franco, 3 Ves. Jr. 75; American
Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Trusts, § 294.1
His suit to recover a debt due him as trustee, and payable
by him over to the cestui, is subject to the equitable de'fense that the cestui has discharged the claim, McBride
v. Wright, 46 Mich. 265 (Cooley, J.); 9 N. W. 275;

Smith v. Brown, 5 Rich. Eq. (S. C.) 291; American Law
Institute, Restatement of the Law of Trusts, § 328.
That the cestui owes a like amount can be shown by way
of equitable plea in set-off, Campbell v. Hamilton, Fed.
Cas. No. 2,359; Waddle v. Harbeck, 33 Ind. 231, 234;
Ward v. Martin, 3 T. B. Mon. (19 Ky.) 18; Driggs v.
Rockwell, 11 Wend. (N. Y.) 504, 508; Wolf v. Beales,
' It has been held that in such a suit equity will not permit the
grantee to set up the statute of limitations ordinarily applicable to

a suit by the trustee if the trustee can show that the beneficiary,
because of ignorance of the breach of trust or because of disability,
would not have been barred by laches had he brought suit directly.

Opinion of the Court.

6 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 242, 243; Agra & Masterman's Bank
v. Leighton, L. R. 2 Ex. 56, 65; American Law Institute,
Restatement of the Law of Trusts, § 329. In an action
in general assumpsit, this defense may be shown under
the plea of non-assumpsit, compare Winchester v. Hackley, supra.
In such cases equity does not countenance the idle
ceremony of allowing recovery by the trustee only to
compel him to account to the benefciary who would
then have to pay the proceeds to the original defendant.
To avoid this circuity of action a court of equity takes
cognizance of the identity in interest of trustee and
cestui que trust. Likewise here, the fact that the petitioners and their beneficiary must be regarded as distinct
legal entities for purposes of the assessment and collection of taxes does not deprive the court of its equity
powers or alter the equitable principles which govern the
type of action which petitioners have chosen for the
assertion of their claim.
Equitable conceptions of justice compel the conclusion
that the retention of the tax money would not result in
any unjust enrichment of the government. All agree
that a tax on the income should be paid, and that if the
trustees are permitted to recover no one will pay it. It
is in the public interest that no one should be permitted
to avoid his just share of the tax burden except by positive command of law, which is lacking here. No injustice
is done to the trustees or the beneficiary by withholding
from the trustees money which in equity is the beneficiary's, and which the government received in payment
of a tax which was hers to pay. A single error on the part
of the taxing authorities, excusable in view of persistent
judicial declarations, has caused both the underassessment
of one taxpayer and the overassessment of the other.
But the error has not increased the tax burden of
either, for whether the tax is paid by one or the other,

its source is the fund which should pay the tax, and only
the equitable owner of the fund is ultimately burdened.
Cf. United States Paper Assn. v. Bowers, 80 F. (2d) 82.
Since in equity the one taxpayer represents and acts for
the other, it is not for either to complain that the government has taken from one with its right hand, when it has,
because of the same error, given to the other with its left.
Petitioners contend that recovery is precluded by § 275
(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, which bars a "proceeding
in court . . . for the collection" of a tax after the pre-

scribed period, and by §§ 607, 609, which are said to prohibit "credit of an overpayment against a barred deficiency." Section 607 provides that any tax assessed or
paid after the expiration of the period of limitation shall
be considered an overpayment, and § 609 declares that a
credit against a liability, in respect of any taxable year,
shall be void "if any payment in respect of such liability
would be considered an overpayment under section 607."
These provisions limit the collection of a tax, and prevent the retention of one paid after it is barred by the
statute. They preclude, in a suit by the taxpayer against
the collector or the government, reliance on a claim
against the taxpayer, barred by statute, as a set-off, or
counterclaim.. But the demand made upon the trustees
was not barred by limitation and it would be an unreasonable construction of the statute, not called for by its
words, to hold that it is intended to deprive the government of defenses based on special equities establishing its
right to withhold a refund from the demanding taxpayer.
The statute does not override a defense based oil the
estoppel of the taxpayer. R. H. Stearrs Co. v. United
States, 291 U. S. 54, 61, 62. The statutory bar to the
right of action for the collection of the tax does not prevent reliance upon a defense which is not a set-off or a
counterclaim, but is an equitable reason, growing out of

STONE v. WHITE.

Opinion of the Court.

the circumstances of the erroneous payment, why petitioners ought not to recover.
Here the defense is not a counter demand on petitioners,
but a denial of their equitable right to undo a payment
which, though effected by an erroneous procedure, has
resulted in no unjust enrichment to the government, and
in no injury to petitioners or their beneficiary. The government, by retaining the tax paid by the trustees, is not
reviving a stale claim. Its defense, which iiheres in the
cause of action, is comparable to an equitable recoupment
or diminution of petitioners' right to recover. "Such a
defense is never barred by the statute of limitations so
long as the main action itself is timely." Bull v. United
States, 295 U. S. 247, 262; Williams v. Neely, 134 Fed. 1,
13.2 Compare United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Pet. 1, 16,
17; United States v. Ringgold, 8 Pet. 150, 163, 164, where
equitable recoupment against a claim by the government
was allowed notwithstanding the immunity of the government from suit.
