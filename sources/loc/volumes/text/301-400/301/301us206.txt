set forth in this chapter." Clearly there is nothing in
that article as expounded by the Supreme Court of Texas
(Insurance Co. v. Walker, 94 Tex. 473; 61 S. W. 711)
that has any bearing on the question under consideration. The challenged ruling is sound and well supported
by our decisions. 2
5. The conclusion that Pennsylvania law governs the
policy provision requiring notice of claim is supported
not only by the making and delivery of the contract of
insurance in that State, the declaration in the policy that
Pennsylvania law shall govern and petitioner's acceptance
of the insurance according to the terms of the policy
but also by the purpose of the parties to the contract
that everywhere it shall have the same meaning and
give the same protection and that inequalities and confusion liable to result 13from applications of diverse state
laws shall be avoided.

WRITS of certiorari, 300 U. S. 647, to review a judgment reversing a judgment of the District Court in a
suit against the bank to recover the purchase price of
shares of the bank's stock, the sale of which to the plaintiff was alleged to have been induced by fraud.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the
Court.
For some years prior to the occurrences out of which
this litigation arose the defendant bank was doing business in New York City. Being unable to meet current
demands, it closed March 3, 1933. March 13 a conservator was appointed; ' October 16 the comptroller declared

it insolvent and appointed a receiver.2 Later, he assbssed
the stockholders par value of their stock.' May 31, Oppenheimer brought this action in the federal court for the
southern district of New York to recover damages upon
an executed rescission of a sale to him of stock of the
bank by means of fraudulent representations made by its
president and vice president. At the close of the evidence, the parties respectively sought a directed verdict,
and, no request for submission of any issue to the jury
having been made,' the court found the bank not enriched
by the sale, and the president and vice president without
actual or apparent authority to make representations in
connection with the sale, and directed a verdict and entered judgment for the bank. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ordered that judgment for the amount
demanded in the complaint be entered against the bank
collectible out of assets of the receivership after payment
in full of all who were creditors when the bank became
insolvent. 85 F. (2d) 582.
Plaintiff applied for a writ of certiorari, contending
that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that his
judgment is not entitled to rank with other unsecured
creditors' claims and that its ruling conflicts with decisions of other Circuit Courts of Appeals.' Defendant presented its cross-petition asserting that the court erred in

Opinion of the Court.

holding: that plaintiff is entitled to participate in the
distribution of proceeds of assessments on stockholders
collected under 12 U. S. C., § 64; that it may be compelled to take and pay for shares of its own capital stock
in a manner not authorized by 12 U. S. C., § 83; that it
is liable for fraud of its officers in connection with the
sale of shares which were the property of another, the
bank not being enriched by the transaction; and that
plaintiff is entitled to judgment against defendant. This
court granted both petitions.
November 1, 1930, plaintiff purchased 10 shares of the
bank's stock for $15,120. He was induced to buy the
stock by false and fraudulent representations of the president and vice president of the bank. It sent him a bill
for the purchase price. Having considerably more on deposit in the bank, plaintiff sent his check for that amount
drawn on it and payable to its order. A vice president
acknowledged receipt of the check and sent plaintiff a
stock certificate for the shares purchased. His check
marked paid and the bill receipted were returned to him.
Plaintiff received dividends on the stock amounting to
$525 and sold two shares for $2,408. Later, May 6, 1933,
he gave the bank notice of rescission, tendered it the certificate and demanded that his account be credited with
the amount of his payment less the sums he had received
as dividends and from the sale of the two shares. The
bank rejected his demand; he brought this suit for
$12,187 with interest and costs. In addition to a general
denial, defendant's answer set up affirmative defenses of
ratification after knowledge of the fraud and of laches but
at the trial these were abandoned.
Defendant's evidence tended to prove that the stock
was not owned by it but by Harriman Securities Corporation, the shares of which were-held in'trust for the
benefit of the stock of the bank. The bank maintained
in its bond department a "suspense account" in which

were reflected purchases and sales of its own stock made
by it for account of that corporation. The bank lent the
affiliate the sums required for purchasing the stock and
the amounts were charged to the latter. When the stock
was sold the proceeds were credited to the affiliate.
Stock so purchased was taken in the name of Kelly, not
an employee of the bank,- as nominee of the affiliate. The
shares in question were so held. Of the amount paid by
plaintiff $100 was retained by the bank as its commission
for making the sale; the balance was entered in the
suspense account. Plaintiff had no knowledge of any
transactions between the bank and its affiliate; he believed he was dealing with the bank as principal. He
has paid the assessment that the comptroller made
against him as stockholder and has not challe~ged its
validity or sought repayment of any part of it.
1. Defendant maintains that a national bank may not
incur liability to retake shares of its stock sold by it either
as principal or agent.
It cites provisions of Title 12, U. S. C., governing
national banking associations, the substance of which follows. Section 24 (Seventh) limits the business of dealing in securities and stock to purchasing and selling without recourse. Section 56 prohibits withdrawal of capital
by dividends or otherwise. Section 59 permits reduction
of capital by vote of two-thirds of the stock. Section 83
declares that no such association shall make any loan or
discount on the security of its own capital stock nor be
a purchaser or hold its shares unless the security or purchase shall be necessary to prevent loss upon a debt
previously contracted; it requires that the stock so
obtained shall be sold within six months.
Defendant suggests that, save as otherwise definitely
authorized, these provisions require that the outstanding
stock of a national bank shall not be reduced while its
banking operations continue. On that basis it main-

Opinion of the Court.

tains that to enforce rescission would in effect allow a
national bank to repurchase its stock and so to accomplish
by indirection what it may not do directly.
The bank had power to sell the stock in question
whether acquired by it in. accordance with or contrary to
§ 83,1 and whether the stock belonged to it, the affiliate or
a third party.7

As the stock was fully paid in when

originally issued, recovery by the plaintiff would not
violate statutory provisions prohibiting reduction of
capital.' It is to be remembered that plaintiff has fully
paid his statutory liability. The bank's liability does
not differ from what it would be if, instead of shares of
its own stock, it had fraudulently sold to plaintiff bonds
or other investment securities.' It cites § 24 (Seventh)
as construed in Awotin v. Atlas Exchange Bank, 295
U. S. 209. But that decision does not support its contention. There the bank sold bonds and in connection
with the sale agreed with the buyer that at maturity it
would repurchase at par value and accrued interest. We
held the agreement repugnant to § 24 (Seventh) requiring sales to be without recourse. The sale was a valid
executed contract; the bank's promise to repurchase was
forbidden by law and therefore void. The purchaser,
chargeable with knowledge of the statute, could not invoke estoppel. The statutes relied on-by defendant cannot reasonably be construed to forbid rescission of
fraudulent sales by national banks of their own stock.
In the absence of language unquestionably disclosing
that purpose, Congress may not be held to' have so in'Lantry v. Wallace, 182 U. S. 536, 553. Scott v. Deweese, 181 U. S.

tended. There is no evidence of that intention. Defrauded purchasers may rescind fraudulent sales by
national banks of their own capital stock.
2. Defendant maintains that it may not be held liable
for misrepresentations made by its officers when making
the sale to plaintiff. It does not challenge the authority
of its president or vice president to act for it in making
sales of investment securities or stock. Through them it
represented to plaintiff that the shares offered him belonged to an estate, made the sale, obtained his check
for the purchase price, took the amount from his deposit,
issued and sent him a stock certificate. If, as it claimed
at the trial, the shares belonged to its affiliate, the latter
was an undisclosed principal, and plaintiff was entitled to
look to the bank as 'if
acting for itself."0 It is immaterial whether, as between the bank and its affiliate, the
amount obtained from plaintiff belonged to the former
or was received by it as agent for the latter.
3. Defendant maintains that the proceeds of assessments may not be charged.with the claim of a rescinding
shareholder.
It argues that, the bank being insolvent and in receivership, the recovery cannot be had from the assets of
the bank and will of necessity come out of the money
paid by shareholders. It calls attention to § 64 which
declares that stockholders shall be held individually
responsible for all "contracts, debts, and engagements"
of the bank.
But that contention misconstrues the judgment directed-below. It is to be "collectible out of the assets of
the receivership after payment in full" of others. Manifestly the asets referred to are not limited to assessments
collected from stockholders but include assets passing
from the bank to the receiver. The phrase quoted from

OPPENHEIMER v. HARRIMAN BANK.

Opinion of the Court.

§ 64 relates to the liability of stockholders enforceable
upon finding of insolvency, appointment of receiver and
assessment by the comptroller, and not to provability or
rank of claims. His determination as to the necessity
and amount of assessments against shareholders is conclusive upon them and immune from collateral attack. 1
The bank may not in this suit invoke the rights of stockholders to defeat plaintiff's claim against it.
Moreover, the quoted provision was enacted for the
protection of the public dealing with national banks and
should be reasonably construed in favor of claimants
against them. To give full effect to the purpose of Congress a liberal construction is required. A. technical or
narrow view would be inconsistent with the true intent
and meaning of the measure. There is nothing in the
purpose or context of the statute to detract aught from
the significance that fairly may be attributed to the words
used. They are broad enough to include all pecuniary
liabilities and obligations of the bank. Indeed, that is a
well-recognized meaning of the word- "engagement."
Plaintiff's claim is for the money the bank fraudulently
got from him and used in its business. Clearly that liability is covered by the phrase "contracts, debts and en!gagements." 12 The construction for which the defendant
contends cannot be sustained.
4. There remains the question whether plaintiff's judgment is entitled to share equally in the receivership estate with other unsecured creditors' claims.
In 1930 when the bank by false representations sold
him the stock and by that means obtained the price out
of his deposit it immediately became bound to make res" See Forrest v. Jack, 294 U. S. 158, 162, and cases cited.

titution. 1" ' The fraudulent sale was subject to rescission
by the plaintiff at any time before the bank closed.
Neither lapse of time while plaintiff remained ignorant
of the fraud nor insolvency of the bank detracted from
its liability. We assume that after March 3, 1933, the
bank was without means Sufficient to meet current demands and that its debts exceeded the value of its assets
plus the statutory liability of its stockholders. After the
appointment of a conservator, but some months before
the comptroller declared the bank insolvent, plaintiff rescinded and brought this suit. He claims no lien, preference, or priority but merely seeks to share in the estate
as do other unsecured creditors.
While stockholders' liability may not be enforced before insolvency and assessment by the comptroller, we
assume, without deciding, that plaintiff's position is the
same as if the bank's insolvency had been declared and a
receiver appointed before he rescinded. Plaintiff appeared by the bank's records to be a stockholder and,
as against creditors for whose benefit the statutory liability was created, was estopped from denying that
status. 4 Recognizing that the bank's fraud and his
rescission availed nothing against the comptroller's assessm'ent, plaintiff paid the amount laid against him. The
judgment he seeks would establish his right to have the
bank pay, because wrongfully obtained from his deposit,

the amount for which this suit is brought. And, having
fully paid his liability to the creditors, there is no reason
why his claim should be subordinated to claims of stockholders on account of their deposit balances when the
bank failed. The record shows that plaintiff then had a
substantial amount on deposit. The bank does not claim
that, in respect of deposits or other indebtedness, stockholders are not entitled to distribution on the same basis
as are non-stockholding creditors. There is no foundation for any such rule. Subscription price having been
fully paid to the bank, the maximum for which stockholders may be held for the benefit of creditors is the
par value of their shares. By payment of the comptroller's assessments they fully discharge their liability
as stockholders. And as claimants they stand on the
same footing as other creditors. 15 Discrimination against
their claims is not authorized by the statute. It follows
that plaintiff's judgment is entitled to rank on a parity
with other unsecured creditors' claims."6
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be
reversed and the case will be remanded to the district
court for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.
