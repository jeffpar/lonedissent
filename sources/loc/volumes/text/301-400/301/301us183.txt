BOURJOIS, INC. v. CHAPMAN

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE.

No. 534. Argued March 5, 1937.-Decided April 26, 1937.
1. A state law requiring, as a health measure, that cosmetic preparations be registered before being offered for sale in the State,
which applies only to those who deal in or -apply the preparations
within the State, and which does not demand that the application for registration be made by the manufacturer or proprietor but permits any person interested to make it, does not
infringe the rights, under the commerce clause, of one whose
preparations are manufactured in another State'and there sold
to customers who deal in or apply them in the State requiring the
registration. P. 186.
2. A state inspection fee will, not be adjudged a direct burden on
interstate commerce where not unreasonable on its face and where,
because of the recent adoption of the regulation involved, it is
impossible to know whether it will yield in excess of the administrative requirement. P. 187.
3. Where interstate commerce is only indirectly affected, the burden
of proving that state inspection fees will actually burden such
commerce rests upon him who challenges the legislation. The
mere fact that the fees imposed might exceed the cost of inspection
is immaterial. P. 187.
4. A state statute imposing fees for the enforcement of a regulation
affecting but one class of activity, the fees and expenditures being
entered in a separate account, presents no question under the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 188.
5. A Maine statute requires that cosmetics offered for sale in the
State be registered, penalizes sale without registration, and empowers a Board to "regulate or to refuse the issuance of certificates of registration or to prohibit the sale of cosmetic
preparations which in its judgment contain injurious substances
in such amounts as to be poisonous, injurious or detrimental to
the person." Held:
(1) It will not be assumed, as a basis for attack under the
Fourteenth Amendment or the state constitution, that one who
has not applied for it will be refused a certificate, or that the
- Board will deny any right to which he is entitled. P. ISS.

(2) The delegation of power to the Board is not obnoxious to
the state constitution or the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 189.
(3) Due process is safeguarded by a provision of the statute

for judicial review when the Board refuses a certificate. Id.

seizure and forfeiture of unregistered cosmetics violate the constitution of Maine does not arise in the case of a manufacturer
whose goods are disposed of to others in another State before
they enter Maine. P. 190.

APPEAL from a decree of the District Court, of three
judges, dismissing the bill in a suit to enjoin enforcement
of a statute requiring registration of cosmetic preparations offered for sale, etc.
Mr. Asher Blum, with whom Messrs. Hugo Mock and
Robert Hale were on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. Ralph W. Farris, Assistant Attorney General of
Maine, with whom Messrs. Franz U. Burkett, Attorney
General, and Clyde R. Chapman were on the brief, for
appellees.
MR. JusTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Bourjois, Inc., a New York corporation, brought, in
.the federal court for Maine, this suit seeking to enjoin,
both temporarily and permanently, the enforcement of
Chapter 109 of the Public Laws of Maine, 1935, entitled
"An Act for the Regulation of Cosmetics." The bill was
filed before January 1, 1936, the effective date of the Act.
The Attorney General of Maine, the Commissioner of
Health and Welfare and the Director of Public Health
were made defendants. The answers denied the material allegations of the bill. The case was heard before
three judges; the application for a temporary injunction
was denied, on the ground that plaintiff's objections were
prematurely raised; and leave was granted to renew its

motion if in enforcing the Act interstate commerce should
be interfered with or due process denied. Thereafter,
a supplemental bill and answer were filed; the case was
again heard; the court concluded that there was both
federal and equitable jurisdiction; denied a motion for
a temporary injunction; and entered a final decree dismissing the bill. The case is here on appeal.
Section 1 of the Act provides:
"Registration of cosmetics. On and after January 1,
1936 no person, firm, corporation or copartnership shall
hold for sale, sell, offer for sale, in intrastate commerce,
give away, deal in, within this state, supply or apply in
the conduct of a beauty shop, barber shop, hairdressing
establishment or similar establishment, any cosmetic
preparation unless the said preparation has been registered with and a certificate of registration secured from
the department of health and welfare."
Section 2 declares that the purpose of the Act is to
safeguard the public health; and provides for the issue
of certificates of registration by the department of health
and welfare "to the manufacturer, proprietor, or producer
of any cosmetic preparation." Other sections of the Act
contain elaborate provisions for the seizure and forfeiture of "cosmetic preparations kept or deposited within
the state intended for unlawful sale or use"; and for
imposition of fines upon violators of the statute.
The plaintiff manufactures cosmetics in New York;
has no place of business in Maine; and does not hold,
use, apply, or sell cosmetics within that State. Among its
many customers are some whose places of business are
in Maine; and their purchases are made in part on orders
given in Maine to travelling salesmen of the plaintiff.
But no order so given is binding until approved by the
plaintiff in New York. All shipments to Maine customers are made from New York; and the sales of the

cosmetics in Maine are not made in the original packages, the large containers in which the cosmetics are
shipped from New York. Compare Purity Extract Co.
v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192, 201; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, 248
U. S. 297, 304.
The plaintiff has not applied for a certificate of registration of any of its preparations; and it announces
that it will refuse to do so, because the statute is void
under the Federal and State Constitutions. Sixteen distinct grounds of invalidity are urged with great earnestness. None is well founded. Only a few need to be
discussed.
First. Most prominent is the claim that the legislation
violates the commerce clause. By its terms, the statute
is limited in operation to intrastate commerce. It does
not attempt to prohibit or regulate the introduction of
cosmetics into the State. It is not directed to manufacturers. It applies only to persons who deal in cosmetics,
or apply them, within the State; and the plaintiff does
not do so. No doubt the plaintiff will lose its Maine
customers unless its preparations may be sold there; and
their sale will be prohibited within the State unless the
preparations are registered. But the State does not demand that the application for registration be made by
the manufacturer or proprietor of the preparation. The
def ndants who administer the statute have construed it
as permitting any one interested to make the application. As some -cosmetics may be of a character to injure
the health of the users, the State may prohibit the sale in
intrastate commerce of a preparation unless it has been
found, upon due enquiry, to be harmless. The fact that
plaintiff's products are made in New York does not confer immunity from such regulation in Maine. Compare
Mutual Film Corp. v. Hodges, 236 U. S. 248, 258; Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, 240 U. S. 510, 517; Pacific
States Box & Basket Co. v. White, 296 U. S. 176, 184.

Opinion of the Court.

There is no discrimination against interstate commerce,
since the regulation applies equally to all preparations,
whether manufactured within or without the State of
Maine.
Second. The plaintiff contends that its interstate commerce is directly burdened, because registration, which
is indispensable to the maintenance of its trade in Maine,
involves payment of a fee; that only an inspection fee
can be justified; and that the State has failed to show
that the fee charged is not in excess of the cost of inspection. Section 2 of the statute fixes the initial fee
at 50 cents per preparation, with a similar annual renewal fee; and stipulates that:
"Fees received under the provisions of this act shall be
used by said department for carrying out the purposes of
this act."
Even if it had been necessary, under the rules applied in
Foote & Co. v. Stanley, 232 U. S. 494, and Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Washington, 300 U. S. 154, for the State to
establish that the fees here charged are not excessive, the
State must be deemed to have sustained that burden.
The fact that the fee for registration is only 50 cents suggests that it may prove inadequate rather than excessive.
The
case was heard shortly after the statute became operative.
It was obviously impossible then to determine
whether the fees would prove to be in excess of the administrative requirement, and in this situation it is sufficient if it is shown that the charges are not unreasonable
on their face. As was said in Patapsco Guano Co. v.
Board of Agriculture, 171 U. S. 345, 354, "If the receipts
are found to average largely more than enough to pay the
expenses, the presumption would be that the legislature
would moderate the charge." See Red "C" Oil Co. v.
Board of Agriculture, 222 U. S. 380, 393. Here, the statute operates directly only upon intrastate commerce.
Where interstate commerce is only indirectly affected, it
rests upon one challenging the legislation to show actual

undue burden upon such commerce. See Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Tax Commission, 297 U. S.
403. The mere fact that the fees imposed might exceed
the cost of inspection is immaterial. See General Oil Co.
v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211, 231; Texas Co. v. Brown, 258
U. S. 466, 475, 476.
The Maine statute presents no question under the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
such as was dealt with in Great Northern Ry. Co. v.
Washington, supra. The statute provides that the fees
collected shall be devoted solely to the enforcement of
this Act; and the Act directly regulates but one class of
activity. The record shows that the State Treasurer has
set up a separate account to which all cosmetic fees are
credited, and against which are to be charged only the
expense of enforcement. Compare Gundling v. Chicago,
177 U. S. 183, 189; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington,
243 U. S. 219, 237; Texas Co. v. Brown, 258 U. S. 466,
479.
Third. The plaintiff contends that in other respects the
statute violates rights protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Constitution of the State. It objects
that the power conferred upon the board to grant or
deny a certificate is unlimited; that the board has issued
no regulations; and that neither the statute nor the board
has provided for hearing an applicant. The plaintiff has
not applied for a certificate; and it is not to be assumed
that, if it concludes to do so, its application will be refused, or that the board will deny any right to which it
is entitled. See Gundling v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183, 186;
Lehon v. Atlanta, 242 U. S. 53, 56; Smith v. Cahoon,
283 U. S. 553, 562; Highland Farms Dairy v. Agnew,
300 U. S. 608.1 There are also other answers to this con'Compare Dalton Adding Machine Co. v. State Corporation

tention. Section 2 defines the department's control of
registration:
"The said department is authorized to regulate or to refuse the issuance of certificates of registration or to prohibit the sale of cosmetic preparations which in its judgment contain injurious substances in such amounts as to
be poisonous, injurious or detrimental to the person."
Delegation of the power to exercise that judgment is not
obnoxious to the Constitution of Maine. Compare Bangor Railway & Electric Co. v. Orono, 109 Me. 292, 296; 84
Atl. 385; In re Knox County Electric Co., 119 Me. 179,
182; 109 Atl. 898; McKenney v. Farnsworth,.121 Me. 450,
452-454; 118 Atl. 237. And obviously, it contravenes no
provision of the Federal Constitution. Compare United
States v. Grimaud, 220 U. S. 506, 517; Mutual Film Corp.
v. Industrial Commission, 236 U. S. 230, 246; Hall v.
Geiger-Jones Co., 242 U. S. 539, 554; Highland Farms
Dairy v. Agnew, supra. Neither constitution requires
that exercise of such a power be preceded by the adoption
of regulations. And neither constitution requires that
there must be a hearing of the applicant before the board
may exercise a judgment under the circumstances and of
the character here involved. The requirement of due
process of law is amply safeguarded by § 2 of the statute,
which provides:
"From the refusal of said department to issue a certificate
of registration for any cosmetic preparation appeal shall
lie to the superior court in the county of Kennebec or
any other county in the state from which the same was
offered for registration."
Compare Hagar v. Reclamation District No. 108, 111

Fourth. Plaintiff urges that relief should be granted
because the provisions of the statute concerning seizure
and forfeiture of unregistered cosmetics violate the Constitution of Maine. To that claim it is a sufficient answer that if there is a wrongful seizure, it will be of
goods belonging to others. For, as the bill and findings
reveal, no goods of the plaintiff will ever be liable to
seizure, since the plaintiff will have none in Maine. If
under this statute the constitutional rights of others are
violated by an unlawful seizure and forfeiture, they, and
not the plaintiff, must seek the redress. Compare Tyler
v. Judges, 179 U. S. 405, 409, 410; Standard Stock Food
Co. v. Wright, 225 U. S. 540, 550; Dier v. Banton, 262
U. S. 147, 149-150, Hence, we intimate no opinion on
the merits of the point raised by plaintiff.
