MR.

CHIEF

JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This case presents a question of equity pleading in
patent suits.
The suit is for infringement and the question is as to
the sufficiency of what is called the "short" bill of complaint. That is, the bill alleges the issue and ownership
of certain patents, of which profert is made, compliance
with all the requirements of the statute and rules of

MUMM v. DECKER & SONS.

Opinion of the Court.

practice of the Patent Office, and infringement. The bill
does not allege compliance with the requirements of R. S.
4886 and 4887 (35 U. S. C. 31, 32), that is, that the invention, of each of the patents in suit, was not known or
used by others in this country before the inventor's invention or discovery thereof, was not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign
country before his invention or discovery, or for more
than two years prior to his application, and was not in
public use or on sale in this country for more than two
years prior to his application, that the invention had not
been abandoned, and that no application for foreign
patents had been filed more than twelve months prior to
the filing of the application in .this country.
The defendant moved for dismissal of the bill of complaint upon the ground of insufficiency of fact to constitute a valid cause of action in equity. Equity Rule 29.
The District Court granted the motion and directed dismissal subject to leave to amend and, amendment not
having been made, -a final decree was entered, which the
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 86 F. (2d) 77. Because of conflict of decisions in the Circuit Courts of
Appeals, we grantwl certiorari. See Moeller v. Scranton
Glass Co., C. C. A. 3d, 19 F. (2d) 14, sustaining the
"short" bill, and Ingrassia v. A. C. W. Manufacturing
Corp., C. C. A. 2d, 24 F. (2d) 703, to the contrary.1

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

301 U. S.

Prior to the adoption of the Equity Rules in 1912, it
was necessary for the plaintiff to allege not only that he
was the first, original and sole inventor but also compliance with the negative requirements of R. S. 4886 and
4887. Sullivan v. Redfield, 23 Fed. Cas. 357; Blessing v.
Trageser Copper Works, 34 Fed. 753; American Graphophone Co. v. National PhonographCo., 127 Fed. 349, 350,
351, and cases there cited. The present diversity of
opinion has arisen in relation to the true construction of
Equity Rule 25, which provides:
"Hereafter it shall be sufficient that a bill in equity
shall contain, in addition to the usual caption:
"First, the full name, when known, of each plaintiff and
defendant, and the citizenship and residence of each party.
If any party be under any disability that fact shall be
stated.
"Second, a short and plain statement of the grounds
upon which the court's jurisdiction depends.
"Third,"a short and simple statement of the ultimate
facts upon which the plaintiff asks relief, omitting any
mere statement of evidence. ..."
The purpose of the Equity Rules was to simplify equity
pleading and practice, and with respect to the former to
dispense with prolix and redundant averments which had
made equity pleading an outstanding example of unnecessary elaboration. The needed improvement in the
interest of simplicity and conciseness made the test not
what was time-honored in the verbiage of the past but
what was essential to set forth the plaintiff's case. His
statement was required to be "short and simple." The
"ultimate facts" which are to be stated are manifestly
distinguished from evidentiary facts. What are these
"ultimate facts"? They are the facts which the plaintiff
must prove, the facts "upon which the plaintiff asks
relief," not the facts which the defendant must prove in

MUMM v. DECKER & SONS.

Opinion of the Court.

establishing an affirmative defence. No analysis of
Equity Rule 25 can make it other than a requirement that
the plaintiff must concisely set forth the ultimate facts
which are sufficient to constitute his cause of action.
This construction is decisive of the present question.
In a suit for infringement of a patent it is not a part of
the plaintiff's case to negative prior publication or prior
use or the other matters to which R. S. 4886 and 4887
refer. These are matters of affirmative defense. As this
Court said in Cantrell v. Wallick, 117 U. S. 689, 695, 696:
"For the grant of letters patent is prima facie evidence
that the patentee is the first inventor of the device deFcribed in the letters patent and of its novelty. Smith v.
Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co., 93 U. S. 486; Lehnbeuter
v. Holthaus, 105 U. S. 94." The issue of the patent is
enough to show, until the contrary appears, that all the
conditions under which a discovery is patentable in accordance with the statutes have been met. Hence, the
burden of proving want of novelty is upon him who
avers it. Walker on Patents, § 116. Not only is the
burden to make good this defense upon the party setting
it up, but his burden is a heavy one, as it has been held
that "every reasonable doubt should be resolved against
him." Id., Cantrell v. Wallick, supra; Coffin v. Ogden,
18 Wall. 120, 124; Barbed Wire Patent, 143 U. S. 275,
284, 285; Adamson.v. Gilliland,242 U. S. 350, 353. What
must be so completely established by the defendant cannot be regarded as a part of the plaintiff's case which is to
be set forth in his bill under the Equity Rule.
The argument is advanced that it may be salutary as
a practical matter to compel the plaintiff to negative
affirmative defenses under R. S. 4886 and 4887, as it may
sometimes happen that he may not be able to make oath
to that effect. A similar requirement as to possible affirmative defenses might prove to be advantageoqs to a

defendant in other suits than those for patent infringement, but that possibility of benefit does not justify a
departure from the standards of correct pleading. There
is nothing in the Equity Rule which indicates an intention to preserve the anomalous practice of compelling a
plaintiff in a patent suit to allege what he is not required
to prove in order to establish his case.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings
in conformitv with this opinion.
Reversed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 688. Argued April 5, 1937.-Decided April 26, 1937.
1. An allowance by a state court for legal services in foreclosure proceedings, "to be paid in due course of administration," but without
any direction to pay, remains subject to the control of that court
and becomes subject to the control and revision of the bankruptcy
court in subsequent proceedings under § 77B. P. 173.
2. An order of the bankruptcy court disallowing the fee, is not
appealable under § 25a of the Bankruptcy Act as from a judgment
rejecting a claim, nor under § 24a, as from a determination of a

controversy arising in bankruptcy proceedings, but only under
§ 24b, in the discretion of the appellate court. P. 173.
86 F. (2d) 898, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 300 U. S. 649, to review an order dismissing
