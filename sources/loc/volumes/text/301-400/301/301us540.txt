Opinion of the Court.

of Internal Revenue to refund taxes, paid by a testamentary trustee on income of the trust when the amount

refunded would inure to the benefit of the cestui que trust,
who should have paid the tax, now barred by the statute

of limitations.
The testator by his will created a trust to pay over net
income to his widow during her life. She elected to take
under the will in lieu of the interest otherwise allowed by
Pennsylvania law. The refund demanded is for taxes
assessed against petitioner, the trustee, and paid by it
upon the net income paid over to the beneficiary for the
years 1924 to 1926, inclusive, and for the year 1928.
As a result of deficiency proceedings the Board of Tax
Appeals has entered final orders determining that the
amounts paid by the trustee as taxes for those years are
overpayments. The beneficiary paid taxes on the income
paid over to her by the trustee for the years 1924 to 1927
inclusive, but these were afterward refunded to her in
recognition of the rule then followed by several courts of
appeals that in these circumstances the income payments
to the widow are annuities purchased by her surrender of
her dower interest which are not taxable as income to her,
until they equal the value of the dower interest. Warner
v. Walsh, 15 F. (2d) 367; United States v. Bolster, 26 F.
(2d) 760; Allen v. Brandeis, 29 F. (2d) 363. See Stone
v. White, decided this day, ante, p. 532. She paid no tax
on the income for the year 1928.
By our decision in Helvering v. Butterworth, 290 U. S.
365, it was established that the income paid over to the
widow is taxable to her and not to the trustee, and in consequence that the tax, which in this case should have been
paid by the beneficiary, had been erroneously collected
from the trustee. It appears that the total amount of the
taxes which the beneficiary should have paid exceeds the
amount of the refund demanded of the Commissioner,
and that the refund, if allowed, will become a part of the
income of the 'beneficiary.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

301 U. S.

The present petition for mandamus to compel respondent, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to refund to
petitioner the taxes erroneously collected, was dismissed
by the Supreme Court of the District. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the petitioner was not equitably entitled to the refund which, if allowed, would inure
to the benefit of the widow, whose liability for the tax is
barred by the statute of limitations. 66 App. D. C. 64; 85
F. (2d) 230. We granted certiorari, the questions decided by the Court of Appeals being cognate to those considered in Stone v. White, supra.
The government, while supporting the decision of the
court below on the merits, insists that the case is not a
proper one for the use of the extraordinary writ of mandamus, and that the suit should have been dismissed on
that ground. The petition for mandamus ispredicated
upon the determination of the Board of Tax Appeals
that petitioner has made overpayments of taxes for the
specified years. The Board has not ordered a refund. It
could not rightly do so, for its jurisdiction is limited to
the determination of the amount of deficiency or overpayment, Revenue Act of 1928, ยง 272, 322 (d), 507, upon the
petition of the taxpayer to review a deficiency assessment
by the Commissioner. The Board is without authority to
order a refund or a credit, although its decision is res adjudicata as to the questions involved in the computation
and assessment of taxes for which a deficiency is claimed.
Cf. Old 'Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279 U. S. 716,
726-727. When the determination of overpayment by the
Board becomes final, the statute provides that such
amounts shall be refunded or credited, ยง 322 (d), and
upon the Commissioner's failure to comply with the statute, a plenary suit will lie in the district court or the Court
of Claims, for the recovery of any refund to which he is
entitled. See National .Fire Insurance Co. v. United
States, 52 F. (2d) 1011, 1013-1014; James v. United
States, 38 F. (2d) 140, 143; Ohio Steel Foundry Co. v.

GIRARD CO. v. HELVERING.

Opinion of the Court.

United States, 38 F. (2d) 144, 148-149. And in such a
suit the Commissioner may secure a final adjudication of
his right to withhold the overpayment determined by.the
Board, on the ground that other taxes are due from the
taxpayerror that upon other grounds he is not equitably
entitled to the refund. See Stone v. White, supra; Welch
v. Obispo Oil Co., ante, p. 190; Lewis v. Reynolds, 284
U. S. 281; Crocker v. Malley, 249 U. S.223.
In view of what we have just decided in Stone v.
WThite, supra, it is evident that in the circumstances of
this case there is no clear duty of the Commissioner to
refund the tax without securing a final adjudication of
the government's right to retain it, as he may do by interposing an appropriate defense in a suit for the refund.
Where the right of the petitioner is not clear, and the
duty of the officer, performance of which is to be cominanded, is not plainly defined and peremptory, mandamus is not an appropriate remedy. U. S. ex rel. Great
Western R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 294
U. S.50, 61; U. S. ex rel. McLennan v. Wilbur, 283 U. S.
414, 419-420; Wilbur v. U. S. ex rel. Kadrie, 281 U. S.
206, 218-219; Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. New
York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 287 U. S. 178, 203; U. S. ex
rel. Redfield v. Windom, 137 U. S.636, 644. The officer
must be left free, in the performance of official duty, to
decide whether he will perform the act demanded or
secure by appropriate procedure a judicial determination
of the extent of his duty. His decision "is regarded as
involving the character of judgment or discretion," the
exercise of which will not be compelled by mandamus

Hall v. Payne, 254 U. S.343, 347; U. S. ex rel. Riverside
Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, 190 U. S.316, 324, 325; Interstate
Commerce Comm'n v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.,
supra.
It is true that the right to a'writ of mandamus may
turn on equitable considerations, as the court below held.

Statement of the Case.

301 U. S.

U. S. ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, 289 U. S. 352. But to
try petitioner's equitable right to the refund here is to
make the writ of mandamus serve the purpose of an ordinary suit and to depart from the settled rule that the
writ of mandamus may not be employed to secure the
adjudication of a disputed right for which an ordinary
suit affords a remedy equally, adequate, and complete.
See Ex parte Baldwin, 291 U. S. 610, 619; Reeside v.
Walker, 11 How. 272, 292; United States v. Duell, 172
U. S. 576, 582.
As we conclude that the issue is not one which should
be adjudicated in a proceeding for mandamus it is unnecessary to consider the merits and the judgment will
be affirmed without prejudice to any other appropriate
proceeding for the refund of the tax.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS is of

the opinion that the judg-

ment should be reversed.
