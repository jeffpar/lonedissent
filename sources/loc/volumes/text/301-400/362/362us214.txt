OCTOBER TERM, 1959.
Per Curiam.

362 U. S.

McGANN v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 153.

Argued March 3, 1960.-Decided March 21, 1960.

Certiorari dismissed as improvidently granted.

By appointment of the Court, 361 U. S. 803, Thomas
Homer Davis argued the cause and filed a brief for
petitioner.
Theodore George Gilinsky argued the cause for the
United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor
General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Wilkey and
Beatrice Rosenberg.
PER CURIAM.

The writ of certiorari was improvidently granted and
must be dismissed. When the case was brought here, on
the meager documentation which so often is all that is
presented by indigent prisoners seeking review on their
own behalf, we assumed that a question involving the
construction of 28 U. S. C. ยง 2255 called for adjudication.
After argument, it became clear that the question of construction is not appropriately presented by the record
because petitioner's claim upon the merits WaS fully considered and decided below, and we find his challenge of
that action to be so insubstantial as not to have warranted
bringing the case here.
