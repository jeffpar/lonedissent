362 U. S.

THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 278.

Argued April 25-26, 1960.-Decided May 16, 1960.

Since the record does not adequately present the questions tendered
in the petition, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently
granted.

Herbert A. Warren, Jr. argued the cause for petitioner.
With him on the brief were Hilton R. Carr, Jr. and A. C.
Dressler.
Oscar H. Davis argued the cause for the United States.
On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant
Attorney General Wilkey, BeatriceRosenberg and Jerome
M. Feit.
PER CURIAM.

After hearing oral argument, and further study of the
record, we conclude that the record does not adequately
present the questions tendered in the petition. Accordingly the writ is dismissed as improvidently granted.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER,

and MR.

whom MR.

JUSTICE CLARK

JUSTICE HARLAN join.

Considering the volume of cases which invoke the
Court's discretionary jurisdiction-as of today 1,091 such
cases have been passed on during this Term-it would be
indeed surprising if in each Term there were not two or
three instances of petitions which,, after passing through
the preliminary sifting process, did not survive the
scrutiny of oral argument. See the cases collected in
Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, 349 U. S. 70, 77-78, and,

NEEDELMAN v. UNITED STATES.

more recently, Triplett v. Iowa, 357 U. S. 217, Joseph v.
Indiana, 359 U. S. 117, and Phillips v. New York, ante,
p. 456. But this is not one of them. The specific questions which were presented by the petition for certiorari
are not now found to be frivolous nor do they raise disputed questions of fact, nor does the record otherwise
appropriately preclude answers to them. In my view
they call for answers against the claims of the petitioner
and I would therefore affirm the judgment. In view of
the disposition of the case elaboration is not called for.
