& CO. ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 55.

Argued February 20-21, 1961.-Decided May 22, 1961.

In this civil antitrust proceeding, this Court held that acquisition by
the du Pont Company of 23% of the common stock of General
Motors Corporation had led to the insulation from free competition
of most of the General Motors market in automobile finishes and
fabrics and tended to create a monoply of a line of commerce, in
violation of § 7 of the Clayton Act. Therefore, this Court reversed
the District Court's judgment dismissing the complaint and remanded the case to that Court for a determination of the equitable
relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest. 353 U. S.
586. After the taking of further evidence, pertaining mostly to the
tax and market consequences to the shareholders of the two companies, the District Court declined to require du Pont to divest
itself completely of the General Motors stock, as urged by the
Government, and sought to satisfy the requirements of this Court's
mandate by requiring du Pont to transfer its voting rights in most
of the General Motors stock to certain of du Pont's shareholders,
by enjoining the two companies from having any preferential or
discriminatory trade relations with each other and by various other
injunctive provisions designed to prevent du Pont from exercising
any control over the management of General Motors. Held: This
remedy is not adequate, and the District Court is directed to proceed expeditiously to enter a decree requiring du Pont to divest
itself completely of the General Motors stock within not to exceed
10 years from the effective date of the decree. Pp. 318-335.
(a) When a violation of the antitrust laws has been proved, the
initial responsibility to fashion an apptopriate remedy lies with
the District Court, and this Court accords due regard and respect
to the conclusion of the District Court; but this Court has a duty
to be sure that a decree is fashioned which will effectively redress
the violations of the antitrust laws. Pp. 322-325.
(b) Since the decree in this case was fashioned by the District
Court in obedience to the judgment sent to it by this Court after
reversal of the District Court's judgment disimissing the Govern-

ment's complaint, this Court has plenary -power to determine
whether its own judgment was scrupulously and fully carried out.
Pp. 325-326.
(c) In civil proceedings, courts are not authorized to punish
antitrust violators, and relief must not be punitive; but courts are
required to decree relief effective to redress the violations 6nd
restore competition, whatever.the adverse effect of such a decree on
private interests. Pp. 326-328.
(d) In this case, the proposed partial divestiture through the
transfer of voting rights would not be an effective remedy; and,
notwithstanding the adverse tax and market consequences which the
District Court found would result, the Government is entitled to a
decree directing complete divestiturc--a remedy peculiarly appropriate in cases of stock acquisitions which violate § 7 of the Clayton
Act. Pp. 326-333.
(e) The alternative, suggested belatedly by du Pont, that its
General Motors stock be disenfranchised, would not provide effective relief, and it might have undesirable effects on the capital
structure, management and control of General Motors. P. 333.
(f) Th injunctive provisions of the District Court's decree
would not adequately remove the objections to the effectiveness of
its main provision for the transfer of voting rights, and the public
is entitled to the surer, cleaner remedy of complete divestiture.
Pp. 333-334.
(g) Once the Government has successfully borne the considerable burden of establishing a violation of the antitrust laws, all
doubts as to the remedy are to be resolved in its favor. P. 334.
(h) The District Court's decree is vacated in its entirety, except
as to the provisions enjoining du Pont itself from exercising voting
rights in respect of its General Motors stock. Pp. 334-335.
(i) In order that this protracted litigation may be concluded as
soon as possible, the District Court is directed to proceed expeditiously to formulate and enter a decree providing for the complete
divestiture by du Pont of its General Motors stock, to commence
within 90 days, and to be completed within not. to exceed 10 years,
of the effective date of the decree. P. 335.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The United States filed this action in 1949 in the
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
The complaint alleged. that the ownership and use by
appellee E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. of approximately 23 percent of the voting common stock of appellee
General Motors Corporation was a violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. §§ 1, 2, and
of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 18. After
trial, the District Court dismissed the complaint. 126
F. Supp. .235 (D. C. N. D. Ill. 1954). On the Government's appeal, we reversed. We held that du Pont's
acquisition of the 23 percent of General Motors stock
had led to the insulation from free competition of

most of the General Motors market in automobile
finishes and fabrics, with the resultant likelihood, at
the time of suit, of the creation of a monopoly of a
line of commerce, and, accordingly, that du Pont had
violated § 7 of the Clayton Act. United States v. E. I.
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U. S. 586 (1957). 1 We
did not, however, determine what equitable relief was
necessary in the public interest. Instead, we observed
that "[tlhe District Courts . . . are clothed 'with large
discretion to model their judgments to fit the exigencies
of the particular case.' InternationalSalt Co. v. United
States, 332 U. S. 392, 400-401," and remanded the cause
to the District Court "for a determination, after further
hearing, of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate
in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the
acquisition offensive to the statute." 353 U. S., at
607-608.
On remand, the District Court invited the Government
to submit a plan of relief which in its opinion would
be effective to remedy the violation. The court also
appointed two amici curiae to represent the interests of
General Motors .and du Pont shareholders, respectively,
most of whom, of course, had not been made parties to
this litigation. The Government submitted a proposed
plan of relief. That plan included diverse forms of
injunctive relief, but its principal feature was a requirement that within 10 years the du Pont company completely divest itself of its approximately 63 million
General Motors shares. The Government proposed that
about two-thirds of these shares be distributed pro rata
to the generality of du Pont shareholders in the form of
dividends over the 10-year period. The other one-third
of du Pont's General Motors holdings-stock which
' Since a holding that the Clayton Act had been violated sufficed
to dispose of the case, we did not decide whether du Pont had also
violated the Sherman Act. See 353 U. S., at 588, note 5.

would have gone to appellees Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty and Investment Company,
holding companies long identified with the du Pont
family itself-were to go to a court-appointed trustee, to
be sold gradually over the same 10-year period. Du Pont
objected that the Government's plan of complete divestiture entailed harsh income-tax consequences for du Pont
stockholders and, if adopted, would also threaten seriously to depress the market value of du Pont and General
Motors stock. Du Pont therefore proposed its own plan
designed to avoid these results. The salient feature of
its plan was substitution for the Government's proposed
complete divestiture of a plan for partial divestiture in
the form of a so-called "pass through" of voting rights,
whereby du Pont would retain all attributes of ownership
of the General Motors stock, including the right to
receive dividends and a share of assets on liquidation,
except the right to vote. The vote was to be "passed
through" to du Pont's shareholders proportionally to
their holdings of du Pont's own shares, except that
Christiana and Delaware would "pass through" the votes
allocable to them to their own shareholders. The amici
curiae also proposed plans of compliance, substantially
equivalent to the du Pont plan. The amicus representing the generality of du Pont shareholders proposed in
addition a program of so-called "take-downs," by which
du Pont shareholders would be allowed to exchange their
du Pont common stock for a new class of du Pont "Special
Common," plus their pro rata share of du Pont-held
General Motors common stock.
The District Court held several weeks of hearings.
The evidence taken at the hearings, largely of expert
witnesses, fills some 3,000 pages in the record before us,
and, together with the numerous financial charts and
tables received as exhibits,"bears mainly not on the competition-restoring effect of the several proposals, but

rather on which proposal would have the more, and which
the less, serious tax and market consequences for the
owners of the du Pont and General Motors stock. The
District Court concluded that although ". . . there is no
need for the Court to resolve the conflict in the evidence
as to how severe those consequences would be[, t]he
Court is persuaded beyond any doubt that a judgment of
the kind proposed by the Government would have very
serious adverse consequences." 177 F. Supp. 1, 42 (D. C.
N. D. Ill. 1959). The court for this reason rejected the
Government's plan and adopted the du Pont proposal,
with some significant modifications. The "pass through"
of voting rights, for example, was so limited that neither
Christiana, Delaware, nor their officers and directors (plus
resident members of the latter's families), should be able
to vote any of the du Pont-held General Motors stock;
General Motors shares allocable to the two companies or to
their officers and directors, or to the officers and directors
of du Pont, or to resident members of the families of the
officers and directors of the several companies, were to
be sterilized, voted by no one. Du Pont, Christiana, and
Delaware were forbidden to acquire any additional General Motors stock. Du Pont and General Motors might
not have any preferential or discriminatory trade relations or contracts with each other. No officer or director
of du Pont, Christiana, or Delaware might also serve as
an officer or director of General Motors. Nor might
du Pont, Christiana, or Delaware nominate or propose
any person to be a General Motors officer or director, or
seek in any way to influence the choice of persons to fill
those posts. The Government objected that without
a provision ordering complete divestiture the decree,
although otherwise satisfactory, was inadequate to redress
the antitrust violation, and filed its appeal here under § 2
of the Expediting Act, 15 U. S. C. § 29. We noted
probable jurisdiction. 362 U. S. 986 (1960).

A threshold question-and one which, although subsidiary, is most important-concerns the scope of our
review of the District Court's discharge of the duty
delegated by our judgment to formulate a decree. In
our former opinion we alluded to the "large discretion" of
the District Courts in matters of remedy in antitrust
cases. Many opinions of the Court in such cases observe
that "[t]he formulation of decrees is largely left to the
discretion of the trial court . . . ," Maryland & Virginia
Milk Producers Assn. v. United States, 362 U. S. 458,
473 (1960); "[i]n framing relief in antitrust cases, a
range of discretion rests with the trial judge," Besser Mfg.
Co. v. United States, 343 U. S. 444, 449 (1952); "[t]he
determination of the scope of the decree to accomplish
its purpose is peculiarly the responsibility of the trial
court," United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 340
U. S. 76, 89 (1950); "[t]he framing of decrees should
take place in the District rather than in Appellate
Courts," International Salt Co. v. United States, 332
U. S. 392, 400 (1947). The Court has on occasion said
that decrees will be upheld in the absence of a showing
of an abuse of discretion. See, e. g., Maryland & Virginia
Milk Producers Assn. v. United States, supra, p. 473;
United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 634
(1953); Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341
U. S. 593 (1951); 2 United States v. National Lead Co.,
332 U. S. 319, 334-335 (1947); United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U. S. 173, 185 (1944)2 These
2 In this case, however, a majority of the Court substantially modified the District Court's decree, in spite of expressions of deference
written into the principal opinion.
3 In Crescent Amusement the Court relied in part on the fact that
the district, judge had initially found the violation of law. This
circumstance was said to enhance the deference owed to the district
judge's determination of the measures appropriate to eliminate the
violation, 323 U. S., at 185. This factor is not present in the case
before us.

Opinion of the Court.

expressions are not, however, to be understood to imply
a narrow review here of the remedies fashioned by the
District Courts in antitrust cases. On the contrary, our
practice, particularly in cases of a direct appeal from the
decree of a single judge, is to examine the District Court's
action closely to satisfy ourselves that the relief is effective to redress the antitrust violation proved. "The
relief granted by a trial court in an antitrust case and
brought here on direct appeal, thus by-passing the usual
appellate review, has always had the most careful scrutiny of this Court. Though the records are usually most
voluminous and their review exceedingly burdensome,
we have painstakingly undertaken it to make certain that
justice has been done." International Boxing Club v.
United States, 358 U. S. 242, 253 (1959); see also id., at
263 (dissenting opinion). We have made it clear that a
decree formulated by a District Court is not "subject only
to reversal for gross abuse. Rather we have felt an
obligation to intervene in this most significant phase of
the case when we concluded there were inappropriate provisions in the decree." United-States v. United States
Gypsum Co., supra, p. 89.
In sum, we assign to the District Courts the responsibility initially to fashion the remedy, but recognize
that while we accord due regard and respect to the conclusion of the District Court, we have a duty ourselves
to be sure that a decree is fashioned which will effectively
'redress proved violations of the antitrust laws. The
proper disposition of antitrust cases is obviously of great
public importance, and their remedial. phase, more often
than not, is crucial. For the suit has been a futile exercise if the Government proves a violation but fails to
secure a remedy adequate to redress it. "A public
interest served by such civil suits is that they effectively
pry open to competition a market that has been closed by
defendants' illegal restraints. If this decree accomplishes

less than that, the Government has won a lawsuit and
lost a cause." International Salt Co. v. United States,
supra, p. 401.
Our practice reflects the situation created by the congressional authorization, under § 2 of the Expediting
Act, 4 of a direct appeal to this Court from the judgment
of relief fashioned by a single judge. Congress has deliberately taken away the shield of intermediate appellate
review by a Court of Appeals, and left with us alone the
responsibility of affording the parties a review of his
determination.5 This circumstance imposes a special
burden upon us, for, as Mr. Justice Roberts said for the
Court, ". . . it is unthinkable that Congress has entrusted the enforcement of a statute of such far-reach4 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 29. The purpose of this
statute was to expedite determination of antitrust cases by allowing

the Attorney General to obtain a special Circuit (now District) Court
of several judges by filing a certificate of public importance under
§ 1 of the Act, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 28 (no such
certificate was filed in this case), and by providing for direct appeal
to the Supreme Court from the decree of the trial court, whether
composed of one or several judges, such appeal to be within this
Court's obligatory jurisdiction. Congress was moved by the "farreaching importance of the cases arising under [the] antitrust
laws . .

In one case this elimination of the normal review by the Court
of Appeals almost prevented there being any review of the District
Court at all. See United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 320
U. S.708 (1943) (noting the absence of a quorum in this Court to
hear -n Expediting Act appeal from a District Court). But Congress
acted to keep such an important matter from going unreviewed, see
H. R. Rep. No. 1317, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. (1944), and enacted a
special statute, 58 Stat. 272, 15 U. S. C.§ 29, pursuant to which
this Court immediately certified the case to a Circuit Court of Appeals, 322 U. S.716 (19.44), which proceeded to decide the appeal.

ing importance to the judgment of a single judge, without
review of the relief granted or denied by him,' HartfordEmpire Co. v. United States, 324 U. S. 570, 571 (1945),
clarifying 323 U. S. 386 (1945).
These principles alone would require our close examination of the District Court's action. But the necessity
for that examination in this case further appears in the
light of additional considerations. First of all, the decree
was fashioned in obedience to the judgment which we sent
down to the District Court after our reversal of that
court's dismissal of the Government's complaint. We
have plenary power to determine whether our judgment
was scrupulously and fully carried out. Chief Justice
Taft, speaking for the Court, said in Continental Ins. Co.
v. United States, 259 U. S.156, 166 (1922), "We delegated
to the District Court the duty of formulating a decree in
compliance with the principles announced in our judgment of reversal, and that gives us plenary power where
the compliance has been attempted and the decree in any
proper way is brought to our attention to see that it follows our opinion." ' Secondly, the record is concerned
mainly with the alleged adverse tax and market effects of
the Government's proposal for complete divestiture.
But the primary focus of inquiry, as we shall show, is
upon the question of the relief required effectively to
eliminate the tendency of the acquisition condemned by
§ 7. For it will be remembered that the violation was
not actual monopoly but only a tendency, towards
"Government counsel at the trial advised the District Court that
he had no authority to suggest modes of divestiture different from
the plan presented by the Government to the District Court. Ap:
pellees suggest that the Government is thus estopped from urging
other modes of divestiture on this appeal. But plainly, under the
rule of Continental Insurance, no stipulation by the Government
could circumscribe this 'Court's power to see that its mandate is
carried out.

OCTOBER TERM, 1960.

366 U. S.

monopoly. The required relief therefore is a remedy
which reasonably assures the elimination of that tendency. Does partial divestiture in the form of the "pass
through" of voting power, together with the ancillary
relief, give an effective remedy, or is complete divestiture
necessary to assure effective relief? Little in the record
or in the District Court's opinion is concerned with that
crucial question. The findings of possible harsh consequences relied upon to justify rejection of complete
divestiture are thus hardly of material assistance in reaching judgment on the central issue. If our examination
persuades us that the remedy decreed leaves the public
interest in the elimination of the tendency inadequately
protected, we should be derelict in our duty if we did not
correct the error.
Before we examine the adequacy of the relief allowed
by the District Court, it is appropriate to review some
general considerations concerning that most drastic,
but most effective, of antitrust remedies-divestiture.
The key to the whole question of an antitrust remedy is
of course the discovery of measures effective to restore
competition. Courts are not authorized in civil proceedings to punish antitrust violators, and relief must not be
punitive. But courts are authorized, indeed required, to
decree relief effective to redress the violations, whatever
the adverse effect of such a decree on private interests.
Divestiture is itself an equitable remedy designed to protect the public interest. In United States v. Crescent
Amusement Co., supra, where we sustained divestiture
provisions against an attack similar to that successfully
made below, we said, at p. 189: "It is said that these provisions are inequitable and harsh income tax wise, that
they exceed any reasonable requirement for the prevention of future violations, and that they are therefore
punitive. . . . Those who violate the Act may hot reap

the benefits of their violations and avoid an undoing
of their unlawful project on the plea of hardship. or
inconvenience."
If the Court concludes that other measures will not be
effective to redress a violation, and that complete divestiture is a necessary element of effective relief, the Government cannot be denied the latter remedy because
economic hardship, however severe, may result. Economic hardship can influence choice only as among two
or more effective remedies. If the remedy chosen is not
effective, it will not be saved because an effective remedy
would entail harsh consequences. This proposition is not
novel; it is deeply rooted in antitrust law and has never
been successfully challenged
The criteria were announced in one of the earliest cases. In United States v.
American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106, 185 (1911), we said:
"In considering the subject . . . three dominant
influences must guide our action: 1. The duty of
giving complete and efficacious effect to the prohibitions of the statute; 2, the accomplishing of this
result with as little injury as possible to the interest
Bills were introduced in the Eighty-sixth Congress to ameliorate
the income-tax consequences of gain on disposition of stock pursuant
to orders enforcing the antitrust laws. See Hearings on S. 200 before
the Senate Committee on Finance, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959):
Hearings on H. R. 8126 before the House Committee on Ways and
Means, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959); H. R. Rep. No. 1128, 86th

of the general public; and, 3, a proper regard for the
vast interests of private property which may have
become vested in many persons as a result of the
acquisition either by way of stock ownership or
otherwise of interests in the stock or securities of the
combination without any guilty knowledge or intent
in any way to become actors or participants in
the wrongs which we find to have inspired and
dominated the combination from the beginning."
The Court concluded in that case that, despite the alleged
hardship which would be involved, only dissolution of
the combination would be effective, and therefore ordered
dissolution. Plainly, if the relief is not effective, there
is no occasion to consider the third criterion.
Thus, in this case, the adverse tax and market consequences which the District Court found would be concomitants of complete divestiture cannot save the remedy
of partial divestiture through the "pass through" of voting rights if, though less harsh, pattial divestiture is not
an effective remedy. We do not think that the "pass
through" is an effective remedy and believe that the
Government is entitled to a decree directing complete
divestiture.
It cannot be gainsaid that complete divestiture is peculh
iarly appropriate in cases of stock acquisitions which
violate § 7.9 That statute is specific and "narrowly

We reject the Government's argument that the Federal Trade

Commission and other administrative agencies charged with the duty
of enforcing the statute are required by § 11 of the Clayton Act to
order divestiture whenever they find a violation of § 7, and that
therefore courts acting under § 15 must give the same relief. Even
if the administrative agencies were so limited, a question which we
do not decide, Congress would not be deemed to have restricted the
broad remedial powers of courts of equity without explicit language
doing so in terms, or some other strong indication of intent. Hecht

sonable to think immediately of the same remedy when
§ 7 of the Clayton Act, which particularizes the Sherman
Act standard of illegality, is involved. Of the very few
litigated12 § 7. cases which have been reported, most
decreed divestiture as a matter of course.1 3 Divestiture
249 U. S. 621 (1919); United States v. Minnesota Mining*& Mfg.
Co., 92 F. Supp. 947 (D. C. D. Mass. 1950), modified, 96 F. Supp.
356 (D. C. D. Mass. 1951); United States v. Imperial Chemical
Indus., Ltd., 100 F. Supp. 504 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1951), decree
entered, 105 F. Supp. 215 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1952).
In many of these cases the courts referred to "dissolution" or
"divorcement" instead of "divestiture." These terms have traditionally been treated as to a large degree interchangeable, and we so
regard them. See Hale and Hale, Market Power: Size and Shape
Under the Sherman Act 370 (1958); Adams, Dissolution, Divorcement, Divestiture: the Pyrrhic Victories of Antitrust, 27 Ind. L. J. 1,
note 1 (1951).
12 Appellees rely on several Clayton Act consent decrees granting
relief short of divestiture, but the circumstances surrounding such
negotiated agreements are so different that they cannot be persuasively cited in a litigation context.
'3 See, e. g., Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Assn. v. United
States, 362 U. S. 458 (1960); Aluminum Co. of America v. Federal
Trade Comm'n, 284 F. 401 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1922), cert. denied, 261
U. S. 616 (1923), modification denied, 299 F. 361 (C. A. 3d Cir.
1924).' United States v. New England Fish Exchange, 258 F. 732
(D. C. D. Mass. 1919), modification denied, 292 F. 511 (D. C. D.
Mass. 1923), on which appellees place great reliance, is not a clear
exception. It is true that defendants there were allowed to retain
the assets (not the stock) of one of the eight corporations whose stock
they had acquired in violation of § 7. But probably acquisition of
only one of those corporations' stock would not have been illegal.
The only clear exception in the courts is American Crystal Sugar Co.
v Cuban-American Sugar Co., 152 F. Supp. 387 (D. C. S. D. N. Y.
1957), aff'd on the defendant's appeal, 259 F. 2d 524 (C. A. 2d Cir.
1958). But the authority of that case is somewhat diminished by
the fact that it was brought not by the Government but by a private
plaintiff, and by the absence of any discussion in the opinion of
the issue of divestiture vel non. See 152 F. Supp., at 400-401 and

has been called the most important of antitrust remedies. 4 It is simple, relatively easy to administer, and
sure. It should always be in the forefront of a court's
mind when a violation of § 7 has been found.
The divestiture only of voting rights does not seem to
us to be a remedy adequate to promise elimination of the
tendency of du Pont's acquisition offensive to § 7. Under
the decree, two-thirds of du Pont's holdings of General
Motors stock will be voted by du Pont shareholdersupwards of 40 million shares. Common sense tells us
that under this arrangement there can be little assurance
of the dissolution of the intercorporate community of
interest which we found to violate the law. The du Pont
shareholders will ipso facto also be General Motors voters.
It will be in their interest to vote in such a way as to
induce General Motors to favor du Pont, the very result
which we found illegal on the first appeal. It may be
true, as appellees insist, that these shareholders will not
exercise as much influence on General Motors as did
du Pont when it held and voted the shares as a block.
And it is true that there is no showing in this record that
the du Pont shareholders will combine to vote together,
or that their information about General Motors' activities will be detailed enough to enable them to vote their
shares as strategically as du Pont itself has done. But
these arguments misconceive the nature of this proceeding. The burden is not on the Government to show
de novo that a "pass through" of the General Motors
vote, like du Pont's ownership of General Motors stock,
would violate § 7. United States v. Aluminum Co. of
America, 91 F. Supp. 333, 346 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1950).
It need only appear that the decree entered leaves a
substantial likelihood that the tendency towards monopoly of the acquisition condemned by § 7 has not

366 U. S.

been satisfactorily eliminated. We are not required to
assume, contrary to all human experience, that du Pont's
shareholders will not vote in their own self-interest.
Moreover, the General Motors management, which over
the years has become accustomed to du Pont's special
relationship, 15 would know that the relationship continues
to a substantial degree, and might well act accordingly.
The same is true of du Pont's competitors. They might
not try so vigorously to break du Pont's hold on General
Motors' business, as if complete divestiture were ordered.
And finally, the influence of the du Pont company itself
would not be completely dissipated. For under the
decree du Pont would have the power to sell its General
Motors shares; the District Court expressly held that
"[t]here would be nothing in the decree to prevent such
dispositions." 177 F. Supp., at 41. Such a sale would
presumably restore the vote separated from the sold stock
while du Pont owned it. This power to transfer the
vote could conceivably be used to induce General Motors
to favor du Pont products. In sum, the "pass through"
of the vote does not promise elimination of the violation
offensive to § 7. What was said of the Sherman Act in
United States v. Union,Pacific R.. Co., 226 U. S. 470, 477
(.1913), applies here: "So far as is consistent with this
purpose a court of equity dealing with such combinations should conserve the property interests involved, but
never in such wise as to sacrifice the object and purpose
of the statute. The decree of the courts must be faithfully executed and no form of dissolution be permitted
that in substance or effect amounts to restoring the

combination which it was the purpose of the decree to
terminate."
Du Pont replies, inter alia, that it would be willing for
all of its General Motors stock to be disenfranchised, if
that would satisfy the requirement for effective relief.
This suggestion, not presented to the District Court, is distinctly an afterthought. If the suggestion is disenfranchisement only while du Pont retains the stock, it would
not avoid the hazards inherent in du Pont's power to
transfer the vote. If the suggestion is permanent loss
of the vote, it would create a large and permanent separation of corporate ownership from control, which would
not only run directly counter to accepted principles of
'corporate democracy, but also reduce substantially the
number of voting General Motors shares, thereby making it easier for the owner of a block of shares far below
an absolute majority to obtain working control, perhaps
creating new antitrust problems for both General Motors
and the Department of Justice in the future. And finally,
we should be reluctant to effect such a drastic change in
General Motors' capital structure, established under state
corporation law.
Appellees argue further that the injunctive provisions
of the decree supplementary to the "pass through" of
voting rights adequately remove any objections to the
effectiveness of the "pass through." Du Pont is enjoined, for example, from in any way influencing the
choice of General Motors' officers and directors, and from
entering into any preferential trade relations with General Motors. And, under IX of the decree, the Government may reapply in the future should this injunctive
relief prove inadequate. Presumably this provision could
be used to prevent the exercise of the power to transfer
the vote. But the public interest should not in this case
be required to depend upon the often cumbersome and

time-consuming injunctive remedy. Should a violation.
of one of the prohibitions be thought to occur, the Government would have the burden of initiating contempt
proceedings and of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that a violation had indeed been committed.16
Such a remedy would, judging from the history of this
litigation, take years to obtain. Moreover, an injunction can hardly be detailed enough to cover in advance
all the many fashions in which improper influence might
manifest itself. And the policing of an injunction would
probably involve the courts and the Government in regulation of private affairs more deeply than the administration of a simple order of divestiture." We think the
public is entitled to the surer, cleaner remedy of divestiture. The same result would follow even if we were in
doubt. For it is well settled that once the Government
has successfully borne the considerable burden of establishing a violation of law, all doubts as to the remedy are
to be resolved in its favor.'
We therefore direct complete divestiture. Since the
District Court's decree was framed around the provision
directing only partial divestiture, and since General
Motors, Christiana, and Delaware acquiesced in its provisions only on that basis, we shall not pass upon the
provisions for ancillary relief but shall vacate the decree

of its General Motors stock. In this way the District
Court will be free to fashion a new decree consistent with
this opinion at a new hearing at which all parties may be
heard. General Motors, Christiana, and Delaware will
thus be able to renew, for the District Court's decision in
the first instance, any objections they may have to the
power of the Court to grant relief against them.
We believe, however, that this already protracted litigation should be concluded as soon as possible. To that
end, we direct the District Court on receipt of our judgment to enter an order requiring du Pont to file within
60 days a proposed judgment providing for complete
divestiture of its General Motors stock, to commence
within 90 days, and to be completed within not to exceed
10 years, of the effective date of the District Court's
judgment, and requiring the Government to file, within
30 days after service upon it of du Pont's proposed judgment, either proposed specific amendments to such
du Pont judgment or a proposed alternate judgment of
divestiture. The District Court shall give precedence
to this cause on its calendar.
The judgment of the District Court, except to the
extent f VI is affirmed, is vacated and remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

of twenty-three percent of the stock of the General

Motors Corporation constituted a violation of § 7 of the
Clayton Act.' The question now before us is the adequacy of the terms of the enforcement of that judgment
by the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, 177 F. Supp. 1. In order to determine. whether the district judge satisfactorily discharged
the duties assigned him, it is necessary to be clear about
these underlying elements of the question for decision:
(1) What did this Court hold and say in finding that
du Pont had violated § 7? (2) What considerations
guided the district judge in fashioning his decree?
(3) What principles has this Court laid down for the
formulation of decrees by District Courts, particularly
under the antitrust laws, and for review of those decrees
here?
I.
As the Court described it, the "primary issue" in the
Government's suit against du Pont, General Motors, and
related parties was "whether du Pont's commanding
position as General Motors' supplier of automotive finishes and fabrics was achieved on competitive merit
alone, or because its acquisition of the General Motors'
stock, and the consequent close intercompany relationship, led to the insulation of most of the General Motors'
market from free competition, with the resultant likelihood, at the time of suit, of the creation of a monopoly
of a line of commerce." 353 U. S., at 588-589. The
question was asked in the context of these facts.
The transaction out of .which the case arose was the
acquisition by du Pont, during the period 1917-1919, of
'38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) § 18. The suit was brought
prior to the enactment in 1950 of amendments to the Act which, by
their terms, are inapplicable to previous acquisitions. 64 Stat. 1125,

a twenty-three percent stock interest in General Motors.
That "colossus of the giant automobile industry" absorbed "upwards of two-fifths of the total sales of
automotive vehicles in the Nation" over the period
from 1938 to 1955. In 1955 it ranked first in sales and
second in assets among all United States industrial corporations. Purchases of automotive fabrics and finishes
by General Motors from du Pont ran into millions of
dollars annually in the years immediately preceding the
institution of the Government's suit in 1949. Du Pont
supplied sixty-seven percent of General Motors' requirements for finishes in 1946 and sixty-eight percent in 1947.
The figures for fabrics supplied to General Motors by
du Pont in those years are fifty-two and three-tenths percent and thirty-eight and five-tenths percent respectively.
*Du Pont's "commanding position as a General Motors
supplier" was not achieved until after its acquisition of
a substantial fraction of General Motors' stock. At the
time of this purchase, du Pont was actively seeking
markets for its nitrocellulose, artificial leather, celluloid,
rubber-coated goods, and paints and varnishes used by
automobile manufacturers. Leading du Pont executives in 1917 and 19.18 indicated that the acquisition of
General Motors stock was due in part to a belief that it
would secure for du Pont an important market for its
automotive products.
"This background of the acquisition, particularly
the plain implications of the contemporaneous documents, destroys any basis for a conclusion that the
purchase was made 'solely for investment.' Moreover, immediately after the acquisition, du Pont's
influence growing out of it was brought to bear
within General Motors -to achieve primacy for
du Pont as General Motors' supplier of automotive
fabrics and finishes." 353 U. S., at 602.

A former du Pont official became a General Motors
vice president and set about maximizing du Pont's share
of the General Motors market. Lines
of communicaI
tions were established between the two companies and
several du Pont products were actively promoted.
Within a few years various du Pont manufactured items
were filling the entire requirements of from four to
seven of General Motors' eight operating divisions. The
Fisher Body division, long controlled by the Fisher
brothers under a voting trust even though General
Motors owned a majority of its stock, followed an independent course for many years, but by 1947 and 1948
"resistance had collapsed" and its purchases from du Pont
"compared favorably" with purchases by other General
Motors divisions. Competitors came to receive higher
percentages of General Motors business in later years,
but it is "likely" that this trend stemmed "at least in
part" from the needs of General Motors outstripping
du Pont's capacity.
"The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record
is that the bulk of du Pont's production has always
supplied the largest part of the requirements of the
one customer in the automobile industry connected
to du Pont by a stock interest. The inference is
overwhelming that du Pont's commanding position
was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained
solely on competitive merit." 353 U. S., at 605.
This Court agreed with the trial court "that considerations of price, quality and service were not overlooked
by either du Pont or General Motors." 353 U. S., at 606.
However, it determined that neither this factor, nor "the
fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both
companies acted honorably and fairly, each in the honest
conviction that his actions were in the best interests of
his own company and without any design to overreach
anyone, including du Pont's competitors," 353 U. S., at

UNITED STATES v.

607, outweighed the Government's claim for relief. This
claim, as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by
it, 126 F. Supp. 235, alleged violation not only of § 7 of the
Clayton Act, but also of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.2
The latter provisions proscribe any contract, combination,
or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade,
and monopolization of, or attempts, combinations, or conspiracies to monopolize, such trade. However, this Court
put to one side without consideration the Government's
appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman Act allegations.3
It rested its decision solely on § 7, which reads in pertinent
part:
"[N]o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part
of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where the effect
of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen
competition between the corporation whose stock is
so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or
community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line
of commerce.
"This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not
using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about,
or in attempting to bring about, the substantial
lessening of competition. . ....
The purpose of this provision was thus explained in the
Court's opinion:
"Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency
not only the substantial lessening of competition from
the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or

any part of the stock of a competing corporation,
but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or
monopolies in a relevant market which, as a reasonable probability, appear at the time of suit likely to
result from the acquisition by one corporation of all
,or any part of the stock of any other corporation.
The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies, or the substantial lessening
of competition, have occurred or are intended ..
353 U. S., at 589.
Thus, a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or
attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court's
decision. Indeed, as already noted, the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved
in the dealings between du Pont and General Motors
acted "honorably and fairly" and exercised their business
judgment only to serve what they deemed the best
interests of their own companies. This, however, did not
bar finding that du Pont had become pre-eminent as a
supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General
Motors; that these products constituted a "line of commerce" within the meaning of the Clayton Act; that
General Motors' share of the market for these products
was substantial; and that competition for this share of
the market was endangered by the financial relationship
between the two concerns:
"The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an
advantage over his competitors from an acquisition
of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute. We repeat, that the test
of a violation of § 7 is whether, at the time of suit,
there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition
is likely to result in the condemned restraints. The
conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such

UNITED STATES

likelihood was proved as to this acquisition ..
353 U. S., at 607.
On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion, the Court remanded the case to the District Court
to determine the appropriate relief. The sole guidance
given the Court for discharging the task committed to
it was this:
"The judgment must therefore be reversed and
the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination, after further hearing, of the equitable
relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest
to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to
the statute. The District Courts, in the framing of
equitable decrees, are clothed 'with large discretion
to model their judgments to fit the exigencies of the
particular case.' International Salt 'Co. v. United
States, 332 U. S. 392, 400-401." 353 U. S., at
607-608.
This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the
District Court.
II.
This Court's judgment was filed in the District Court
on July 18, 1957. The first pretrial conference-held to
appoint amici curiae to represent the interests of the
stockholders of du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings-took place on September 25, 1957. At the outset,
the Government's spokesman explained that counsel for
the Government and for du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief
plan that both sides could recommend to the court.
Du Pont, he said, had proposed disenfranchisement of its
General Motors stock along with other restrictions on
the du Pont-General Motors relationship. The Government, deeming these suggestions inadequate, had urged

OCTOBER TERM, 1960.
FRANKFURTER,

J., dissenting.

366 U. S.

that any judgment include divestiture of du Pont's shares
of General Motors. Counsel for the Government invited
du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a
specific program, but stated that if the court desired, or
if counsel for du Pont thought further discussion would
not be profitable, the Government was prepared to submit
a plan within thirty days.
Counsel for du Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date.
No previous antitrust case, he said, had involved interests
of such magnitude or presented such complex problems
of relief. The submission. of detailed plans would place
the issues before the court more readily than would
discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the
abstract. The Court adopted this procedure with an
appropriate time schedule for carrying it out.
The Government submitted its proposed decree on
October 25, 1957. The plan called for divestiture by
du Pont of its 63,000,000 shares of General Motors
stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders, as
a dividend, over a period of ten years. Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty & Investment
Company, major stockholders in du Pont, and the
stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by
provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee, again
over a ten-year period, of du Pont's General Motors stock
allocable to them, as well as any General Motors stock
which Christiana and Delaware owned outright. If, in
the trustee's judgment, "reasonable market conditions"
did not prevail during any given year, he was to be allowed
to petition the court for an extension of time within the
ten-year period. In addition, the right to vote the General Motors stock held by du. Pont was to be vested in
du Pont's stockholders, other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware; du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring

UNITED STATES v.

stock in or exercising control over General Motors;
du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were to be prohibited
to have any director or officer in common with General
Motors, and vice versa; and General Motors and du Pont
were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified
percentage of its requirements of any du Pont manufactured product, or for the grant of exclusive patent rights,
or for a grant by General Motors to du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of
General Motors, or for the maintenance of any joint
commercial enterprise by the two companies.
On motion of the amici curiae, the court directed that
a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the
Government's plan. On May 9, 1958, the. Commissioner
announced his rulings. The annual dividends paid to
du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock
would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of
du Pont's earnings and profits. The measure, for federal
income tax purposes, of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at
the time of each annual distribution. In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders, the measure would be the
lesser of the fair market value of the shares or du Pont's
tax basis for them, which is approximately $2.09 per
share. The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned
by or allocable to Christiana, Delaware, and the stockholders of Delaware, and deposited with the trustee, would
result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate.
Du Pont's counterproposal was filed on May 14, 1958.
Under its plan du Pont would retain its General Motors
shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the
right to vote those shares. Christiana and Delaware
would, in turn, be required to pass on the voting rights to
the General Motors shares allocable to them to their own

stockholders. Du Pont would be enjoined from having as
a director, officer, or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors, and no
director, officer, or employee of du Pont could serve as a
director of General Motors without court approval. Du
Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General
Motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights to its
stockholders.
On June 6, 1958, General Motors submitted its objections to the Government's proposal. It argued, inter
alia, that a divestiture order would severely depress the
market value of the stock of both General Motors
and du Pont, with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors,
among them thousaiTds of small trusts and charitable
institutions; that there would be A similar decline in the
market values of other automotive and chemical stocks,
with similar losses to ihe stockholders of those companies;
that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock
hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the
efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital; and that all this would
have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market
and on general business activity. General Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would
not be "in the public interest" as required by the mandate
of this Court.
The decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed in
August of 1958. These plans, like du Pont's, contained
provisions for passing the vote on du Pont's General
Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du Pont,
Christiana, and Delaware, except that officers and directors of the three companies, their spouses, and other
people living in their households, as well as other speci-

fled persons, were to be totally disenfranchised. 'toth
plans also prohibited common directors, officers, or
employees between du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware,
on the one hand, and General Motors on the other. Further, both plans placed restrictions on trade relations
between du Pont and General Motors. Amicus Dallstream, representing the du Pont stockholders, proposed
in addition a program termed a "takedown," by which
du Pont would create a new class of stock, "du Pont
Special Common," which would have no rights in
du Pont's General Motors stock and which du Pont stockholders could obtain, along with their allocable portion
of the General Motors shares owned by du Pont, at times
suitable to them, in exchange for their present du Pont
common.- This proposal would have different, and in
several respects more favorable, tax consequences than
those of the Government's plan.4
In a memorandum filed on September 26, 1958, the
Government, on the- assumption that divestiture was
required under the Clayton Act, -suggested various
ways in which its decree might be modified to ameliorate its harsh tax consequences. The Government
stated that it would have no objections to the modifications discussed in the memorandum but it did not submit
amendments to its original proposal.
On the same day, the Government filed a motion for a
preliminary injunction, seeking to restrAin du Pont,
Christiana, and Delaware from exercising their voting
rights in General Motors stock, to prevent du Pont,
Christiana, and Delaware from having any director,
officer, or employee in common with General Motors or
nominating any such person to serve in General Motors,

and to prohibit further acquisitions of General Motors
stock by the three corporations. The Government urged
that since all parties were in substantial agreement on
these measures as the minimum appropriate relief, the
court should adopt them without delay. The court
denied the motion on November 3, 1958, on the ground
that the Government had failed to show a likelihood of
irreparable injury in the absence of immediate relief and
that, with final determination of the case not far distant,
it would be undesirable to begin deciding issues piecemeal
at that late date.
After further preliminaries which need not be recounted,
the trial of the issues on the appropriate relief commenced
on February 16, 1959, and continued to a conclusion on
April 9, 1959. The Government presented its evidence
on twelve hearing days; the defendants and amici also
presented evidence on twelve days; and the Government
took four more hearing days for the presentation of
rebuttal evidence. Briefs were filed and the case was
submitted to the court in June 1959. The court's decision was announced on October 2, 1959.
The printed record of the proceedings below covers
3,340 pages. Of this, trial of the issues pertaining to the
terms of the decree ,fills 2,380 pages. An additional 543
pages contain exhibits. In the course of the trial twentynine witnesses were called by the Government and thirtytwo by the defendants and amici. The printed exhibits
number 193 submitted by the Government, thirty-two
by du Pont, thirty by.General Motors, nine by Christiana
and Delaware, and one by amicus Dallstream. The bulk
of this mass of evidence bore principally upon* disputes
over the market and tax consequences of divestiture of
du Pont's General Motors stock and upon the requirement of resort to this remedy for the effective enforcement
of § 7.

On occasion the Government objected to the attention
that was being focused on the details of its proposed
decree. The Government insisted that its ultimate aim
was not to further a specific plan but to obtain any reasonable order of divestiture. However, late in the trial
the Government indicated that its original divestiture
proposal stood before the court unamended in any detail.
"Mr. Reycraft (chief counsel for the Government): ....
"I might also add that it is rather an obvious
thought that the judgment which we did file was
approved by not only the Assistant Attorney General but the Attorney General, and that while I am
authorized here to represent the Government, I have
no authority to change the decisions they make.
"The Court It is my understandingthen that you
are standing on the decree that you proposed before
this hearing started?

"Mr. Cox (counsel for du Pont): . ...

"... I understand Mr. Reycraft's position now
to be that he stands on the judgment that was filed.
But if the Government should come in on its brief
with a brand new proposal sometime, may it please
the Court, we may find ourselves in a position where
we will have to come into Court and ask for some
kind of an opportunity to have a look at that.
"The Court: That will depend entirely on the
extent or the character of the deviation from the

original proposal.

"The Court: From what Mr. Reycraft has said,
I am assuming that that is the decree, with probably
minor changes.
"Mr. Reycraft: I have nothing further, yoir
Honor." ' (Emphasis added throughout.)
Thus it appears that the Government stood on its original
proposal, rather than on alternative suggestions.
And so one comes to consider how the court dealt with
the issues presentedby the parties.
III.
After disposing of two preliminary questions-ruling in
favor of the amenability of General Motors, Christiana,
and Delaware, as parties not condemned as violators of
§ 7, to the enforcing power of the court, and against the
amenability to direct enforcement of holders of both
du Pont and Delaware stock who were not parties to the
suit-the court thus defined the central issue before it:
"Under the mandate of the Supreme Court it is
the responsibility of this Court to frame a judgment
which will eliminate the effects of du Pont's acquisition of stock of General Motors which are offensive
to the statute. The effect of the acquisition which
the Supreme Court found to be offensive to the
statute was the 'reasonable probability' that the
acquisition might result in restraint or monopolization of the market for automotive fabrics and finishes. 353 U. S. 586, 595, 607, 77 S. Ct. 872, 1 L.
Ed. 2d 1057. Accordingly, the problem before this
Court is one of devising a judgment that will effectively guard against the probability of restraint or
monopolization which the Supreme Court found to
exist." 177 F. Supp., at 12-13.

In discharging its duty under this mandate, particularly since relevant circumstances might offer a choice
between effective alternatives, the court deemed it appropriate not to exclude from consideration the vast
multiform interests at stake-both the hundreds of
thousands of truly innocent stockholders and the bearing
on the national economy of the nature of the disposition
of du Pont's General Motors holdings.
"This does not mean that the private interests of
the stockholders can outweigh the public interest in
a judgment that will effectively dissipate the effects
of the acquisition found to be unlawful. But it does
mean that in the opinion of this Court the primary
public purpose should be achieved so far as possible
without inflicting unnecessary injury upon innocent
stockholders in the various corporations involved.
The purpose of the judgment should be remedial and
not punitive. Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States,
323 U. S. 386, 409, 65S. Ct. 373, 89 L. Ed. 322;
United States v. National Lead Co., 332 U. S. 319,
67 S. Ct. 1634, 91 L. Ed. 2077. No harsh and oppressive consequences should be visited upon the stockholders unless it can be shown on the facts that these
results are inescapable if a decree is to be framed
that will comply with. the mandate of the Supreme
Court. The -cases leave no doubt that these are
considerations which the Court should weigh in the
framing of its final judgment. United States v.

The Government's first major contention-that by the
terms of the Clayton Act the court had no choice but

366 U. S.

to order total divestiture-was rejected on the basis of
an analysis of the statute and this Court's reaffirmation
of the "large discretion" possessed by the District Courts
"to model their judgments to fit the exigencies of
the particular case." The court proceeded to a consideration of the evidence introduced by the parties. The
first subject was the tax impact of the Government's proposed decree. Extensive expert evidence (much of which
was derived from a statistical survey found by the court
to have been soundly and objectively conducted) indicated that individual stockholders of du Pont would pay
income taxes at a rate of fifty percent to sixty percent
under the Government's plan, and that the taxes payable by such persons could amount to $1,000,000,000
if the value of the General Motors shares were $50 per
share, and approximately $770,000,000 if $40 per share.
The capital gains tax on the sale of the General Motors
stock allocable to Christiana and Delaware would be
perhaps as much as $200,000,000. The court determined
that variations of the Government's plan would also
result in vast tax levies. It found, for example, that if
a single distribution were employed to dispose of the
63,000,000 General Motors shares, at an assumed market
value of $45 per share the total tax cost would be
$588,044,000.
A second economic consequence of the Government's
divestiture scheme would be its impact on the market
value of the securities involved. The Government relied
on three types of evidence to show that its plan would
have little influence on the market prices of General
Motors and du Pont stock. The first type was expert
testimony that there was a regular flow of investment
money coming into the market. However, upon detailed
review of the testimony of a dozen witnesses, the court
concluded that "there was no convincing evidence in
this category that any substantial portion of this invest-

UNITED STATES v.

PONT & CO.

351

J., dissenting.

ment money would be directed to buying General Motors
stock at the true value of the stock, if the Government
decree were in effect." 177 F. Supp., at 22. :
The Government's second type of evidence relating
to the market consequences of its decree was the statistical
testimony of academic and professional analysts. The
court noted that it was shown no charts or statistics
relating to a situation "remotely approaching" the forced
sale of 2,000,000 shares of General Motors stock each year
for ten years, attended by additional sales of both General
Motors and du Pont stock for tax and other purposes.
Further, it found that one Government expert admitted
he would defer to the judgment of investment bankers
in the matter of the price for which the General Motors
stock could be sold; another testified that in the past an
increase in stock supply of twenty percent had been associated with price declines of between ten and fifteen percent; the testimony of another Government witness was
based on inadequately drawn statistical tables, and his
demeanor on the witness stand deprived his evidence of
credibility; a fourth witness' opinions had no foundation
in factual evidence.
The Government third type of evidence related to
securities offerings in the recent past. The court determined that the circumstances of these offerings-i. e.,
their background, magnitude, timing, and durationmade them dissimilar to a divestiture of du Pont's
interest in General Motors. In any event most of these
offerings did have a depressing effect on the market value
of the stock involved. None of this evidence, the court
found, gave assurance that the Government proposal
would not cause serious loss on the sale of General Motors
and du Pont stock during the divestiture period.
The defendants countered the Government's case
with a variety of evidence. Two experienced underwriters testified that the Government's ten-year divesti-

366 U. S.

ture plan would result in a decline in the value of
General Motors stock of from twenty percent to thirty
percent; that heavy tax sales of du Pont would lower its
price at least twenty-five percent; that distribution of
General Motors stock in lieu of cash dividends would be
even worse from this standpoint; that even an extension
of the divestiture period to twenty years would not prevent declines in the neighborhood of fifteen percent; that
a further loss estimated at from $1.50 to $2 per share sold
in underwriting expense would be incurred by Christiana
and Delaware; and, finally, that the trustee could never
make the sales during the divestiture period anyway,
since he could -not realize a price, in the words of the
Government's proposed final judgment, "sufficiently high
to reflect the fair value and true worth of the stock."
Several trust management executives testified that
because of the tax consequences of the Government's
decree and the difficulties of allocating, equitably the
General Motors shares received as dividends by the trusts,
they, and presumably others in their position throughout
the country, would be forced to make mass sales of du Pont
stock. Executives of several insurance companies and an
investment trust company predicted declines in the value
of General Motors stock and expressed an intention to buy
it for their concerns only at considerably reduced prices.
Many witnesses concurred in the view that the Government's decree would render future financing by
General Motors highly uneconomic and very difficult to
accomplish.
The court then appraised the evidence bearing on possible voting control of General Motors, under a decree of
less than total divestiture, by corporations or individuals
affiliated with du Pont. It determined that the Government's broadest grouping-individuals who were stockholders of Delaware, additional individuals 'named
du Pont, and certain corporations in which both groups

UNITED STATES v. DU PONT & CO.
316

FRANKFURTER,

J., dissenting.

(sixty-tive persons in all) own stock or on whose boards
they sit-would, under the du Pont plan's "pass-through"
of voting rights, aggregate the vote of about eight percent
of the total vote of General Motors. It was unclear to
the court either that this combination had a reasonable
basis in fact or that, even if it did represent a cohesive
block of votes, it was a large enough block to exercise any
real control over General Motors. However, the court
deemed it unnecessary to resolve these questions, since
it intended to frame a decree to guarantee that concerted
action by these stockholders would be precluded.
On the basis of its appraisal of the evidence, the court
reached its essential conclusions. The first question
was what provision to make with respect to du Pont's
63,000,000 shares of General Motors. It determined that
a careful and detailed plan for a "pass-through" of the
votes of these shares to du Pont's stockholders and an
injunction to prevent du Pont and General Motors from
sharing common officers, directors, and employees were
necessary. The court then considered whether title to
the stock, stripped of these vital incidents of ownership.
must also be taken from du Pont, "in order to remove
and to guard against the probability of restraint or
monopolization of trade which was the consequence the
Supreme Court found to be offensive to the statute."
177 F. Supp., at 40. "There is no evidence," it concluded,
"on which the Court could make such a finding." 177
F. Supp., at 40.
"In essence, therefore, what would be left in
du Pont would be the most sterile kind of an investment. The Court notes in this connection that Section 7 of the Clayton Act expressly excludes from its
operation 'corporations purchasing such stock solely
for investment and not using the same by voting or
otherwise' to bring about anti-competitive effects.
There would thus appear to be a recognition on the

366 U. S.

part of Congress that the holding of stock does not
in all instances carry with it the power to bring about
consequences offensive to the statute. The Court
recognizes that the Supreme Court has held that in
the past du Pont has not held its stock in General
Motors solely for investment. This Court is of the
opinion, however, that the divestiture and ancillary
injunctive provisions referred to hereafter will be
effective to assure that hereafter General Motors
stock will be held by du Pont solely for investment.
"In the circumstances, therefore, the Court finds
that there is nothing in the record made in the hearing on relief or in the record in the trial in chief
which would support, even by inference, the conclusion that du Pont's possession of the bare legal
title to General Motors stock, stripped of its right
to vote and of its right to representation on the
Board of General Motors, would create any possibility that the stock would have any influence on
the practices and policies of General Motors or could
be used in any way that would be inconsistent with
the mandate of the Supreme Court." 177 F. Supp.,
at 41.
What was on the other side of the ledger? The evidence indicated that divestiture of legal title would
visit upon thousands of innocent investors adverse
tax and market consequences, always severe even if
varying in detail depending on the variation of the Government's plan. The court concluded that any plan
for divestiture of legal title to du Pont's interest in General Motors would either impair the value of the property
interests involved or impose severe tax consequences on
du Pont's stockholders. Moreover, any plan that pro-.
duced as a by-product the accumulation of vast amounts
of cash by du Pont would have the undesirable result

UNITED STATES v.

of enhancing greatly du Pont's economic power and
position. All this led the court to hold that total divestiture, while unnecessary to remove the anticompetitive
consequences of du Pont's ownership of the General
Motors stock, would impose unfair injury on the stockholders of those companies.
The court dealt with the Government's two objections to its result. The fear that block voting of the
passed-through votes on the General Motors shares by
investors who were related by blood or business interest
would leave control of General Motors in the hands of
du Pont's close associates was met by precluding the stockholders of Christiana and Delaware, as well as other specified persons, from voting their allocable shares of du Pont's
General Motors stock. The objection that retention by
du Pont of any financial stake in General Motors, even
on behalf of its stockholders, would provide incentive to
intercorporate favoritism between the two, while deemed
merely a- "naked suggestion," was answered by providing specific relief against preferential trade relations between du Pont and General Motors. In light of the proof
and of these precautionary prohibitions, the court concluded that to order divestiture of du Pont's title to the
General Motors stock would "constitute a serious abuse
of discretion." 177 F. Supp., at 49.6
6 A summary of the detailed provisions of the decree carrying out
the direction and purposes of the court's opinion follovs.
Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were enjoined from acquiring

additional General Motors stock except as stock or rights might be distributed to them as stockholders by General Motors.
Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, on the one hand, and General
Motors, on the other, were prohibited to have common officers,
directors, or employees. The former three were also. restrained from

as long as du Pont, Christiana, or Delaware own any General Motors
stock, any agreement between them which (1) requires General

The questions presented by this appeal must be considered in the setting of the proceedings, summarized
above, that led to the District Court's conclusions in
formulating its decree. Since the Court rejects the GovMotors to purchase from du Pont a specified percentage of its
requirements of any product (with certain time provisos), or (2)
grants to either concern Axclusive patent rights, or grants to du Pont
preferential rights to make or sell any chemical discovery of General
Motors.
Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were restrained, for the same
period, from entering into any joint business venture with General
Motors and from knowingly holding stock in any business enterprise
in which General Motors holds stock. The same restrictions were
applied to General Motors.
Du Pont was enjoined, again for the stock-holding period, from
dealing with General Motors with respect to du Pont products on
terms more favorable than those on which it is willing to deal with
General Motors' competitors. The same restriction was placed upon
General Motors in its dealings with du Pont.
Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, and their directors and officers,
and the members of the families of their directors and officers who
reside in the same household with them, were enjoined from exercising
their voting rights in General Motors stock owned by them or allocable to them under the decree, and from attempting to influence
anyone voting General Motors stock.
The vote on the General Motors shares owned by du Pont was
ordered "passed through" to the stockholders of du Pont (subject
to the prohibitions of the preceding paragraph), and the notification
and proxy machinery necessary to effectuate this provision was outlined. Provision was made for the appointment of a monitor of these
voting procedures.
A procedure was established whereby du Pont and Christiana
might sell or otherwise dispose of their General Motors stock.
Two separate provisions preserved the right of any party to apply
to the court for modification of the decree in the event of a change
of circumstances (such as the advent of legislative tax relief) and for
further orders necessary for carrying out the judgment.
Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were directed to obtain from

ernment's claim that total divestiture is statutorily
required upon a finding of a 'violation of § 7 of the Clayton
Act, I need say no more about it.
If a District Court is not subject to any statutory
requirement to order divestiture in a § 7 case, is it left
without guidance or direction in fashioning an appropriate decree as a court of equity? Of course not. There
is a body, of authority, both procedural and substantive, by which it is to be guided. It is, however, well
to remember that the wise admonition that general principles do not decide concrete cases has sharp applicability
to equity decrees. Any apparently applicable policy or
rule, abstractly stated, must be related to the specific
circumstances of a particular case in which it is invoked
and applied. Care must be taken to consider phrases
used in relation to the particular facts of" the cases
relied on.
One principle has comprehensive application. It is
that coufts of equity, as this Court advised the District
Court in remanding the case to it to fashion the appropriate relief, "are clothed 'with large discretion to model
their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular
case.'" '353 U. S., at 607-608. This is a commonplace,,
but one of compelling importance. To forget it is to forget equity's special function and historic significance.
The transcendence of this doctrine derives from the recogtheir officers and directors, and their families, written consents to
be bound by the voting restrictions of the judgment.
For the purpose of securing compliance with the judgment, the
Department of Justice was authorized to conduct reasonable inspections of the records and interviews with the employees of du Pont,
Christiana, and Delaware and to apply to the court for similar
privileges as to General Motors upon a showing of good cause.

nition that without it the effort to dispense equal justice
under law would all too often be frustrated. The landmark sentences of Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 321, 329330, express the principles that must guide the chancellor:
"We are dealing here with the requirements of
equity practice with a background of several hundred years of history. . . . The essence of equity
jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to
do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather
than rigidity has distinguished it. The qualities of
mercy and practicality have made equity the instrument for nice adjustment and reconciliation between
the public interest and private needs as well as
between competing private claims ....
If, indeed, equity's characteristic flexibility is deeply
rooted in history, the administration of justice makes
greater demands upon it now than ever before. As business transactions become increasingly complex, they
multiply and complicate the issues presented to courts
even in litigation of ordinary dimensions. How much
more is this true of a suit of the magnitude and reach of
the one before us, with inevitable impact far beyond the
interests of the immediate parties. In such a case we
need to be specially mindful that the purpose of equity
jurisdiction is to adapt familiar principles of law to intricate, elusive, and unfamiliar facts. As one member of
this Court recently put it: "Equity decrees are not like
the packaged goods this machine age produces. They
are uniform only in that they seek to do equity in a given
case." United Steelworkers of America v. United States,

The District Court was duty bound to exercise discretion-which means to weigh contending considerations
and conflicting evidence as a matter of judgment-in
framing a decree to meet the needs of the case. It could
not escape exercising discretion-that is, exercising its
judgment within an area of allowable choice-which this
Court committed to it. Discretion precludes whimsy or
caprice. Discretion means the judicial discretion of a
court of equity. Where precedent or judicial tradition
has established limitations on the chancellor's range of
choice, he must respect them. What limitations confined
the court below? Consideration of the relevant authorities on the formulation of -antitrust decrees becomes
necessary.
First, what was open to consideration in the District
Court? Its overriding concern had to be for the protection of the public interest. It was its duty to hear all
the evidence bearing on that question and in any conflict with-private interests decisively to resolve doubts in
favor of the general welfare. The account of the District Court's procedures, and of the considerations on
which it reached its reflective conclusions, in Parts II
and III of this opinion establishes, I submit, that it
fully conformed to this essential requirement. Although
it considered the Government's case on the likelihood
of block voting of the votes of the General Motors shares
passed through to Delaware and Christiana of doubtful
accomplish this it may require the performance of conditions, may
experiment to determine how best to accomplish its purpose, and
may use either the negative or the positive form of decree."

"Equitable remedies . . .are distinguished by their flexibility, their
uulimited variety, their adaptability to circumstances, and the natural rules which govern their use. There is in fact no limit to their
variety and application; the court of equity has the power of devising its remedy and shaping it so as to fit the changing circumstances
of every case and the complex relations of all the parties."

strength, it sterilized those shares to prevent their being
voted at all. Again, although it found no proof in the
record to support the Government's "naked suggestion"
concerning the probability of future preferential trade
relations between General Motors and du Pont, it constructed a set of prohibitions against such dealing between
the two enterprises. As already noted, the court fashioned
its decree in deference to its conception of its "primary
duty" to devise a judgment "that will effectively guard
against the probability of restraint or monopolization
which the Supreme Court found to exist." 177 F. Supp.,
at 13.
Did the District Court fail in its duty because it deemed
relevant for consideration as one factor in striking the
balance involved in its conclusion the consequences of
divestiture to thousands upon thousands of blameless
stockholders and other so-called private interests? The
decisions of this Court gave full warrant to the District
Court that it did not exceed its discretionary powers in
doing so. The weighty words of United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106, 185, are apposite:
"In considering the subject . . . three dominant
influences must guide our action: 1. The duty of
giving complete and efficacious effect to the prohibitions of the statute; 2, the accomplishing of this
result with as little injury as possible to the interest
of the general public; and, 3, a proper regard for
the vast interests of private property which may
have become vested in many persons as a result of
the acquisition either by way of stock ownership or
otherwise of interests in the stock or securities of the
combination without any guilty knowledge or intent
in any way to become actors or participants in
the wrongs which we find to have inspired and
dominated the combination from the beginning ..
And in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1,

overlooked that injury to the public by the prevention of
an undue restraint on, or the monopolization of trade or
commerce is the foundation upon which the prohibitions
of the statute rest, and moreover that one of the fundamental purposes of the statute is to proteqt, not to
destroy, rights of property." The importance of these
considerations was reiterated in Continental Ins. Co.
v. United States, 259 U. S. 156, with the Government
actively championing their propriety, and suggesting that
"'it seemed wise not to amputate any more than was

This Court's decisions leave no doubt that it was
proper for the District Court to attend to the likelihood
of danger to the public welfare that might arise from
the serious adverse market consequences of divestiture
and to the likelihood of extensive loss to innocent investors through both market decline and tax levy. It is
apparent that the Department of Justice recognized the
relevance of the tax impact. In a statement on proposed
legislation to alleviate the tax burden of divestiture
decrees, Robert A. Bicks, then Acting Assistant Attorney
General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, said:
"Bear in mind, the 1890 Sherman and the 1914 Clayton Acts, the basic antitrust statutes, became law
before the income tax was a reality. And the land"See also United States v. Terminal R. Assn., 224 U. S. 383;

mark antitrust cases-dissolving illegal trusts and
monopolies via divestiture-were largely a product
of an era marked by no income tax or much lower

tax rates. Indeed, there is real basis for concluding that some bench-mark antitrust divestiture
cases . . . might well not have been decreed had

today's tax rates prevailed." Bicks, Statement on

Committee on Ways and Means, July 20, 1959, 4

It is obvious from the context of these remarks that their
immediate objective was to smooth the way toward
obtaining divestiture in this very case.1°
In a case such as du Pont, in which the challenged
transaction occurred approximately thirty years prior to'
the initiation of suit, the force of these considerations
is greatly enhanced. The relationship between General
Motors and du Pont stood uncondemned by the Government through successive administrations throughout that
period. This is riot remotely to hint any form of
estoppel against resort to divestiture as relief for the
illegality, however belatedly established, were it otherwise the required means for correction of past misconduct or its future avoidance. I do maintain that, as
this Court has recognized, it was altogether proper for
the District Court--even incumbent upon it-to take
"account of what was done during that time-the many
millions of dollars spent, the developments made, and the

pending du Pont case. See 4 Antitrust Bulletin, at 561, n. 7, 562,

United States v. United States Steel Corp., 251 U. S.
417, 453.
In short, the factors that influenced the District Court
were fit considerations for judicial scrutiny. But we still
have to inquire what criteria were open to the District
Court for appraising the relevant variables and how that
court's determinations are to be reviewed by this Court.
The very foundation for judgment in reviewing a District Court's decree in a case like this is the inherent
nature of its task in adjudicating claims arising under the
antitrust laws. The sweeping generality of the antitrust
laws differentiates them from ordinary statutes. "As
a charter of freedom," wrote Mr. Chief Justice Hughes
for the Court, "the [Sherman] Act has a generality and
adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in
constitutional provisions." Appalachian Coals, Inc.,
v. United States, 288 U. S. 344, 359-360. This is no
less true of the Clayton Act's prohibition "where the
effect . . . may be to substantially lessen competition."

Correspondingly broad is the area within which a District
Court must move to fit the remedy to the range of the
outlawry. Far-reaching responsibility is vested in the
court charged with fashioning a decree and the decree
it fashions must be judged on review in light of this
responsibility.
"In the anti-trust field the courts have been accorded, by common consent, an authority they have in
no other branch of enacted law.... They would not
have been given, or allowed to keep, such authority
in the anti-trust field, and they would not so freely
have altered from time to time the interpretation of
its substantive pr'qvisions, if courts were in the habit
of proceeding with the surgical ruthlessness that

might commend itself to those seeking absolute
assurance that there will be workable competition,
and to those aiming at immediate realization of the
social, political, and economic advantages of dispersal of power." United States v. United Shoe
Machinery Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295, 348 (a decision
affirmed by this Court without opinion, 347 U. S.
521).
Partly on the basis of these views, the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws
recommended that divestiture "not be decreed as a
penalty," that it "not be invoked where less drastic remedies will accomplish the purpose of the litigation," and
that possible disruption of industry and markets as well
as effect on the public, investors, customers, and employees be taken into account. Report of the Attorney
General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust
Laws (1955), pp. 355-356. This statement fairly reflects
the views of this Court, to the effect that a decree must
not "impose penalties in the guise of preventing future
violations," Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, 323
U. S. 386, 409; that the least harsh of available measures
should be adopted when the Court is satisfied that they
will be effective, e. g., Timken Roller Bearing Co. v.
United States, 341 U. S. 593, 603 (concurring opinion);
and that injunctive relief may well be an adequate sanction against continued wrongdoing, id., at 604 (concurring
opinion), and Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221
U. S. 1, 77. Add to this that we have recognized a sound
basis in reason for distinguishing palpably illegal activity
from conduct that was arguably permissible, and for dealing with the latter less severely than the former. See
Federal Trade Comm'n v. National Lead Co., 352 U. S.
419, 429; United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 340
U. S. 76, 89-90.

The principles thus pronounced by this Court were
duly heeded by the District Court. The salient feature
of' its attitude was its disposition to favor the Government's claims on behalf of the public interest. It
even rejected the defendants' argument, based on
National Lead and Gypsum, supra," that it should take
into account that the question whether the acquisition
violated the law was, to say the least, reasonably in
doubt, and that therefore no blame should be imputed
to the officers and directors of the defendants. "The
Court . . .approaches the problem on the assumption
that the appropriate relief is that which is necessary to
eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the
statute, notwithstanding that the acquisition might
reasonably have been believed to be permissible when
made." 177 F. Supp., at 14.
The Government urges, however, that divestiture is, if
not the required relief, at least the normal and ordinary
relief in stock acquisition cases. The contention is that,
as the safest remedy, i. e., the surest of anticompetitive
results, divestiture is, and lhas been considered to be, the
preferred relief for all save a few exceptional cases. Support for this view is drawn from a long line of cases in
which divestiture has been decreed. The contention
calls for detailed scrutiny.
The objectives of divestiture were thus stated in Schine
Chain Theatres, Inc., v. United States, 334 U. S. 110,
128-129:
"Divestiture or dissolution must take account of
the present and future conditions in the particular
industry as well as past violations. It serves several
functions: (1) It puts an end to the combination or
conspiracy when that'is itself the violation. (2) It

deprives the antitrust defendants of the benefits of
their conspiracy. "(3) It is designed to break up or
render impotent the monopoly power which violates
the Act. . . .2

This tripartite formulation summarizes the considerations that have guided this Court's rulings on divestiture. In Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1,
the source of modern antitrust law, the. defendants
were charged with combination and conspiracy to
restrain trade in and monopolize interstate and foreign
commerce in petroleum products, in violation of §§ 1
and 2 of the Sherman Act. The lower court found both
provisions offended by a combination of seven individual
defendants and thirty-eight corporate defendants to
lodge in the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey substantial
stock ownership of and control over many subsidiary
corporations in the petroleum industry and to cause
Standard Oil to manage their affairs so as to throttle competition, findings sustained here. Coming to the problem of remedy, while acknowledging that "ordinarily"
injunctive relief would be adequate to restrain repetition
of the illegal activity, the Court found that the situation
presented by the Standard Oil aggrandizement called for
stiffer measures: "But in a case like this, where the condition which has been brought about in violation of the
statute, in and of itself, is not only a continued attempt
to monopolize, but also a monopolization, the duty to
enforce the statute requires the application of broader
and more controlling remedies." 221 U.-S., at 77. (Emphasis added.) Recognition of this need-that interFor a similar statement see United States v. Minnesota Mining

corporate connections call for severance when persistence
of the relationship in itself would constitute a violation
of the antitrust laws-has been steadfastly adhered to.
"Dissolution of the combination will be ordered where the
creation of the combination is itself the violation."
United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U. S. 173,
189. It has been the controlling factor in the majority
of the divestiture decrees in the intervening years, since
most situations before the Court have similarly demanded
this relief.13
The second element of the Schine rationale-depriving
antitrust defendants "of the benefits of their conspiracy"-is equally well established. United States v.
Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U. S. 173, was a Sherman
Act suit in which certain motion picture exhibitors were
found to have used their combined buying power to obtain
terms more favorable than those received by their independent competitors in licensing films, whereby independents were driven from the field and a monopoly in
theater operation developed in many towns. Each corporate exhibitor was required to divest itself of its interest
in any other corporate defendant or its affiliates.
"Those who violate the Act may not reap the benefits of their violations and avoid an undoing of their

Court accepted the District Court's finding that " 'The great evil' "
in the case "'was the combination that Wirtz and Norris caused and

unlawful project on the plea of hardship or inconvenience. That principle is adequate here to justify
divestiture of all interest in some of the affiliates
since their acquisition was part of the fruits of the
conspiracy." 323 U. S., at 189.14
The third Schine objective of divestiture was "to break
up or render impotent the monopoly power which violates the Act." The role of divestiture in meeting this
need was spelled out in the Crescent case:
"Common control was one of the instruments in
bringing about unity of purpose and unity of action
and in making the conspiracy effective. If that affiliation continues, there will be tempting opportunity
for these exhibitors to continue to act in combination against the independents. The proclivity in
the past to use that affiliation for an unlawful end
warrants effective assurance that no such opportunity will be available in the future ...
" 323
U. S., at 189-190.
These, then, are the justifiable bases for compelling
divestiture. They explain and define the authorities on
which the Government relies. Do they, or any of them,
invalidate the District Court's refusal to decree divestiture in the circumstances of this case and justify this
Court in overruling that court's exercise of discretion in
finding divestiture uncalled for?
The notion that the very existence of an interest by
du Pont in the stock of General Motors constitutes a
violation of the Act need not detain us. It cannot be
questioned that, as the Court's opinion on the merits
in this case makes clear,- the violation condemned is
the effect of the stockholding on competition, not the

stockholding as such.1 5 To be sure, this illegal tendency to
lessen competition may be ended by terminating any
intercorporate relationship. But just as surely the
unlawfulness of the tendentious stockholding may be
ended by preventing its harmful consequences.
Nor is divestiture required as a means of depriving the
defendant of the fruits of its violation. While du Pont's
interest in General Motors might serve as a tool for the
accomplishment of antitrust violations, it is certainly
not the fruit of any such violation. The fruit-the benefit-of a violation of § 7 is the unfair competitive position
of one corporation through its stock interest in another.
Effective termination of this competitive advantage was
precisely the design of the elaborate .injunctive provisions
devised by the District Court.
The final desideratum-vitiating a monopoly power-is
not literally applicable to the du Pont situation, since
the District Court dismissed the monopoly charge under
the Sherman Act and this Court refused to review the dismissal. 353 U. S., at 588, n. 5. But even if this criterion
were carried over into a Clayton Act setting to enforce the
desirability of avoiding every potentiality of monopoly
power, there is no compulsion to decree divestiture. Such

argumentative power does not preclude restraints, by
injunctive relief, that render it "impotent," to use the language of the Schine case. Nor is there in the record before us any basis in fact for the fears that have evoked the
application of t1' " principle in previous divestiture cases.
There is no finding in this case, as there were in Crescent
and Schine, of a deliberate conspiracy aimed at the
destruction of competition. We cannot point in this case,
as we have on occasion in the past, to any blatantly anticompetitive scheme. See, e. g., United States v. Reading
Co., 253 U. S. 26, 59. Instead we have only the finding
that "there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints," 353
U. S., at 607, i. e., to restrain commerce. Moreover, the
Court explicitly ruled executive misconduct out of the
case-"without any design to overreach anyone, including
du Pont's competitors." 353 U. S., at 607.
Even in the Crescent case, the Court voiced its concern for the future only by way of support for its
conclusion that the District Court's severance of the defendants could not be reversed for abuse of discretion.
323 U. S., at 190. The Court sustained, rather than overturned, the lower court's judgment. To infer that the
Court would have found an abuse of discretion had the
District Court in Crescent limited itself to a decree of
injunctive relief is an unwarranted assumption. But the
Government in effect draws such an inference for the purpose of this case, even though the facts of du Pont's violation do not faintly resemble the offense of the movie
exhibitors in Crescent. When the powerful interests of
James J. Hill and J. Pierpont Morgan coalesce to place
in one controlling parent the stock of the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific Railways, Northern Securities Co. v.

United States, 221 U. S. 1, and United States v. American
Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106; when the rail carriers controlling the means of transportation of anthracite coal combine to destroy a potential competitor, United States v.
Reading Co., 226 U. S. 324, the facts demand the major
surgery of divestiture-destruction of the offending combinations. But to hold that the treatment of these
conscious conspiracies to restrain trade and to achieve
monopoly power is compelling precedent for determining the relief necessary and appropriate to remedy the
only wrong judicially found by this Court under § 7, is
to treat situations flagrantly different as though they
were the same. Surely there is merit to the notion of
shaping the punishment to fit the crime, even beyond
the precincts of the Mikado's palace.
The grounds thus canvassed furnish the. relevant considerations for this Court's review of the District Court's
decree. The obvious must be restated. We do not sit
to draft antitrust decrees de novo. This is a court of
appeal, not a trial court. We do not see the witnesses,
sift the evidence in detail, or appraise the course of
extended argument, session after session, day after day.
(A review of Part III of this opinion abundantly shows
the extent to which the District Court's appraisal of the
credibility of witnesses, analysis of "expert testimony, and
reconciliation of the claims of counsel entered into the
painstaking process that led to the court's views on complicated issues and ultimately to the formulation of its
decree.) In short, this Court does not partake of the
procedure and is not charged with the responsibility
demanded of the court entrusted with the task of devising
the details of a decree appropriate for the governance of
a vastly complicated situation arising out of unique circumstances. By its nature, this Court, as an appellate
tribunal, lacks the means-the procedural facilities-to
evolve a decree in a case like this. For these reasons this

Court sent this case back to the District Court, quoting
in part (353 U. S., at 608), without specific limitation,
the comprehensively general guidelines of an earlier case:
"The framing of decrees should take place in the
District rather than in Appellate Courts. They are
invested with large discretion to model their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case."
International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U- S.
392, 400-401.1"
To tell a trial judge that he has discretion in certain
matters isto tell him that there is a range of choices
available to him. It is to tell him that the responsibility
is his, and that he will not be reveried except for straying outside the permissible range of choice, i. e., for abuse
of discretion. See, e. g., United States v. CrescentAmusement Co., 323 U. S. 173, 189; Timken Roller Bearing Co.
v. United States, 341 U. S. 593, 600-601. In sustaining
the judgment in Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342
U. S. 143, 156, the Court stated its standard for upholding
the trial court's decree as simply that "The decree is reasonably consistent with the requirements of the case and
remains within the control of the court below."

(Empha-

sis in the original.) Certainly we ought not to reverse
the carefully wrought results of a conscientious trial judge
without a showing amounting almost to a demonstration
that he exceeded the fair limits of judicial choice vhich
this Court explicitly reposed in him."
16To

the same effect, see Associated Press v. United States, 326

When a district judge has failed to accord parties
an adequate hearing or has been otherwise wanting in the
administration of fair procedure, there is the best of reasons for this Court to secure for them the full measure of
judicial consideration which they are owed but failed to
receive. But when, as in this case, the comprehensiveness
of the hearing, the full consideration of the issues, both
through evidence and argument, the evident diligence and
searching competence of the judge-reflected throughout
the long hearing-and his care in expounding the reasons
for his judgment demonstrate a deep awareness of the
duty with which this Court. charged him without any
restrictions on his task except that he was entrusted "with
large discretion," reversal of the lower court's result can
be justified only by a showing of patent misconception of
conclusions should not be subject to reversal merel, for gross abuse
of discretion, and that this Court must intervene when the provisions
of the decree are "inappropriate." I could not agree more, eithcr
with these views or with those expressed in the remarks that formed
their preface:
"The determination of the scope of the decree to accomplish its
purpose is peculiarly the responsibility of the trial court. Its opportunity to know the record and to appraise the need for prohibitions
or affirmative actions normally exceeds that of any reviewing court."
340 U. S., at 89.
In Hartford-Empirethe opinion of the Court says "it is unthinkable that' Congress has entrusted the enforcement of a statute of
such far-reaching importance to the judgment of a single judge,
without review of the relief granted or denied by him." 324 U. S.,
at 571. These words, if given the reading they seem most readily to
bear, are certainly unobjectionable, for our power to review the
antitrust relief determinations of trial judges is not in doubt. If
this language is to be read to authorize de novo consideration here of
all the details of a lower court's decree, then it marks a real aberration in this branch of the law. Whatever respect such a view might
once have deserved, it deserves none now, for our recent decisions
have uniformly adopted the principle of appellate deference to trialcourt discretion. See cases cited in notes 7 and 16, supra.

governing law or want of conscientious regard for "the
exigencies of the particular case." When judged by the
relevant decisions and pronouncements of this Court, such
legal defects or inadequacies are impressively disproved by
this record.
It may be suggested that however faithfully the trial
court abided by the other teachings of this Court, it forgot
one, namely, "that relief, to be effective, must go beyond
the narrow limits of the proven violation." United
States v. United States Gypsum Co., 340 U. S. 76, 90.
See InternationalSalt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392,
400. This principle is important but it carries no warrant
for reversal in this case. It has already been pointed out
that the District Court specifically applied this principle
in significant provisions of its decree. This Court found a
danger of restraint of trade only in the market for automobile fabrics and finishes. The District Court nevertheless
extended the injunctive provisions of its decree to all trade
relations between du Pont and General Motors, regardless
of the products involved. This Court proceeded on the
assumption that the officers and directors of the oom•panies had acted honorably and in the best interests of
their respective corporations. Yet the District Court,
responsive to the Government's urging, though without substantial evidence in the record, chose to sterilize
the voting power not only of du Pont's officers and directors, but also of a major block of its large shareholders,
the shareholders of Christiana and Delaware. In fact,
the District Court exceeded the Government's requests in
several substantial respects. This is true with respect to
the injunction against cooperative and preferential business practices between du Pont and General Motors,1 8

nel,1" and the detail of the retention of jurisdiction and
reopening clauses.2"
Moreover, the principle of extending relief beyond the
narrow limits of the violation has an important limiting
corollary. The trial court is not authorized to order
relief which it is without findings to support. "A full
exploration of facts is usually necessary in order properly
to draw such a decrep." Associated Press v. United
States, 326 U. S.1, 22. This Court has unhesitatingly
reversed remedial action by the lower courts, both for
and against the Government, when wanting in supporting findings. See Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States,
323 U. S.386, 418; Schine Chain Theatres, Inc., v. United
States, 334 U. S.110; United States v. Paramount Pictures, 334 U. S.131, 170-174; Hughes v. United States,
342 U. S.353, 357-358: But if findings on questions of
fact, or mixed questions of law and fact, are essential to
the formulation of a decree, it becomes virtually impossible to develop a basis for a divestiture order at this stage
on this record. The District Court found that once all of
du Pont's ties to General Motors, save its stock interest,
were severed the record is barren of justification for an
inference of reasonable probability of restraint of trade.
Conversely, it found that the tax and market consequences of divestiture would be so onerous that, in the
absence of any serious anticompetitive danger, it would
have constituted an abuse of discretion to enter such a
decree. These conclusions were based in significant
measure on the firsthand factual analysis that only a trial
judge is in a position to make. For the Court to require
divestiture, thereby overturning a trial court judgment

founded on an appraisal of voluminous conflicting evidence and opinion, is in effect to displace the trial court's
function as a fact-finder.
The Government suggests that possibly, in "exceptional" cases, some remedy other than divestiture may
suffice, but that this is not the "exceptional" case. If this
is not an "exceptional" case, what would be? Is it really
tenable to regard this an ordinary, a conventional, a runof-the-mill case?
Du Pont began to acquire General Motors stock while
World War I was still in progress. It owned that stock
openly for three decades before this suit was instituted
to challenge the validity of the acquisition. During that
period the number of General Motors and du Pont
stockholders expanded from a few thousand to many hundreds of thousands. The value of the General Motors
stock greatly increased. The tax laws were substantially
changed. The District Court has fashioned a closely knit
network of provisions to prevent preferential dealings
between General Motors and du Pont. So certain was it
that divestiture would, on the basis of its findings, work
great and unjustifiable loss on wholly innocent investors,
that it considered a divestiture order beyond its discretionary power. The precedents of this Court to which
the District Court could look for guidance in the discharge of its duty permitted, at the least, the inferences
(1) that the framing of the decree lay within its discretion, (2) that within the scope of that discretion it was
free to consider all relevant consequences, both public
and private, of the plans proposed, (3) that it was under
no compulsion to order divestiture, (4) that there was
ample reason to avoid a harsh remedy if it were to conclude that a less severe one would be effective, (5) that
both the facts and the formulated reasoning of prior
divestiture cases made them distinguishable from the

du Pont problem, and (6) that unless the District Court
abused its discretion by disregarding this Court's guides
for its decision, its judgment would stand on review. In
the face of all this, it is indeed "exceptional" for this
Court to upset the lower court's judgment that its decree
met the needs established in the proceeding before it.
The essential appeal of the Government's position lies
in its excitation of fear of any intercorporate relationship
between two such colossi as du Pont and General Motors.
It is easy to calm this fear by a requirement of divestiture.
Insofar as the Court yields to that fear, it is strange,
indeed, that this was not obvious to the Court when it
found the illegality for which it directed the District
Court to evolve a corrective remedy. Not a single consideration now advanced by the Court for directing
divestiture was not available when the case was originally
here. For not one of these considerations is based on
evidence elicited at the hearing before the District Court,
directed by this Court, for determining the relief. Such a
limitation on the discretionary decree-fashioning power,
upon full hearing in the District Court, certainly could
not have been in this Court's mind when it remitted that
function to the District Court, otherwise it would have
spoken its mind and not left it all to the "large discretion"
of the court. In any event it requires prophetic confidence to conclude that that decree is so obviously inadequate as to require reversal before it can be tried in practice. Neither the record when the case was first here nor
the facts adduced at the hearing on molding the decree
give warrant for this Court to set aside the trial court's
finding on the improbability of future restraint of trade
in view of the safeguarding terms of the decree. If the
Court were to allow the District Court's maturely considered scheme for protecting the dominant public interest

with less than "surgical ruthlessness" to proceed, time
might show that the relief granted by the District Court
was well based, and that this Court's willingness to give it
a try properly averted reasonably founded fear of serious
economic dislocation.
Reversal by way of commanding divestiture is a "judgment from speculation," carrying with it irreversible
consequences, whereas the District Court's decree leaves
the door open for "judgment from experience," Tanner v.
Little, 240 U. S. 369, 386, under its clauses retaining jurisdiction to modify the judgment in the light of changed
circumstances. Resort to such safety valve clauses is
an established practice in review of antitrust remedies,
for they allow the courts to act on the basis of informed
hindsight rather than treacherous conjecture. In International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392, 401,
the Court enunciated this principle in language pertinent
here:
"The District Court has retained jurisdiction, by
the terms of its judgment, for the purpose of
'enabling any of the parties . . . to apply to the
court at any time for such further orders and directions as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction or carrying out of this judgment' and 'for
the amendment, modifications or termination of any
of the provisions . . . .' We think it would not be
good judicial administration to strike paragraph VI
from the judgment to meet a hypothetical situation
when the District Court has purposely left the way
open to remedy any such situations if and when the
need arises. The factual basis of the claim for
modification should appear in evidentiary form
before the District Court rather than in the argumentative form in which it is before us. ..."

The wisdom of this policy is reflected in many of our
decisions."' Why should it not guide the Court's decision
in this case? The Government's presentation boils down
to an unsubstantiated assertion that any tie between
du Pont and General Motors gravely jeopardizes the play
of competitive forces. When we are asked to assume this,
we are asked to assume that even after a decree fashioned
with the circumspection with which this was, a "reasonable probability" exists that the defendants will, in
a --'holly undefined way, combine to violate the antitrust laws. We are asked, in essence, to enter Alice's
Wonderland where proof is unnecessary and the governing rule of law is "Sentence first, verdict after."
The District Court here concluded that the relief it
devised would dispel all potential restraints upon free
competition as effectively as would divestiture, while
divestiture was likely to cause serious economic disturbance unwarranted by a need for that remedy. Neither
in its procedures nor in its consideration of the data presented to it did the court fail to discharge the obligations
placed upon it by the decisions of this Court and by the
only instruction-to exercise "large discretion"-given it
by the Court in this case. In no way did the District
Court abuse the discretion entrusted to it. Its judgment
should therefore be affirmed.
