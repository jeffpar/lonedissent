SECURITY FLOUR MILLS CO. v. COMMISSIONER
OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH3 CIRCUIT.

No. 276. Argued February 10, 1944.--Decided February 28, 1944.
1. The rule that a taxpayer (on the accrual basis) may not accrue an
expense the amount of which is unsettled or the liability for which
is contingent is applicable to a tax the liability for which he denies
and payment of which he is contesting. P. 284.
2. In 1935 a taxpayer (on the accrual basis) made sales of flour at
prices which included an amount sufficient to cover a federal processing tax. In the same year, the taxpayer obtained a temporary injunction against collection of the tax, on condition that the amount
thereof be deposited pendente lite. In 1936 the tax was held invalid
and the impounded funds were returned to the taxpayer. Held that
payments made by the taxpayer in 1936, 1937 and 1938 to reimburse
customers for the amount of the tax on such sales were not deductible from gross income for 1935. Pp. 283, 285.
3. Section 43 of the Revenue Act of 1934, which requires that deductions be taken for the taxable year in which the amount was paid or
accrued, "unless in order to clearly reflect income the deductions or
credits should be taken as of a different period," does not authorize
or require that deduction of the payments here in question be taken
as of the taxable year 1935. Pp. 284, 287.

CERTioRARI, 320 U. S. 724, to review the reversal of a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 45 B. T. A. 671,
which set aside the Commissioner's determination of a
tax deficiency.

Messrs. Robert C. Foulston and John F. Eberhardt for
petitioner.
Mr. J. Louis Monarch, with whom Solicitor General
Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Samuel 0. Clark, Jr.,
and Messrs. Sewall Key and Bernard Chertcoff were on
the brief, for respondent.
Messrs. J. B. Faegreand Hayner N. Larson filed a brief
on behalf of the Russell-Miller Milling Co., as amicus
curiae,urging reversal.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Circuit Court of Appeals has held 1 that the Board
of Tax Appeals erred in deciding I that the petitioner was
entitled, in reporting its income tax for the year 1935, to
deduct payments made by it in 1936, 1937, and 1938.
Because of a conflict of decision 3 we granted certiorari.
The petitioner, which conducts a flour mill, reports its
net income on the accrual basis. As a first domestic processor of wheat it was subject to the processing tax levied
under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. In the
early months of 1935 it paid processing taxes, and claimed,
and was allowed, the amount so paid as a deduction from
gross income in its federal income tax return for 1935.
The amount thus paid is not involved.
Petitioner instituted a suit to enjoin the collection of
processing taxes, and obtained a temporary injunction enjoining further collection on the condition that pendente

lite it file information returns and pay the amount of the
tax into a depository. From May I to December 31, 1935
petitioner so paid $93,000 and accrued over $9,000 additional upon its books for processing tax for the last month.
It also accrued about $1,000 as a reserve for possible increases in taxes earlier paid. On January 6, 1936, the
taxing provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act were
held unconstitutional by this court. Certain of the petitioner's vendees attempted to intervene in the injunction
suit and to have impounded moneys returned to them.
Petitioner resisted and the court denied the intervention
and made an order directing the depository to pay to the
petitioner the impounded money, which was done February 28, 1936.
The petitioner set up on its books a suspense account
covering the items above mentioned under the title "Reserve for Processing Tax, Claims, etc." The petitioner refunded various sums to its customers, totaling over $45,000 in 1936, 1937, and 1938 to reimburse customers for
processing tax included in the sales price of flour sold them
in 1935 and not paid to the Collector of Internal Revenue
as processing taxes. In its 1935 tax return petitioner deducted from gross income the total of the amounts impounded and accrued but not paid the Collector in the
year 1935 as accrued tax liability. The Commissioner
found a deficiency by disallowing the petitioner's deduction for taxes accrued but not paid in 1935.
The propriety of the claimed deduction depends upon
the construction of §§ 23 (a), 41 and 43 of the Revenue
Act of 1934V Section 23 permits the deduction of ordinary and necessary expenses "paid or incurred during the
taxable year in carrying on any trade or business." Section 41 declares the general rule that the taxpayer's annual accounting period shall be the fiscal year or calendar

year, depending upon the method of accounting regularly
employed, provided such method clearly reflects income.
Section 43, on which the petitioner relies, provides:
"The deductions and credits provided for in this title
shall be taken for the taxable year in which 'paid or accrued' or 'paid or incurred', dependent upon the method
of accounting upon the basis of which the net income is
computed, unless in order to clearly reflect the income the
deductions or credits should be taken as of a different
period. .

....

It is settled by many decisions that a taxpayer may not
accrue an expense the amount of which is unsettled or the
liability for which is contingent, and this principle is fully
applicable to a tax, liability for which the taxpayer denies,
and payment whereof he is contesting.' Here the petitioner, in figuring its costs and its sales price to consumers, added the amount of the processing tax, but it collected its purchase price as such and designated no part of
it as representing the tax. The petitioner received the
purchase price as such. Its tax liability, if any, to the
United States did not differ from other debts. Since it
denied liability for, and failed to pay, the tax during the
taxable year 1935, it was not in a position in its tax accounting to treat the Government's claim as an accrued
liability. As it admittedly received the money in question in 1935 and could not deduct from gross income an
accrued liability to offset it, the receipt, it would seem,
must constitute income for that year.
Petitioner nevertheless insists that § 43 of the Revenue
Act, which requires that deductions be taken for the taxable year in which the amount was paid or accrued, creates
an exception applicable to this case by its concluding
clause, "unless in order to clearly reflect the income the

Opinion of the Court.

deductions or credits should be taken as of a different
period." In short, the petitioner's position is that the
Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals are authorized and required to make exceptions to the general rule
of accounting by annual periods wherever, upon analysis
of any transaction, it is found that it would be unjust or
unfair not to isolate the transaction and treat it on the
basis of the long term result. We think the position
is not maintainable.
The Revenue Act of 1921, in §§ 214 (a) (6) and 234 (a)
(4) 6 authorized the Commissioner to allow the deduction
of losses in a year other than that in which sustained when,
in his opinion, that was necessary clearly to reflect income.
The qualifying clause of § 43 was first added as § 200 (d)
of the Revenue Act of 1924.' The reports of both House
and Senate Committees concerning this change said:
"The proposed bill extends that theory to all deductions
and credits. The necessity for such a provision arises in
cases in which a taxpayer pays in one year interest or
rental payments or other items for a period of years. If
he is forced to deduct the amount in the year in which
paid, it may result in a distortion of his income which
will cause him to pay either more or less taxes than he
properly should." 8
From these reports it is clear that the purpose of inserting the qualifying clause was to take care of fixed liabilities payable in fixed installments over a series of years.
For example, a tenant would not be compelled to accrue,
in the first year of a lease, the rental liability covering the
entire term nor would he be permitted, if he saw fit to pay
all the rent in advance, to deduct the whole payment as
an expense of the current year. But we think it was not
intended to upset the well-understood and consistently

applied doctrine that cash receipts or matured accounts
due on the one hand, and cash payments or accrued definite obligations on the other, should not be taken out of
the annual accounting system and, for the benefit of the
Government or the taxpayer, treated on a basis which
is neither a cash basis nor an accrual basis, because so to
do would, in a given instance, work a supposedly more
equitable result to the Government or to the taxpayer.
The question is not whether the Board, within its discretion, made a determination of fact. Compare Dobson
v. Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489. It is rather whether, as
matter of law, the Board misconstrued the extent of the
power conferred by the Revenue Act.
"All the revenue acts which have been enacted since the
adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment have uniformly
assessed the tax on the basis of annual returns showing
the net result of all the taxpayer's transactions during a
fixed accounting period, either the calendar year, or, at
the option of the taxpayer, the particular fiscal year which
he may adopt." "
The rationale of the system is this: "It is the essence of
any system of taxation that it should produce revenue
ascertainable, and payable to the government, at regular
intervals. Only by such a system is it practicable to produce a regular flow of income and apply methods of
accounting, assessment, and collection capable of practical operation." 1o
This legal principle has often been stated and applied."
The uniform result has been denial both to Government
and to taxpayer of the privilege of allocating income or

payment, or, applying the accrual basis, the year in which
the right to receive, or the obligation to pay, has become

final and definite in amount.
But the petitioner urges that § 43 has altered the rule
so that a hybrid system, partly annual and partly transactional, may, within administrative discretion, be substituted for that of annual accounting periods. It urges
that the change was due to the desire of Congress to prevent distortion of true income. This must mean distortion of true income, not of a given year, but, in the light
of ultimate gain, from a series of transactions over a period
of years, growing out of, or in some way related to, an
initial transaction in the taxable year. The very section
on which petitioner relies, however, reiterates the adherence of Congress to the system of annual periods of
computation.
As we said in Dixie Pine Products Co. v. Commissioner,
supra,referring to a section identical with § 43 now under
consideration, "The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1936
worked no significant change over earlier Acts respecting
the permissible basis of calculating annual taxable
income."
We are of opinion that the purpose of the language
which Congress used was not to substitute, whenever in
the discretion of an administrative officer or tribunal such
a course would seem proper, a divided and inconsistent
method of accounting not properly to be denominated
either a cash or an accrual system.
The judgment is
Affirmed.
lII. JusTics DOUGLAS and MR. JUsTICE JACKSON are of
opinion that the case is governed by Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489, and that the judgment should, for
the reasons therein stated, be reversed.
