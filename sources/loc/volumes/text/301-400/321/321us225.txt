it were shown that such failure was "due to reasonable
cause and not due to willful neglect." Revenue Act of
1936, § 291, 49 Stat. 1727. The Board has made no finding on that subject, apparently assuming that the mandatory provisions applied to all years. The question is one
of fact in the first instance for the Board's determination.
Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489. The Government does not object to a remand to the Board for the limited purpose of reconsidering the imposition of the 25 per
cent penalty for the year 1936 only, if the respondent shall
seasonably apply to the Board therefor. In all things
else the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the cause remanded with directions to remand to the Tax
Court for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.

MR.

JUSTICE

JACKSON delivered the opinion of the

Court.
For the years 1934, 1935, and 1936 the taxpayer, a corporation, filed complete income and excess-profits tax returns on Form 1120 of the Treasury Department. Each
of these included a question whether the corporation was
a personal holding company within the meaning of § 351
of the applicable revenue act and stated that if it was, an
additional return on Form 1120H was required. The
taxpayer answered the question in the negative and did
not in any year file personal holding company returns on
Form 1120H.
The Commissioner imposed personal holding company
surtaxes for each year and under the authority of § 406
of the Revenue Act of 1935 and § 291 of the Revenue Acts
of 1934 and 1936 imposed a 25 per cent penalty for failure
to file the personal holding company return.
The president, who executed the income tax returns, did
not file personal holding company returns because he
thought the taxpayer was not a personal holding company
within the meaning of the Act. It was actively engaged
in the pawnshop business. However, more than 50 per
cent of its capital stock was owned by less than five stockholders, and more than 80 per cent of its gross income was
derived from interest. The taxpayer filed information
returns showing dividends of over $300 paid to each stockholder during those years and its books and records made
available to the Commissioner during audit disclosed the
facts. No fraud or bad faith is suggested.
The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the penalties,1 and
its decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.'

Opinion of the Court.

There appearing to be no conflict of decision between circuits, we on November 9, 1942 denied certiorari. The
25-day period allowed by our rule in which to file petition
for rehearing expired. In February 1943 a conflict developed through decision of Lane-Wells Co. v. Commissioner
by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.' Petitioner
asked leave to file out of time a petition for rehearing and
we consented. On June 7, 1943, we granted petition for
rehearing, vacated the order denying certiorari, and
granted certiorari limited to the penalty question.' We
asked counsel in view of § 1140 of the Internal Revenue
Code and Helveringv. NorthernCoal Co., 293 U. S. 191, to
discuss our jurisdiction to grant a petition for'rehearing
in the case.
Section 1140 of the Internal Revenue Code, in relevant
part, provides:
"The decision of the Tax Court shall become final"(b) Decision affirmed or petition for review dismissed."(2) Petitionfor certioraridenied.--Upon the denial of
a petition for certiorari, if the decision of the Tax Court
has been affirmed or the petition for review dismissed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals; or
"(3) After mandate of the Supreme Court.-Upon the
expiration of 30 days from the date of issuance of the mandate of the Supreme Court, if such Court directs that the
decision of the Board be affirmed or the petition for review
dismissed."
There are other provisions dealing with the situations
where the Board's decision is modified or reversed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals or by this Court, the purpose be3317 U. S. 677.

ing to determine definitely the date on which the statute
of limitations, suspended during appeal, begins to run
again and assessment may be made by the Commissioner.
The Revenue Act of 1926 had identical provisions.' In reporting upon the provision in the Revenue Bill of 1926,
the Senate committee said:
"Section 1005 prescribes the date on which a decision of
the Board (whether or not review thereof is had) is to become final. Inasmuch as the statute of limitations upon
assessments and suits for collection, both of which are
suspended during review of the Commissioner's determination, commences to run upon the day upon which the
Board's decision becomes final, it is of utmost importance
that this time be specified as accurately as possible. In
some instances in order to achieve this result the usual
rules of law applicable in court procedure must be changed.
For example, the power of the court of review to recall its
mandate is made to expire 30 days from the date of issuance of the mandate." Sen. Rep. No. 52, 69th Cong., 1st
Sess., p. 37.
In Helveringv. Northern Coal Co., supra,we considered
the provision of the 1926 Act, corresponding to § 1140 (b)
(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, dealing with issuance of
mandate by this Court. The question was whether notwithstanding the lapse of more than thirty days after mandate we could grant a petition for rehearing, and it was
urged that this statute did not qualify the inherent power
of the Court to reconsider its judgments throughout the
term in which they are entered. Quoting the statute, we
held: "In view of the authoritative and explicit requirement of the statute and of its application to these cases,
the petitions for rehearing are severally denied."
While it appears that we have a number of times granted
certiorari to review decisions in cases originating with the
6§ 1005, 44 Stat. 110.

Opinion of the Court.

Tax Court after once denying the petitions, Duquesne
Steel Foundry Co. v. Burnet, certiorari denied, 282 U. S.
878, certiorari granted, 282 U. S. 830; Neuberger v. Commissioner, certiorari denied, 308 U. S. 623, certiorari
granted, 310 U. S. 655; Crane-Johnson Co. v. Commissioner, certiorari denied, 308 U. S. 627, certiorari granted,
309 U. S. 692; Helvering v. Cement Investors, certiorari
denied, 315 U. S. 802, certiorari granted, 315 U. S. 825, in
all but one of these cases the petition for rehearing was filed
within 25 days after the denial of certiorari. In the other,
the question of jurisdiction was not raised or considered,
and therefore it does not establish a construction of the
statute. United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172; Snow
v. United States, 118 U. S. 346, 354; Cross v. Burke, 146
U. S. 82, 86; Louisville Trust Co. v. Knott, 191 U. S. 225,
236; Arant v. Lane, 245 U. S. 166, 170.
It sometimes is desirable in the light of events to grant
a previously denied writ of certiorari, as where it appears
the question must later be taken because of conflict. A
grant in such a case not only enables us to do justice to
the party if it appears that he has the right of the controversy, but also it gives us the benefit of argument and
examination of the additional or contrary aspects of the
question presented by the case. Our rules provide for
petitions for rehearing as matter of right within 25 days
after judgment,7 and this rule has been applied to petitions
for rehearings of orders denying certiorari. We have applied it to cases falling within the purview of § 1140 (b)
(2). No mandate issues on denial of certiorari, and after
a final decision the mandate does not issue until expiration
of the 25-day period within which petition for rehearing
may be filed.' If, therefore, we follow the practice heretofore observed, by which we regard denials of certiorari

as qualified until the 25-day period expires, we put the
denial and the decision on a generally equal basis except
as Congress has seen fit to give the latter an additional
thirty days before finality. The Government after consideration of the practical aspects of the question advises
that in its view our practice in these matters has been
"salutary and in accordance with sound policy." There
appears to be no good reason, therefore, to hold that the
rule as to rehearings, in so far as it permits as matter of
right the filing of petition therefor within 25 days, may
not apply to this class of cases. But when under our
rules our denial has become final, this statute deprives us
of jurisdiction over the case.
Accordingly the writ of certiorari is dismissed for want
of jurisdiction.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE
MURPHY and MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE concur, dissenting:

I can find no warrant in § 1140 of the Internal Revenue
Code for saying that the decision of the Tax Court becomes "final" only after the expiration of the 25-day
period within which a petition for rehearing may be filed.
The section contains no such provision. The 25-day
period for rehearings is prescribed by our Rule 33. But
our authority to grant petitions for rehearing during the
Term rises from the same source. See Wayne United Gas
Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., 300 U. S. 131, 136-137;
Art Metal Construction Co. v. United States, 289 U. S.
706; Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410, 415. Hence I
see no basis for saying that one, but not the other, qualifies
that provision of § 1140 which states that the decision of
the Tax Court becomes final "upon denial of a petition
for certiorari."

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.*

Decided February 14, 1944.
The recoveries here in question were not as matter of law proceeds
of the "sale or exchange" of a capital asset, and were properly
taxed as ordinary income rather than as capital gain under § 117
of the Internal Revenue Code. P. 232.
Rehearing denied.

ON PETITION for rehearing of two of the four cases decided in Dobson v. Commissioner,320 U. S. 489.
Messrs. Leland W. Scott and William L. Prosser for
petitioners.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Petition for rehearing in two of the four cases decided
together on December 20, 1943 states that these contained
an issue not present and not considered in the main case.
In these two cases the Tax Court held that recoveries by
these taxpayers in 1939 did constitute taxable income. It
held, also, that the recovery was taxable as ordinary income, despite taxpayer's contention that it should be taxed
as capital gain under § 117 of the Internal Revenue Code.
This contention, the petition says, presents questions of
law to be determined by this Court, rather than of fact
finally to be determined by the Tax Court.
The weakness of taxpayers' position lies in the fact that
not every gain growing out of a transaction concerning

capital assets is allowed the benefits of the capital gains
tax provision. Those are limited by definition to gains
from "the sale or exchange" of capital assets. Internal
Revenue Code § 117 (2), (3), (4), (5).
We certainly cannot say that the items in question were
as matter of law proceeds of the "sale or exchange" of a
capital asset. Harwick asserted a claim, and the three
other taxpayers involved in these cases filed suit, against
the National City Company, demanding rescission of their
purchases of stock. Their claims were compromised or
admitted; the taxpayers seek to link the recoveries resulting therefrom with their prior sales of the stock, which
resulted in losses. The Tax Court did not find as matter
of fact, and we decline to say as matter of law, that such
a transaction is a "sale or exchange" of a capital asset
in the accepted meaning of those terms. Cf. Helvering
v. FlaccusLeather Co., 313 U. S. 247; Fairbanksv. United
States, 306 U. S. 436. In Helvering v. Hammel, 311 U. S.
504; Electro-Chemical Engraving Co. v. Commissioner,
311 U. S. 513; Helvering v. Nebraska Bridge Supply &
Lumber Co., 312 U. S. 666, on which petitioners rely, we
held as matter of law that losses resulting from a sale were
not to be denied the benefits of the capital losses provisions
because the sale was a forced or involuntary one, as upon
foreclosure. Those cases are no aid to petitioners here.
Petition for rehearing is denied.
