REGAL KNITWEAR CO. v. NATIONAL LABOR
RELATIONS BOARD.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 86.

Argued December 8, 1944.-Decided January 29, 1945.

1. A cease and desist order of the National Labor Relations Board
and an order of the Circuit Court of Appeals for its enforcement
may validly provide that the order shall apply to the employer's "successors and assigns." P. 16.
2. An order of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the enforcement
of a cease and desist order of the Board, though applying in terms
to "successors and assigns," would have a scope no broader than
that prescribed by -Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for
the District Courts-"Every order granting an injunction and
every restraining order . . . is binding only upon the parties to
the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal
service or otherwise." P. 14.

3. Whether one brings himself in contempt of an enforcement order
as a "successor" or "assign" depends on an appraisal of his rela-

tions and behavior, not upon mere construction of the terms of
the order. P. 15.

CERTIORARI, 323 U. S. 692, to review a decree granting
enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations
Board.
Mr. John P. Chandler submitted for petitioner.
Mr. Malcolm F. Halliday, with whom Solicitor General Fahy, Mr. Alvin J. Rockwell and Misses Ruth Weyand and Fanny M. Boyls were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JuSTIcE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The National Labor Relations Board, after appropriate
proceedings, issued a cease and desist order against the
petitioner, 49 N. L. R. B. 560, and thereafter obtained
from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
an order for its enforcement. 140 F. 2d 746. We granted
certiorari, limited to a single question on which there was
a conflict in practice between different circuits. 323 U. S.
692. The Board has followed the formula which orders
not only a particular respondent, but also "its officers,
agents, successors and assigns" to cease and desist. The
question is whether enforcement will be granted without
deleting "successors and assigns" from those enjoined.
The Circuit Courts of Appeals for the First, Second, Third,
Fourth, and Eighth Circuits, and the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia have upheld the authority of the
Board to include such a provision.' In some of these cases

Opinion of the Court.

change of ownership was shown to be probable and in
other cases there was no such proof. The Second Circuit,
in refusing to delete the provision, said: "In allowing
these words to stand we wish to make it clear, however,
that we do not hold that a 'successor' or an 'assign' will
be in contempt of our order if it should (even after notice of the order, but without participating with the respondent in any disobedience by it) do exactly those
things which the order forbids. In other words, we do
not hold that those words impose any liability which
would not exist without them." Labor Board v. Blackstone Mfg. Co., 123 F. 2d 633, 635; see also Bethlehem
Steel Co. v. Labor Board, 120 F. 2d 641, 650-51 (App.
D. C.). The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit, on the other hand, consistently eliminates the
provision as to successors and assigns from the order,2
but recognizes that successors or assigns under some circumstances are bound by the Board's order, even without
the words.3
When one court of appeals strikes out the provision but
says its absence may in some circumstances have the same
effect as if it were there, and another court of appeals approves the provision but says its presence may have no
more effect than if it were out, there is more than a faint
suggestion that the conflict is over semantics rather than
over practical realities.

Opinion of the Court.

324 U. S.

The formula that includes successors and assigns, among
others, is one probably borrowed from the jargon of conveyancing. Doubtless these words often are used, not out
of consideration of their appropriateness, but because of
their familiarity. Courts of equity sometimes have used
this formula in their decrees." Before the enactment of
the Labor Relations Act the Federal Trade Commission
issued orders containing these familiar provisions.' The
Securities and Exchange Commission has done the same.6
The Bituminous Coal Division of the Department of the
Interior does likewise.7 The National Labor Relations
Board has employed this formula consistently since 1937, '
and some state labor boards have followed the example.'
Not only have circuit courts of appeals, except of the
Seventh Circuit, generally enforced orders containing this
provision, but this Court has several times done so. Southport Petroleum Co. v. Labor Board, 315 U. S. 100, 106,

Opinion of the Court.

The dearth of cases in which actual controversies have
been precipitated by this more general than discriminating
use of this ritual indicates that its significance both for
good and ill is greater in anticipation than in retrospect.
Administrative agencies have considerable latitude to
shape their remedies within the scope of their statutory
authority and, where the infirmity is inadequacy of findings to show appropriateness of the choice made in the
particular case, are ordinarily entitled to have the case
remanded for further consideration. Phelps Dodge Corp.
v. Labor Board, 313 U. S. 177, 194; Addison v. Holly Hill
FruitProducts, 322 U. S. 607, 616. The courts, nevertheless, may not grant an enforcement order or injunction
so broad as to make punishable the conduct of persons who
act independently and whose rights have not been adjudged according to law. Chase National Bank v. Norwalk, 291 U. S. 431, 436-37; Hitchman Coal & Coke Co.
v. Mitchell, 245 U. S. 229, 234; Scott v. Donald, 165 U. S.
107, 117; Alemite Mfg. Corp. v. Staff, 42 F. 2d 832.
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that:
"Every order granting an injunction and every restraining
order . . . is binding only upon the parties to the action,
Labor Board v. Falk Corp., 308 U. S. 453, enforcing 6 N. L. R. B.
654, 666; Labor Board v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 309 U. S. 206,
enforcing 7 N. L. R. B. 237, 252; Labor Board v. Link-Belt Co., 311
U. S. 584, enforcing 12 N. L. R. B. 854, 883; Phelps Dodge Corp. v.
Labor Board, 313 U. S. 177, enforcing, as modified, and remanding
19 N. L. R. B. 547, 603.
It is suggested, at least inferentially, that Labor Board v. Express
Publishing Co., 312 U. S. 426, is authority against the position of
the Court in the case at bar. However, the order there under review
contained these same words. Matter of Express Publishing Co., 13
N. L. R. B. 1213, 1226. While this Court limited the enforcement
order in certain other respects, it did not strike the words "successors
and assigns." The issue was not passed on, but its very absence from
a case concerning permissible breadth of orders suggests the innocuous
character of the provision as compared with that passed on in the
Express case.

their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys,
and upon those persons in active concert or participation
with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise."" This is derived from the
common-law doctrine that a decree of injunction not only
binds the parties defendant but also those identified with
them in interest, in "privity" with them, represented by
them or subject to their control. In essence it is that defendants may not nullify a decree by carrying out prohibited acts through aiders and abettors, although they
were not parties to the original proceeding.
The term "successors and assigns" in an enforcement
order of course may not enlarge its scope beyond that defined by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Successors
and assigns may, however, be instrumentalities through
which defendant seeks to evade an order or may come
within the description of persons in active concert or participation with them in the violation of an injunction.
If they are, by that fact they are brought within scope
of contempt proceedings by the rules of civil procedure.
We have indicated that Labor Board orders are binding
upon successors and assigns who operate as "merely a disguised continuance of the old employer." Southport Petroleum Co. v. Labor Board, 315 U. S. at 106. We have
also said of an injunction to restrain violation of the Fair
Labor Standards Act, which is somewhat analogous to
Labor Board orders, that "Not only is such an injunction
enforcible by contempt proceedings against the corporation, its agents and officers and those individuals associated
with it in the conduct of its business, but it may also, in
appropriate circumstances, be enforced against those to
whom the business may have been transferred, whether
as a means of evading the judgment or for other reasons."'

Opinion of the Court.

Walling v. Reuter Co., 321 U. S. 671,674. In both of these
cases the reference is not merely to succession, but to
a relation between the defendant and the successor
which might of itself establish liability within the terms
of Rule 65.
We do not undertake to decide whether or under what
circumstances any kind of successor or assign will be liable
for violation of a Labor Board order. It is true that we
have said that "Questions of construction had better be
ironed out before enforcement orders issue than upon contempt proceedings." (J. I. Case Co. v. Labor Board, 321
U. S. 332,341.) But it is apparent from Rule 65, and from
the views of one circuit court of appeals as to the narrow
effect of the words in the order and of another as to the
broad effect of the order without the words, that whether
one brings himself in contempt as a "successor or assign"
depends on an appraisal of his relations and behavior and
not upon mere construction of terms of the order. If defendants enter upon transactions which raise doubts as
to the applicability of the injunction, they may petition
the court granting it for a modification or construction of
the order. Cf. New Jersey v. New York City, 296 U. S.
259. While such relief would be in the sound discretion
of the court, we think courts would not be apt to withhold
a clarification in the light of a concrete situation that left
parties or "successors and assigns" in the dark as to their
duty toward the court. Enforcement orders are issued
to effectuate the purposes of the Act, not for the entrapment of parties, and courts no less than parties desire to
avoid unwitting contempts as well as to punish deliberate
ones.
No concrete case is before us. We have here an
abstract controversy over the use of these words, and it
is as sterile as abstract controversies usually are. The
employer objects to the words of the order merely as
words. They do not enlarge its own obligation, and if

324 U. S.

it complies with the order, little by way of obligation
could be passed to a successor or assign by the order that
is not in any event imposed by statute. The Board is not
here attempting to reach or to hold anyone in contempt
by virtue of such orders. No successor or assign appears
before us complaining that these words put him in jeopardy. No one can be punished for contempt because of
these words until after a judicial hearing, in which their
operation could be determined on a concrete set of facts.
All that is before us is the question whether we will hold
abstractly that this provision is an illegal one to include
in a cease and desist order of the Labor Board or an
enforcement order of the Court.
Whether it is wise that an order attempt to define its
own effect on others than parties to the action when the
law has already done so is not for us to say. We cannot
say that "successors and assigns" as well as "officers and
agents" may not under some circumstances be among
those reached by the order within the scope of Rule 65 and
hence cannot say that it is not a permissible provision.

An injunction is a continuing threat to those named as
subject to it, of the pains of contempt proceedings if they
disobey its provisions. The opinion of the Court recognizes that the present injunction running against the employer's "successors and assigns" purports to include
within its sweep some who are not subject to its command and is thus a threat to those over whom the Court
has no authority. The opinion also admits that the persons who are bound by the present decree would be as
effectively bound if the decree were to omit the words

REGAL KNITWEAR CO. v. BOARD.

STONE,

C. J., dissenting.

"successors and assigns." See Walling v. Reuter Co., 321
U. S. 671, 674-675, and cases cited.
It has long been deemed to be an abuse of power for a
federal court to enjoin practices in which a defendant
has not engaged and which are unrelated to those which
may be properly enjoined. See Labor Board v. Express
Publishing Co., 312 U. S. 426, and cases cited. To me it
seems no less a misuse of authority for a court, as well as
for the Labor Board itself, to threaten those who are not
subject to its command. This is the more so where the
tendency of the threat is to inflict an unauthorized penalty
on the employer by deterring third persons from dealing
with him to acquire his property and business, in circumstances in which that may lawfully be done.
That there have been numerous cases before this Court
where the Board's order has not been challenged in this
respect, is significant only as showing how extensive the
abuse has become and how ready employers and the lower
courts have been to acquiesce in threatened wrong when
the injury seemed not to be immediate. But these are
not reasons for our acquiescence, when the question is
brought to us for decision for the first time. It is no part
of the function of the Board or of courts to make unwarranted threats against suitors or innocent third persons.
Such misleading and unwarranted use of the phrase should
be avoided, either by striking it from the decree or so
qualifying it as to designate the class of "successors and
assigns" to whom it may be lawfully applied. Cf. Southport Co. v. Labor Board, 315 U. S. 100, 107.
