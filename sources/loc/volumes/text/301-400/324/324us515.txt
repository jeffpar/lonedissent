problem presented. Respondent claims, and the court
below has sustained, only the right to have the flow of
the Willow maintained at its natural level. That level has
been increased by raising the level of the St. Croix above
its high-water mark. The increase in the level of the St.
Croix above high-water mark has operated to raise the
level below the respondent's darn to an extent which has
damaged respondent by diminishing the power head. To
that extent respondent has suffered damage and is entitled
to recover on principles announced in the Cress case.
United States v. Cress has stood for twenty-eight years

precisely similar to those here disclosed. I think it is a

federal government because they are not navigable.

CONNECTICUT LIGHT & POWER CO. v. FEDERAL
POWER COMMISSION.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 189. Argued January 3, 1945.-Decided March 26, 1945.
1. The declaration of policy in § 201 (a) of the Federal Power Act,
that federal regulation is "to extend only to those matters which
are not subject to regulation by the States," is relevant in resolving
ambiguity in specific provisions of the Act which purport to effectuate that policy. P. 527.
2. In the provision of § 201 (b) of the Federal Power Act, that the
Commission shall have jurisdiction over all facilities for the transmission or wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce, "but
shall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this

distribution," the phrase "facilities used in local distribution" delimits the jurisdiction of the Commission and establishes a legal
standard which must be observed in determining whether a company is a "public utility" under the Act. P. 530.
3. The exemption from the Commission's jurisdiction of "facilities used
in local distribution" is not limited to facilities which distribute no
out-of-state energy. Facilities may carry out-of-state energy exclusively and still be exempt under the Act. The test is whether
they are local distribution facilities. P. 531.
4. The jurisdiction of the Commission under the Federal Power Act
to regulate accounting practices extends only to companies which
are "public utilities" under the Act, i. e., companies which own or
operate facilities that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. P. 531.
5. The court below having considered irrelevant the appropriate test
of the Commission's jurisdiction under the Act, its inquiry on review
did not proceed under a correct rule of law and its judgment must
be reversed. P. 532.
6. Where a federal agency is authorized to invoke an overriding federal
power except in certain prescribed situations and then to leave the
problem to traditional state control, the existence of federal authority to act should appear affirmatively and not rest on inference
alone. P. 532.
7. The business of local distribution of electric energy does not as a
matter of law exclude the process of reducing out-of-state electric
energy from high to low voltage in subdividing it to serve ultimate
consumers. P. 534.
8. Upon the record in this case, it is doubtful whether the Commission
applied the correct law, and the case should be remanded to the
Commission for appropriate jurisdictional findings. This Court does
not undertake to decide as an original matter whether the facilities
in question are facilities which subject the company to the Act, nor
whether there was basis for jurisdiction of the Commission during
some past period by reason of the company's operation of facilities
since abandoned. P. 534.
9. The jurisdiction of the Commission under the Federal Power Act,
over facilities for the transmission of electric energy in interstate
commerce which are not used in local distribution, does not depend upon whether any particular volume or proportion of interstate energy is involved; and such a jurisdictional limitation is not
to be supplied by construction. P. 536.

The Federal Power Commission has asserted jurisdiction to regulate the accounting practices of the Connecticut Light and Power Company. The Federal Power Act
as amended in 1935, 49 Stat. 838, 16 U. S. C. § 792 et seq.,
declares a congressional policy concerning the business
of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate
distribution to the public, and states that regulation of
"that part of such business which consists of the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the
sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce
is necessary in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to extend only to those matters which are

not subject to regulation by the States." § 201 (a), 49
Stat. 847, 16 U. S. C. § 824 (a).
The Company, incorporated by Connecticut, serving
customers only in Connecticut and owning no utilities
property outside of that state, is comprehensively regulated by the Connecticut Public Utilities Commission in
accounting practices as in many other matters, and it
challenges the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission.
The State of Connecticut, appearing amicus curiae,
through its Attorney General avers that this assumption
of jurisdiction by the Federal Commission "represents an
unwarranted and illegal invasion of the powers of the
State to regulate its local distributing company, which
powers were clearly to be preserved to the State under the
provisions of the Federal Power Act." The Connecticut
Public Utilities Commission joins with the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, also
appearing as amici curiae, and they contend that the
Federal Power Commission's order regulating accounting
practices exceeds any authority given by the Federal
Power Act and intrudes upon the field which that Act
expressly reserved to local regulation.
The basic facts are not seriously in dispute. The Company for some time prior to August 26, 1935, the effective
date of the Federal Power Act, operated as a member of
the Connecticut Valley Power Exchange, an interstate
power pool which interchanged energy among certain systems in New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Had
such operation continued, the Company would be subject
to the Act and to the Commission's order. Two days before its effective date and frankly for the purpose of avoiding federal regulation the Company rearranged its
operations with intent to cut every connection and discontinue every facility whose continued operation would
render it subject to the Federal Power Commission's

CONNECTICUT CO. v. POWER COMM'N. 519
515

Opinion of the Court.

control. The Commission conceded in its opinion and the
Government admits here the Company's right to do so.1
But the Commission said petitioner's effort was "only a
gesture," for while it cut certain connections "it did not
cut other interconnections over which interstate energy
flowed." Of those facilities which the Commission held
subjected the Company to the Power Act at the time it
became effective, the Company has since divested itself
of all but one, and on that one the Commission rests its
present jurisdiction to control petitioner's accounting.
But it also claims that its accounting orders were entitled
to obedience up to the time of the abandonment of the
other facilities and because of them.
The facilities on which jurisdiction is predicated are for
two general types of operation, one being used in receipt
of interstate power, the other for transmission of energy
sold to a municipality which in turn sold some part of it
for export from the state.
The only presently existing facilities said to confer jurisdiction are at Bristol. Here the petitioning company purchases energy from the Connecticut Power Company,
which despite a confusing similarity of name is an entirely
separate and unaffiliated concern. The petitioning company receives power at 66,000 volts from the lines of the
Connecticut Power Company over a short tap line, owned
by the Connecticut Power Company, which leads to petitioner's substation. There the energy is stepped down to
4,600 and 13,800 volts and transmitted thence over many
circuits to consumers in and around Bristol. The substation includes all of the usual equipment, lightning arresters, disconnects, oil circuit breakers, busses, step-down

transformers, and appurtenant structures of an outdoor
substation; and in the substation building a synchronous
condenser is owned and operated, as required by the supply contract, to maintain the power factor.
What is called the East Hampton connection, severed
July 1, 1939, consisted of facilities by which the petitioner
received energy from the Connecticut Power Company
at 13,800 volts and transmitted it several miles to its Leesville substation where it was reduced to 4,600 volts and
to other substations where it was reduced to 2,300 volts
and supplied to customers. What is referred to as the
Torrington-Winsted District connection, discontinued in
June of 1941, was differently operated. Energy was purchased from the Torrington Electric Light Company,
which in turn had purchased it from the Connecticut
Power Company. Delivery was accepted by petitioner
at the bus bar of the Torrington Company at low voltage,
2,300 volts, petitioner maintained a substation which
stepped this voltage up to 27,600, at which it was transmitted about ten miles over its lines to a substation at
Winsted where facilities were operated to lower the voltage to 4,600, whence it was put on distribution lines.
The Commission held in all three instances that such
facilities of petitioner were "for the transmission of electric energy . . . as distinguished from local distribution
thereof." It found that the energy received from the
Connecticut Power Company and Torrington Company
"regularly, frequently and for substantial periods of time
included electric energy in substantial amounts transmitted from Massachusetts." Hence it concluded petitioner owned facilities for transmission of energy in interstate commerce and was a "public utility" under its
jurisdiction by virtue of the Act.
The other type of operation on which it predicated
jurisdiction was terminated in February 1941. It consisted of sale of energy at wholesale to the Borough of

CONNECTICUT CO. v. POWER COMM'N. 521
515

Opinion of the Court.

Groton, which operated a municipal distribution plant.
The Borough, with knowledge of the Company, resold a
portion of this energy to a corporation which transmitted
it to Fishers Island, a small island off Connecticut shore
but territory of New York. There it was distributed to
that small community at retail. When the Groton contract expired in 1940 petitioner refused to renew it unless
the Borough discontinued sales of energy destined for
Fishers Island. This change was required by the Company avowedly to eliminate flow of its energy to New
York and thus to remove one of the grounds on which the
Commission has asserted jurisdiction.
The Commission held that from the effective date of
the Act to February 28, 1941, facilities owned by the
Company were used to convey electric energy to the Borough of Groton "for the transmission and sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce" and that
such facilities were for transmission of such energy "as
distinguished from local distribution thereof." Hence the
Company was held to have been a public utility during the
period of such operation and subject for that period to
the jurisdiction of the Commission.
It is not denied, although the Commission's findings
and opinion make no mention of the fact and appear to
have given it no weight, that the predominant characteristic of the company's over-all operation is that of a local
and intrastate service. It serves one hundred seven
towns, cities, and boroughs of Connecticut with a total
population of about 660,000 and in addition supplies substantially all the power used by local companies which
serve communities of Connecticut having a population of
130,000. It owns no lines crossing the Connecticut boundary and does not connect with any other company at the
boundary. It has no business other than Connecticut service for which it needs any facilities whatever, and if local
distribution service were terminated, no remaining pur-

pose or use of any kind is suggested for the facilities in
question. Its purchases and sales, its receipts and deliveries of power, are all within the state. Its rates and its
fiscal and accounting affairs are fully and so far as appears
effectively regulated by the State of Connecticut.
The Federal Power Commission on January 7, 1941
issued its order requiring petitioner to show cause why it
should not be held to be a "public utility" subject to the
Act and why it should not reclassify and keep its accounts
according to the Federal Commission's uniform system.
On May 15, 1942 it issued findings and decision. Rehearing was denied. The Company then applied for the review by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia
to which the statute entitles it. § 313 (b) of the Act, 49
Stat. 860.
The Court of Appeals sustained the orders. 141 F. 2d
14. It held that "The Federal Power Act obviously intends to confer Federal jurisdiction upon electric distribution systems which normally would operate as interstate
businesses." It construed the "but" clause of the Act,
which we shall later consider, as "intended to make it
clear that this [the Commission's] jurisdiction extends
even to local facilities where the Act provides for their
regulation, as it does in the case of accounting practices."
The Court concluded that "Therefore, whether or not the
facilities by which petitioner distributes energy from Massachusetts should be classified as 'local' is not relevant to
this case. The sole test of jurisdiction of the Commission
over accounts is whether these facilities, 'local' or otherwise, are used for the transmission of electric energy from
a point in one state to a point in another." We granted
certiorari. 323 U. S. 687.
The first question is whether the reviewing court acted
under a misapprehension as to the meaning of the statute.
The jurisdictional and regulatory provisions of the Federal Power Act apply only to "public utilities," and the

CONNECTICUT CO. v. POWER COMM'N. 523
515

Opinion of the Court.

Act provides that by "public utilities" it "means any person who owns or operates facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission." § 201 (e), 49 Stat. 848. These
facilities are carefully defined. "The Commission shall
have jurisdiction over all facilities for such transmission
or sale of electric energy, but shall not have jurisdiction,
except as specifically provided in this Part and the Part
next following, over facilities used for the generation of
electric energy or over facilities used in local distribution
or only for the transmission of electric energy in intrastate
commerce, or over facilities for the transmission of electric energy consumed wholly by the transmitter." § 201
(b). Transmission and sale as used in this provision
are further defined to mean respectively "transmission of
electric energy in interstate commerce" and "sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce." And the
Act goes on to say: "electric energy shall be held to be
transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a
State and consumed at any point outside thereof" and
that sale of electric energy at wholesale means "a sale of
electric energy to any person for resale." §§ 201 (c), (d).
Of course as preamble to all of these provisions stands the
policy declaration that Federal regulation "of that part
of such business which consists of the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such
energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is necessary
in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to
extend only to those matters which are not subject to
regulation by the States." § 201 (a).
Can it be said in that state of the statute that whether
facilities are local is not relevant to 'this case? The Court
of Appeals in returning an affirmative answer to this question noted that "There is a superficial inconsistency" between its position and the last quoted provision of the Act.
But it said that we, in Jersey CentralPower & Light Co. v.
Federal Power Commission, 319 U. S.61, held this "lir-

itation" "not to apply to the sections of the Act which
specifically give the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction over matters of financial arrangement, such as the
accounting section which we are discussing here." This
misapprehends our holding in the Jersey Central case.
The line did not cross state borders and since it was wholly
within one state, it was contended that the line was used
for intrastate transmission and that the Act did not apply
although the line was used to transmit power in its course
of exportation from the State. We denied this contention
and said, "It is impossible for us to conclude that this
definition means less than it says and applies only to the
energy at the instant it crosses the state line and so only
to the facilities which cross the line and only to the company which owns the facilities which cross the line. The
purpose of this act was primarily to regulate the rates and
charges of the interstate energy. If intervening companies might purchase from producers in the state of production, free of federal control, cost would be fixed prior
to the incidence of federal regulation and federal rate control would be substantially impaired, if not rendered
futile." 319 U. S. at 71-72. We held that the "primary
purpose" of the 1935 amendments to the Power Act was
to give the Power Commission control of sales of energy
across state lines which had been held to be beyond the
control of the state of export in Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro Steam & Electric Co., 273 U. S. 83.
Here, however, the federal authority to fix the sale price
of the energy coming from Massachusetts in interstate
commerce attaches and presumably has been or at least
may be exercised pursuant to the Jersey Central holding
before the energy reaches this company. What petitioner
does or fails to do is only after the incidence of federal
regulation
and can in no way frustrate it.
In the Jersey
Central case on consideration of its facts
we said, "We conclude, therefore, that Jersey Central is

Opinion of the Court.

a public utility under this act." 319 U. S. at 73. Such a
finding made the provisions of the Act apply to it. But
the Company contended, notwithstanding its status as a
public utility, that it was carried out of that particular
federal regulation by the fact that the state regulated its
security issues. We held that state regulation does not
operate to exempt from the security provisions a company otherwise subject to the Commission's jurisdiction
but that "The sounder conclusion, it seems to us, is that
the limitation is directed at generation, transmission and
sale rather than the corporate financial arrangements of
the utilities engaged in such production and distribution."
Id. at 74-75. In other words, the policy admonition is to
be heeded in determining whether particular facilities
make their owner a "public utility" rather than in exempting from specific regulatory provisions a company
found to be a public utility. The Jersey Centralcase does
not read the policy declaration out of the Act as the court
below assumed it to do.
Legislative history is illuminating as to the congressional purpose in putting these provisions into the Act.
As frequently is the case, this original bill was drafted
by the counsel and aides of the agency concerned. 2 In its
support Commissioner Seavey of the Federal Power Commission said to the House Committee, "The new title II
of the act is designed to secure coordination on a regional
scale of the Nation's power resources and to fill the gap
in the present State regulation of electric utilities. It is
conceived entirely as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, State regulation." I Progress of the bill through
various stages shows constant purpose to protect rather
than to supervise authority of the states. In reporting a

revised bill to the Senate the Committee on Interstate
Commerce said, "Subsection (a) . . . declares the policy
of Congress to extend that regulation to those matters
which cannot be regulated by the States and to assist
the States in the exercise of their regulatory powers, but
not to impair or diminish the powers of any State commission."' 4 The Report of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce in presenting the amended
bill called attention to Public Utilities Commission v.
Attleboro Steam & Electric Co., 273 U. S. 83, holding that
rates charged in interstate wholesale transactions may not
be regulated constitutionally by the states, and expressed
the purpose to give federal jurisdiction to regulate rates
of wholesale transactions, but not to give jurisdiction
over local rates. It said:
"The bill takes no authority from State commissions
and contains provisions authorizing the Federal Commission to aid the State commissions in their efforts to ascertain and fix reasonable charges. . . . The new parts are
so drawn as to be a complement to and in no sense a
usurpation of State regulatory authority and contain
throughout directions to the Federal Power Commission
to receive and consider the views of State commissions.
Probably, no bill in recent years has so recognized the responsibilities of State regulatory commissions as does title
II of this bill."
"Subsection (b) confers jurisdiction upon the Commission over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, but does not apply to any
other sale of electric energy or deprive a State of any
lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of
hydroelectric energy transmitted out of the State. As

Opinion of the Court.

in the Senate bill no jurisdiction is given over local distribution of electric energy, and the authority of States to
fix local rates is not disturbed even in those cases where
the energy is brought in from another State." '
If we consider the professions of the sponsors of this bill
to have been in good faith, where are we to find them
written into the Act?
The policy declaration that federal regulation is "to
extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States" is one of great generality. It cannot nullify a clear and specific grant of jurisdiction, even
if the particular grant seems inconsistent with the broadly
expressed purpose. But such a declaration is relevant
and entitled to respect as a guide in resolving any ambiguity or indefiniteness in the specific provisions which
purport to carry out its intent. It cannot be wholly
ignored.
The declared purpose might also be looked for in specific
denials of power to the Commission, such as that found in
§ 204 (f), which provides that its controls, relating to issuance of securities, shall not extend to a public utility operating in a state under the laws of which its securities are
regulated by a state commission. But such exemptions
from particular regulations apply only to companies found
in general to be subject to federal regulation and do not
protect the state's general control over its local utilities.
The assurance which the sponsors of this legislation expressed as to protection of the general jurisdiction of a
state over electric utilities of.this character either is not
given effect by this Act at all, or it is to be found in the
words of § 201 (b), "but shall not have jurisdiction, except as specifically provided in this Part and the Part next
following, ..
over facilities used in local distribution . . ." The court below, following a statement in

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

324 U. S.

HartfordElectricLight Co. v. FederalPower Commission,
131 F. 2d 953 (C. C. A. 2d, 1942), held that this "but"
clause "is intended to make it clear that this jurisdiction
extends even to local facilities where the Act provides for
their regulation, as it does in the case of accounting practices." This seems to get the cart before the horse, for
whether the Act provides for such regulation depends on
whether the facilities are under the jurisdiction of the
Commission; the Commission's jurisdiction does not depend on some independent application of the regulatory
provisions. But the cited decision, pointing out that one of
the several types of facilities mentioned as exempt in the
"but" clause, i. e., those "used only for transmission in intrastate commerce," could not possibly be used for interstate transmission, rejected the whole provision to avoid
a "foolish interpretation." It concluded, "The 'but'
clause then shows up not as one reducing jurisdiction but
as a negatively worded confirmation of the Commission's
jurisdiction, in certain circumstances, over the facilities
mentioned in the 'but' clause." 8 The Commission takes
much the same position here.
It is hard for us to believe that Congress meant us to
read "shall have jurisdiction" where it had carefully writ8 The statement was not decisive of the result, which rested on an
alternative ground; and the court did recognize need for the further
step of finding that the generating facilities were used as facilities for
interstate wholesale sales, and therefore were within § 201 (b). The
court below failed expressly to find existence of jurisdictional facilities under § 201 (b). The quoted statement reads in full:
"Moreover, among the facilities described in the 'but' clause of
§ 201 (b), are those used 'only for the transmission . . . in intrastate
commerce'; as such facilities could not possibly be among those used
for interstate transmission or interstate wholesale sales, the 'but' clause
becomes foolish if interpreted as carving out of the authority granted
in the earlier part of the same sentence the facilities described in the
'but' clause. Such a foolish interpretation is avoided by giving effect
to a phrase in the 'but' clause, i. e., 'except as specifically provided

ten "but shall not have jurisdiction."

The command

"thou shalt not" is usually rendered as to forbid and we
think here it was employed without subtlety or contortion
and in its usual sense. If otherwise in doubt this provision
should be read in harmony with the policy provision. So
read, its terms seem plainly to state circumstances under
which the Commission shall not have jurisdiction. As
such it is the provision which loomed importantly in the
minds and speech of its sponsors, perhaps was necessary
to get the bill passed, and is one which the Commission
must observe and the courts must enforce.
This bill came before Congress as prepared by the staff

of the Commission, couched largely in the technical language of the electric art. Federal jurisdiction was to follow
the flow of electric energy, an engineering and scientific,
rather than a legalistic or governmental, test. Technology of the business is such that if any part of a supply

of electric energy comes from outside of a state it is, or
may be, present in every connected distribution facility.
Every facility from generator to the appliance for consumption may thus be called one for transmitting such
interstate power. By this test the cord from a light plug

to a toaster on the breakfast table is a facility for transmission of interstate energy if any part of the load is generated without the state. It has never been questioned
that technologically generation, transmission, distribution
and consumption are so fused and interdependent that the
in this Part or the Part next following [sections 824-825r of this title].'
The 'but' clause then shows up not as one reducing jurisdiction but as
a negatively worded confirmation of the Commission's jurisdiction, in
certain circumstances, over the facilities mentioned in the 'but' clause.
In other words, the 'but' clause is to be construed as if it read:
'Wherever it is so specifically provided in Parts II and III, the Commission shall have jurisdiction over the facilities used for generation,
for local distribution, for intrastate transmission, etc.'" Hartford
Electric Light Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 131 F. 2d 953, 962.

whole enterprise is within the reach of the commerce
power of Congress, either on the basis that it is, or that it
affects, interstate commerce, if at any point it crosses a
state line. Such a broad and undivided base for jurisdiction of the Power Commission would be quite unobjectionable and perhaps highly salutary if the United States
were a unitary government and the only conflicting interests to be considered were those of the regulated
company.
But state lines and boundaries cut across and subdivide
what scientifically or economically viewed may be a single
enterprise. Congress is acutely aware of the existence and
vitality of these state governments. It sometimes is
moved to respect state rights and local institutions even
when some degree of efficiency of a federal plan is thereby
sacrificed. Congress may think it expedient to avoid
clashes between state and federal officials in administering
an act such as we have here. Conflicts which lead state
officials to stand shoulder to shoulder With private corporations making common cause of resistance to federal
authority may be thought to be prejudicial to the ends
sought by an act and regulation more likely to be successful, even though more limited, if it has local support.
Congress may think complete centralization of control of
the electric industry likely to overtax administrative
capacity of a federal commission. It may, too, think it
wise to keep the hand of state regulatory bodies in this
business, for the "insulated chambers of the states" are
still laboratories where many lessons in regulation may be
learned by trial and error on a small scale without involving a whole national industry in every experiment.
But whatever reason or combination of reasons led Congress to put the provision in the Act, we think it meant
what it said by the words "but shall not have jurisdiction,
except as specifically provided in this Part or the Part
next following . . .over facilities used in local distribu-

CONNECTICUT CO. v. POWER COMM'N. 531

Opinion of the Court.

tion." Congress by these terms plainly was trying to
reconcile the claims of federal and of local authorities and
to apportion federal and state jurisdiction over the industry. To define the scope of state controls, Congress
employed terms of limitation perhaps less scientific, less
precise, less definite than the terms of the grant of federal
power. The expression "facilities used in local distribution" is one of relative generality. But as used in this
Act it is not a meaningless generality in the light of our
history and the structure of our government. We hold the
phrase to be a limitation on jurisdiction and a legal
standard that must be given effect in this case in addition
to the technological transmission test.
Nor do we think the exemption of "facilities used in
local distribution" exempts only those which do not carry
any trace of out-of-state energy. Congress has said without qualification that the Commission shall not, unless
specifically authorized elsewhere in the Act, have jurisdiction "over facilities used in local distribution." To
construe this as meaning that, even if local, facilities come
under jurisdiction of the Federal Commission because
power from out of state, however trifling, comes into the
system, would nullify the exemption and as a practical
matter would transfer to federal jurisdiction the regulation of many local companies that we think Congress
intended to leave in state control. It does not seem important whether out-of-state energy gets into local distribution facilities. They may carry no energy except
extra-state energy and still be exempt under the Act. The
test is whether they are local distribution facilities. There
is no specific provision for federal jurisdiction over accounting except as to "public utilities." The order must
stand or fall on whether this company owned facilities
that were used in transmission of interstate power and
which were not facilities used in local distribution.

532

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

324 U. S.

Since the Court of Appeals considered irrelevant the
jurisdictional test which we find to be imposed by Congress, the inquiry on review has not proceeded under a
correct rule of law and it follows that the judgment of the
Court of Appeals must be reversed.
Whether the Commission's decision was reached under
the same misapprehension of the law of its jurisdiction is
not made so clear from its findings or opinion. Of course
under the Act "The finding of the Commission as to the
facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive." § 313 (b). The Commission has found that
each of the facilities in question is "used for the transmission of electric energy purchased as aforesaid from the
Connecticut Power Company, as distinguished from local
distribution thereof." It has not, however, made an
explicit finding that these facilities are not used in local
distribution; and we are in doubt whether by application
of the statute as herein construed it could have done so.
We have said, and it is applicable to this case, that "Where
a federal agency is authorized to invoke an overriding
federal power except in certain prescribed situations and
then to leave the problem to traditional state control, the
existence of federal authority to act should appear affirmatively and not rest on inference alone." Yonkers v.
United States, 320 U. S. 685, 692; Floridav. United States,
282 U. S. 194, 211-12; cf. Palmer v. Massachusetts, 308
U. S. 79, 84; Federal Trade Commission v. Bunte Bros.,
312 U. S. 349, 351. Nothing except explicit findings excluding the grounds of state control gives assurance that
the bounds of federal jurisdiction have been accurately
understood and fully respected, and that state power has
been considerately and deliberately overlapped.
The findings and opinion of the Commission leave us
in doubt, to say the least, as to whether what we consider
limitations on the jurisdiction of the Commission were so
considered by it. The only specific reference to the sub-

Opinion of the Court.

ject is the statement that "Respondent's contentions that
it is subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Connecticut and therefore not subject to the regulation provided by the Federal Power Act
must be rejected," citing Northwestern Electric Co. v.
Federal Power Commission, 125 F. 2d 882, and In the
Matter of Hartford Electric Light Co., 2 F. P. C. 502,
aff'd, 131 F. 2d 953. In both of those cases factual differences in reference to the status of the company as a public
utility were involved, and we agree with the Commission
that once a company is properly found to be a "public
utility" under the Act the fact that a local commission
may also have regulatory power does not preclude exercise of the Commission's functions. Cf. Northwestern
Electric Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 321 U. S. 119.
But such a rejection of state control as grounds of exemption must be preceded by the finding, giving due weight
to the policy declaration in doubtful cases, that the company in question is a "public utility" by reason of ownership of facilities not used in local distribution.
In determining this the Commission announced and
applied a rule which appears to be one of law as to interstate transmission: "Such transmission, in our opinion,
extends from the generator, where generation is complete
[citing Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, 286 U. S. 165,
181] to the point where the function of conveyance in
bulk over a distance, which is the essential characteristic
of 'transmission,' is completed and the process of subdividing the energy to serve ultimate consumers, which is
the characteristic of 'local distribution,' is begun [citing
Southern Gas Corp. v. Alabama, 301 U. S. 148, 155; and
East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, 283 U. S. 465,
471] ."
The Southern and East Ohio cases both involved natural gas transportation into a state and sales of gas at
retail therein. Each was a tax case in which the state

asserted that the sales within the state constituted an
intrastate business which in one case would support a state
levy of an annual franchise tax based on the actual
amount of capital employed in the state; and in the other,
an excise tax based on gross receipts from the business
within the state. The companies each contended that
sales made to consumers within the state were still within
interstate commerce and hence there was no state jurisdiction to tax. In neither case was this Court required to
determine the exact point at which interstate commerce
ceased and intrastate commenced. It was required to find
only some "doing of business" within the state in order
to sustain the constitutionality of the statutes involved.
In both cases it upheld the power of the state to tax and
in both. held that the distribution at low pressure was a
local business for taxation purposes as distinguished from
transmission in interstate commerce. But a holding that
distributing gas at low pressure to consumers is a local
business is not a holding that the process of reducing it
from high to low pressure is not also part of such local business. In so far as the Commission found in these cases a
rule of law which excluded from the business of local distribution the process of reducing energy from high to low
voltage in subdividing it to serve ultimate consumers, the
Commission has misread the decisions of this Court. No
such rule of law has been laid down.
But for such an erroneous view of the law established
by our decisions it seems doubtful if the Commission
would have reached the conclusion that it did upon this
record. Nor is it clear that if it were reached it would be
supported by substantial evidence. Expert testimony
received by the Commission on the subject from the Commission's own experts seems to have been predicated upon
the Commission's understanding of the law. It is not
for us to make an original appraisal of the facts. We do
not therefore undertake to decide as an original matter

Opinion of the Court.

whether the facilities in question are or are not facilities
which can subject the Company to the Act.
Nor do we undertake to pass upon the contention of the
Government that even if the present facilities do not constitute a sufficient basis for federal jurisdiction the operation of other facilities since abandoned subjects the Company to the accounting order of the Commission for the
period of January 1, 1937, when it became effective, until
June 1, 1941 or some other date, depending on the facility
found to be the basis of jurisdiction. The Company contends that to make it install an expensive system of accounting for a period that was short and has already expired would be a mere waste of time and money and would
be of no practical benefit. The Commission contends that
the accounting requirements and information would tend
to discourage further write-ups and inflation of accounts
and would amount to "regulation by the informatory
process." It contends that this company has been guilty
of accounting abuses in the nature of write-ups and the
creation of fictitious surpluses which would be eliminated
or at least discouraged by an application of its uniform
system of accounts. The Company denies that such
abuses exist. It is not, however, contended that Congress
has conferred any jurisdiction upon the Commission to
reach accounting abuses when and if they exist except as
to companies which own facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. In other companies the correction of these abuses, if they exist, is left to the state government, which has this company completely within its
power and whose constituents are the sufferers by any
abuses that may exist. We will not undertake to make
an original finding as to jurisdiction for a period, any more
than as to jurisdiction at the present time.
Another contention made by the Company may be
shortly disposed of. It is contended that the volume of
energy passing over certain of these facilities is insignifi-

cant in proportion to the total. Only about one-fifth of one
per cent of all the energy received and generated by the
Company throughout the State of Connecticut was transmitted out of the state during the time of the connection
of Fishers Island with the Borough of Groton. Congress
appears to have left to the Commission's sound administrative discretion to determine whether or not to assert
its authority in such situations. Congress annually receives a report of the Commission's work and appropriates
the funds for its continuance. If it thinks the Commission is over-extending its attention to trivial situations it
has ready means of control in its hands. The wisdom of
its work is not our concern, but only its legal justification.
We do not find that Congress has conditioned the jurisdiction of the Commission upon any particular volume or
proportion of interstate energy involved, and we do not
think it would be appropriate to supply such a jurisdictional limitation by construction.
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed with instructions to remand the cause
to the Federal Power Commission for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

The findings and opinion of the Federal Power Commission in this case make clear that they are substantially
and reasonably rooted in fact and law and that proper respect has been shown for jurisdictional limitations. Remand of the case to the Commission for further consideration thus can only serve to produce needless delay and
to force the Commission to make certain minor and unnecessary changes in its written opinion. Cf. dissenting

CONNECTICUT CO. v. POWER COMM'N. 537
515

MURPHY,

J., dissenting.

The basic jurisdictional fact necessary to sustain the imposition on petitioner of the Commission's accounting
standards is that petitioner be a public utility within the
meaning of the Federal Power Act. In the setting of this
case petitioner must thus be found to own or operate facilities for the "transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce." § 201 (b). Nowhere in the Act has
Congress defined "transmission" or "facilities" other than
to say in § 201 (c) that "electric energy shall be held to be
transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a
State and consumed at any point outside thereof." The
Commission therefore has the duty in the first instance
of interpreting and applying these terms to the factual
situation confronting it. A court's function in reviewing
this jurisdictional determination is necessarily limited to
ascertaining whether that determination has warrant in
the record and a reasonable basis in law, giving due weight
to the fact that the Commission is an expert body designated by Congress and specially equipped to grapple with
the highly technical problems arising in this field. Labor
Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U. S. 111, 130, 131.
The Commission here has found that petitioner owns
and operates an electric utility system in the State of
Connecticut. It is undisputed that electric energy generated in Massachusetts is transmitted over the wires of
other companies to petitioner's facilities at Bristol, Connecticut. In order to transmit power economically for
such a long distance, it is necessary to raise the voltage
and reduce the current in Massachusetts as the energy
starts its interstate journey. But the high voltage needed
for transit purposes cannot be utilized by consumers. It
therefore is necessary to employ apparatus at the receiving end of the interstate transmission to lower the voltage.
Petitioner accordingly maintains step-down transformers
and substation facilities at Bristol for that purpose. After
the voltage is lowered, the energy is subdivided and dis-

tributed over petitioner's wires to consumers in and
around Bristol.
The Commission concluded that the functions of the
Bristol step-down transformers and substation facilities
constitute transmission of energy in interstate commerce
since it felt that, in its opinion, such transmission "extends from the generator, where generation is complete,
to the point where the function of conveyance in bulk
over a distance, which is the essential characteristic of
'transmission,' is completed and the process of subdividing
the energy to serve ultimate consumers, which is the characteristic of 'local distribution,' is begun." In other
words, the Commission viewed the interstate transmission as complete only after the energy is converted back
into a form suitable for local distribution and use and the
facilities used for such conversion purposes are necessarily
facilities for interstate transmission.
, The jurisdictional determination of the Commission
must therefore stand or fall upon the validity of its analysis of when long-distance transmission of electrical
energy across state lines is at an end. Only if we can
point to an absence of any substantial evidence to support
the Commission's view or if we can find legal or statutory
principles compelling the opposite view can we justifiably
say that the Commission had no jurisdiction in this case
or that remand should be made to the Commission for
further proceedings. But the Commission's view cannot
be undermined on either basis and it should therefore be
affirmed.
. Certainly there is ample testimony in this case
by engineers to the effect that the Bristol substation equipment
constitutes "facilities for transmission of electric energy
in interstate commerce," as distinguished from "facilities
used in local distribution." And the very fact that the
Commission, with all its accumulated wisdom and experience, is of the opinion that interstate transmission ceases

CONNECTICUT CO. v. POWER COMM'N. 539
515

MURPHY,

J., dissenting.

only after the transmitted energy has been converted into
a form suitable for local distribution and use is not without
weight and significance.
From a legal standpoint, the Commission made no plain
error. Clearly no opinion in this Court has purported to
decide at what precise point interstate transmission of
electrical energy ends and local distribution commences.
This seems to be a novel point insofar as legal precedent is
concerned. The Commission's conclusion in this respect
hardly seems so unreasonable and unsound as to require
us to hold, as a matter of law, that interstate transmission
ends just before the voltage is decreased. And this Court
does not pretend so to hold in this case.
The Court criticizes the Commission and remands the
case to it, however, mainly because it cited Southern Gas
Corp. v. Alabama, 301 U. S. 148, 155, and East Ohio Gas
Co. v. Tax Commission, 283 U. S. 465, 471, in a footnote
in support of its proposition that interstate transmission
ends only after the energy is converted back into a form
suitable for local distribution. It is said that the Commission erroneously assumed that those cases set forth a
rule of law which excluded the process of reducing energy
from high to low voltage in subdividing it to serve ultimate consumers from the business of local distribution.
But even assuming that these two cases do not enunciate
such a rule and do not directly support the Commission's
proposition, it does not follow that the Commission committed reversible error by citing them in a footnote. The
Commission's proposition was grounded not on these two
cases but upon the testimony in the record and its own
knowledge and experience pertaining to electrical transmission. This is plainly revealed by the use of the phrase
"in our opinion" in the sentence setting forth the Commission's distinction between interstate transmission and
local distribution. The slight reference to the Southern
Gas and East Ohio cases was at most for purposes of

324 U. S.

analogy and cannot serve to impair the true underlying
basis of the Commission's proposition. Presumably all
the Commission need do on remand in this respect is to
remove the footnote reference to these cases-a fact that
makes obvious the proposition that more than an irrelevant or even erroneous citation of a case should be required before we are justified in reversing an administrative determination and sending it back for further
consideration.
The Court also deals at great length with the policy
declaration in § 201 (a) of the Act that federal regulation
is "to extend only to those matters which are not subject
to regulation by the States" and with the "but" clause in
§ 201 (b), which states that the Commission shall not
have jurisdiction, except as specially provided, over certain facilities, including those used in local distribution.
But neither of these provisions is controlling in this case
where the Commission has made a clear and supportable
finding that petitioner is a public utility within the meaning of the Act and where the only federal regulation
sought to be imposed is the accounting requirements of
§ 301 (a).
It may be conceded that this Court in Jersey Central
Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 319 U. S. 61, did not
read out of the Act the policy declaration in § 201 (a).
But it did make clear that the declaration, which speaks
solely in terms of "regulation," was directed solely at proposed federal regulation of the generation, transmission
and sale of electric energy rather than at proposed federal
regulation of the corporate financial arrangements of utilities, such as their accounting methods. 319 U. S. at 74, 75.
Congress did not intend, in other words, to intrude upon
state regulation of generation, transmission and sale of
energy but it did intend to impose financial regulations on
public utilities engaged in interstate transmission of
energy even though states might also impose financial

CONNECTICUT CO. v. POWER COMM'N. 541

MURPHY,

J., dissenting.

regulations. This means, under the facts of this case, that
interstate transmission of energy is a proper test of
whether federal accounting standards may be imposed.
What sort of transmission may be a proper subject of federal regulation in and of itself if the State of Connecticut
already regulates the transmission facilities is not in issue.
The Commission clearly did not misconceive the meaning
of this policy declaration and, in light of this Court's
opinion, it apparently need do no more than spell out its
recognition of the scope and present inapplicability of the
declaration.
Nor did the Commission do violence to the "but" clause
of § 201 (b). Here the Commission, following the rule
stated in the Jersey Centralcase, 319 U. S. at 73, that "the
determinative fact is the ownership of facilities used in
transmission," has found that petitioner is a public utility
since it owns and operates facilities used in interstate
transmission of energy. The Commission thus has jurisdiction over petitioner for accounting purposes. The
denial of jurisdiction in the "but" clause where facilities
are used for transmission of energy in local commerce has
no relevance in this case, an obvious fact which the Commission apparently now must make explicit on remand.
The Commission is dealing here with a difficult marginal case. The precise dividing line between interstate
transmission and local distribution can only be drawn
by those familiar with the engineering and electrical problems involved. The problem in this case, moreover, is
a relatively unique one. An informal survey by the Commission has shown that out of a total of about 1,000 privately owned electric utilities there are only 12 which own
or operate step-down substation facilities for taking outof-state energy and which would not otherwise be public
utilities under the Act. The problem is thus one peculiarly within the competence of the Commission, which has
shown no desire to use the principle it has enunciated in

this case and could not use it as a vehicle for assuming

unjustified jurisdiction over the facilities of all the local
distributing companies in the nation. It has given proper
respect to the dictates of Congress relative to state regulation. We should therefore affirm its action in this case
without burdening it with requirements of artistic refinement and of negations of the applicability of irrelevant
statutory provisions.

No. 354. Argued February 2, 1945.-Decided March 26, 1945.
Article 115-3 of Treasury Regulations 101, promulgated under the
Revenue Act of 1938, requires that, for computing under § 112 (b)
(7) (E) the amount of "earnings and profits" distributed by a corporation as liquidating dividends, with respect to securities which
the corporation had acquired by tax-free exchanges for its own stock
and had later sold, the basis be the transferor's cost rather than the
value of the securities at the time of their acquisition by the corporation. Held:
1. The regulation was reasonable and a valid exercise of the rulemaking power. P. 546.
2. Though the Tax Court relied on § 501 of the Second Revenue
