CANADIAN AVIATOR, LIMITED v. UNITED
STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 279. Argued January 5, 1945.-Decided February 26, 1945.
The Public Vessels Act provides that "a libel in personam in admiralty
may be brought against the United States . . . for damages caused
by a public vessel of the United States . . ." Held:
1. The remedy afforded by the Act is not confined to cases where
the public vessel is the "physical instrument" by which the "physical
damage" is done. P. 222.
2. Damage "caused by a public vessel" embraces damage resulting
from negligence of personnel in the operation of the vessel. P. 224.
3. The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158; The Vera Cruz, No. 2, 9 L. R.,
Prob. Div. 96 [1884]; Dobson v. United States, 27 F. 2d 807; and
O'Neal v. United States, 11 F. 2d 869, distinguished. P. 225.
4. The Act authorizes the courts to apply principles of in rem as
well as in personam liability in admiralty, even though it denies
a maritime lien; which is in accord with the broad purpose of the
Act as evidenced in its legislative history. P. 227.
5. A complaint alleging that, while following directly astern of
a public vessel as ordered by Naval authorities, complainant's vessel was damaged when it struck a submerged wreck, and that the
accident resulted solely from the negligence of the public vessel and
its crew, stated a cause of action under the Act. P. 228.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
This writ brings here for review a libel filed by the petitioner, a Canadian corporation and owner of the steamship
Cavelier, against the respondent, the United States Government, to recover, under the provisions of the Public
Vessels Act, 1925, 43 Stat. 1112,1 damages alleged to have
been suffered by the Cavelier due to the negligent operation of a public vessel of the United States. The United
States District Court dismissed the libel on the ground
that it failed to state a cause of action within the Public
Vessels Act, 1925, for which the United States had consented to be sued.2 The Circuit Court of Appeals, one
judge dissenting, affirmed the District Court.'
The jurisdiction of the United States District Court is
based on ยง 24 of the Judicial Code. The petition for certiorari was granted, 323 U. S. 688, because the Circuit
Court of Appeals decided a question of general importance relating to the construction of a federal statute. Jurisdiction of this Court rests on ยง 240 (a) of the Judicial
Code.
On August 4, 1942, the petitioner, the owners of the
steamship Cavelier, filed a libel in personam in admiralty
in a federal district court against the United States to
recover for damages to its ship, the Cavelier, alleged to
have been caused by the negligent operation of the United
States Naval patrol boat, YP 249, a public vessel of the
United States. The libel averred that on July 7, 1942, the
Cavelier, while en route from Canada to Jamaica, was
ordered by United States Naval authorities to enter Dela143 Stat. 1112. Section 1 provides: "That a libel in personam in
admiralty may be brought against the United States .

ages caused by a public vessel of the United States, and for compensation for towage and salvage services, including contract salvage,

ware Bay. Upon approaching the bay, the Cavelier received further instructions from the naval authorities that
in her transit of the waters constituting the entrance to
the bay, the Cavelier was to follow directly astern of the
patrol boat, YP 249, a public vessel of the United States.
While following directly astern of the YP 249, as ordered,
the Cavelier struck a submerged wreck and sustained serious damages. It was further alleged that the collision
with the wreck was due "solely to the fault and negligence
of the United States vessel YP 249 and those in charge of
her."
The libel also stated that petitioner, a Canadian
corporation, elected to have its suit proceed in accordance
with principles of libels in personam and in rem; that in
similar circumstances the Government of the Dominion
of Canada allows nationals of the United States to sue in
its courts.
The respondent, United States, appeared specially and
sought to have the libel dismissed because it failed to state
a cause of action for which the United States had consented to be sued. Petitioner, the libelant, opposed this
action, relying on ยง 1 of the Public Vessels Act, 1925, which
provided that a "libel in personam in admiralty may be
brought against the United States . . . for damages
caused by a public vessel of the United States . . ." I The
federal district court dismissed the libel on the ground that
the accident alleged in the libel was not caused by the
"negligent operation of the vessel," that the vessel was
' The petitioner's libel alleged the following specific acts of negligence:
"1. She was not in charge of a competent person.
"2. She failed to keep a good look-out.
"3. She failed to guide the Cavelier safely through the waters constituting the entrance to Delaware Bay.
"4. She led the Cavelierdirectly over a submerged wreck.
"5. She failed to give the Cavelier proper or adequate guidance as
to making a safe entrance into Delaware Bay."

not the "efficient cause" of the accident but that the accident arose from the "personal and independent negligence
of its officers." The court held that the Act authorized
suit only where the public vessel was the proximate cause
of the damage.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the action of the
district court on the theory that the phrase in the Act
"caused by a public vessel" meant caused by those in
charge of the vessel, with the vessel as the "noxious instrument," the "physical instrument," by which the physical damage was done; that in the instant case the physical
cause was the submerged wreck. The Circuit Court also
held that the Act did not authorize recovery on the admiralty principles of in rem liability.
The dismissal by the lower court of petitioner's libel
raises three questions for consideration by this Court:
Does the Public Vessels Act, 1925, authorize suit against
the United States where the public vessel is not the physical cause, the "physical instrument" by which the damage
is done; that is, is the Act confined to cases involving the
collision situation? If not, does the Act, which authorizes
the filing of a libel in personam against the United States,
authorize recovery in such suit on admiralty principles
of in rem as well as in personam liability? Finally, if the
Act authorizes recovery on admiralty principles in rein
and in personam, does petitioner's libel state a cause of
action under those principles of admiralty law?
The Public Vessels Act, .1925, was the last in a series
of statutes directed generally at affording private vessel
owners an adequate and efficient remedy for damages arising from negligent operation of ships owned by the United
States.' Prior to 1916 a private owner whose ship was

damaged by negligent operation of a vessel owned or operated by the United States could not recover from the
United States for damages suffered due to the United
States' immunity from suit. On the other hand, the
United States could sue private owners for damages arising from their negligence. Recognizing the inequities of
this situation, Congress passed numerous private acts
granting relief in a particular case where a private vessel
was damaged by negligent operation of a government ship.
The delays, coupled with the inconvenience to Congress
of handling each claim by separate bill, led Congress to
provide in the Shipping Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 728, that
Shipping Board vessels while employed as merchant vessels were subject to "all laws, regulations, and liabilities
governing merchant vessels" regardless of the fact that
the United States owned or had an interest in them.7
In The Lake Monroe, 250 U. S. 246, this Court held that
this statutory waiver of sovereign immunity from suit
subjected Shipping Board merchant vessels to proceedings in rem in admiralty. Since the arrest and seizure
of a vessel incident to an admiralty proceeding in rem
proved embarrassing, Congress, in 1920), adopted the
Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525,8 which provided
Section 9 provides, in part, 39 Stat. 730-31:
"Every vessel purchased, chartered, or leased from the board ...
while employed solely as merchant vessels shall be subject to all laws,
regulations, and liabilities governing merchant vessels, whether the
United States be interested therein as owner, in whole or in part,
or hold any mortgage, lien, or other interest therein."

generally that a "libel in personam" for damages could be

ยง 2; but that vessels subject to suit under the Act should
not be subject to seizure or arrest, ยง 1. Although ยง 2 of
the Act limited suit to the "filing of a libel in personam,"

to include "public vessels" as well as merchant vessels of
the United States. Apparently fearing that such an extension of the scope of the bill would delay passage, the
Suits in Admiralty Act was adopted, its provisions being
confined to "merchant vessels." 11
After the introduction of several bills' 2 dealing with
suits against public vessels, Congress, in 1925, adopted
the Public Vessels Act, 43 Stat. 1112. It provided that a
"libel in personam in admiralty may be brought against
the United States . . . for damages caused by a public

vessel of the United States." ยง 1." Venue of such suits
is laid in the district court for the district "in which the
vessel or cargo charged with creating the liability is found
within the United States." "4 ยง 2. It was also provided
that suits under the Act "shall be subject to and proceed in

in so far as the same are not inconsistent herewith . . ." "5

The Act also specified that no suit may be brought by a
national of a foreign government unless said foreign government, under similar circumstances, allows nationals of
the United States to sue in its courts, ยง 5; ยงยง 8 and 9 of the
Act contain provisions similar to those in the Suits in
Admiralty Act, providing that the statute should not be
construed to recognize the existence of a lien against a
public vessel and conferring on the United States all exemptions and limitations of liability accorded by law to
owners of private vessels."
First. Respondent contends that ยง 1 of the Public Vessels Act authorizing suits against the United States "for
damages caused by a public vessel" should be construed
to apply only in cases where the public vessel is the "physical instrument" by which the "physical damage" is done,
e. g. collision; that therefore petitioner's libel does not lie
under the Act. Such a construction narrowly limits the
Act's relief. We conclude that such a narrow interpretation of the Act is not justifiable. While the general history of the Act as outlined above does not establish that
the statute necessarily extends to the non-collision cases
in view of the rule of strict construction of statutory
waiver of sovereign immunity, United States v. Sherwood, 312 U. S. 584, 586; Eastern TransportationCo. v.
United States, supra, we think Congressional adoption
of broad statutory language authorizing suit was deliberate and is not to be thwarted by an unduly restrictive
interpretation. See The Lake Monroe, 250 U. S. 246;

payment of interest."

Land Bank v. Priddy,295 U. S. 229, 231.
In 1924, H. R. 6989 was introduced in the House of
Representatives, its provisions being similar 17 to those
of the Public Vessels Act as adopted, with this material
difference: Section 1 of that bill authorized suit against
the United States "for damages caused by collision by a
public vessel." (Italics added.) On reference to the
House Committee on Claims, a substitute bill, H. R'
9535, was reported to the House.18 This bill provided for
suits "for damages caused by a public vessel of the United
States." This bill with the latter phrase included subsequently became the Public Vessels Act. This change in
the language of the Act prior to its adoption convinces
us that Congress intended to authorize suits in other than
collision cases. The sponsors of the bill in both houses of
Congress understood that it extended to cases where damage was done "by collision, or other fault of Government
vessels and Government agents." 19 Moreover, Congres'TH. R. 6989, 68th Cong., 2d Sess., provided: "That a libel in personam in admiralty may be brought against the United States, ....
for damages caused by collision by a public vessel of the United
States, . . ."

This bill was highly similar to the Public Vessels Act, 1925, 43 Stat.
1112, as finally adopted. A material variance, other than the one
mentioned above, was a provision making the consent of the Attorney General a condition precedent to suit under the bill.

sional reports on this bill and the course of discussion in
the numerous hearings held on predecessor measures to
the present bill, indicates that authority to sue was not
to be limited to cases where the vessel was the physical
instrument that caused the physical damage. 0
The use of the phrase "caused by a public vessel" constitutes an adoption by Congress of the customary legal
terminology of the admiralty law which refers to the vessel
as causing the harm although the actual cause is the negligence of the personnel in the operation of the ship. Such
personification of the vessel, treating it as a juristic person
whose acts and omissions, although brought about by her
personnel, are personal acts of the ship for which, as a
juristic person, she is legally responsible, has long been
recognized by this Court. United States v. Brig Malek
Adhel, 2 How. 210, 233-34; The China, 7 Wall. 53, 68;
Ralli v. Troop, 157 U. S.386, 402-3; The John G. Stevens,
170 U. S. 113, 120; The Barnstable, 181 U. S. 464, 467.
That such was the meaning attributed to this phrase is
further evidenced by ยง 2 of the Act, relating to venue,
which provides that venue shall lie in the district "in
which the vessel or cargo charged with creating the liability is found." 43 Stat. 1112. The consent to suit embodied in the Act thus extends to cases where the negligence of the personnel of a public vessel in the operation of
the vessel causes damage to other ships, their cargoes, and
trict court and prosecute his action. It provides for the appearance
of the Attorney General of the United States, and all maritime accidents of any kind resulting from collision, and so on, are taken care
of.2 0 A great deal of money would be saved to the Government."

personnel, regardless of physical contact between the two
ships,2 and where principles of admiralty law impose
liability on private parties. There seems no logical reason
for allowing recovery for collision and refusing recovery
for damages caused by other movements of the offending
vessel.
The fact that the Committee reports on the bill state
that the "chief purpose" of the Act is to authorize recovery in collision cases, that the departmental letters attached to the report consider principally the "collision"
situation, does not require that the statute should be so
limited.2 Respondent relies on The Osceola, 189 U. S.
158, in which it was held that a Wisconsin statute imposing liability "for all damages . . . done to persons or
property by such ship," did not apply to injuries suffered
by a member of a ship's crew arising from the negligence
of the master of the vessel, since the damage was not "done
by the ship herself, as the offending thing, . . ." 189 U. S.
158, 176. Since that case involved a suit by a member of
the crew against his employer-owner of the vessel, the
holding in that decision on its facts is clearly inapplicable
to the instant case. Moreover, the language in the Wisconsin statute is narrower in scope than that in the Public
Vessels Act, 1925, which refers generally to "damages
caused by a public vessel." Furthermore, the legislative
history of the Public Vessels Act requires a different result
in so far as the Osceola case interprets the Wisconsin statute to apply only to cases where the vessel is itself the
physical cause of the damage. These latter two considerations serve also to distinguish The Vera Cruz, No. 2, 9

United States as employer.
. Second. Petitioner, evidently relying on ยง 2 of the Act,
states in its libel that it elects to have the action proceed
on principles of in rem as well as in personam liability.3
As the Circuit Court of Appeals apparently holds that
the Act does not authorize recovery on principles of in
rem liability because of the statutory denial of a maritime
lien, we turn to a consideration of this holding. Does the
Public Vessels Act which authorizes filing of a "libel in
personam" authorize the courts to apply principles of in
rem as well as in personam liability in admiralty? 24.As
was indicated, p. 219 supra, this Court held that the Suits
in Admiralty Act, which also authorizes filing of a "libel
in personam" authorizes the courts to grant judgment on
in rem as well as in personam principles, except that the
government vessel was not subject to seizure or arrest.
See Admiralty Rules, Supreme Court, Rule 14:
"In all suits for pilotage or damage by collision, the libellant may
proceed in rem against the ship and/or in personam against the master
and/or the owner."
2 See note 1, supra. At the time of the Committee reports on H. R.
23

9535 (which when adopted became the Public Vessels Act), the courts
had not yet interpreted the Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525, to
authorize recovery on admiralty principles of both in rem and in personam liability. See Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States,

272 U. S.675 (1927). We find no discussion of whether ยง 2 of the
Public Vessels Act imported both principles into its text. The problem had been adverted to in the Attorney General's letters of opinion
to the committees considering the problem. H. Rep. No. 913, p. 12,

Opinion of the Court.

Section 3 of that Act, "Procedure in cases of libel in personam," 25 specifically authorizes a libelant, if he so elects,
to proceed in accordance with principles of libels in rem
if it appears that had the vessel been privately owned a
libel in rem might be maintained; election to so proceed
is not to preclude the libelant from seeking relief in personam in the same suit. Although the Public Vessels Act
does not have a similar provision, ยง 2 of the Public Vessels Act expressly provides that "suits shall be subject to
and proceed in accordance with the provisions" of the Suits
in Admiralty Act, "in so far as the same are not inconsistent" with the provisions of the Public Vessels Act.2" Since
there is nothing in the Public Vessels Act that is inconsistent with this provision of the Suits in Admiralty Act,
we hold that the incorporation clause applies. Other provisions of the Public Vessels Act support such incorporation. Authority is given to sue generally "in admiralty";
this broad generic term implies a right to invoke principles of in rem and in personam liability. Furthermore,
in Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States, supra,
we held that authority to resort to both types of principles of admiralty liability was borne out by the fact
that the Suits in Admiralty Act provided that the United
States should be entitled to all the exemptions accorded to
private persons under admiralty law. We there held:
"The necessary implication is that if, under the Harter
Act . . . or the Limitation of Liability Act, . . . the
United States as owner of a merchant vessel should not be
able to show performance of the conditions upon which
such statutory limitations of liability are granted, it must
assume the personal liability for negligence in such cases
exactly as a private owner would." (272 U. S. 675,
690-91.)

Opinion of the Court.

324 U. S.

The Public Vessels Act contains the same exemption provision as that in the Suits in Admiralty Act.2" This interpretation of the Act accords with the broad purpose
expressed in the Congressional hearings and reports on
the Act.2" In addition, such an interpretation accomplishes Congress' purpose to grant foreign nationals the
same rights as would be accorded our nationals in foreign
courts in a similar situation; a narrower interpretation
would limit the reciprocal effect of this Act.2"
Third. Since we hold that the Public Vessels Act was
intended to impose on the United States the same liability
(apart from seizure or arrest under a libel in rem) as is
imposed by the admiralty law on the private shipowner,
it remains to be considered whether petitioner states a
valid cause of action under general principles of admiralty law, in rem and in personam. Petitioner alleges that
the respondent's vessel, having undertaken to guide petitioner's boat, the Cavelier, through the waters at the entrance of the bay, did so in a negligent fashion causing
petitioner to strike a submerged wreck; that the accident
was caused solely by the negligence of YP 249 and its
crew. It needs no extended citation of authority to show
that where a tug negligently grounds its tow, the tug and
its owner are liable for the damages resulting therefrom.

CATLIN ET A., TRUSTEES, v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 419.

Argued February 1, 2, 1945.-Decided February 26, 1945.

1. In a proceeding instituted by a petition in the District Court for
the condemnation of land under the War Purposes Act of 1917, a
"judgment" entered upon a declaration of taking filed pursuant to
the Declaration of Taking Act of 1931, and a subsequent order denying the landowner's motion to vacate the judgment and to dismiss
the petition, held not "final decisions" under ยง 128 of the Judicial
Code and therefore not appealable. P. 232.
2. The right of the landowner to challenge the validity of the taking,
for nonconformity with the prescribed statutory purposes, was not
abrogated by the Declaration of Taking Act; but the right of appeal
in this relation may be exercised only when final judgment, disposing
of the cause in its entirety, has been rendered. P. 240.
142 F. 2d 781, affirmed.
v. Blessing, 105 U. S. 626, 630: "Nor is the term 'tort,' when used in
reference to admiralty jurisdiction, confined to wrongs or injuries
committed by direct force, but it includes wrongs suffered in consequence of the negligence or malfeasance of others, where the remedy
at common-law is by an action on the case." See also Eastern TransportationCo. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675; In re Fassett, 142 U. S.
