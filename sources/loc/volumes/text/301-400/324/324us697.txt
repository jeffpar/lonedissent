BROOKLYN SAVINGS BANK v. O'NEIL.
NO. 445.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW
YORK.*

Argued February 5, 6, 1945.-Decided April 9, 1945.
1. In the absence of a bona fide dispute between the employer and
the employee as to liability, an employee's written waiver of his
right to liquidated damages under § 16 (b) of the Fair Labor
Standards Act does not bar a subsequent action by the employee to
recover such liquidated damages. P. 707.
2. The legislative policy behind the provision of § 16 (b) for liquidated
damages, as evidenced by the legislative history of the provision and
by other provisions and the structure of the Act, shows that
Congress did not intend that an employee should be allowed to
waive his right to liquidated damages. P. 706.
3. Exceptional circumstances of the kind held to justify a waiver
agreement such as was upheld in Fort Smith & Western R. Co. v.
Mills, 253 U. S. 206, are not here involved. P. 709.
4. The right of the employee to liquidated damages under § 16 (b)
does not depend on whether the employee is compelled to sue for
minimum wages due. P. 711.
5. Absence from the Fair Labor Standards Act of a specific provision
prohibiting waivers of rights under the Act is not to be construed
as permitting such waivers. P. 712.
6. An employee's release and waiver of rights to minimum wages and
liquidated damages under the Fair Labor Standards Act, in consideration of a sum known by both employer and employee to be
less than the statutory minimum wages due, is void. P. 713.
7. It is unnecessary here to determine questions of the validity and
effect of agreements between employer and employee in settlement
of claims arising under the Act where there is a bona fide dispute
between the parties. P. 714.

MR. JUsTIcF REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
The writs of certiorari granted in these three cases present questions as to the interpretation of Section 16 (b) of
the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, at
1069, which provides that an employer who violates the

tion whether an employee subject to the terms of the Act
can waive or release his right to receive from his employer
liquidated damages under § 16 (b). Case No. 421 presents the issue of whether in a suit brought pursuant to
the provisions of § 16 (b) the employee is entitled to interest on sums recovered as wages and liquidated damages under that section. Since these three cases involve
similar problems relating to the interpretation of § 16 (b)
and the Congressional policy behind its adoption, all three
cases will be dealt with in one opinion. See also No. 462,

The petitioner, Brooklyn Savings Bank, owned and
operated an eleven-story office building in which the
respondent was employed as a night watchman during
a two-year period from November 5, 1938, to August 30,
1940. Since a substantial portion of that building was

"Any employer who violates the provisions of section 6 or section 7
of this Act shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the
amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime
compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount
as liquidated damages. Action to recover such liability may be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more
employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated, or such employee or employees may designate an agent or representative to maintain such action for and in
behalf of all employees similarly situated. The court in such action

devoted to the production of goods for commerce, the
respondent was entitled to overtime compensation under
the provisions of § 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act.'
52 Stat. 1063. No such compensation was paid at that
time. However, in November, 1942, over two years after
the respondent had left petitioner's service, the petitioner
computed the statutory overtime compensation due the
respondent and offered him a check for $423.16 in return
for a release of all of his rights under the Act. The
respondent signed the release and took the check. Since
this sum did not include any payment for liquidated damages provided for in § 16 (b) of the Act, the respondent
subsequently instituted the present proceeding in a New
York City Municipal Court to recover liquidated damages
due him under § 16 (b). The complaint was dismissed
on the grounds that respondent failed to prove a cause
of action and also that the respondent "released any claim
for liquidated damages or counsel fees." The Appellate
Term reversed, per curiam, holding that respondent was
employed in the production of goods for commerce within
2 The New York Appellate Term held that the Fair Labor Standards Act applied to the petitioner's operation of its building. This
holding was affirmed by the Appellate Division and the Court of
Appeals. See notes 5 and 6. Petitioner did not raise this issue in
his petition for certiorari.
3Section 7 (a) provides:
"No employer shall, except as otherwise provided in this section,
employ any of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce(1) for a workweek longer than forty-four hours during the
first year from the effective date of this section,
(2) for a workweek longer than forty-two hours during the
second year from such date, or
(3) for a workweek longer than forty hours after the expiration
of the second year from such date,
unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in

the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act and was
entitled therefore to recover liquidated damages by reason
of petitioner's default in making overtime payments as
required by § 7 of the Act.4 This decision was affirmed by
the New York Appellate Division,5 and by the New York
Court of Appeals." Since the New York Court of Appeals
decided a federal question of substance not heretofore
determined by this Court, we granted certiorari' limited
to the question of whether the respondent's release of all
claims and damages under the Act, given at the time he
received payment of the overtime compensation due
under the Act, is a defense to an action subsequently
brought solely to recover liquidated damages. The jurisdiction of this Court rests on § 237 (b) of the Judicial
Code.
No. 554.
The petitioner in this second case operated a box factory
in which he employed the respondent during the period
from October, 1938, the effective date of the Fair Labor
Standards Act, to November, 1942, when respondent was
discharged. During this period the respondent worked
hours in excess of the statutory maximums in effect during
this period. Petitioner failed to pay respondent time and
one-half for overtime as required by the Act. In September, 1942, the Wage and Hour Administration procured
an injunction, by consent, prohibiting the petitioner from
violating the Act. In November, 1942, the petitioner tendered the respondent $500 for wages due and owing under
the Act, the latter accepting the money and signing a

general release of all claims against petitioner under the
Act. Both parties knew at this time that more than $500
was due to respondent for minimum wages and overtime
pay under the Act. Shortly thereafter, the respondent
engaged counsel to recover the balance due him under the
Act. Petitioner, before suit was filed, tendered the balance of the statutory wages due, but respondent refused
to accept it because it did not include an equal sum for
liquidated damages. Thereupon the respondent brought
suit for $276.05, the balance of the statutory wages due
respondent, and $776.05, being liquidated damages equal
to the whole amount ($500 plus $276.05) which had
originally been unlawfully withheld. In his answer, the
petitioner pleaded settlement of respondent's claim for
$500, the release given by respondent pursuant to such
settlement, and the petitioner's subsequent tender of a
check for the deficiency in statutory minimum and overtime wages due. The District Court granted judgment
for the respondent relying on Guess v. Montague, 140 F.
2d 500, which held invalid a settlement agreement on the
part of employees to accept less than the statutory minimum wage.' The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit affirmed.'
Because the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals
decided an important question of federal law which has
not been, but should be, settled by this Court, we granted
certiorari "olimited to the question of whether there had
been a compromise of respondent's claim. Jurisdiction
of this Court rests on § 240 (a) of the Judicial Code.

Opinion of the Court.

ment of the basic statutory wages due under the Act, can
validly release and waive any further right to recover liquidated damages under the provisions of § 16 (b).11 A preliminary question arises as to whether respondent's release
was given in settlement of a bona fide dispute between the
parties with respect to coverage or amount due under the
Act or whether it constituted a mere waiver of his right to
liquidated damages. The state courts made no findings
of fact on this issue. Where a state court fails to pass on
evidence or make findings of fact because under their respective views the facts referred to are immaterial, we are
not relieved from the duty of examining the evidence for
the purpose of determining what facts reasonably might
be and presumably would be found therefrom by the state
court. Merchants' NationalBank v. Richmond, 256 U. S.
635,638; Carlsonv. Curtiss, 234 U.S. 103,105. Cf. United
Gas Co. v. Texas, 303 U. S. 123, 143; Creswill v. Knights
of Pythias, 225 U. S. 246, 261. We think the record in this
case shows that the release was not given in settlement
of a bona fide dispute between employer and employee.
Petitioner undertook to pay the respondent after our decision in Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U. S. 517, which
determined the applicability of the Fair Labor Standards
Act to building operators like the petitioner. Petitioner's
answer in the Municipal Court merely relied upon payment of the statutory liability and the release of other
claims. With the exception of the recital in the release,
there is nothing in the record which shows that the respondent's release was obtained as the result of the settlement of a bona fide dispute between the parties with respect to coverage or amount. 2 Moreover, the decision by
the New York Appellate Division was based on Rigopoulos

two years after he left the petitioner's employment that petitioner had

v. Kervan, 140 F. 2d 506, which involved waiver of right
to liquidated damages in the absence of a bona fide dispute and which expressly reserved decision on the question
of validity of a settlement where there was such a dispute
between the parties. The issue presented in No. 445 therefore is whether in the absence of a bona fide dispute between the parties as to liability, respondent's written
waiver of his right to liquidated damages under § 16 (b)
bars a subsequent action to recover liquidated damages.
We are of the opinion that it does not bar such claim. 3
It has been held in this and other courts that a statutory right conferred on a private party, but affecting the
public interest, may not be waived or released if such
waiver or release contravenes the statutory policy. Midstate HorticulturalCo. v. PennsylvaniaR. Co., 320 U. S.
356, 361; Phillips v. Grand Trunk R. Co., 236 U. S. 662,
667. Cf. Young v. Higbee Co., 324 U. S. 204, 212. Where
a private right is granted in the public interest to effectuate a legislative policy, waiver of a right so charged or
colored with the public interest will not be allowed where
it would thwart the legislative policy which it was designed to effectuate. 4 With respect to private rights
to his acceptance of the check given him by the petitioner either as to
the existence of liability under the Act or as to the amount of such
liability. Viewed most favorably petitioner's witness' testimony was
merely to the effect that the petitioner had subjective doubts as to the
existence and amount of its liability.

created by a federal statute, such as § 16 (b), the question
of whether the statutory right may be waived depends
upon the intention of Congress as manifested in the particular statute. As was stated in Midstate Horticultural
Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 320 U. S. 356, 360, "...
whether the policy of . . . [the] legislation contemplates
the one result or the other . . . is the controlling ques-

tion."

nor the debates" indicates that the question at issue was

",The provisions of § 16 (b) appeared for the first time in the bill
reported by a Conference Committee of both Houses. The Committee report simply stated, H. Rep. No. 2738, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.,
p. 33:
"Section 16 of the conference agreement provides a fine of not more
than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than 6 months, or both,
for violations of the act. No person is to be imprisoned upon conviction for a first offense. This section also provides for civil reparations for violations of the wages and hours provisions. If an employee is employed for less than the legal minimum wage, or if he is
employed in excess of the specified hours without receiving the prescribed payment for overtime, he may recover from his employer
twice the amount by which the compensation he should have received
exceeds that which he actually received."
There were three legislative reports on predecessor bills but these
bills did not contain any provision analogous to § 16 (b). S. Rep. No.
884, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. Rep. No. 1452, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.;
H. Rep. No. 2182, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.
16 As indicated in note 15, supra, § 16 (b) was first incorporated into
the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 in the bill reported out of the
Conference Committee of both Houses. The debates in both Houses
prior to adoption of the Conference report were quite brief, 83 Cong.
Rec. 9158-78, 9246-67. The only reference to § 16 (b) was by Representative Keller who stated, 83 Cong. Rec. p. 9264:
"Among the provisions for the enforcement of the act an old principle has been adopted and will be applied to new uses. If there shall

specifically considered and resolved by Congress. In the
absence of evidence of specific Congressional intent, it becomes necessary to resort to a broader consideration of the
legislative policy behind this provision as evidenced by its
legislative history and the provisions in and structure of
the Act. See Tennessee Coal Co. v. Muscoda Local, 321
U. S.590, 597; United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 11718, 122-23. Such consideration clearly shows that Congress did not intend that an employee should be allowed
to waive his right to liquidated damages.
The legislative history of the Fair Labor Standards Act
shows an intent on the part of Congress to protect certain
groups of the population from sub-standard wages and
excessive hours which endangered the national health and
well-being and the free flow of goods in interstate commerce.17 The statute was a recognition of the fact that
due to the unequal bargaining power as between employer
and employee, certain segments of the population required
federal compulsory legislation to prevent private contracts
on their part which endangered national health and efficiency and as a result the free movement of goods in interoccur violations of either the wages or hours, the employees can themselves, or by designated agent or representatives, maintain an action
in any court to recover the wages due them and in such a case the
court shall allow liquidated damages in addition to the wages due equal
to such deficient payment and shall also allow a reasonable attorney's fees and assess the court costs against the violator of the law so
that employees will not suffer the burden of an expensive lawsuit. The
provision has the further virtue of minimizing the cost of enforcement
by the Government. It is both a common-sense and economical method
of regulation. The bill has other penalties for violations and other judicial remedies, but the provision which I have mentioned puts directly into the hands of the employees who are affected by violation
the means and ability to assert and enforce their own rights, thus avoiding the assumption by Government of the sole responsibility to enforce
the act."

state commerce. 8 To accomplish this purpose standards
of minimum wages and maximum hours were provided.
Neither petitioner nor respondent suggests that the right
to the basic statutory minimum wage could be waived by
any employee subject to the Act. No one can doubt but
that to allow waiver of statutory wages by agreement
would nullify the purposes of the Act. We are of the
opinion that the same policy considerations which forbid
waiver of basic minimum and overtime wages under the
Act also prohibit waiver of the employee's right to liquidated damages.
We have previously held that the liquidated damage
provision is not penal in its nature but constitutes compensation for the retention of a workman's pay which
might result in damages too obscure and difficult of proof
for estimate other than by liquidated damages. Overnight
Motor Co. v. Missel, 316 U. S. 572. It constitutes a Congressional recognition that failure to pay the statutory
minimum on time may be so detrimental to maintenance
of the minimum standard of living "necessary for health,
efficiency and general well-being of workers" "oand to the
free flow of commerce, that double payment must be made
in the event of delay in order to insure restoration of the
worker to that minimum standard of well-being.'" Em18 The legislative debates indicate that the prime purpose of the
legislation was to aid the unprotected, unorganized and lowest paid
of the nation's working population; that is, those employees who
lacked sufficient bargaining power to secure for themselves a minimum subsistence wage. 81 Cong. Rec. 7652, 7672, 7885; 82 Cong.
Rec. 1386, 1395, 1491, 1505, 1507; 83 Cong. Rec. 7283, 7298, 9260,

20 The necessity of prompt payment to workers of wages has long
been recognized by Congress as well as by state legislatures. Numerous statutory provisions have been adopted to insure prompt payment. See for example, 33 U. S. C. § 914 (e) and (f); 46 U. S. C.

ployees receiving less than the statutory minimum are
not likely to have sufficient resources to maintain their
well-being and efficiency until such sums are paid at a
future date. The same policy which forbids waiver of the
statutory minimum as necessary to the free flow of commerce requires that reparations to restore damage done by
such failure to pay on time must be made to accomplish
Congressional purposes. Moreover, the same policy which
forbids employee waiver of the minimum statutory rate
because of inequality of bargaining power, prohibits these
same employees from bargaining with their employer in
determining whether so little damage was suffered that
waiver of liquidated damage is called for. This conclusion
is in accord with decisions of the majority of the federal
courts that have considered this question.2' This result,

moreover, avoids the difficult problems of allocation that

would arise in numerous cases where a lump sum was paid
for back wages and waiver of right to liquidated damages
and where issue was subsequently raised as to whether
there had been full payment of the basic minimum and
overtime wages specified in the Act. Nor does the instant
case involve exceptional circumstances of the kind held to
justify a waiver agreement such as was upheld in Fort
Smith & Western R. Co. v. Mills, 253 U. S. 206.
The private-public character of this right is further
borne out by an examination of the enforcement provisions of the Act. Although the difficulties of enforcement
under the Act were recognized, 2 the Administrator was
given limited enforcement powers. Criminal prosecution
was available only for willful violations-difficult to prove.
§ 16 (a). The Administrator's civil remedy lay by way
of suit for an injunction, which by its nature tends to be
prospective in operation. No power was vested in the
Administrator to bring an action at law to obtain payment
of minimum wages left unpaid and to recover damages
arising from delay in payment. Sole right to bring
such suit was vested in the employee under § 16 (b).
Although this right to sue is compensatory, it is nevertheless an enforcement provision.' And not the least effective aspect of this remedy is the possibility that an
employer who gambles on evading the Act will be liable
for payment not only of the basic minimum originally
due but also damages equal to the sum left unpaid. To
permit an employer to secure a release from the worker

who needs his wages promptly will tend to nullify the
deterrent effect which Congress plainly intended that
§ 16 (b) should have. Knowledge on the part of the employer that he cannot escape liability for liquidated damages by taking advantage of the needs of his employees
tends to insure compliance in the first place. To allow
contracts for waiver of liquidated damages approximates
situations where courts have uniformly held that contracts
tending to encourage violation of laws are void as contrary
24
to public policy.
Prohibition of waiver of claims for liquidated damages
accords with the Congressional policy of uniformity in
the application of the provisions of the Act to all employers subject thereto, unless expressly exempted by the provisions of the Act. An employer is not to be allowed to
gain a competitive advantage by reason of the fact that
his employees are more willing to waive claims for liquidated damages than are those of his competitor. 5 The
same considerations calling for equality of treatment
which we found so compelling in Midstate Horticultural
Co., supra,exist here.

H. Rep. No. 2182, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 6-7, states: "There
are to be no differentials either between sections of the United States,
between industries, or between employers. No employer in any part
of the United States in any industry affecting interstate commerce
need fear that he will be required by law to observe wage and hour
standards higher than those applicable to his competitors. No employee in any part of the United States in any industry affecting
interstate commerce need fear that the fair labor standards maintained by his employer will be jeopardized by oppressive labor standards maintained by those with whom his employer competes."

employer shall not employ a worker longer than the specified time without payment of overtime compensation and
that, upon violation of this provision, the employer shall
be liable for statutory wages and liquidated damages.
One section, § 16 (b), creates the obligation for the entire
remedy. Collection of both wages and damages is left to
the employee."
Respondent argues that § 16 (b) indicates that the
right to liquidated damages arises only if the employee is
compelled to sue for minimum wages due. Section 16 (b)
in no way bears out this interpretation.27 It provides absolutely that the employer shall be liable for liquidated
damages in an amount equal to minimum wages overdue;
liability is not conditioned on default at the time suit is
begun. It is also argued that the elimination from a predecessor bill of a provision prohibiting waiver of the provisions of the Act indicates a Congressional intent to allow
an employee to waive his claim to liquidated damages.'

But such a contention proves too much. It applies with
equal force to the right to minimum wages. Such an interpretation would nullify the effectiveness of the Act.
It is also suggested that the failure to impose criminal
sanctions for the violation of the liquidated damage provisions or to authorize an injunction to prevent their violation manifests a difference in Congress' attitude toward
the waiver of the employee's right to the basic statutory
wage as compared with his right to liquidated damages.
But there is no reason for making an employer subject
to a criminal penalty or an injunction for failure to pay
liquidated damages. They are collectible as private damages by the employee for failure to obey the same requirements as to wages which are punished and controlled, so
far as the purely public interest is concerned, by criminal
sanctions and injunction.
Petitioner relies on the fact that various other federal
statutes authorizing employees to sue for wages or for
damages arising from injuries sustained in the course of
employment contain specific provisions prohibiting waiver
of rights under the acts involved, or provide means by
which compromises and settlements can be approved."'
Cong., 2d Sess., amended and recommitted, Dec. 17, 1937. The reason
for eliminating this provision from the final bill does not appear. It
was done in the course of the general revision of the bill in the Conference Committee.
29 The following federal statutes contain express provisions relating
to the waiver or settlement of claims under them: Longshoremen's and
Harbor Workers' Comp. Act, 33 U. S. C. §§ 908 (i), 915 (b), 916;
Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. § 55; Jones Act, 46 U. S. C.
§ 688; settlement of wage claims of merchant seamen, 46 U. S. C.
§§ 597, 644. The federal courts have interpreted these provisions
strictly so as to protect the employee. Garrettv. Moore-McCormack

Opinion of the Court.

There is no indication why Congress did not embody a
similar provision in the Act under consideration in this
case. Absence of such provisions, however, has not prevented the courts from invalidating waivers where the
legislative policy would be thwarted by permitting such
contracts." The decision in the instant case is based on
the legislative policy behind this enactment and issues
arising under other acts having different legislative backgrounds are not conclusive in determining the legislative
intent with respect to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Failure to provide a method of waiving claims under the Act
can support contrary inferences, that such waivers were
to be allowed or that the provisions of the Act state a
settled policy which cannot be modified by private contracts. We are of the opinion that the legislative history
and provisions of the Act support a view prohibiting such
waiver. As was stated in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,
300 U. S. 379, 397, "'while in individual cases hardship
may result, the restriction will enure to the benefit of the
general class of employees in whose interest the law is
passed and so to that of the community at large.' [Adkins
v. Children's Hospital, 261 U. S. 525.] Id., p. 563."
The invalidity of the release or waiver in No. 445 makes
the release and waiver involved in No. 554 a fortiori invalid. In the latter case both the federal District Court 81
and the Circuit Court of Appeals 82 found "that both
parties knew more than $500.00 was due.. ." at the time
the petitioner tendered $500 to the respondent in return
for a comprehensive release covering all of the respondent's claims against the petitioner employer. Thus in
that case the employer and employee attempted by means
of that release to waive the right to the basic statutory
minimum as well as the right to liquidated damages. This

attempted release and waiver of rights under the Act was
absolutely void. See Smith v. McCullough, 270 U. S. 456,
465. When petitioner attempted to pay the additional
sum due as a statutory minimum, the respondent refused
to accept payment, thus there was no valid settlement
which would operate to bar the respondent employee's
right to recover the balance of the statutory minimum
wage still due and liquidated damages equal in amount
to the entire sum of wages which the employer had not
paid promptly.
Our decision of the issues raised in No. 445 and No. 554
has not necessitated a determination of what limitation,
if any, § 16 (b) of the Act places on the validity of agreements between an employer and employee to settle claims
arising under the Act if the settlement is made as the result of a bona fide dispute between the two parties, in
consideration of a bona fide compromise and settlement.
Neither of the above-mentioned cases presented such issues for our consideration. Cf. Duncan v. Thompson, 315
U. S. 1, 7; Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., 317 U. S.
239; Tennessee Coal Co. v. Muscoda Local, 321 U. S.590,
603.
There remains to be considered the question whether
an employee recovering minimum wages and liquidated
damages under the provisions of § 16 (b) is also entitled
to interest on the sums so recovered." We granted certiorari in No. 421 " to the Circuit Court of Appeals for

the Second Circuit, limited to the question of the propriety
of allowing interest on recoveries of unpaid overtime compensation and liquidated damages under the Act. Certiorari was granted because that court decided an important federal question of substance which had not previously been determined by this Court. The jurisdiction
of this Court in No. 421 rests on § 240 (a) of the Judicial
Code.
We are of the opinion that the question of the right to
interest on sums recoverable under the provisions of § 16
(b) of the Act constitutes a question of federal, not local,
law. Board of Commissionersv. United States, 308 U. S.
343, 349-50; see Prudence Corp. v. Geist, 316 U. S. 89, 95;
Garrettv. Moore-McCormack Co., 317 U. S. 239. Interest
is not recoverable in judgments obtained under § 16 (b).
As was indicated in our decision in Overnight Motor Co.
v. Missel, supra, § 16 (b) authorizes the recovery of liquidated damages as compensation for delay in payment of
sums due under the Act. Since Congress has seen fit to
fix the sums recoverable for delay, it is inconsistent with
Congressional intent to grant recovery of interest on such
sums in view of the fact that interest is customarily allowed as compensation for delay in payment. To allow
an employee to recover the basic statutory wage and
liquidated damages, with interest, would have the effect
of giving an employee double compensation for damages
arising from delay in the payment of the basic minimum
wages. See Royal Indemnity Co. v. United States, 313
U. S. 289, 296. Allowance of interest on minimum wages
and liquidated damages recoverable under § 16 (b) tends
to produce the undesirable result of allowing interest on
interest. See Cherokee Nation v. United States, 270 U. S.

No. 445.
Respondent was employed by petitioner in New York,
and in New York gave to petitioner, without consideration,
a purported written release of its obligation to pay the
statutory liquidated damages prescribed by § 16 (b) of the
Fair Labor Standards Act. Section 243 of the Debtor and
Creditor Law of New York declares a written instrument
purporting to release "all claims, debts, demands or obligations . . . shall not be invalid because of the absence
of consideration or of a seal." Counsel are agreed that,
unless the words or policy of the Fair Labor Standards Act
preclude, the written release was as effective to discharge
the obligation for liquidated damages as was the release
under seal at common law.
We find nothing in the Fair Labor Standards Act to prevent the effective operation of such a release upon the
cause of action for liquidated damages more than any
other. Section 16 (b) of the Act authorizes the employee
to recover liquidated damages from an employer who violates the duty imposed by §§ 6 and 7 of the Act to pay
the prescribed minimum and overtime wages. That duty
is expressed in §§ 6 and 7 in terms of a command to the

employer. Willful failure to obey it is made a criminal
offense by §§ 15 (a) (2) and 16 (a), and authority to enjoin violations of §§ 6 and 7 is given by §§ 15 and 17.
These provisions and these alone afford some basis for
inferring a Congressional policy against the release of minimum and overtime wages. But the Act places the right
to recover liquidated damages authorized by § 16 (b) on a
very different footing. That section expresses no command. It merely imposes a civil liability on the employer
and gives an action to the employee to enforce the liability. Failure by the employer to pay the prescribed liquidated damages is not made a criminal offense by §§ 15
and 16 and may not be enjoined under §§ 15 and 17.
The studious avoidance of any provision making the
non-payment of the liquidated damages a public wrong,
by the omissions of sanctions which the statute does impose for the failure to pay minimum and overtime wages,
is the most persuasive kind of evidence that it was the
Congressional purpose to leave undisturbed the general
policy of the law that a mere private claim for damages
may be released at the will of the claimant. It is not an
answer to say that "there is no reason for making an employer subject to a criminal penalty or an injunction for
failure to pay liquidated damages," since they are "collectible as private damages." It is precisely because the statute in this case has in every respect treated the claim for
liquidated damages as a private claim while imposing sanctions, as for a public wrong, for non-payment of minimum
and overtime wages, that we must infer that Congress intended that the claim for liquidated damages should have
the status of private claims, which are subject to release,
a status which the statute denied to minimum and overtime wages.
This pointed difference in the treatment of the two
classes of claims is underscored by the complete lack of

'718

any legislative history suggesting that there was any
Congressional purpose to treat alike the two classes of
claims which it treated so differently in the statute. In
its progress through Congress there was stricken from the
bill, which was finally enacted as the Fair Labor Standards Act, a clause providing that any agreement for waiver
of compliance with any provision of the Act should be
void. Section 17 (b), S. 2475, as passed by Senate, 75th
Cong., 1st Sess., 1937. With this provision eliminated,
the mandatory terms of §§ 6 and 7, the criminal penalties
of the Act, and its provision for relief in equity, afford the
sole ground to be found either within or without the statute for any inference of a Congressional policy against
the release of claims arising under the Act. These factors
concern only the minimum and overtime wages. They
neither support nor suggest any Congressional policy
against release of liquidated damages to which they are
inapplicable and wholly unrelated.
If such an undeclared policy is to be inferred, it must
be inferred from the statute, read in its appropriate setting. The statute is silent as to any exceptional policy
with respect to claims for unliquidated damages-a silence
which is given meaning by the provisions affirmatively
making non-payment of minimum and overtime wages a
public wrong. Any inference that a release of minimum
and overtime wages is invalid must be because the release
is an aggravation of the public wrong. But to draw that
inference is to foreclose the possibility of a like inference
with respect to liquidated damages, the non-payment of
which is not made a public wrong.
We held in Overnight Motor Co. v. Missel, 316 U. S.
572, that the provision for liquidated damages is not
punitive. Hence it cannot in itself be said either to have
created or sanctioned a public right or interest in the
recovery of liquidated damages. In view of the uncer-

Opinion of

C. J.

tain coverage of the Act we cannot ignore the fact that
the statutory liability may be harsh in its application
and enable the employee to recover an amount far in
excess of any damage which he has in fact suffered. All
these considerations persuasively suggest that Congress
has adopted no policy which precludes the employee from
releasing, as in the case of other claims, the claim for
liquidated damages when the release conforms to local
law and is procured without overreaching or unfairness.
On the contrary the provisions of the Act show, and the
legislative history emphasizes, that Congress intended to
treat the liquidated damage obligation differently from
its command to pay minimum and overtime wages. Because of this difference we cannot say that it intended to
place the employee so far in tutelage as not to be free to
give, and the employer to obtain, a release of what is by
the terms of the statute nothing more than a cause of
action for damages which in fact he may or may not
have suffered.
No. 554.
There appears to have been no accord and satisfaction
in this case, and for the reasons stated in our opinion in
Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O'Neil, No. 445, the attempted
release by respondent of his claim for overtime wages was
void as against the policy of the Fair Labor Standards
Act. Because of petitioner's failure to pay overtime wages
as directed by § 7 of the Act, respondent is entitled to
recover liquidated damages as provided by § 16 (b), and
the judgment should be affirmed.
