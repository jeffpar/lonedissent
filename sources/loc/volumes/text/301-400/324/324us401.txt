Syllabus.

MALINSKI ET AL. V. NEW YORK.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW YORK.

No. 367. Argued December 4, 5, 1944.-Decided March 26, 1945.
1. Upon review of a state court judgment affirming convictions of codefendants Malinski and Rudish on a charge of murder, denial of
rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
being claimed, the judgment against Malinski is reversed and that
against Rudish is affirmed. Pp. 402, 412.
2. The case against the co-defendant Rudish, both as tried and as
sustained on appeal, was not dependent on a subsequent confession
of Malinski (though assumed to have been coerced); on the record,
the questions raised involve matters of state procedure beyond the
province of this Court to review; and the judgment against Rudish
is therefore affirmed. Anderson.v. United States, 318 U. S. 350, and
Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S.143, distinguished. Pp. 410, 412.
Opinion of DOUGLAS, J., in which BLACK, MURPHY and RUTLEDGE,
JJ., join:
3. The question whether there has been a violation of the due process
clause of the. Fourteenth Amendment by the introduction of an
involuntary confession is one upon which this Court must make an
independent determination on the undisputed evidence. P. 404.
4. If all the attendant circumstances indicate that the confession was
coerced or compelled, it may not be used to convict a defendant.
P. 404.
5. A conviction obtained by use of a coerced confession will be set
aside even though the evidence apart from the confession might
have been sufficient to sustain the verdict. P. 404.
6. The evidence of the circumstances in which Malinski made the first
of several confessions, together with the comments of the prosecutor
in his summation to the jury, show that that confession was coerced;
and, upon the record, the case must be considered as one in which a
coerced confession was used to obtain a conviction. P. 406.
7. The judgment against Malinski, resting in part on a coerced confession, must be reversed. A majority of the Court do not reach
the question whether the subsequent confessions were free from the
infirmities of the first. P. 410.
292 N. Y. 360, 55 N. E. 2d 353, affirmed in part; reversed in part.

CERTIORAI, 323 U. S. 694, to review the affirmance of
convictions of murder.
Messrs. John J. Fitzgerald and David F. Price, with
whom Mr. Joseph A. Solovei was on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Solomon A. Klein, with whom Messrs. Thomas Cradock Hughes and Henry J. Walsh were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Malinski and Rudish were convicted along with one
Indovino of the murder of Leon Fox, a police officer who,
late at night, was escorting a manager of a theatre to a
bank depository. The details will be found in 292 N. Y.
360. There were no eye witnesses to the crime who could
identify the robbers. Malinski was implicated by various
witnesses--by Spielfogel, an old friend and a criminal
serving a sentence of thirty to sixty years in Sing Sing;
by Malinski's girl friend; by Malinski's brother-in-law.
Each testified that Malinski confessed the crime to him
or her. The confessions to the girl friend and to the
brother-in-law were made a few hours after the crime and
were merely that Malinski had shot a cop; but the confession to Spielfogel disclosed in detail the planning and
execution of the crime. Malinski denied making these
confessions. Yet as the New York Court of Appeals
pointed out (292 N. Y. p. 370) those confessions and other
evidence of the State were sufficient, if believed, to support the conviction, wholly apart from another confession
around which the present controversy turns. But the circumstances under which the latter confession was obtained raised the substantial federal question which
prompted us to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.

MALINSKI v. NEW YORK.
401

Opinion of the Court.

I
Malinski was arrested while on his way to work on the
morning of Friday, October 23, 1942. The police did not
then arraign him but took him to a room in the Bossert
Hotel in Brooklyn where he arrived about 8 A. M. He was
immediately stripped and kept naked until about 11 A. M.
At that time he was allowed to put on his shoes, socks and
underwear and was given a blanket in which to wrap himself. He remained that way until about 6 P. M. Malinski
claims he was beaten by the police during that period.
The police denied this. There was no visible sign of any
beating, such as bruises or scars; and Malinski made no
complaint to the judge on arraignment nor to the jail authorities where he was later held. Sometime during Friday morning Spielfogel was brought to the hotel. He and
Malinski were put alone together in a room sometime that
afternoon. Shortly after their conference-apparently
around 5:30 P. M. or 6:00 P. M.-Malinski confessed to
the police. After it was made Malinski was allowed to
dress. Malinski was kept at the hotel that night and the
next three days. The record does not show exactly how
long and frequent the questioning was after the first confession. But it is clear that Malinski was questioned in
the early hours of Saturday, the 24th, and at other times
during that day. He was further questioned on Sunday,
the 25th, and taken with Spielfogel from the hotel to
the scene of the crime where he identified several places
which had a relationship to the commission of the crime
and where he pointed out how the crime was executed.
On Monday, the 26th, he was taken from the hotel to the
police garage where he identified the automobile used in
the robbery. At about 5:00 P. M. on Monday he was
taken to a police station and questioned. On Tuesday
morning, October 27th, about 2 A. M. he made a confession

at the police station. That confession was introduced at
the trial. Shortly thereafter-about 4:00 A. M.-he was
booked and put in a cell and soon arraigned.
The trial court held a preliminary hearing on the voluntary character of the confession of October 27th before
allowing it to be introduced in evidence. There is a question in the case whether the confession of October 23rd as
well as that of October 27th was submitted to the jury, a
question to which we will return. It is sufficient here to
note that the trial court charged the jury that a confession should not be considered by them unless they found
beyond a reasonable doubt that it was voluntary. And
they were told that although the delay in arraignment was
not conclusive, they might consider it in passing on the
question of voluntariness. The Court of Appeals sustained the judgment of conviction by a divided vote.1 But
the question whether there has been a violation of the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by the introduction of an involuntary confession is one on which
we must make an independent determination on the undisputed facts. Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227; Lisenba v. California,314 U. S. 219; Ashcraft v. Tennessee,
322 U. S. 143.
If all the attendant circumstances indicate that the confession was coerced or compelled, it may not be used to
convict a defendant. Ashcraft v. Tennessee, supra, p. 154.
And if it is introduced at the trial, the judgment of conviction will be set aside even though the evidence apart from
the confession might have been sufficient to sustain the
jury's verdict. Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U. S. 596, 597.
If the evidence alone is considered, there is serious doubt
whether the confession made on the late afternoon of Fri1 The

Court of Appeals did not divide on the issue which is before

us. The dissenting judges thought (1) that Spielfogel was an accomplice and that the conviction of Rudish was not supported by
corroborative evidence; and (2) that the instruction concerning the
voluntary character of the confession was not adequate.

MALINSKI v. NEW YORK.

Opinion of the Court.

day, October 23rd (the first day of Malinski's detention)
was admissible under the rule of Chambers v. Florida,
Lisenba v. California, and Ashcraft v. Tennessee, supra.
If the confession had been"the product of persistent questioning while Malinski stood stripped and naked, we
would have a clear case. But it was not. Malinski was
stripped when he arrived at the hotel so that he might be
examined for bullet wounds.2 He remained in that condition several hours-much longer than any such physical examination could possibly justify. But it does not
appear that he was subjected to more than occasional questioning during that period. No confession was obtained
from him at that time. He said he was beaten; but that
was disputed. And the assertion has such a dubious claim
to veracity that we lay it aside. In any event, he soon
had his shoes, socks, and underwear back on and a blanket
in which to wrap himself. He complained of that treatment in his testimony. The police justified it with the
dubious explanation that it was to make certain that Malinski did not escape. Yet the record does not show any
persistent and incessant-let alone gruelling-questioning
by the police while Malinski was only partially clothed.
There are many gaps in the chronological narrative of
what transpired that day. But several circumstances
stand out. Malinski was held incommunicado; he was not
allowed to see a lawyer, though he asked for one, and he
was not allowed to see friends, with one exception. 8 That
2 While the robbers were escaping, the wounded policeman fired
several shots, some of which hit the car in which they made their
escape.
3 The matter was described by the prosecutor in a rather shocking
manner:
"They hold men for several days. Are you satisfied with that?
They are not going to let him go home, or let him get hold of a smart
mouthpiece to preach about his rights and sue out writs. You want
a District Attorney in this county that is worth his salt, not a powderpuff District Attorney. When you are trying a case of murder, especially murder of a police officer, you don't go over and give him a

exception was Spielfogel.4 As we have noted, he and Malinski had a private conference that afternoon. Malinski
was told that Spielfogel was there. Malinski asked to see
him. Spielfogel's version of what transpired varies from
Malinski's. The former says that Malinski told him the
police knew so much that Malinski figured he "might as
well go out there and tell them the rest." Malinski said
that he asked Spielfogel, "What are you doing with me?";
and that Spielfogel replied, "don't let them hit you. You
know you didn't do it. Go out and say I told you to tell
the truth." Shortly thereafter Malinski made his confession of October 23rd. If that evidence alone is not
sufficient to show that that confession was coerced, the
comments of the prosecutor place it beyond doubt. For
in his summation to the jury he made certain statements
which the Court of Appeals said were "indefensible" (292
N. Y. p. 373) and which we think are sufficient to fill in
any gaps on the record before us and to establish that this
confession was not made voluntarily. He said that Malinpat on the back and say, 'Do you want anything? Do you want to
have your lawyer or your wife or somebody else?' In fact after that
they would not even let him see Mr. Math, an assistant in our office;
they would not even let him talk to a rabbi. Do you think McNally,
17 years in the Police Department, is going to let this jerk from the
East Side tell him his business?"
4
As the Court of Appeals points out (292 N. Y. p. 375), Spielfogel
and Malinski had an agreement that if either went to prison the one
who was free would help take care of the other's family. After Spielfogel went to Sing Sing, Malinski contributed for a while to the support of Spielfogel's wife. When Malinski refused to pay any more,
Spielfogel unburdened himself to two other convicts, Yellin and Kovner, "but with no intention of acting against Malinski for, curiously
enough, testimony is in this record that, after knowledge of what had
occurred in the shooting of Fox reached the police department and a
lieutenant of police was sent to Sing Sing prison to interview Spielfogel, he refused to talk to the police officer. Even after that police
officer had told him all that Spielfogel must have told to Yelin and
Kovner he still evinced no interest in helping the police. It was only
later that he consented to talk."

MALINSKI v. NEW YORK.
401

Opinion of the Court.

ski "was not hard to break"; that "He did not care what
he did. He knew the cops were going to break him
down." And lie added:
"Why this talk about being undressed? Of course, they
had a right to undress him to look for bullet scars, and keep
the clothes off him. That was quite proper police procedure. That is some more psychology-let him sit around
with a blanket on him, humiliate him there for a while; let
him sit in the corner, let him think he is going to get a
shellacking."
If we take the prosecutor at his word, the confession of
October 23rd was the product of fear-one on which we
could not permit a person to stand convicted for a crime.
But it is said that this coerced confession was not introduced in evidence, that it was submitted to the jury
only insofar as it threw light on the voluntary character
of the subsequent confessions, and that under the rule
of Lyons v. Oklahoma, supra,p. 601, the adequacy of that
instruction to the jury is solely for the state courts to
determine. We do not think, however, that Lyons v.
Oklahoma, supra, fits this case.
The confession of October 23rd was oral. Its details
were not put in evidence. But Spielfogel, a witness for
the prosecution, adverted to it in his testimony, saying
that Malinski told "everything" at that time. A police
officer testified on behalf of the prosecution to the same
effect. The prosecutor referred to it in his summation in
language which we have already quoted. He added that
"Six o'clock in the evening after he (Malinski) was picked
up, he told the whole thing." When the confession of
October 27th (which was a detailed confession taken down
by a stenographer) was offered in evidence, a preliminary
hearing was had. That hearing covered the voluntary
character of the October 23rd confession as well as the
October 27th confession. The trial court in its charge to
the jury reviewed the events leading up to the confession

324 U. S.

of October 23rd-the prosecutor's version, Malinski's version. It then referred to the delay in arraigning Malinski, stating that the police claimed they Were willing to
arraign Malinski on the day of his arrest but that Malinski
preferred to stay at the hotel with Spielfogel. It then
charged:
"Be that as it may, I charge you that it was the duty of
the police to arraign the defendant before the nearest Magistrate without unnecessary delay, and, further, that if a
police officer failed or refused to perform such duty, he is
guilty of a misdemeanor.
"But, gentlemen, you will bear in mind that the police
department is not on trial in this case. This testimony
was adduced solely on the question as to whether or not
the alleged confession later made was the result of the
coercion, either direct or implied, which is prohibited by
the statute, and which invalidates a confession if made.
If you should find that the arraignment of the defendant
was delayed, you may consider that on the question of the
voluntariness of any confession made by Malinsky, including the one made in the early hours of October 27th at
the Bath Beach station house.
"However, I am charging you that the failure to arraign,
in and of itself, is not conclusive against the People, and
does not in and of itself, standing alone, destroy the
validity of the confession. Is that clear?
"On the question whether Malinski was coerced, you
may consider that he made no complaint to the Magistrate when arraigned and did not seek the services of the
jail physician. That evidence, if true, is not, however, conclusive against Malinski, but may be considered by the
jury on the issue of the voluntariness of the confession."
Malinski made no objections to these references to his
confession of October 23rd. And while he asked for a
mistrial because of the prosecutor's comments, he made
on this phase of the case no requests to charge which were

refused. The Court of Appeals, however, did not hold
that Malinski was precluded from objecting' to the use
made at the trial of his confession of October 23rd. It
considered his objection that "it was error for the court
to submit to the jury the confession made by Malinski
orally on October 23rd" as well as the other three confessions made to the police. 292 N. Y. p. 370. And it
made plain, when it held that Malinski's "confession"
should not have been excluded as a matter of law, that it
meant "not only the confession made orally to a police
officer on the Friday night of the arrest but also the two
automobile trips on Sunday and Monday, one to the police
garage to permit Malinski to identify the automobile used
in the crime and the other to Coney Island to revisit a
restaurant and the scene of the crime, and the confession
to the District Attorney which was taken stenographically
in the early morning of Tuesday, October 27th." 292
N. Y. pp. 373-374. Its ruling was that none of the four
confessions was involuntary as a matter of law. Thus as
we read the opinion of the Court of Appeals, it reviewed
the judgment of conviction on the basis that all four confessions to the police had been submitted to the jury. We
find no indication that it construed the record to be like
the one in Lyons v. Oklahoma, supra, where consideration
of the first coerced confession was strictly limited to the
voluntary character of subsequent confessions. Nor do
we think that the record before us can be fairly construed
in that manner.
There were repeated references at the trial to the confession of October 23rd. The prosecutor made emphatic
references to it in his summation. On this record the fact

that Malinski confessed to the crime shortly after he was
arrested stands out in bold relief. The use made of the
confession could hardly have been more effective had its
details been put in evidence. It was not insulated from
the trial. The part of the charge to the jury which we have
quoted may possibly have been an effort in that direction.
But it is more susceptible of the interpretation that the
delay in arraignment, not the first confession, was to be
considered "solely on the question as to whether or not
the alleged confession later made was the result of the coercion." That seems to have been the interpretation given
the charge by the Court of Appeals. 292 N. Y. p. 374.
No more explicit charge was given. The jury at no time
was admonished that it could not convict on the basis of
the first confession nor consider it as evidence against
Malinski. We must consider the case, therefore, as one in
which a coerced confession was employed to obtain a conviction. Coerced confessions would find a way of corrupting the trial if we sanctioned the use made of the
October 23rd confession in this case. Constitutional rights
may suffer as much from subtle intrusions as from direct
disregard.
It is thus apparent that the judgment before us rests in
part on a confession obtained as a result of coercion. Accordingly a majority of the Court do not come to the question.whether the subsequent confessions were free from the
infirmities of the first one.'
II
We have not-mentioned Rudish. He did not confessto
the police. He was tried jointly with Malinski, his counsel electing not to ask for a severance. We are asked to
reverse as to Rudish because the confession of October
27th which was introduced in evidence against Malinski

LEDGE join in Part I of this opinion.

Opinion of the Court.

was prejudicial to Rudish. It is argued that that course
is indicated by Anderson v. United States, 318 U. S. 350.
In that case we reversed a judgment of conviction against
all the defendants though the confessions which had been
introduced were the confessions of only some of them. But
in that case we were reviewing a criminal proceeding in a
federal District Court over which we have more control
than we do over criminal trials in the state courts. McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332. Moreover, in the
Anderson case the jury was told that in considering the
guilt or innocence of each defendant they could consider
the whole proof made at the trial. And it appeared that
the prosecution leaned heavily on the confessions to establish its case against all the defendants. The furthest
we have gone in a comparable case from a state court is to
vacate the judgment against the co-defendant who did
not confess and remand the case to the state court for
further consideration. Thus in Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322
U. S. 143, 155, we followed that procedure, at the suggestion of the Attorney General of the State, where the judgment against the co-defendant who did not confess was
sustained by the state court on the assumption that the
confession which we held to be coerced was properly admitted and that the conviction of the defendant who did
confess was valid.
We do not believe that procedure is appropriate in this
case even though it be assumed arguendo that the confession of October'27th was involuntary. It is true that
that confession referred both to Rudish and to Indovino.
But before that confession was offered in evidence the trial
court with the complete approval of counsel for Rudish
worked out a procedure for protecting Rudish and Indovino. "X" was substituted for Rudish, "Y" for Indovino. The jury were plainly instructed that the confession was admitted against Malinski alone and that they
were not to speculate concerning the identity of "X" or
"Y." When it came to the charge, the trial court sub-

mitted the case against Rudish separately from the one
against Malinski' The Court of Appeals in sustaining the
judgment against Rudish in no respect relied on any confession to the police which Malinski made. And when it
turned to the comments of the prosecutor, which we have
quoted, it noted that they concerned Malinski, not Rudish.
292 N. Y. p. 373.
On this record the questions raised by Rudish involve
matters of state procedure beyond our province to review.
Barrington v. Missouri, 205 U. S. 483. Since the case
against him, both as tried and as sustained on review, was
not dependent on Malinski's confession of October 27th,
we think it inappropriate to vacate the judgment as we
did in Asheraft v. Tennessee, supra, though we assume that
that confession was coerced. Whether our reversal of the
judgment against Malinski would as a matter of state law
affect the judgment against Rudish is not for us to say.
In each case our mandate will provide for a remand to the
Court of Appeals for proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.
The judgment against Rudish is affirmed.
The judgment against Malinski is reversed.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.

It is also my view that the judgment as to Malinski
calls for reversal, leaving the disposition of Rudish's conviction in the light of such reversal to the New York Court
of Appeals.
Apart from permitting Congress to use criminal sanctions as means for carrying into execution powers granted
to it, the Constitution left the domain of criminal justice
7This treatment of the matter seems to have followed the procedure
adopted in New York in case of joint trials. See People v. Snyder, 246
N. Y. 491, 497, 159 N. E. 408; People v. Fisher, 249 N. Y. 419, 424,

to the States. The Constitution, including the Bill of
Rights, placed no restriction upon the power of the States
to consult solely their own notions of policy in formulating
penal codes and in administering them, excepting only
that they were forbidden to pass any "Bill of Attainder"
or "ex post facto Law," Constitution of the United States,
Art. I, § 10. This freedom of action remained with the
States until 1868. The Fourteenth Amendment severely
modified the situation. It did so not by changing the distribution of power as between the States and the central
government. Criminal justice was not withdrawn from
the States and made the business of federal lawmaking.
The Fourteenth Amendment merely restricted the freedom theretofore possessed by the States in the making and
the enforcement of their criminal laws.
Unlike the limitations of the Bill of Rights upon the
use of criminal penalties by federal authority, the Fourteenth Amendment placed no specific restriction upon the
administration of their criminal law by the States. Congress in proposing the Fourteenth Amendment and the
States in ratifying it left to the States the freedom of
action they had before that Amendment excepting only
that after 1868 no State could "abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States" nor "deprive
any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law," nor deny to any person the "equal protection of the laws." These are all phrases of large generalities. But they are not generalities of unillumined vagueness; they are generalities circumscribed by history and
appropriate to the largeness of the problems of government with which they were concerned. "The privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United States" derived
from the two aspects of citizenship in our federal system.
The safeguards of "due process of law" and "the equal
protection of the laws" summarize the history of freedom
of English-speaking peoples running back to Magna Carta
and reflected in the constitutional development of our

people. The history of American freedom is, in no small
measure, the history of procedure.
Here we are concerned with the requirement of "due
process of law" in the enforcement of a state's criminal
law. Experience has confirmed the wisdom of our predecessors in refusing to give a rigid scope to this phrase.
It expresses a demand for civilized standards of law. It is
thus not a stagnant formulation of what has been achieved
in the past but a standard for judgment in the progressive
evolution of the institutions of a free society. The suggestion that "due process of law," as guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment, is a compendious expression of
the original federal Bill of Rights (Amendments I to
VIII) has been rejected by this Court again and again
and after impressive consideration. See, e. g., Hurtado v.
California, 110 U. S. 516; Twining v. New Jersey, 211
U. S. 78; Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278; Palko v.
Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319.
In the Bill of Rights, Eighteenth-century statesmen
formulated safeguards against the recurrence of welldefined historic grievances. Some of these safeguards,
such as the right to trial by a jury of twelve and immunity
from prosecution unless initiated by a grand jury, were
built on experience of relative and limited validity.
"Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that
a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without them." Palko v. Connecticut, supra, at 325.
Others, like the freedom of the press or the free exercise
of religion or freedom from condemnation without a
fair trial, express rights the denial of which is repugnant to
the conscience of a free people. They express those
"fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie
at the base of all our civil and political institutions," Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U. S. 312, 316, and are implied in
the comprehensive concept of "due process of law."
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
thus has potency different from and independent of the

MALINSKI v. NEW YORK.
401

Opinion of

specific provisions contained in the Bill of Rights. Apart
from all other considerations, how could it be otherwise
without charging Madison and his great contemporaries
in the framing and adoption of the Bill of Rights with
writing into it a meaningless clause? The Fifth Amendment specifically prohibits prosecution of an "infamous
crime" except by indictment; it forbids double jeopardy
and self-incrimination, as well as deprivation of "life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law." Not to
attribute to due process of law an independent function
but to consider it a shorthand statement of other specific
clauses in the same Amendment is to charge those who
secured the adoption of this Amendment with meretricious redundancy by indifference to a phrase-"due process
of law"-which was one of the great instruments in the
very arsenal of constitutional freedom which the Bill of
Rights was to protect and strengthen. Of course the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has the
same meaning. To suppose that "due process of law"
meant one thing in the Fifth Amendment and another in
the Fourteenth is too frivolous to require elaborate
rejection.
A construction which gives due process no independent
function but makes of it a summary of the specific provisions of the Bill of Rights would tear up by the roots much
of the fabric of law in the several States. Thus, it would
require all the States to prosecute serious crimes through
the grand jury system long ago abandoned by many of
them, see Hurtadov. California,supra, to try such crimes
by a jury of twelve which some of the States have seen
fit to modify or abandon, see Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S.
581, to enforce the privilege against self-incrimination
with the technical requirements prevailing in the federal
courts when States, consistently with fundamental notions of justice, have seen fit to make other arrangements,
see Twining v. New Jersey, supra, and to have jury trials

see Livingston v. Moore, 7 Pet. 469, 551; Walker v. Sauvinet, 92 U. S. 90; Pearsonv. Yewdall, 95 U. S. 294, 296.
And we can hardly select one provision of the Bill of
Rights and reject another, as for instance the provision
of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search
and seizure. Such a view would not only disregard the
historic meaning of "due process." It leads inevitably to
a warped construction of specific provisions of the Bill of
Rights to bring within their scope conduct clearly condemned by due process but not easily fitting into the
pigeonholes of the specific provisions. But for contrary
suggestions, it would seem too late in the day to treat
seriously the argument that a phrase so laden with historic
meaning as is "due process of law" can be given an improvised content of some selected provision of the original
Bill of Rights.
And so, when a conviction in a state court is properly
here for review, under a claim that a right protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment has been denied, the question
is not whether the record can be found to disclose an infraction of one of the specific provisions of the first eight
amendments. To come concretely to the present case, the
question is not whether the record permits a finding, by a
tenuous process of psychological assumptions and reasoning, that Malinski by means of a confession was forced to
self-incrimination in defiance of the Fifth Amendment.
The exact question is whether the criminal proceedings
which resulted in his conviction deprived him of the due
process of law by which he was constitutionally entitled
to have his guilt determined. Judicial review of that
guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment inescapably imposes upon this Court an exercise of judgment upon the
whole course of the proceedings in order to ascertain

whether they offend those canons of decency and fairness
which express the notions of justice of English-speaking
peoples even toward those charged with the most heinous
offenses. These standards of justice are not authoritatively formulated anywhere as though they were prescriptions in a pharmacopoeia. But neither does the application of the Due Process Clause imply that judges are
wholly at large. The judicial judgment in applying the
Due Process Clause must move within the limits of accepted notions of justice and is not to be based upon the
idiosyncrasies of a merely personal judgment. The fact
that judges among themselves may differ whether in a
particular case a trial offends accepted notions of justice
is not disproof that general rather than idiosyncratic
standards are applied. An important safeguard against
such merely individual judgment is an alert deference to
the judgment of the state court under review. But there
cannot be blind acceptance even of such weighty judgment without disregarding the historic function of civilized procedure in the progress of liberty.
And so, with every respect for the contrary views of
the majority of the judges below and of some of my
brethren here, I cannot escape agreement with the Chief
Judge of the New York Court of Appeals and two of his
associates that there was not in this case a fair trial of
issues vital to the determination of guilt or innocence.
Considering the circumstances of Malinski's detention, the
long and continuous questioning, the willful and wrongful
delay in his arraignment and the opportunity that that
gives for securing, by extortion, confessions such as were
here introduced in evidence,1 the flagrant justification by
the prosecutor of this illegality as a necessary police proIIt is suggested that "the New York Court of Appeals unanimously
sustained the jury's verdict that the confessions were not coerced."

cedure, inevitably calculated to excite the jury-all these
in combination are so below the standards by which the
criminal law, especially in a capital case, should be enforced as to fall short of due process of law.
In reviewing a state criminal conviction we must be
deeply mindful of the responsibilities of the States for
the enforcement of criminal laws, and exercise with due
humility our merely negative function in subjecting convictions from state courts to the very narrow scrutiny
which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment authorizes. On the other hand, in the discharge of
that duty we must give no ear to the loose talk about
society being "at war with the criminal" if by that it is
implied that the decencies of procedure which have been
enshrined in the Constitution must not be too fastidiously
insisted upon in the case of wicked people. Despite the
opinion of Chief Judge Lehman, on behalf of the three dissenting
judges, will speak for itself:
"Here we are agreed that a finding by the jury that the defendant's
confession, though obtained while he was unlawfully detained without
arraignment, is not against the weight of the evidence. The officers

of the law deny that they beat the defendant or threatened him.
Whatever may have been the motive of the police in taking Malinski
to the Hotel Bossert instead of to a police station or jail, we find no
basis for any inference that the police believed that the hotel was an
appropriate place where a person could, without too much risk of
discovery, be beaten in order to compel a confession. Nonetheless,
in this case, as in People v. Mummiani (supra [258 N. Y. 394], pp.
399-400), 'the conclusion is inescapable' that the police delayed the
arraignment of the defendant 'for the purpose of subjecting him to an

inquisition impossible thereafter' at which he might be induced to make
a confession by resort to what the Supreme Court of the United States
has described as 'those reprehensible practices known as the "third
degree" which, though universally rejected as indefensible, still find
their way into use.' There can be no fair trial of the issue whether
the confession is voluntary where the jury is not properly informed
that the detention was unlawful and that they must take that fact
into consideration. That has not been done in this case." People v.

fact that English criminal justice has serious inadequacies
and lags behind some of our penological advances, it is
undeniable that on the whole it is much more effective
than ours. Yet there can be no doubt, as English parliamentary proceedings and the reports of the English Court
of Criminal Appeal amply prove, that practices such as
this record reveals are not there tolerated. See, for instance, Inquiry in Regard to the Interrogation by the
Police of Miss Savidge (1928), Cmd. 3147; 217 H. C. Deb.
(5th ser. 1928), May 17, 1928, 1303 et seq. Whatever
differences there may be between the situations in England and in this country in the task of law enforcement,
it is intolerable to suggest that we cannot have effective
law enforcement without conduct such as this record
spreads before us. The notion that we must resort to such
methods in order to check crime or to convict criminals
has been rejected by those who have had most to do with
the criminal law. After consideration of the problem, a
committee of eminent lawyers reported this conclusion:
"The remedy for the ills which afflict the administration
of criminal justice, whatever that remedy may be, will not
be found in measures which violate law. Such expedients,
so far from restoring health and vigor to the system, only
aggravate and protract the disorder. Under our form of
government the machinery of criminal justice depends for
its force and efficiency upon the enlightened moral sense
of the individuals to whom the public by their constitution
and laws have temporarily entrusted its operation. And
it is as unwise as it is unwarranted for these servants of
the public to violate the constitution and laws in the vain
hope of accomplishing useful or beneficial results."

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, dissenting in part.
I concur in reversing the judgment against Malinski, but
dissent from affirmance of the judgment against Rudish.
I agree that Malinski's oral confession of October 23,
1942, was coerced, was used in evidence against him and
that this requires reversal of the judgment against him.
I therefore join in the Court's opinion in so far as it relates to him. But I am unable to agree that we should
stop with the ruling grounded upon the confession of
October 23 alone. I think the subsequent confessions, including the written one of October 27, were vitiated with
all the coercion which destroys admissibility of the first
one. Accordingly their use in evidence also requires reversal of the judgment against Malinski. Furthermore,
since the written confession also affected Rudish and in
my opinion the devices employed were ineffective to prevent its influencing the verdict and the judgment against
him, I think that judgment likewise should be reversed.

However great the proof against him otherwise may be,
under our system no man should be punished pursuant to
a judgment induced wholly or in part by a coerced confession. In my opinion the entire procedure, from the time
Malinski was taken into custody until his written confession was obtained nearly five days later, was a single and
continuous process of coercion of the type commonly
known as "the third degree." I do not think the Constitution has room for this in company with all the protections
it throws around the individual charged with crime.

RUTLEDGE,

The State's summation boldly admitted the case was of
that character. It characterized Malinski's treatment as
"quite proper police procedure." It was "some more psychology-let him sit around with a blanket on him, humiliate him there for a while; let him sit in the corner,
let him think he is going to get a shellacking." The Court
of Appeals characterized "the remarks" as "indefensible."
Not only the remarks, but also the conduct they accurately depict must bear that condemnation, as the
record demonstrates.
The "psychology" got results. It produced a confession,' the first in a series. The Court of Appeals treated
them as one, though its opinion expressly recognized there
were three or more.2 The first came at the end of ten
hours of applied "psychology." I The others followed later
in the course of and at the end of four days of illegal
detention.
'The evidence is undisputed that Malinski arrived at the hotel at
about 8:15 a. m., was immediately stripped, and was not given back
his clothing, except his shorts, until after he confessed that evening.
The summation added to the statement quoted above in the text:
"McNally [a police officer] took one look at him and said, 'Come
here'-just a little tough talk--'what do you know about it?' Six
o'clock in the evening after he was picked up he told the whole thing."
2 "Counsel have urged upon us, however, that it was error for the
court to submit to the jury the confession made by Malinski orally on
October 23rd, by word and deed on October 25th and 26th and.to an
Assistant District Attorney and a stenographer in the early morning
hours of October 27th. ...
"When we have spoken of Malinski's confession we include, of
course, not only the confession made orally to a police officer on the
Friday night of the arrest but also the two automobile trips on Sunday
and Monday, one to the police garage to permit Malinski to identify
the automobile used in the crime and the other to Coney Island to
revisit a restaurant and the scene of the crime, and the confession to
the District Attorney which was taken stenographically in the early
morning of Tuesday, October 27th." 292 N. Y. 360, 370, 373-374.

By any test the first confession was "involuntary." It
was unworthy of credence in any court. No other conclusion can be drawn on the record. The undisputed
facts' bear out this view and the State's admission that
it was obtained by threat of "shellacking." The evidence
is in conflict on whether physical force was used.5 There
is no conflict that it was threatened. Nor is there room for
inference that the threat did not bring about the confession. "Malinski was not hard to break." No conviction
tainted with this confession's influence can stand.
Moreover, the first confession was used to secure the
defendants' conviction. In more ways than one. In the
first place, it was used directly in evidence against
the accused, as the Court of Appeals expressly recognized
when it sustained the trial court's action in submitting
that confession, together with the later ones, to the jury,'
and as we now hold. Further, we would be innocent indeed if we did not believe that "leads" furnished were followed and that the evidence thus procured and presented,
as an immediate consequence of the initial coercion, had
part in bringing about the verdict. The record bears out
that belief. Else why was Malinski illegally detained, inconmnunicado, at the hotel for three days after he had told
"the whole thing"? Whatever may be the rule as to the
use of evidence secured by means merely unlawful,' in

my judgment the Constitution does not tolerate the use
of evidence obtained by unconstitutional methods, including coercive ones, to bring about a conviction for crime
which is constitutional.8 The Constitution does not thus
nullify its own terms, setting them at war with each other.
The "leads" thus secured in violation of both the fundamental law and the law of the State8 led directly to the
later confessions, including the written one, and. vitiated
them with every vice infecting the first. In my judgment,
all that followed the first confession was the product of it
and therefore of the initial coercion which induced it. Beyond this, the coercive influences themselves continued
throughout the period between the first confession and the
last, with the single exception that Malinski was given
back his clothing.
This fact is highly material as showing the initial coercion. Without more, it belies the explanation that the
prisoner was stripped and kept naked or partly so for ten
hours because otherwise he might try to escape."° That
danger, if it existed, continued as much after the first confession as before it. It continued throughout the whole

time he was detained at the hotel. Malinski was stripped
and held naked or partly so, not to prevent his escape,
but to do just what the prosecution says was intended, to
"break" a man "who was not hard to break" by inducing
the fear of a "shellacking."
But the fact that Malinski was given back his clothing,
when and only when he confessed, does not show that the
coercion ceased then or before the last confession was
secured. It shows only that one of the coercive tactics
used had become no longer necessary and therefore no
longer was employed. Otherwise, why was Malinski
not promptly booked and arraigned, as he was four nights
later when the written confession was secured. Why was
he detained illegally at the hotel for three days and four
nights" after he admittedly had told "everything"? Why,
further, was he held incommunicado during all this time,
seeing only the police, the assistant prosecuting attorney,
and Spielfogel? Why also was he subjected to examination, interrupted now and then it is true, in some instances
because he fell asleep, but continuing throughout most
of each day, including the time of the trips to the scene
of the crime and the police garage, and to the early hours
of each morning? 1
1 The fourth night was devoted to final interrogation at the Bath
Beach Police Station.
' The questioning of the first day and evening, Friday, October 23,
continued after the oral confession and was still in progress at 3:00
a. m. on Saturday, October 24. Ten to twelve persons were usually
present and many participated in the questioning. Investigators
stayed for a time and left to return later. One detective left the
hotel at 10:00 or 11:00 p. m. on October 23 and, on his return at 3:00
a. m., found the questioning still continuing. The interrogation, on
and off, had then proceeded for nineteen hours.
Throughout October 24, a police lieutenant testified, many of the
detectives "continuously" examined and talked to Malinski. The
latter said, "They kept questioning me all that day and night." Again
on October 25 he was questioned "to clear up certain points," though

All this, the State asks us to believe, was consistent
with Malinski's making a "clean breast" entirely voluntarily. All this comports with the view that the coercion
had worn off and the written confession was the act of a
man freed from the fears and the pressures which forced
out the first one, or so a jury could find. Such is the claim
made in the view that the first confession was not used in
evidence against the accused.
I cannot accept this view. On the contrary, I think only
one conclusion can be drawn from the facts, namely, that
all the conditions which forced out Malinski's first confession continued in full effect until they extorted also the
written one, excepting only that he was given back his
clothing. That fact alone is not enough to show that the
coercive conditions were wholly abated and the influences
they generated had no part in bringing about the later
confessions.
an officer denied that this "went on for hours and hours." On that
day Malinski was taken on a tour of the scene of the crime. The assistant district attorney and a stenographer accompanied the party.
Malinski testified without contradiction that he "was being questioned riding all the way back to the hotel," and that the questioning
continued there until 2:00 a. m.
On Monday, October 26, ten or twelve detectives were still present
with Malinski at the hotel. During the course of that day he was
questioned and taken to a police garage to identify the automobile
used in the crime. There is much confusion in the officers' testimony
as to the time of this trip and whether it preceded or followed one to
the Bath Beach Police Station. The weight of their evidence perhaps
is that they went to the police garage first, then to the police station,
arriving there about 5:00 p. m. The State's supplementary brief
supports this view and the view that on arrival at the station questioning by the assistant district attorney and others began. There is
every reason to believe that the final questioning of Malinski, leading
to a written confession at 2:10 a. m., October 27, had proceeded for
some nine hours. At the very least, we know that the questioning
by a battery of investigators (eight police officers in addition to the
assistant district attorney) was in progress at 7:00 p. m., October 26,
and continued to midnight.

Taking away Malinski's clothes is not the controlling
fact in this case. It was only one feature of the initial
duress. The details of this need not be repeated here.
Taken altogether, the first day's proceedings weave into
a pattern typical of "third degree" method.
This pattern was not torn apart when it "broke"
Malinski and he confessed for the first time. With that
event he was not arraigned or released. His unlawful detention continued for three days and four nights. The
questioning continued at frequent intervals each day and
each night.' Spielfogel "I continued to see him daily.
No one else except his imprisoners was allowed to see him
at any time. That he did not ask again to see counsel or
others is but evidence that he had been "broken." He
and Spielfogel were taken to the scene of the crime and
to the police garage to identify the automobile used in the
crime. These two incidents, I think, show conclusively
that the coercion continued after, and did not abate with,
the first confession. They were in themselves confessions, as the Court of Appeals recognized. In my view
they were at once the products of the first confession and
immediately connecting links between it and the written
one. They were the consequence of continuing, though
interrupted, examination extending from the time of the
first confession to the last, and carried within themselves
that confession's vice, transmitting it to the written one.
They were the process, with all else that went on during
the period, by which whatever had been obtained at the

Spielfogel was as much a tool to secure Malinski's confession as
any member of the police. He was brought down from Sing Sing on
October 14, 1942, by the assistant district attorney and others because
of what he had revealed about the crime. He made a statement to the
police before Malinski was taken into custody and was present at the
hotel shortly after Malinski was brought there. He at first refused
to discuss the case with the state officials. No satisfactory explanation
is offered of his change in attitude.

first confession was checked, elaborated, verified and distilled until the final essence was separated and bottled in
the written confession, a process typical of "third degree"
procedure. That they brought forth strong corroborating
evidence does not negative or nullify the existence of the
coercive conditions which produced both the inducing
original confession and the corroboration thus secured.'
Finally when Malinski confessed the last time, it was
in the early hours of the morning, after a night and a day
of questioning. Only after this confession was obtained,
but significantly very shortly thereafter, was Malinski
booked, arraigned and taken to the jail.
All these facts stand undisputed on the record. With
the facts of the first day's proceedings, they establish beyond question the pattern of the "third degree." They
establish its application from the time of the arrest
throughout the first day until the first confession. They
prove with equal clarity, in my judgment, that every
thread in that pattern but one, no longer needed, continued to hold through every moment from the first confession to the last. No single occurrence, not excluding the
return of the clothing, took place which gives basis to conclude that the initial psychological pressures were relaxed
or their coercive influence and effects were nullified.
If after the clothing was returned, Malinski no longer
feared a "shellacking," an inference there is broad room
to doubt, he knew there were other pressures to take the
place of this threat, pressures made possible by its success in forcing from him the first confession. He knew
that all of the subsequent examination, as it turned out
through four nights and three days, would be founded on
this confession and that he would be forced to square

sought to protect himself by using his handkerchief to open the car

every statement, both in it and made later, not only with
every other statement but also with every fact to the discovery of which any statement might lead. This in fact
was what he was being required to do, among other incidents, at the scene of the crime and at the police garage.
In short, he knew that he was "on the grill" and would
continue so until he made whatever statement might satisfy the officials who had him in charge. Cf. Chambers v.
Florida,309 U. S. 227, 240.
To say that in such circumstances the coercive influences had ended before they produced the result at which
the entire procedure was aimed and with which it stopped,
is, in my opinion, a conclusion we cannot draw and the
facts allow no room for permitting a jury to make such
an inference.
Were the question wholly fresh, the conclusion would
seem doubtful in any case that a later confession could be
entirely voluntary and uncoerced, where an earlier one had
been compelled. A man once broken in will does not readily, if ever, recover from the breaking. Cf. Mr. Justice
Murphy, dissenting in Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U. S. 596,
606. No change in circumstances can wholly wipe out its
effects upon himself or upon others. Thereafter he acts
with knowledge that the damage has been done. Others
do likewise. He is suspect by his own mouth and must
continue so, whether he repudiates or confirms the confession. If he repudiates, he incurs the additional suspicion of lying, and his credibility as a witness in his own
behalf is impaired, if not destroyed. If he confirms, he
does so with the knowledge he has already confessed and
any other course will bring upon him the suspicions and
the burden of proof they entail.
For these reasons a stricter standard is necessary where
the confession tendered follows a prior coerced one than
in the case of a single confession asserted to have been coerced. It would seem consistent therefore with our con-

been used to secure the later ones. In no other way can
the effects of the coercion be wholly excluded from the
trial. In no other way can one who has been subjected to
use of force or coercive "psychology" be put upon an equal
plane for the determination of his guilt or innocence with
others who have escaped such unlawful action or be put
back in the position he is entitled by law to occupy until
his trial and a verdict of guilty, that of a man presumed
to be innocent until the contrary is proved by legal means
beyond a reasonable doubt. Cf. Lehman, Ch. J., dissenting in the Court of Appeals, 292 N. Y. at 383.
In any event, where there is a continuous process of
coercion such as existed in this case, resulting in a series of
confessions of which the first is the creative precursor of
the later ones, and they moreover are obtained under identical circumstances except for relaxation in one of the initial pressures, there hardly can be room for saying, as was
said in the Lyons case, that the latter confessions are not
coerced. " Accordingly I think Malinski's conviction was
16 That the written confession did not follow on the heels of the
first, in the present circumstances, only aggravated the original coercion. The significant fact in Lyons v. Oklahoma, not present in this
case, was that the second confession was made under auspices entirely different from those surrounding the first. The prisoner was in
the custody of different officials, men shown by the record to be persons whom he had no reason to fear. And there was no evidence
that they shared in or at any time applied the brutal methods by
which it was charged, and denied, the first confession had been
obtained. The principal question was whether the lapse of time
between the two confessions, only some twelve hours, was sufficient
so that the second could be taken as having been made free of the
compulsions which induced the first, notwithstanding the change in
officials having custody. A majority held that the difference in time.

vitiated as much by admission of the latter confessions as
by admitting the earlier oral one. If so, he should not be
required to stand another trial at which those confessions
may be used against him. Nor should the state officials
be permitted to think they may be used again, though the
first one must be excluded.

This is a capital case. Rudish has been sentenced to
death. The written confession involved him. It was used
in evidence against Malinski. The court and counsel attempted what I think is and proved to be the impossible,
namely, to keep Rudish's identity as one of the persons
mentioned in the confession from the jury by devices similar to those employed in Anderson v. United States, 318
U. S. 350, 356, with the same result. The devices were so
obvious as perhaps to emphasize the identity of those they
purported to conceal. True, the charge in the Anderson
case was not meticulous as was the one given here to separate the defendants and apply the confession only against
the one as to whom technically it was admitted. Nevertheless, I think the line too fine to draw, in capital cases
at any rate, between that case and this one in this respect.
There could be no valid basis for admitting this confession
against Rudish in a separate trial. Due process does not
permit one to be convicted upon his own coerced confession. It should not allow him to be convicted upon

jury might have found the second confession voluntary, if there had
been no such change. Nor does it rule that the coercing officials, by
prolonging the period of coercion, though relaxing it in some of the
tactics used, can escape its consequences and nullify its continuing
effects.

a confession wrung from another by coercion." A conviction supported only by such a confession could be but
a variation of trial by ordeal. Cf. Brown v. Mississippi,
297 U. S. 278, 285; Chambers v. Florida,supra,at 236, 237.
The effect is not different because the two, confessor and
the person implicated, are tried together or because the
torture is applied to other witnesses but not to the accused.
Nor is it different, in this respect, because trial is in a state
rather than a federal court. Accordingly I think the practice followed in the Anderson case and in Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, should be followed in this one, and
the judgment against Rudish should be reversed.
In Lisenba v. California,314 U. S. 219, the Court stated:
"Like the Supreme Court of California we disapprove the
violations of law involved in the treatment of the petitioner, and we think it right to add that where a prisoner,
held incommunicado, is subjected to questioning by officers for long periods, and deprived of the advice of counsel, we shall scrutinize the record with care to determine
whether, by the use of his confession, he is deprived of
liberty or life through tyrannical or oppressive means.
17 The matter goes beyond and deeper than mere violation of the
constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, to whatever extent
this may have been applied to the states by adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. Compare Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78,
and Snyder v. Massachusetts,291 U. S. 97, with Brown v. Mississippi,
297 U. S. 278; cf. Hysler v. Florida,315 U. S. 411, stating at 413:
"However, if Florida through her responsible officials knowingly used
false testimony which was extorted from a witness 'by violence and
torture,' one convicted may claim the protection of the Due Process
Clause against a conviction based upon such testimony." Although
"the majority thought the tender of proof insufficient to require a trial
on a writ of error coram nobis, three dissenting justices deemed it
irrelevant whether the state officials knew the coerced confessions
were false, 315 U. S. at 424, and interpreted Brown v. Mississippi,
supra, and Chambers v. Florida,supra, as barring "confessions wrung
from the accused or his accomplices. . .'. Cf. also Mooney v. Holo:
han, 294 U. S. 103, and Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U. S. 213.

The warning exactly fits this case, as do also the repeated warnings referred to by the dissenting opinion in

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY joins in this opinion.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY, dissenting in part.
As pointed out in the opinion of the Court, Malinski's
oral confession of October 23 was involuntary in character and hence its admission invalidated his conviction.

But it is equally clear to me that the pattern of mental
fear continued until his arraignment on October 27,
thereby voiding as well his confessions by word and
deed on October 25 and 26 and the written confession
made during the early hours of October 27. It is inconceivable, moreover, that the admission of these tainted
confessions was without influence in the conviction of the
co-defendant Rudish. Accordingly, I agree with Mr. Justice Rutledge that the judgment should be reversed also
as to Rudish.
The subhuman psychology applied by the police to
Malinski began soon after his arrest on October 23. He
was stripped, humiliated and threatened with a shellacking. He was questioned throughout the day and was
denied the benefit of counsel, relatives or friends. This
succeeded in breaking Malinski's will, which the prosecu18 "We cannot close our eyes to the fact that our frequently and
solemnly repeated admonitions to law enforcement officers that they
are not above the law and may not in their zeal to obtain convictions
hold, without arraignment, persons suspected of crime in order to
have opportunity to obtain confessions, are often unheeded." 292
N. Y. at 386.

MuRPHY, J., dissenting in part.

tor boasted "was not hard to break," and the police were
able to extract an oral confession from him. But this
was not enough; the police wanted a written confession.
So they continued to hold the "broken" Malinski until
such a confession was forthcoming on October 27. During
this period he was illegally held without being arraigned,
was questioned at frequent intervals and saw no one save
his questioners and Spielfogel. The only concession made
to him was the privilege of wearing all his clothes.
There is an absence of any evidence that the "broken"
Malinski regained his free independent will during the illegal detention or that the effects of the humiliation and
threatened shellacking, which caused him to "break," wore
off prior to the written confession on October 27. There
was not even a twelve-hour interval between the interrogations or a change of interrogators which this Court in
Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U. S. 596, thought sufficient to
break the pattern of coercion. The reign of mental fear
and terror here was continuous for four days and Malinski's will was in a shattered state on the occasion of making
each confession. Such confessions cannot be dignified with
the adjective "voluntary," however non-coercive may have
been the immediate surrounding circumstances.
Once an atmosphere of coercion or fear is created, subsequent confessions should automatically be invalidated
unless there is proof beyond all reasonable doubt that such
an atmosphere has been dispelled and that the accused has
completely regained his free individual will. Otherwise we
might as well discard all pretense to a civilized and humane system of criminal justice and adopt without further
ado the terroristic police practices of certain past and present tyrannies in other parts of the world. Since all the
confessions here were made in a continuing background of
threatened coercion, it follows that they all were void.
One other matter is worthy of comment. Malinski, as
well as his co-defendant Rudish, is an American of Jewish

ancestry. The prosecutor made certain remarks in his
statement to the jury that may have been intended and
were indicative of a desire to appeal to racial and religious
bigotry. He spoke of Malinsky as a "jerk from the East
Side" and referred to his residence in "the lower east side
of Manhattan, where your life is not worth a pretzel."
This is a characterization of a territory containing a large
proportion of Americans of like origin.
Those clothed with authority in court rooms of this nation have the duty to conduct and supervise proceedings
so that an accused person may be adjudged solely according to the dictates of justice and reason. This duty is an
especially high one in capital cases. Instead of an attitude of indifference and carelessness in such matters,
judges and officers of the court should take the initiative
to create an atmosphere free from undue passion and emotionalism. This necessarily requires the exclusion of attacks or appeals made by counsel tending to reflect upon
the race, creed or color of the defendant. Here the defendants' very lives were at stake and it was of the utmost
importance that the trial be conducted in surroundings
free from poisonous and dangerous irrelevancies that
might inflame the jury to the detriment of the defendants. Brazen appeals relating to their race or faith had no
relevance whatever to the grave issue facing the jury and
could only be designed to influence the jury unfairly; and
subtle and indirect attacks were even more dangerous and
effective. Statements of this character are the direct
antithesis of every principle of American justice and fair
play. They alone are enough to cast grave doubts upon
the validity of the entire proceedings.

and I think the judgment should be affirmed as

to both petitioners.

MALINSKI v. NEW YORK.
401

Opinion of

STONE,

C. J.

Malinski, charged with murder, made several confessions of guilt, which were introduced in evidence at his
trial. Two, made to the police, are alleged to have been
coerced, the first on October 23rd and the other four days
later on October 27th. During that time he admitted to
the police other isolated facts which tended to fasten guilt
upon him. Three friends of Malinski also testified that
on several occasions shortly after the commission of the
crime and long before his arrest, he voluntarily admitted
to them and to his sister that he had committed the
crime.
The testimony as to whether the first confession to the
police was coerced was sharply conflicting. There was no
evidence that petitioner was subjected to any coercion at
or about the time of the second confession to the police,
save as the jury could find that the coercion, if any, attending the first confession continued to operate so as to induce
the second.
The trial court, after reviewing fully the evidence of
petitioner's detention and the coercion by the police which
is said to have attended his first confession, and of the
delay in his arraignment, instructed the jury:
"This testimony was adduced solely on the question as to
whether or not the alleged confession later made was the
result of the coercion, either direct or implied, which is
prohibited by the statute, and which invalidates a confession if made. If you should find that the arraignment
of the defendant was delayed, you may consider that on
the question of the voluntariness of any confession made
by Malinski, including the one made in the early hours of
October 27 . . ."

The trial court also correctly instructed the jury that
petitioner's contention was that the confession of October
27 was tainted by the detention and coercion which had
preceded it, and that "you must find beyond a reasonable
doubt that this confession was a voluntary one before you
would have the right to consider it." With respect to

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of

324 U. S.

this later confession, the jury was further instructed:
"If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession is a voluntary one, you will then determine whether
or not the statements inculpating the defendant, therein
contained, are true. If you shall have resolved both of
these questions in favor of the prosecution, then and only
then will you consider the confession in determining the
guilt or innocence of the defendant . . ."
There were no exceptions to these instructions and no
requests for a further charge on this subject.
After a painstaking review of the facts, the New York
Court of Appeals unanimously sustained the jury's verdict
that the confessions were not coerced.1 That court, on
appeal from a judgment of death, has power, which we
are not free to exercise in a case coming from a state court,
to make new findings of fact, Art. 6, § 7 of the New York
Constitution of 1939; 2 People v. McGrath, 202 N. Y.
445, 450; 96 N. E. 92, and also to give judgment without
regard to technical errors, defects or exceptions not affecting substantial rights. N. Y. Code Crim. Proc., § 542.
It seems to be recognized by this Court that the question whether the second confession was coerced was properly submitted to the jury. But it holds that the first
confession was coerced and was submitted to the jury as
itself proof of guilt, and that for that reason the verdict
must be set aside although the jury found under the instructions of the court, which we have quoted, that the
second confession was not coerced.
Even though the first confession were the product of
coercion, the trial court, as we have pointed out, instructed
' The chief judge and two others, dissenting, thought that the conviction should be reversed because of the insufficiency of the charge
as to the delay in arraignment; they apparently relied on state

grounds, and not on the federal constitution.
2The amendment to Art. 6, § 7, effective January 1, 1944, retains
this power in the Court of Appeals.

the jury that the evidence with respect to the first confession was adduced only to show that the second was
coerced. And the jury was instructed that it could consider the second confession, only if it found it voluntary,
and that it could convict in that case. In view of these
instructions, we cannot say that the first confession was
submitted to the jury, or that, in the absence of any exception or request to charge more particularly, there was any
error of which petitioner can complain. Hence the jury's
verdict must be taken as conclusively establishing that the
second confession was voluntary and was not induced by
any coercion attending the first. Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322
U. S. 596.
But even if it could be said, as the Court of Appeals
seems to have thought, that the jury's verdict was a determination that the first confession was not coerced, we
perceive no ground on which that determination can be
disregarded. This Court recognizes that if only the testimony submitted to the jury be considered, the question
whether the first confession was coerced was for the jury.
The Court sets aside the jury's verdict solely because of
the interpretation it places upon the conflicting testimony in the light of certain remarks, which the opinion
of Mr. Justice Douglas quotes, made by the prosecuting
attorney in the course of his summation to the jury. But
the prosecutor did not testify in the case, and it does not
appear that he was present at any of the interviews of
petitioner by the police, or had any knowledge of the
alleged coercion. At most, his remarks were an ill-advised
attempt at justification of the coercion which the defense
had alleged. He added no word by way of proof or admission to the evidence already before the jury. The jury,
acting within its province, could have concluded, as it evidently did, that the prosecutor's remarks did not tend to
prove anything more than his own ineptitude. The

Court's decision thus sets aside the conviction by the
process of re-weighing the conflicting testimony as to the
alleged coercion, in the light of the arguments addressed to
the jury.
It is not the function of this Court, in reviewing, on constitutional grounds, criminal convictions by state courts,
to weigh the evidence on which the jury has pronounced
its verdict, also in the light of the arguments of counsel,
or to sit as a super-jury. We have, in appropriate cases,
set aside state convictions as violating due process where
we were able to say that the case was improperly submitted to the jury or that the unchallenged evidence
plainly showed a violation of the constitutional rights of
the accused. Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278; Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227; Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S.
547. But we have not hitherto overturned the verdict of
a state court jury by weighing the conflicting evidence on
which it was based.
The rightful independence of the states in the administration of their own criminal laws in their own courts requires that in such cases we scrupulously avoid retrying
the facts which have been submitted to the jury, except
on a clear showing of error substantially affecting the
constitutional rights of the accused. We agree that the
controlling principles upon which this Court reviews on
constitutional grounds a state court conviction for crime,
are as stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
But the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
is concerned with matters of substance. It cannot rightly
be made the instrument of reform of the manners of state
officials. And however reprehensible or even criminal
the acts of state officials may be, in so far as the conduct
of the trial is concerned, they do not infringe due process
unless they result in the use against the accused of evi-

dence which is coerced or known to the State to be fraudulent or perjured, or unless they otherwise deny to him
the substance of a fair trial, which is due process. See
Lisenba v. California,314 U. S. 219, 235-238; Buchalter v.
New York, 319 U. S. 427, and authorities cited.
Judged by these standards, we think that there was no
denial of due process in submitting petitioner Malinski's
confession to the jury in the manner in which they were
in fact submitted, and that there is no constitutional
ground for setting aside the jury's verdict against him.
We cannot say on this record that the jury was not rightly
permitted to determine whether petitioner's confessions
of guilt to the police were coerced, or that the verdict was
without support in the evidence, or that the instruction
that the jury could find the defendant guilty if it found
that the second confession was not the result of the alleged
coercion at the time of the first, was not properly given.
. Petitioner Rudish has raised no substantial federal
question reviewable here, and his conviction, as well as
Malinski's, should be affirmed.
