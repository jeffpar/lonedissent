1. In a suit by a union under § 301 (a) of the Labor Management
Relations Act of 1947, a Federal District Court has authority to

union. Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, ante, p. 448. Pp. 550552.
2. A decree under § 301 (a) ordering enforcement of an arbitration
provision in a collective bargaining agreement is a "final decision"
within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 1291 and is appealable.

MR.

JUSTICE

DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case, a companion case to No. 211, Textile
Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, ante, p. 448, was brought by respondent-union
in the District Court to compel specific performance

Opinion of the Court.

of a grievance arbitration provision of a collective bargaining agreement between it and petitioner. The
controversy arose over the layoff of employees incident
to a curtailment of production and a liquidation of
the plants in question. Petitioner terminated the employment of the men who were laid off. The respondent protested the termination of employment, claiming
that the men should not have been discharged, thus preserving certain accrued rights to fringe benefits (such as
insurance, pensions, and vacations) payable to laid-off
employees.
The District Court granted specific performance. 131
F. Supp. 767. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 233 F. 2d
104, relying on its prior decision in General Electric Co. v.
United Electrical Workers, ante, p. 547. For the reasons
given in No. 211, Textile Workers Union of America v.
Lincoln Mills of Alabama, ante, p. 448, we think the
Court of Appeals was correct in affirming the District
Court's judgment ordering enforcement of the agreement
to arbitrate.
There remains the question whether an order directing
arbitration is appealable. This case is not comparable
to Baltimore Contractors v. Bodinger, 348 U. S. 176,
which held that a stay pending arbitration was not a
"final decision" within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 1291.
Nor need we consider cases like In re Pahlberg, 131 F. 2d
968, and Schoenamsgruber v. Hamburg Line, 294 U. S.
454, holding that an order directing arbitration under
the United States Arbitration Act is not appealable. The
right enforced here is one arising under § 301 (a) of the
Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. Arbitration
is not merely a step in judicial enforcement of a claim nor
auxiliary to a main proceeding, but the full relief sought.
A decree under § 301 (a) ordering enforcement of an
