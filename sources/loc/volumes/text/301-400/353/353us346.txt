OCTOBER TERM, 1956.
Opinion of the Court.

353 U. S.

KREMEN ET AL. V. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 162.

Argued March 6, 1957.-Decided May 13, 1957.

The three petitioners were arrested by federal officers, who had an
arrest warrant for only one of them. Without search warrants,
the officers searched the cabin where petitioners were found, seized

the entire contents of the cabin and removed them some 200 miles
away for purposes of examination. Some of the evidence so seized
was introduced at the trial of petitioners in a federal court, and
petitioners were convicted of certain federal offenses. Held: Objections to the search and seizure were adequately raised and preserved; the search and seizure were illegal; and admission into
evidence against each of the petitioners of some of the items seized
in the cabin rendered the guilty verdicts illegal. Pp. 346-348.
231 F. 2d 155, reversed.

Norman Leonard argued the cause and filed a brief for
petitioners.
Kevin T. Maroney argued the cause for the United
States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin,
Assistant Attorney General Tompkins, Harold D. Koffsky, Philip R. Monahan and Carl G. Coben.
PER CURIAM.

Of petitioners' various contentions we find the one
relating to the validity of the search and seizure made
by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation dispositive of this case, and we therefore need not consider the
others.
The indictment charged the three petitioners with relieving, comforting, and assisting one Thompson, a fugitive from justice, in violation of 18 U. S. C. ยง 3, and with
conspiring to commit that offense in violation of 18 U. S. C.
ยง 371. In addition, it charged petitioners Kremen and

Opinion of the Court.

Coleman with harboring Steinberg, also a fugitive from
justice, and with conspiring to commit that offense.
Petitioners were found guilty, and on appeal their convictions were sustained, one judge dissenting. 231 F. 2d 155.
Because of the unusual character of the search and seizure
here involved, we granted certiorari, without, however,
limiting the writ. 352 U. S. 819.
Thompson and Steinberg had been fugitives from justice for about two years when agents of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation discovered them, in the company of
Kremen, Coleman and another, at a secluded cabin near
the village of Twain Harte, California. After keeping
the cabin under surveillance for some 24 hours, the officers
arrested the three petitioners and Thompson. Thompson
and Steinberg were arrested outside the cabin; Kremen
and Coleman, inside. The agents possessed outstanding
arrest warrants for Thompson and Steinberg, but none
for Kremen and Coleman. These four individuals were
searched and documents found on their persons were
seized. In addition, an exhaustive search of the cabin
and a seizure of its entire contents were made shortly
after the arrests. The agents possessed no search warrant.
The property seized from the house was taken to the
F. B. I. office at San Francisco for further examination.
A copy of the F. B. I.'s inventory of the property thus
taken is printed in the appendix to this opinion, post,
p. 349.
The majority of the Court are agreed that objections to
the validity of the search and seizure were adequately
raised and preserved. The seizure of the entire contents
of the house and its removal some two hundred miles
away to the F. B. I. offices for the purpose of examination are beyond the sanction of any of our cases. While
the evidence seized from the persons of the petitioners
might have been legally admissible, the introduction
against each of petitioners of some items seized in the

OCTOBER TERM, 1956.
Opinion of the Court.

353 U. S.

house in the manner aforesaid rendered the guilty verdicts illegal. The convictions must therefore be reversed,
with instructions to grant the petitioners a new trial.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BURTON and MR. JUSTICE CLARK dissent,
believing that the items of evidence offered and admitted
into evidence were legally seized. They are of the opinion that the validity of a seizure is not to be tested by the
quantity of items seized. Validity depends on the circumstances of the seizure as to each of the items that is offered
into evidence. Furthermore, only a fragmentary part of
the items listed by the Court as seized was admitted into
evidence and if any items were illegally seized their effect
should be governed by the rule of harmless error since
there was ample evidence of guilt otherwise.

took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
