Rex Trailer Co. v. United

MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.

I do not agree that disposition of this case is controlled
by the decision in Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350
U. S. 148. Believing that § 26 (b) (1) of the Surplus
Property Act of 1944, 40 U. S. C. §489 (b)(1), imposes
a civil penalty, and that an action thereunder is therefore subject to the five-year limitation provided in 28
U. S. C. § 2462, I would reverse. Cf. United States ex rel.
