GLUS v. BROOKLYN EASTERN DISTRICT
TERMINAL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 446. Argued March 2, 1959.--Decided April 20, 1959.
Claiming that respondent was estopped from pleading the statute
of limitations because it had induced delay by representing to
petitioner that he had seven years in which to sue, petitioner
brought action against respondent in a Federal District Court under
the Federal Employers' Liability Act, after expiration of the threeyear statutory period of limitation, to recover damages for an
industrial disease he allegedly contracted while working for
respondent. Held: If petitioner can prove that respondent's
responsible agents conducted themselves in such a way that he
was justifiably misled into a good-faith belief that he could begin
his action at any time within seven years after it accrued, he is
entitled to have his case tried on the merits, and the District Court
erred in dismissing the case on the ground that it was barred by
the three-year limitation. Pp. 231-235.
253 F. 2d 957, reversed.

Seymour Schwartz argued the cause for petitioner.
With him on the brief was John J. Seffern.
William C. Mattison argued the cause for respondent.

With him on the brief was John J. Kennelly.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

In 1957 petitioner brought this action under the Federal
Employers' Liability Act to recover damages for an industrial disease he allegedly contracted in 1952 while working
for respondent.'

Although § 6 of the Act provides that

"No action shall be maintained under this chapter unless
commeficed within three years from the day the cause of

action accrued," petitioner claimed that respondent was
estopped from raising this limitation because it had

induced the delay by representing to petitioner .that he
had seven years in which to sue.; Respondent contended
that while estoppel often prevents defendants from relying on statutes of limitations it can have no such effect in
FELA cases for there the time limitation is an integral
part of a new cause of action and that cause is irretrievably lost at the end of the statutory period. The
District Court, after discussing two lines of cases "in
sharp conflict," one supporting respondent I and one supporting petitioner,' concluded with apparent reluctance
that it was required by prior decisions of the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit to dismiss petitioner's suit.'
The Court of Appeals affirmed, saying "'For the reasons
well stated by [the District Court] we should not attempt
to retrace our footsteps now, but may well await resolution of the conflict by the Supreme Court." 253 F. 2d
957, 958. Since the question is important and recurring
we granted certiorari. 358 U. S. 814.
To decide the case we need look no further than the
maxim that no man may take advantage of his own
wrong. Deeply rooted in our jurisprudence this principle
has been applied in many diverse classes of cases by both
I Paragraph 9 of petitioner's complaint states, "Subsequent thereto
defendant's agents, servants and employees fraudulently or Unintentionally misstated to plaintiff that he had seven years within which
to bring an action against said defendant as a result of his industrial
disease and in reliance thereon plaintiff withheld suit until the present
time."

law and equity courts8 and has frequently been employed
to bar inequitable reliance on statutes of limitations." In
Schreeder v. Young, 161 U. S. 334, this Court allowed a
debtor to redeem property sold to satisfy a judgment,
after the statutory time for redemption had expired
although the statute granting the right to redeem also
limited that right as to time.' The Court held that the
purchasers could not rely on the limitation because one of
them-had told the debtor "that he would not be pushed,
that the statutory time to redeem would not be insisted
upon, and [the debtor] believed and relied upon such
assurance." The Court pointed out that in "such circumstances the courts have held with great unanimity that
the purchaser is estopped to insist upon the statutory
period, notwithstanding the assurances were not in writing and were made without consideration, upon the ground
that the debtor was lulled into a false security." 161

that where one party has by his representations or his
conduct induced the other party to a transaction to give
him an advantage which it would be against equity and
good conscience for him to assert, he would not in a court
of justice be permitted to avail himself of.that advantage.
And although the cases to which, this principle is to be
applied are not as well defined as could be wished, the

courts of law as well as-equity where the technical advantage thus obtained is set up and relied on to defeat the
ends of justice or establish a dishonest claim."
We have been shown nothing in the language or history
of the Federal Employers' Liability Act to indicate that
this principle of law, older than the country itself, was
not to apply in suits arising under that statute." Nor
has counsel made any convincing arguments which might
lead us to make an exception to the doctrine of estoppel
in this case. To be sure language in some decisions of this,

Opinion of the Court.

But that language is in dicta and is neither binding nor
persuasive. Accordingly, we hold that it was error to dismiss this case. Despite the delay in filing his suit petitioner is entitled to have his cause tried on the merits if he
can prove that respondent's responsible agents, agents
with some authority in the particular matter, conducted
themselves in such a Way that petitioner was justifiably
misled into a good-faith belief that he could begin his
action at any time within seven years after it had accrued.
It is no answer to say, as respondent does, that the
representations alleged were of law and not of fact and
therefore could not justifiably be relied on by petitioner.
Whether they could or could not depends on who made
them and the circumstances in which they were made.
See Scarborough v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 190 F.
2d 935. Such questions cannot be decided at this stage
of the proceedings.
It may well be that petitioner's complaint as now drawn
is too vague, but that is no ground for dimissing his action.
Cf. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S.41, 47-48. His allegations are sufficient for the present. Whether petitioner
can in fact make out a case calling for application of the
doctrine of estoppel must await trial.
Reversed.
