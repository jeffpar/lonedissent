CERTIORARI TO THE APPELLATE DEPARTMENT OF THE
SUPERIOR COURT, LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.

No. 687. Argued April 3, 1941.-Decided April 28, 1941.
1. The Commerce Clause did not wholly withdraw from the States
the power to regulate matters of local concern with respect to
which Congress has not exercised its power, even though the regulation affects interstate commerce. P. 113.
2. The federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935 does not include the regulation of casual or occasional interstate transportation of passengers
by persons not engaged in such transportation as a regular occupation or business, § 303 (b) (9). P. -112.
3. A California statute requires every "transportation agent," defined
as one who sells or offers to sell or negotiate for transportation on
the public highways of the State, to obtain a license assuring his
fitness and to file a bond securing faithful performance of the transportation contracts which he negotiates. It applies alike to agents
negotiating for interstate or intrastate commerce, is not a revenue
measure, and does not appear to increase the cost of interstate
commerce. Its apparent object is to safeguard members of the
public, desiring to secure transportation by motor vehicle, from
fraud and overreaching. Held, consistent with the Commerce
Clause when applied to a person who, without having obtained the

CERTIORAR, 312 U. S. 672, to review the reversal of a

conviction on a charge of misdemeanor.
Mr. William J. McFarland argued the cause, and
Messrs. Ray L. Chesebro, Frederick Von Schrader, John
L. Bland, and Bourke Jones were on the brief, for petitioner.
In order to protect the public safety and welfare, and
to prevent fraud upon the public, the business of acting
as agent or broker for the sale of transportation of persons by means of private passenger motor vehicles operated casually by unlicensed persons must be regulated.
The decision below that even in the absence of legislation by Congress the States are without such power in
respect of transportation to destinations beyond the
State, conflicts with decisions of this Court.
This legislation is not a direct burden upon interstate
commerce. Bradley v. Public Utilities Comm'n, 289

MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

A statute of California, Ch. 390, Statutes of 1933, p.
1011, as amended by Ch. 665, Statutes of 1935, p. 1833,
defines a transportation agent as one who "sells or offers
to sell or negotiate for" transportation over the public
highways of the state, § 2, and requires every such agent
to procure a license from the State Railroad Commission authorizing him so to act. By §§ 6, 7, and 8, prerequisites to the license are determination by the Commission
of the applicant's fitness to exercise the licensed privilege,
the payment of a license fee of $1.00, and the filing by
the applicant of a bond in the sum of $1,000, conditioned
upon the faithful performance of the transportation contracts which he negotiates. By § 16 any person acting
as a transportation agent without a license is guilty of
a misdemeanor. The question for decision is whether
the statutory exaction of the license and bond infringes
the Commerce Clause of the Constitution when applied
to one who negotiates for the transportation interstate
of passengers over the public highways of the state.
Respondent was convicted of violation of the statute
by arranging for the transportation by motor vehicle, of

passengers from Los Angeles, California, to Dallas,
Texas, by one who, so far as appears, made only the
single trip in question. The state appellate court reversed the judgment of conviction, holding on the
authority of Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U. S. 34,
that the statute as applied infringes the Commerce
Clause. We granted certiorari, 312 U. S. 672, the question, considered in the light of our decisions since the
Di Santo case, sustaining state regulations affecting
interstate transportation by motor vehicle, being of
importance.
Congress has not undertaken to regulate the acts for
which respondent was convicted or the interstate transportation to which they related. The Motor Carrier
Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 49 U. S. C. §§ 301-327, which
applies to certain classes of common and contract interstate carriers by motor vehicle, excludes from its operation the casual or occasional transportation by motor
vehicle of passengers. in interstate commerce by persons
not engaged in such transportation as a regular occupation or business, § 303 (b) (9). Hence we are concerned
here only with the constitutional authority of the state
to regulate those who, within the state, aid or participate
in a form of interstate commerce over which Congress
has not undertaken to exercise its regulatory power.
The statute is not a revenue measure. Cf. Texas
Transport Co. v. New Orleans, 264 U. S.150. It applies
alike to transportation agents who negotiate for transportation intrastate as well as interstate and so does not
discriminate against interstate commerce. Cf. Real Silk
Mills v. Portland,268 U. S. 325. It does not appear that
the regulation will operate to increase the cost of the
transportation or in respects not already indicated affect
interstate commerce. It is not shown to be other than
what on its face it appears to be, a measure to safeguard
the members-of the public desiring to secure transporta-

tion by motor vehicle, who are peculiarly unable to protect themselves from fraud and overreaching of those
engaged in a business notoriously subject to those abuses.
As this Court has often had occasion to point out, the
Commerce Clause, in conferring on Congress power to
regulate commerce, did not wholly withdraw from the
states the power to regulate matters of local concern
with respect to which Congress has not exercised its
power, even though the regulation affects interstate commerce. Ever since Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh
Co., 2 Pet. 245, and Cooley v. Board of Port Wardens,
12 How. 299, it has been recognized that there are
matters of local concern, the regulation of which unavoidably involves some regulation of interstate commerce,
but which because of their local character and their number and diversity may never be adequately dealt with
by Congress. Because of their local character, also,
there is wide scope for local regulation without impairing the uniformity of control of the national commerce
in matters of national concern and without materially
obstructing the free flow of commerce which were the
principal objects sought to be secured by the Commerce
Clause. Notwithstanding the Commerce Clause, such
regulation in the absence of Congressional action has,
for the most part, been left to the states by the decisions
of this Court, subject only to other applicable constitutional restraints. See cases collected in Di Santo v.
Pennsylvania,supra, 40.
A state may license trainmen engaged in interstate
commerce in order to insure their skill and fitness. Smith

Board of Port Wardens, supra. Where, as here, Congress has not entered the field, a state may pass inspection laws and regulations, applicable to articles of interstate commerce, designed to safeguard the inhabitants
of the state from fraud, provided only that the regulation neither discriminates against nor substantially
obstructs the commerce. Turner v. Maryland, 107 U. S.
38; Plumley v. Massachusetts, 155 U. S. 461; Patapsco
Guano Co. v. North Carolina, 171 U. S. 345, 357, 358;
Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501; see also Minnesota Rate
Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 398-412 and cases cited; South
Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., 303 U. S.
177, 185-191 and cases cited.
The present case is not one of prohibiting interstate
commerce or licensing it on conditions which restrict or
obstruct it. Cf. Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47;
Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U. S. 282. For
here the regulation is applied to one who' is not himself

engaged in, the transportation but who acts only as
broker or intermediary in negotiating a transportation
contract between the passengers and the carrier. The
license required of those engaged in such business is not
conditioned upon any control or restriction of the movement of the traffic interstate but only on the good character and responsibility of those engaged locally as
transportation brokers.
Fraudulent or unconscionable conduct of those so engaged which is injurious to their patrons, is peculiarly a
subject of local concern and the appropriate subject of
local regulation. In every practical sense regulation of
such conduct is beyond the effective reach of Congressional action. Unless some measure of local control is
permissible, it must go largely unregulated. In any case,
until Congress undertakes its regulation, we can find
no adequate basis for saying that the Constitution, interpreted as a working instrument of government, has
foreclosed regulation, such as the present, by local
authority.
In Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, this Court took a different view. Following what it conceived to be the reasoning of McCall v. California,136 U. S. 104, it held that
a Pennsylvania statute requiring others than railroad or
steamship companies, who engage in the intrastate sale
of steamship tickets or of orders for transportation to
and from foreign countries, to procure a license by giving proof of good moral character and filing a bond as
security against fraud and misrepresentation to purchasers, was an infringement of the Commerce Clause. Since
the decision in that case .this Court has been repeatedly
called upon to examine the constitutionality of numerous local regulations affecting interstate motor vehicle
traffic. It has uniformly held that in the absence of
pertinent Congressional legislation there is constitutional
power in the states to regulate interstate commerce by

motor vehicle wherever it affects the safety of the public or the safety and convenient use of its highways, provided only that the regulation does not in any other
respect unnecessarily obstruct interstate commerce.
ContinentalBaking Co. v. Woodring, 286 U. S. 352, 371;
Bradley v. Public Utilities Commission, 289 U. S. 92, 95;
see South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros.,
supra, and cases cited; H. P. Welch Co. v. New Hampshire, 306 U. S. 79, 83; Eichholz v. Public Service Commission, 306 U. S. 268; Maurer v. Hamilton, 309 U. S.
598, 603; and see Zifirin, Inc. v. Reeves, 308 U. S. 132.
If there is authority in the state, in the exercise of its
police power, to adopt such regulations affecting interstate transportation, it must be deemed to possess the
power to regulate the negotiations for such transportation where they affect matters of local concern which are
in other respects within state regulatory power, and
where the regulation does not infringe the national interest in maintaining the free flow of commerce and in
preserving uniformity in the regulation of the commerce
in matters of national concern. See Hartford Accident
& Indemnity Co. v. Illinois, 298 U. S. 155.
The decision in the Di Santo case was a departure
from this principle which has been recognized since
Cooley v. Board of Port Wardens, supra. It cannot be
reconciled with later decisions of this Court which have
likewise recognized and applied the principle, and it can
no longer be regarded as controlling authority.
Reversed.
