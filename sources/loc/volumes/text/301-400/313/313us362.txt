APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS.

No. 709. Submitted April 2, 1941.-Decided May 26, 1941.
Where a State has sold land under a tax title which is valid with
the help of a statute curing irregularities in the tax proceeding,
but invalid without it, a repeal of the curative statute impairs the
obligation of the contract between the State and its vendee, in
violation of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. P. 371.

We may concede for the argument that appellants purchased from the State in the belief that the effect of Act
142 was to make impervious to attack a tax title conveyed by the State and to vest such title in the State's
grantees. But even so, appellants purchased at their peril
and under the risk that the Supreme Court of Arkansas
might disagree with them as to the effect of the Act upon
which they relied, and might place upon it another and
entirely different construction. This is what has been
done, and all that has been done, in the present case.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

313 U. S.

In Carle v. Gehl, 193 Ark. 1061, the Supreme Court of
Arkansas held that Act 142 was not a statute of limitations. In Kosek v. Walker, 196 Ark. 656, the court held
that the Act was of no avail to purchasers from the State
in litigation over such titles arising after the repeal of the
Act by Act 264 of 1937.
In Union Trust Co. v. Watts, 75 Ark. L. R. 30, the court
again held that Act 142 was not a confirmation act and
that it was not effective to cure defective tax titles nor to
vest title during the time it was in force.
Before this litigation was instituted, the Supreme
Court of Arkansas had authoritatively determined the
meaning of the Act in question. The fact that this
determination was made after appellants had bought
from the State, relying upon another interpretation of
the Act, is unimportant.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This appeal presents the question whether an Arkansas
Act of March 17, 1937, as construed and applied, violates
Article I, § 10, of the Constitution.
March 20, 1935, an act of the legislature of Arkansas'
took effect which provided:
"Whenever the State and County Taxes have not been
paid upon any real or personal property within the time
provided by law, and publication of the notice of the
sale has been given under a valid and proper description,
as provided by law, the sale of any real or personal property for the non-payment of said taxes shall not hereafter be set aside by any proceedings at law or in equity
because of any irregularity, informality or omission by
any officer in the assessment of said property, the levying
of said taxes, the making of the assessor's or tax book,
' Act 142 of 1935.

Opinion of the Court.

the making or filing of the delinquent list, the recording
thereof, or the recording of the list and notice of sale,
or the certificate as to the publication of said notice of
sale; provided, that this Act shall not apply to any suit
now pending seeking to set aside any such sale, or to any
suit brought within six months from the effective date of
this Act for the purpose of setting aside any such sale."
Certain land in Desha County, Arkansas, was sold to
the State in 1933 for non-payment of 1932 taxes. The
land was not redeemed and was certified to the State, as
owner. In 1936 the Commissioner of State Lands, on
behalf of the State, by deeds reciting his statutory authority so to do, conveyed to the appellants all the right,
title, and interest of the State in two parcels of the
land.
By an Act of March 17, 1937, the Act of March 20,
1935, was repealed.3
January 10, 1939, the corporation which owned the
land when sold for non-payment of taxes conveyed to the
appellee, and, on January 21, he brought suit against the
appellants to cancel the State's deeds, to quiet his title,
and for mesne profits or rents. He alleged that there
were irregularities in the proceedings prior to the sale to
the State which rendered it void. The appellants admitted the irregularities. It was agreed on all hands
that though these irregularities would have constituted
grounds for avoiding the sale but for the provisions of
the Act of 1935, they would not have been available to
the appellee if the Act were still in force. The trial
court entered a decree in favor of the appellee which the
Supreme Court affirmed.'
The appellants contended in the courts below, and con'Act 264 of 1937.
The words of the Act are: "That Act 142 of the Acts of 1935 be
and the same is hereby repealed."

tend here, that if the Act of 1937 be given the effect
of divesting them of title confirmed in them by the Act
of 1935 the later Act impairs the obligation of their
contracts with the State. The Supreme Court of Arkansas held that "the Act [of 1935] does not profess to
cure tax sales, but only [provides] that tax sales shall
not be set aside by the courts because of certain irregularities and informalities, naming them." It said that
the appellants acquired no greater vested interest or title
than the State had and the repeal of the Act of 1935
"violated no constitutional right of theirs to a defense"
thereunder. We are of opinion that the decision was
erroneous.
For present purposes it is unnecessary to recite the
statutory procedure for assessment, levy, and collection
of real estate taxes in Arkansas. If the taxes levied become delinquent, a sale by the Collector is authorized.
If no person bids the amount of the delinquent taxes,
penalty, and costs, the Collector is to bid in the property in the name of the State.' The State is not required
to pay the amount bid in its name.5 The Clerk of the
County Court is required to make a record of the sale
to the State and send a certificate thereof to the Auditor
of State.' Lands thus sold to the State may be redeemed
within two years of the sale.! After expiration of the
period of redemption, the County Clerk executes a certificate of sale and causes the same to be recorded in the
County Recorder's office. Thereupon the lands vest in
the State. The certificate, after recordation, is sent by
the Clerk to the Commissioner of State Lands and thereupon the lands are subject to disposal according to law.8

Opinion of the Court.

The Commissioner is authorized to sell them and to make
deeds to purchasers.9
As the Supreme Court has indicated in this case, Act
142 of 1935 was one of a series of statutes adopted to prevent the setting aside of tax sales and titles based upon
them, for informalities and irregularities in the assessment
and levy of taxes and the sale of property for delinquent
taxes, which had seriously impeded the effective collection
of taxes and diminished the State's revenue.
In Berry v. Davidson, 199 Ark. 276, 280,; 133 S. W. 2d
442, the court, after referring to several similar acts, said:
.. . we now think it apparent that the legislature was
endeavoring to find and put into effect a remedy or means
to correct the evils growing out of nonpayment of taxes, to
prevent tax evasion. For many years it was a recognized
proposition that tax forfeitures and sales of land on account thereof were well nigh universally held ineffectual
to convey title, and there is perhaps at this time, no doubt,
that there was a general recognition of the futility of taxing laws; that it was thought by many that people need
not pay taxes if they were willing to meet the worry and
expenses of litigation in regard thereto."
"Act 142, above mentioned, while it was still in force,
was another evidence of the legislature's effort and struggle
to correct or cure these well grounded and long established
practices illustrating the futility of the law requiring payment of taxes. Out of all this has come Act 119 of the
Acts of 1935 construed and upheld in the last cited case.
[Fuller v. Wilkinson, 198 Ark. 102, 128 S. W. 2d 251.]
According to the terms of that statute, when it shall have
been invoked in regard to such tax sales, we must, and do,
hold that the decree of confirmation of a sale to the state
'operates as a complete bar against any and all persons,
•Id., §§ 8610, 8620.

firms, corporations, quasi-corporations, associations who
may claim said property' sold for taxes subject only to
the exceptions set forth and stated in the act, none of which
is applicable to aid the appellant."
It is evident from these statements that the purpose
of Act 142 was definitely to assure purchasers from the
State that the land bought by them could not be taken
away from them on grounds theretofore available to the
delinquent taxpayer.
In its opinion in the present case, the court lays stress
on the fact that Act 142 was not a curative act, although
in earlier decisions it had repeatedly so designated it.' °
But we do not deem the name or label of the legislation
important. The fact is, as the court below holds, that
the purpose and effect of the statute were to render unavailing to the owner whose property had been sold for
taxes, as grounds of attack on the title of the purchaser
from the State, irregularities and informalities in the
performance of acts by state officers in connection with
the assessment, levy, and sale which the legislature could,
in its discretion, have omitted to prescribe as essentials
to the passing of a valid title.
The Act of 1935 must be viewed in the setting of the
statutory scheme of taxation, sale of forfeited lands to
the State, and sale in turn by the State. Its purpose
was to assure one willing to purchase from the State a
title immune from attack on grounds theretofore available. By its legislation the State said, in effect, to the pro"Carle v. Gehl, 193 Ark. 1061; 104 S. W. 2d 445; Deaner v.

Opinion of the Court.

spective purchaser of lands acquired for delinquent taxes,
that if he would purchase he should have the immunity. Under the settled rule of decision in this court, the
execution of the State's deeds to the appellants constituted the execution or consummation of a contract, the
rights arising from which are protected from impairment
by Article I, § 10 of the Constitution; and the obligation of the State arising out of such a grant is as much
protected by Article I, § 10, as that of an agreement by
an individual. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136, 137,
139. The Act of 1935, taken in connection with the
other statutes regulating the acquirement by the State,
and the disposition by it, of lands sold for delinquent
taxes, constituted, in effect, an offer by the State to those
who might become purchasers of such lands, and the
protection it afforded to the title acquired by such purchasers necessarily inured to every purchaser acting under it and constituted a contract with him."
The federal and state courts have held, with practical
unanimity, that any substantial alteration by subsequent
legislation of the rights of a purchaser at tax sale, accruing to him under laws in force at the time of his purchase, is void as impairing the obligation of contract.12

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

313 U. S.

Appellee relies upon the circumstance that the State's
deed is a quitclaim. From this it is inferred that no contract was made that the terms of the Act of 1935 were to
bind the State with respect to the title conveyed. But "the
laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of
a contract, and where it is to be performed, enter into and
form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to
or incorporated in its terms." 13 This court has held that
the terms of a statute according rights and immunities to
a vendee of the State are a part of the obligation of the
deed made pursuant to it. The grant of the State of
Georgia involved in Fletcherv. Peck, supra,was a patent
of the public lands of the State and, of course, contained
no warranty of title save such as is implied from the fact
that the State purports to grant its own lands. In Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S. 1, the rights of the plaintiff held to be protected by Art. 1, § 10, arose out of his
application for a patent filed pursuant to a state statute.
The impairment was worked out by a subsequent statute
seeking to destroy the right of the plaintiff to the patent
pursuant to his compliance with the earlier act. No warranty was involved. In Appleby v. New York City, 271
U. S.364, it appeared that the legislature had fixed the
shore line of the City of New York along the Hudson River
and that the land inside that line had been granted to the
city with the consequent right to convey it. The city had
conveyed land under water, on the landward side of the
line, to Appleby by a quitclaim deed.' By subsequent

statutes the State granted the city authority to use the
land in question for municipal purposes and the city
proceeded to improve it. This court held that the city's
grant, made with full legislative sanction, could not be
impaired by the subsequent legislation.
As in the cases cited, so here, the question is whether
the State granted a valuable right which it subsequently
essayed to take away. The Supreme Court of Arkansas
sustained the constitutional validity of Act 142 of 1935
on the obvious ground that a taxpayer has no vested right
in any given form of procedure for forfeiture of lands for
non-payment of taxes. As that court has held, the extent
of his right is that he shall have notice of the sale and a
fair opportunity to prevent forfeiture for default. It is
suggested that the act of the State in depriving the taxpayer of the right to set aside a sale for technical procedural
defects is of like quality with the State's attempt to restore
the taxpayer's rights against the appellants who purchased
from the State. But obviously the two acts are not of the
same quality. The taxpayer had neither a contract nor
any other constitutional right as against the State to
insist upon any given form of procedure, so long as what
was done in forfeiting his lands was not arbitrary or unfair.
But the appellants, as purchasers from the State, were
given, by the Act of 1935, an important assurance that
the State would not itself take away or authorize others
to destroy the estate which it had granted, by reason of
technical defects in procedure cured by the Act of 1935.
The appellee suggests that it is significant that the State
was not a party to this suit, and was not, therefore, seeking
to take back what it had granted. But, as Fletcherv. Peck,
or covenants of warranty or of seizin, of said parties of the first part
or their successors or to operate further than to pass the estate right,
title or interest they may have or may lawfully claim in the premises
hereby conveyed by virtue of their several charters and the various
acts of the Legislature of the People of the State of New York."

supra, shows, this is not important; for that suit was between two private parties, as is this, one claiming rights
conferred by the earlier state action and the other claiming
superseding rights under later legislation.
It begs the question to say that the State may not abdicate its police power. In the exercise of the policy committed to the legislature it is competent for the State to
enter into a contract which it intends as an assurance of
protection to its grantee. 5 This we think the State has
plainly done in the present instance. The judgment is
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting:

There is far more involved here than a mere litigation
between rival claimants to a few hundred acres of Arkansas land. In my view, the statute here stricken down
is but one of many acts adopted both by Congress and
by state legislatures in an effort to meet the baffling economic and sociological problems growing out of a nationwide depression. These problems-among them the
owners' loss of homes and farms, chiefly through mortgage sales and tax forfeitures and the states' concomitant
loss of tax revenues-challenged the wisdom and capacity of the nation's legislators.
Among the efforts of Arkansas' legislators to meet
these problems was the legislation adopted by Act 142
of 1935 and repealed by Act 264 of 1937-the repealing
act being the statute here held invalid. It is quite apparent that considerations of public policy induced the
Arkansas legislature to pass the 1935 act whereby Arkansas courts were prohibited from setting aside certain
types of defective tax sales "by any proceedings at law or
in equity." At the time that act was passed, more than

25% of the real property in the state was tax delinquent.'
Loss of revenue from so substantial a portion of the

state's total acreage was a serious matter.

In the eyes of

some people, the land could be sold and the lost revenues

recouped if some of the formal grounds on which tax
2
titles could be invalidated were rendered unavailing. It
seems clear that the 1935 legislature was persuaded of
the wisdom of such a step. But it also seems clear that
the 1935 act was repealed in 1937 because the legislature
became convinced that the law had worked directly contrary to the state's policy of obtaining the benefits believed to flow from continuity of possession by home
owners and farmers,' that it had accomplished inequitable results, that it had thereby "operated injuriously
to the interests of the State, and that sound policy dictated its repeal. ' 4 This is apparent from reading that
part of § 2 of the repealing act of 1937 which declared that "said Act 142, Acts 1935, ignores jurisdictional prerequisites to effect valid sales of tax delinquent
lands, as prescribed by law, and has brought the laws of

Ark. Acts 1935, No. 119, § 12. In Desha County, where the lands
here involved are located, tax delinquency as of December 31, 1933,

county in the state. Realty Tax Delinquency (Bureau of the Census, 1934) Vol. I, part II, Arkansas, pp. 3-4. And see Brannen, Tax

the State incident thereto into doubt and confusion . . ."
Both the 1935 act and the 1937 act repealing it touch
on Arkansas' policy as to taxation, tax forfeiture, and land
ownership-matters of public policy which are of vital
interest to the state and all its citizens. It was a matter
of serious moment to Arkansas that 25% of the state's
privately owned land-homes, farms, and other propertywas in jeopardy of being taken from its owners because of
inability to pay taxes. If only 50% of the forfeitures
were homes and farms, simultaneous ouster of so many
citizens could result in forced migrations and discontents
disastrous in their consequences.

The manifestations of

financial distress revealed by the widespread delinquency
spotlighted conditions which called for the best in legislative statesmanship. To seek a rational and fair solution
to the problem was not only within the power of Arkansas'
lawmakers, but was also their imperative duty. Without
attempting to judge the wisdom or equities of either act,
it is easy to see that both the 1935 and the 1937 act represented rational and understandable attempts to achieve
such a solution. To hold that the contract clause of the
Federal Constitution is a barrier to the 1937 attempt to
restore to the distressed landowners the remedy partly
taken away by the 1935 act is, in my view, wholly inconsistent with the spirit and the language of that Constitution.
As already stated, Arkansas was not faced with a problem peculiar to that state alone. At the depth of the
depression, over 20% of all real property in the United
States was tax delinquent.5 Nor was Arkansas alone in
seeking to do something about the situation. "Since 1928

pp. 6-7. By states, tax delinquency varied from a low of 6% in
Massachusetts to a high of 40.5% in Michigan. North Dakota (37.5%),
Illinois (37%) and Florida (36%) followed close after Michigan.

nearly every state in the Union has enacted legislation
dealing with the problem of delinquent taxes and a number of states have completely remodeled their systems of
tax delinquency laws. This legislative activity has been
called forth by the unprecedented increase just before and
during the depression in the amount of unpaid property
taxes and by the consequent threat both to the financial
stability of state and local governments and to the security
of private property." 6 By acts passed in the single year
of 1933, twelve states extended the time for paying taxes
already due, eleven states postponed sales for taxes,
twenty-six states (among them Arkansas) waived or reduced penalties and interest on taxes already delinquent
or for which property had already been sold, nine states
(among them Arkansas) lengthened the period of redemption on property already sold, and sixteen states permitted
payment of already delinquent taxes in installments
spread over a period of years.7
The states, and the federal government also, were
faced with a "financial crisis [which had] the same results as if it were caused by flood, earthquake, or disturbance in nature." 8 The federal government greatly
expanded facilities for farm loans; set up the Home
Owners Loan Corporation; practically underwrote the
nation's banking system; passed the Frazier-Lemke Act;
widened the scope of bankruptcy jurisdiction; and embarked on a system of nationwide relief. In the states,

part of the effort to meet the crisis took the form of
mortgage and tax moratoria; part took other forms, including that of the legislation now before us. All may
well be considered parts of the larger and over-all effort
to avert cataclysmic changes which were thought to
threaten the equilibrium and tranquility of our society.
This Court, in its notable decision in Home Building &
Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, upheld that phase
of the Minnesota effort which took the form of a mortgage moratorium. In the course of the opinion, the
Court quoted the state Attorney General, who in his
argument here had stated: "'Tax delinquencies were
alarmingly great, rising as high as 78% in one county of
the state. In seven counties of the state the tax delinquency was over 50%. Because of these delinquencies
many towns, school districts, villages and cities were
practically bankrupt' . . . [and] serious breaches of the
peace had occurred." 9 The policy behind mortgage
moratoria and the policy behind tax leniency to landowners are inextricably intertwined." ° The basic philosophy of the two types of legislation is identical. For
encouragement of home and farm ownership has always
been treated as a major objective of our social and governmental policy. And therefore what was said in the
Blaisdell case with reference to the contract clause is
equally applicable here: "Not only is the constitutional
provision qualified by the measure of control which the
State retains over remedial processes, but the State also
continues to possess authority to safeguard the vital interests of its people. It does not matter that legislation appropriate to that end 'has the result of modifying
or abrogating contracts already in effect.' Stephenson

read into contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties, but the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts
as a postulate of the legal order." "
So much for the general setting which gave rise to
the law here held invalid. In order better to understand
the effect that law had on the appellants and the appellee, it is necessary to consider other provisions of
Arkansas law.
At the time appellants secured from the state a quitclaim deed to the lands here in question, the law provided two alternative means of assuring purchasers of
tax forfeited lands against loss:
(1) Such purchasers, under certain circumstances,
could hold on to the land through the protection afforded
by the remedial processes of the courts; 1
(2) In case they could not hold on to the land, such
purchasers were afforded the protection of a judicially
enforceable right to be reimbursed by the landowner for
the amount paid out for purchase price and subsequent
taxes, with interest, as well as for improvements--all in
the event that the former owners of the land should for
any reason be able to prove that the lands had never been
validly forfeited. Ark. Dig. Stats. (Pope, 1937) §§
4663-4665, 13881.
Home Building & Loan Assn. v. BlaisdeU, supra, at 434-435.
"There were three principal ways by which purchasers of tax

titles could hold on to the land:
(1) By acquiring a valid tax deed. (The tax deeds here were
admittedly invalid under the laws existing at the time of forfeiture.)
(2) By two years open and adverse possession. (Though over two
years had elapsed between the date of purchase and the beginning

of this litigation, the courts below found that the purchasers had not
availed themselves of this remedy.)
(3) By failure of the former landowner to compensate the purchaser for his expenditures. (The order of the court below provided that such compensation be paid.)

The Arkansas legislature, by Act 264 of 1937, narrowed
the circumstances under which purchasers might hold
on to the land. But the second alternative assurance
remained intact.
From my study of the case I am of opinion that:
(1) The 1937 Arkansas statute here attacked neither
impaired nor sought to repudiate any contractual agreement or obligation expressly or impliedly assumed by the
state;
(2) The 1937 Arkansas statute was enacted well
within the state's general legislative powers and is in no
way inconsistent with the true intent and fair interpretation of the federal constitutional prohibition which
commands that "No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law

impairing the Obligation of Contracts . . ."
First. The state, by quitclaim deeds, without any express warranty whatever, conveyed the lands in question
to appellants. It is appellants' claim that an "obligation
of the contract created by the grant of the State" has
been impaired by the Arkansas statute. Stripped of surplus verbiage, appellants' naked contention is that Arkansas, by its quitclaim sale and conveyance, obligated
itself to refrain from thereafter passing a general legislative enactment if such enactment would affect in any
manner any of the legal means provided to protect tax
sale purchasers against loss. We need not here consider
whether under the Arkansas Constitution the legislature
could have thus bargained away the state's legislative
power in setting up a scheme for the sale of tax forfeited land. For there was no attempt on the part of
the state officials who made the sale to exercise any such
extraordinary authority.
A deed to property without warranty is an agreement
to transfer whatever title the grantor has. And even
without express language to that effect in the conveyance, it is reasonable to say that a valid quitclaim con-

WOOD v. LOVETT.

BLACK,

J., dissenting.

veyance carries along with it an implied obligation that
the grantor will not repudiate the grant and attempt to
reassert title in himself, for such a reassertion of title
would be contrary to the express purpose which actuated the parties in reaching the agreement which ended
in the conveyance. The implied obligation not to reassert title was the basis of the decision in Fletcher v.
Peck, 6 Cranch 87, a decision which this Court relies on
in the case at bar. Cf. Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet.
380, 414-415. In Fletcher v. Peck, the court said: "A
contract executed, as well as one which is executory, contains obligations binding on the parties. A grant, in its
own nature, amounts to an extinguishment of the right of
the grantor, and implies a contract, not to reassert that
right. A party is, therefore, always estopped by his own
grant." 13 What the State of Georgia did in that case
was to seek to reassert title to land which the court found
it had conveyed for a consideration under what the court
deemed to be a valid contract. True, Georgia was not
a party to the actual litigation, but by purporting to convey to one purchaser land which had already been conveyed by it to another purchaser the state clearly attempted to assert that it still had title to the land. Here
the State of Arkansas has not repudiated any implied
obligation by attempting to reassert title in the lands
whose ownership is now in issue. There is no litigation
here between the state and its grantees, and none, as in
Fletcher v. Peck, between rival grantees of the state.
Appellee claims title through an owner whose estate
Arkansas had purportedly forfeited for unpaid taxes.
Neither in the facts of this case nor in the legislation attacked is there any kind of challenge to the validity of
16

Cranch 87, 137. In that case Mr. Justice Johnson denied that

the impairment of contract clause was intended to apply to contracts already fully executed. Id., at 145. That question, however,
is not material to the point here under discussion.

the state's conveyance of all the title the state possessed.
As pointed out above, Fletcher v. Peck rested upon the
assumption that there was a continuing obligation on the
part of the state, as on the part of any other grantor, not
to repudiate a valid conveyance and attempt to reassert
a claim to property which had been sold. Such a ruling
offers no support to the contention that Arkansas, in
quitclaiming all its interest to appellants, thereby assumed a continuing contractual obligation that its legislative department would in no way alter the procedural
rules to be followed by the Arkansas courts in adjudicating controversies between the state's grantees and the
original owners whom the state had attempted to divest
of their property by the drastic method of forfeiture.
"The trouble at the bottom of the . . .case is that the
supposed promise . . . on which it is founded does not
exist. If such a promise had been intended it was far
too important to be left to implication." Knoxville
Water Co. v. Knoxville, 189 U. S.434, 436. "The patent
[here, the quitclaim deed] contains no covenant to do or
not to do any further act in relation to the land; and we
do not, in this case, feel at liberty to create one by implication." Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Pet. 280, 289. "A
contract binding the State is only created by clear language, and is not to be extended by implication beyond
the terms of the statute. . . . In the case at bar . . .
the act . . . operated in no manner as a restraint on the
legislature or as a contract upon its part that the State
would not act whenever in its judgment it perceived the
necessity for an additional ferry. . . . No promise made
by the legislature by the first act is broken by the second." Williams v. Wingo, 177 U. S. 601, 603, 604.
"There is no undertaking on the part of the State with
the purchaser that the remedy prescribed in this statute,
and no other, shall be pursued, unless it is to be implied
from the mere presence of the provision in the statute,

WOOD v. LOVETT.

J., dissenting.

and we think it is well settled that no such implication
arises." Wilson v. Standefer, 184 U. S. 399, 410.
In this case Arkansas has fully complied with the express terms of its contract. For there was certainly no
express obligation on the part of Arkansas that its general laws concerning forfeiture of property and sale of
land should remain static. Nor do I believe that any
such obligation can properly be implied. Arkansas did
not agree with the appellants that it would keep on its
statute books legislation which in effect forfeited its
citizens' lands in a way and manner which was directly
in the teeth of what had been the Arkansas law at the
time the alleged forfeitures occurred. And I do not believe that we should compel the accomplishment of such
a result by what I conceive to be a stretching of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution.
Second. Measured either by the constitutional provision itself or by that provision as construed by prior
decisions of this Court, I am of opinion that the Arkansas
statute is consistent with what was referred to in Home
Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 438439, as the true intent and fair interpretation of the contract clause.
Writing in 1817, Judge Livingston, of the Federal Circuit Court of New York, had this to say of the contract
clause: "There is not, perhaps, in the Constitution any
article of more ambiguous import, or which has
occasioned, and will continue to occasion, more
discussion

and

disagreement, .

.

. or

the

applica-

tion of which to the cases which occur will be attended with more perplexity and embarrassment. ...
and it will not be surprising if, in the discharge of it,
great diversity of opinion should arise." Adam v.

Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, supra, written
in 1933,' appears a resum6 of previous decisions which

substantiate the accuracy of Judge Livingston's prophecy. And in the Blaisdell case this Court quoted a statement originally made by Justice Johnson in Ogden v.
Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 286: "But to assign to contracts, universally, a literal purport, and to exact for
them a rigid literal fulfilment, could not have been the
intent of the constitution. It is repelled by a hundred
examples. Societies exercise a positive control as well
over the inception, construction, and fulfilment of
contracts as over the form and measure of the remedy to
enforce them." The accuracy of this statement cannot
be questioned by one who reflects upon the extent to
which contracts and agreements are a part of the daily
activities of our society. For, so nearly universal are
contractual relationships that it is difficult if not impossible to conceive of laws which do not have either direct or indirect bearing upon contractual obligations.
Therefore, it would go far towards paralyzing the legislative arm of state governments 'to say that no legislative body could ever pass a law which would impair in
any manner any contractual obligation of any kind.
Upon a recognition of this basic truth rests the decision
in the Blaisdell case. Such recognition was made clear
by the use of the following expressions, either quoted
and implicitly approved, or used for the first time: "the
prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read
with literal exactness like a mathematical formula"; "No
attempt has been made to fix definitely the line between
alterations of the remedy, which are to be deemed legitimate, and those which, under the form of modifying the
remedy, impair substantial rights. Every case must be
determined upon its own circumstances"; "In all such
cases the question becomes, therefore, one of reasonableness, and of that the legislature is primarily the judge";
"The question is not whether the legislative action affects
contracts incidentally, or directly or indiredtly, but

WOOD v. LOVETT.
362

BLACK,

J., dissenting.

whether the legislation is addressed to a legitimate end
and the measures taken are reasonable and appropriate
to that end"; "If it be determined, as it must be, that
the contract clause is not an absolute and utterly unqualified restriction of the State's protective power, this
legislation is clearly so reasonable as to be within the
legislative competency." 290 U. S. 398, 430, 438, 447.
The Blaisdell decision represented a realistic appreciation of the fact that ours is an evolving society and
that the general words of the contract clause were not intended to reduce the legislative branch of government to
helpless impotency. See Veix v. Sixth Ward Building
& Loan Assn., 310 U. S. 32, 38. Whether the contract
clause had been given too broad a construction in judicial opinions prior to the Blaisdell decision is not now
material. And whether I believe that the language
quoted from the Blaisdell opinion constitutes the ultimate criteria upon which legislation should be measured
I need not now discuss. For I am of opinion that the
Arkansas statute, passed in pursuance of a general public policy of that state, comes well within the permissible
area of state legislation as that area is defined by the
Blaisdell case and the decisions upon which that case
rests. 4
1

The only part of the Blaisdell decision mentioned by the Court

in the case at bar is a passage quoting a statement which in Blaisdell
the Chief Justice quoted from Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4

Wall. 535, 550, 552: "the laws which subsist at the time and place
of the making of a contract, and where it is to be performed, enter

into and form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to or
incorporated in its terms." The Court now quot6s this language as
the governing law. In the Blaisdell case, however, the Chief Justice
followed the quotation with this statement: "But this broad language cannot be taken without qualification. Chief Justice Marshall
pointed out the distinction between obligation and remedy. Sturges
v. Crowninshield, supra [4 Wheat. 122], p. 200. Said he: 'The distinction between the obligation of a contract, and the remedy given

As has already been pointed out, the forfeiture in the
case at bar was wholly invalid under what was the governing law at the time of such forfeiture. That invalidity was rendered unavailing to the land's former owners-and to all other owners similarly situated-by the
1935 act. As has also been pointed out, experience evidently demonstrated to the legislature that the best interest of all the people of the state was not served by
the change effected by the 1935 act; hence its repeal in
1937. In Arkansas, as appellants argue here, "these
actions to cancel tax deeds are in their essential nature
nothing more or less than suits to redeem the property . . ."

And it has long been recognized as the law

in Arkansas that "the right to redeem lands from a tax
sale depends upon the statute in force at the date of the
sale." Thompson v. Sherrill, 51 Ark. 453, 458; 11 S. W.
689; Groves v. Keene, 105 Ark. 40, 43; 150 S. W. 575.
At the time of the forfeiture and sale to the state, Arkansas law protected the purchaser by providing that he
should be reimbursed and made whole in case his tax
purchase was set aside for irregularity. That protection
is today afforded to the full extent that it was when apby the legislature to enforce that obligation, has been taken at the
bar, and exists in the nature of things. Without impairing the
obligation of the contract, the remedy may certainly be modified as
the wisdom of the nation shall direct.'" Home Building & Loan
Assn. v. Blaisdell, supra, at 430. And Chief Justice Marshall, elab-

orating his views of this same subject in his dissenting opinion in
Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 343, 353, said: "We have, then,
no hesitation in saying that, however law may act upon contracts, it
does not enter into them, and become a part of the agreement. The
effect of such a principle would be a mischievous abridgment of legislative power over subjects within the proper jurisdiction of States,
by arresting their power to repeal or modify such laws with respect
to existing contracts." "We think, that obligation and remedy are
distinguishable from each other. That the first is created by the
act of the parties, the last is afforded by government."

WOOD v. LOVETT.

pellants bought the land; the repealing act of which appellants complain did not take away any part of that
right. From all of this it is manifest that the entire
plan of the state in connection with tax sales, both before
and after the repealing act of 1937, shows a scrupulous
desire to provide compensation for the purchaser in order that he may not suffer pecuniary loss, whatever may
be the consequences of a suit for the land. And the
whole course of legislation in Arkansas shows a desire
to be fair both to the purchaser of tax forfeited land and
to the former owners whose land is about to be lost by
reason of the drastic device of forfeiture. Cf. Curtis v.
Whitney, 13 Wall. 68, 71. I cannot believe that the true
intent and interpretation of the contract clause prohibits Arkansas from making such an effort to preserve
the rights of both the landowner and the one who claims
the landowner's forfeited property. Arkansas has not
here taken away appellants' "entire' remedy" but has
done so "in part only." Mason v. Haile, 12 Wheat. 370,
378. I am willing to concede that there may be a "vast
disproportion between the value of the land and the sum
for which it is usually bid off at such sales." Curtis v.
Whitney, supra, at 70. But assuming that the tax forfeited land here was obtained at such abargain, I am
still of the opinion that these appellants-who have the
right to their money, with interest-have been denied no
right guaranteed by the contract clause. And in this
connection it is not to be forgotten that appellants could
have obtained a perfect title by openly and adversely
holding possession of the land for two years-a privilege
which the state courts finally and authoritatively found
had not been exercised. Tax sold properties are undoubtedly bought with the knowledge on the part of
those who speculate " in them that states ordinarily

adopt a liberal policy in order to protect property owners from tax forfeiture. And even granting that we
could enter into questions of policy, I would be unable
to reach the conclusion that Arkansas, by repealing its
1935 statute, acted "without . . . reason or in a spirit
of oppression." W. B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, 295
U. S. 56, 60. It would seem to me to be difficult to support an argument that Arkansas was acting either unreasonably, unjustly, oppressively, or counter to sound
public policy in adopting a law which, without depriving purchasers of the right to recover their money outlay,
with interest, sought to make the ,way easy for former
home owners and property owners of all types to reacquire possession and ownership of forfeited property. If
under the contract clause it is justifiable to seek to find "a
rational compromise between individual rights and public welfare," Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell,
supra, at 442, then it seems to me that this is a case for
the application of that principle. I do not believe that
the Arkansas legislature is prohibited by the Federal
Constitution from adopting the public policy which the
decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court has upheld in
this case. "Especial respect should be had to such decisions when the dispute arises out of general laws of a
State, regulating its exercise of the taxing power, or relating to the State's disposition of its public lands." 16
