they are correct in the latter contention, it is of no avail.

the proper basis was the value of the securities at the

UNITED STATES v. A. S. KREIDER CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 853. Argued May 7, 1941.-Decided May 26, 1941.

1. Section 24 (20) of the Judicial Code, which gives the District
Courts jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Claims over
certain suits against the United States, provides that no suit shall
be allowed thereunder unless the same shall have been brought
within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made.
Held, that the six-years period is an outside limit consistent with
the five-years limit on suits for the recovery of internal revenue
taxes set by § 1113 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, amending
R. S. § 3226. P. 446.
2. In response to a claim of tax refund, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue found an overpayment in the amount claimed and sent
the taxpayer a certificate of overassessment in that amount bearing
notation that a stated part of it was barred by limitations and
enclosed a check for the difference, which the taxpayer accepted.
Held, that there was no account stated upon which the taxpayer
could ground an action for the part not repaid and thus avoid the
five-years limitation of § 1113 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 on
suits to recover internal revenue taxes. Bonwi Teller & Co. v.
United States, 283 U. S. 258, distinguished. P. 448.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In 1921, respondent filed its income tax return for 1920,
disclosing tax liability of $52,481.97, which it paid in full.
Thereafter, and prior to June 15, 1926, it executed a waiver
extending until December 31, 1926, the time for audit and
possible additional assessment of taxes. On July 26, 1926,
respondent paid a deficiency assessment of $1,362.50. Almost three years later, on March 23, 1929, respondent filed
a claim for refund of $53,844.47, the entire amount of
taxes paid for 1920.
The Commissioner found that respondent had overpaid
its 1920 taxes in the sum of $14,833.68. In October, 1929,
he sent respondent a certificate of overassessment which
noted that there had been an overpayment in that amount
but that $13,471.18 was "barred by statute of limitations."
Accompanying the certificate was a check for the difference, $1,362.50, which respondent apparently accepted.
In thus computing the refund owing to respondent, the
Commissioner assumed that subsections (b) (1), (b) (2),

and (g) of § 2841 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 9,
66, 67) authorized him to remit only that part of the 1920
tax which was paid in 1926.
On March 7,1932, respondent brought the present action
in a United States District Court to recover the sum
withheld. At the close of the trial, petitioner moved for
judgment on the ground that the action was barred by
§ 1113 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 9, 116).
The District Court granted the motion and entered judgment for petitioner. 30 F. Supp. 722. The Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting, holding that the
general six-year limitation in § 24 (20) of the Judicial Code
[28 U. S. C. § 41 (20)] rather than the limitations in
§ 1113 (a) determined the timeliness of respondent/s
action. 97 F. 2d 387.
The cause was returned to the District Court. Over
the renewed contention of petitioner that the action was
barred by § 1113 (a), the District Court proceeded to the
merits. It held, in effect, that § 284 (b) (2) did not limit
the refund sanctioned by § 284 (g) to the portion of the
1See. 284. (a) Where there has been an overpayment of any income,
war-profits, or excess-profits tax imposed [by specified Acts], the
amount of such overpayment shall [subject to enumerated conditions]
be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.
(b) Except as provided in subdivisions .

. (g) of this section-

.

(1) No such credit or refund shall be allowed or made after ...
four years from the time the tax was paid in the case of a tax imposed
by any prior Act, unless before the expiration of such period a claim
therefor is filed by the taxpayer; and
(2) The amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion
of the tax paid during the .

the filing of the claim. ...
(g) . . . If the taxpayer has, on or before June 15, 1926, filed such

a waiver in respect of the taxes due for the taxable year 1920 or 1921,
then such credit or refund relating to the taxes for the taxable year
1920 or 1921 shall be allowed or made if claim therefor is filed either
on or before April 1, 1927, or within four years from the time the tax
was paid....

tax paid within four years of respondent's claim, and entered judgment as prayed in the complaint. 30 F. Supp.
724. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, accepting
as the law of the case its earlier decision that the action
was timely, despite petitioner's argument to the contrary.
117 F. 2d 133. On April 14,1941, we granted certiorari.
Relying principally on Bonwit Teller & Co. v. United
States, 283 U. S. 258, respondent maintains that its action
was commenced well within the applicable period of limitation. Further, respondent contends that both courts
below correctly refused to regard § 284 (b) (2) as a limitation on the Commissioner's duty to make refunds under
§ 284 (g). We find it unnecessary to examine the latter
contention, for we are of opinion that respondent sued too
late.
No
Insofar as material here, § 1113 (a) provides: "...
[suit or proceeding for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
assessed or collected] shall be begun . . . after the expiration of five years from the date of the payment of such
tax . . . unless such suit or proceeding is begun within
two years after the disallowance of the part of such claim
to which such suit or proceeding relates."
Undoubtedly, respondent has failed to begin its action
within either of the periods specified in § 1113 (a). See
United States v. A. S. Kreider Co., 97 F. 2d 387, 388. The
suit was not instituted until March 7, 1932, although the
last tax payment was made on July 26, 1926, and the claim
for refund was disallowed in October, 1929.2 But as alIt should be noted that this action seeks recovery of money which
was paid in 1921. We assume, so far as this decision is concerned,
that the phrase "such tax" in the quoted language refers to the total
tax for the year in question whenever determined and assessed; or
stated differently, that "payment" within the meaning of this statute
does not occur until the entire tax for 1920 is paid, including deficiency
assessments made several years later. Compare Union Trust Co. v.
United States, 70 F. 2d 629.

Opinion of the Court.

ready stated, the court below held that the action was
not barred because the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505), later
incorporated in § 24 (20) of the Judicial Code, rather than
§ 1113 (a) prescribed the period within which respondent
was bound to bring suit. We view the statutes differently.
Section 24 (20) gives the district courts jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Claims of certain suits against
the United States. To equate the right thus conferred to
the existing right to sue in the Court of Claims (see 28
U. S. C. § 262), the statute provides: "No suit against the
Government of the United States shall be allowed under
this paragraph unless the same shall have been brought
within six years after the right accrued for which the
claim is made."
We think the quoted language was intended merely to
place an outside limit on the period within which all
suits might be initiated under § 24 (20). Clearly, nothing in that language precludes the application of a different and shorter period of limitation to an individual class
of actions even though they are brought under § 24 (20).
Phrasing the condition negatively, Congress left it open to
provide less liberally for particular actions which, because
of special considerations, required different treatment.
See Christie-Street Commission Co. v. United States, 136
F. 326, 332-333.
Section 1113 (a) is precisely that type of provision.
Recognizing that suits against the United States for the
recovery of taxes impeded effective administration of the
revenue laws, Congress allowed only five years from payment of the tax for the commencement of such actions,
unless specified circumstances extended the period. That
this specific provision is entirely consistent with the general provision in § 24 (20) is plain. Indeed, the limitaWe assume also that the Commissioner's refusal in 1929 to make the
refund was a "disallowance" of respondent's claim.

Compare Bonwit

Teller & Co. v. United States, 283 U. S. 258, 265, with United States v.

tion in § 1113 (a) has no meaning whatever unless the
limitation in § 24 (20) is construed not to govern proceedings for the recovery of "internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or
collected." I
Bonwit Teller & Co. v. United States, supra, does not
remove the bar of § 1113 (a) here. There we held
under the peculiar facts disclosed that the taxpayer could
evade the limitations of that section by grounding its
action on a subsequent "account stated" rather than on
the original, wrongful overassessment. But the instant
case is plainly distinguishable, for, assuming that familiar doctrines of contracts furnish the test (Daube v.
United States, 289 U. S. 367, 370), we are unable to find
the requisites of an account, stated in the transactions
on which respondent relies.
To establish an account stated, respondent must show
that a balance was struck "in such circumstances as to
import a promise of payment on the one side and acceptance on the other." R. H. Stearns Co. v. United
States, 291 U. S. 54, 65; see also, Toland v. Sprague, 12
Pet. 300, 325; Nutt v. United States, 125 U. S. 650. But
plainly, "no such promise is a just or reasonable inference from the certificate of overassessment delivered to
this taxpayer, if the certificate is interpreted in the setting of the occasion." R. H. Stearns Co. v. United
States, supra. In fact, a contrary inference is the only
legitimate supposition respondent could make. At most,
respondent could assume that the United States prom'Apparently the applicability of a specific limitation instead of
the general Tucker Act limitation has not been challenged for 35
years. See Christie-Street Commission Co. v. United States, 136 F.
326. The specific limitation has been assumed to apply in numerous cases. See, e. g., United States v. Bertelsen & Petersen Engineering Co., 306 U. S. 276; Bates Mfg. Co. v. United States, 303
U. S. 567; R. H. Stearns Co. v. United States, 291 U. S. 54; Daube
v. United States, 289 U. S. 367.

ised to pay $1,362.50; the check was there in fulfillment.
Obviously, refusal to refund the balance did not and
could not imply a promise to pay the amount withheld.
Acceptance by respondent, another essential of an
account stated, is equally lacking. By accepting the
check for $1,362.50 respondent agreed only to a partial
account stated (compare Sturm v. Boker, 150 U. S. 312,
340), thereby converting that much of the statement
into an account settled. The institution of this suit is
ample proof that respondent never intended to accept
the certificate in its entirety as a correct computation of
the amount which it claimed was due.
We conclude that respondent's suit is barred by the
limitations of § 1113 (a). The judgment is reversed,
and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the
petition.
Reversed.
