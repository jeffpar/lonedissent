ALDRICH v. ALDRICH

378 U. S.
ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF WEST
VIRGINIA.

No. 55. Argued October 24, 1963.-Decided November 12, 1963, that
questions be certified to Supreme Court of Florida.-Questions
certified to Supreme Court of Florida December 16, 1963.Decided June 22, 1964.
In response to questions certified by this Court, the Florida Supreme
Court advised that, although an award of alimony purporting to
bind the husband's estate was not proper under Florida law, in the
absence of an express prior agreement between the spouses, the
failure of the husband, now deceased, to appeal permitted the
decree to become final and it is not subject to collateral attack.
Accordingly, the West Virginia courts, in probating the husband's
estate, must, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, give the
decree as broad a scope as Florida does.
147 W. Va. 269, 127 S. E. 2d 385, reversed and remanded.

Herman D. Rollins argued the cause and filed a brief
for petitioner.
Submitted by Charles M. Love for respondents on the
brief in opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari.
PER CURIAM.

Petitioner, Marguerite Loretta Aldrich, was granted a
divorce from M. S. Aldrich by the Circuit Court of Dade
County, Florida, in 1945. The jurisdiction of that court
to award the divorce was not contested then, nor is it contested in this action. M. S. Aldrich was ordered by the
Court to pay petitioner $250 a month as permanent alimony, and the decree provided that "said monthly sum
of $250.00 shall, upon the death of said defendant
[husband], become a charge upon his estate during her
[petitioner's] lifetime .

. .. "

There was no prior ex-

press agreement between the parties that the estate would
be bound. Subsequently, the husband petitioned the
Florida court for a rehearing, which was denied, but the

court reduced alimony from $250 to $215 per month. No
appeal was taken by either party.
M. S. Aldrich died testate, a resident of Putnam
County, West Virginia, on May 29, 1958. His will was
duly probated in Putnam County and petitioner filed a
claim against the estate for alimony which had accrued
after the death of her former husband. The appraisal of
the estate showed assets of $7,283.50. Petitioner commenced this action in the Circuit Court of Putnam
County, West Virginia, in order to have her rights in the
estate determined. She also demanded that certain
allegedly fraudulent transfers of real and personal property made by M. S. Aldrich be set aside and the properties
which were the subject of such transfers administered as
a part of the estate, so as to be subject to her claim for
alimony under the Florida divorce decree.
On motion for summary judgment by the defendants,
the Circuit Court of Putnam County held that the decree
of the Florida divorce court was invalid and unenforceable
insofar as it purported to impose upon the estate of M. S.
Aldrich an obligation to pay alimony accruing after his
death. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia
affirmed the judgment, 147 W. Va. 269, 127 S. E. 2d 385.
It characterized the controlling question in the case as
"whether the judgment . . . to the extent that it
awards alimony to accrue after the death of M. S.
Aldrich and makes the alimony so accruing a charge
upon his estate, is a valid judgment which is entitled
to full faith and credit in the courts of this state;
for if such judgment is not entitled to such full
faith and credit the question of its enforcibility
against the property and assets formerly owned by
M. S. Aldrich becomes unimportant and need not be
considered or discussed." 147 W. Va., at 274, 127
S. E. 2d, at 388.
Recognizing that, as required by the Full Faith and
Credit Clause, Art. IV, ยง 1, of the Federal Constitution,

378 U. S.

"a judgment of a court of another state has the same
force and effect in this state as it has in the state in which
it was pronounced," 147 W. Va., at 275, 127 S. E. 2d, at
388, the court also noted that " 'no greater effect is to
be given to it than it would have in the state where it
was rendered.'" Ibid., 127 S. E. 2d, at 389. Although
apparently not questioning the power of Florida to impose a charge upon the estate, the court concluded that
such a charge was, absent express agreement by the parties
to the divorce, improper under Florida law and that "the
judgment awarding such alimony was void and of no
force and effect under the law of the State of Florida in
which such judgment was rendered and will not be given
full faith and credit in the courts of this state." 147 W. Va.,
at 283, 127 S. E. 2d, at 393. We granted certiorari, 372
U. S. 963, to decide whether West Virginia had complied
with the mandate of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.
Being uncertain regarding the relevant law of Florida
and believing that law to be determinative of the effect
to be given the Florida judgment, we certified (375 U. S.
75, 375 U. S. 249, 251-252) the following questions of
state law to the Florida Supreme Court, pursuant to
Rule 4.61 of the Florida Appellate Rules:
1. Is a decree of alimony that purports to bind the
estate of a deceased husband permissible, in the absence
of an express prior agreement between the two spouses
authorizing or contemplating such a decree?
2. If such a decree is not permissible, does the error of
the court entering it render that court without subject
matter jurisdiction with regard to that aspect of the cause?
3. If subject matter jurisdiction is thus lacking, may
that defect be challenged in Florida, after the time for
appellate review has expired, (i) by the representatives
of the estate of the deceased husband or (ii) by persons to
whom the deceased husband has allegedly transferred part
of his property without consideration?
4. If the decree is impermissible but not subject to
such attack in Florida for lack of subject matter juris-

diction by those mentioned in subparagraph 3, may an
attack be successfully based on this error of law in the
rendition of the decree?
The Florida court, in answer to our certification, has
determined that although the award of alimony purporting to bind the estate was not proper under Florida law,
the court rendering the decree did not thereby lose its
jurisdiction over that part of the case. It further decided that "when the husband failed to take an appeal
and give a reviewing court the opportunity to correct the
error, the decree of the Circuit Court on such question
passed into verity, became final, and is not now subject
to collateral attack." 163 So. 2d 276, 284. Having given
a negative answer to both the first two questions, the
court believed it unnecessary to consider the latter two
questions. We accordingly take the passage quoted above
as meaning that collateral attack on any ground would
not have been sustained.
Given the answers of the Florida court, it becomes plain
that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of
West Virginia, based as it was on a misapprehension regarding the law of a sister State, cannot stand. The Florida alimony decree must be treated as if it were perfectly
correct under substantive principles of Florida law. It
cannot be argued that a rule of law imposing a burden
on the estate of a divorced man who has had his day in
court violates due process, and if the judgment is binding
upon him, it is also binding on those whom Florida law
considers to be in privity with him, so long as Florida
does not seek to bind those who cannot be bound consistent with due process. That West Virginia must give
the decree of alimony as broad a scope as that it has in
Florida is clear, see Johnson v. Muelberger, 340 U. S.581,
and is questioned neither by the Supreme Court of
Appeals of West Virginia nor by respondents.
The judgment below is reversed, and the case remanded
for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
