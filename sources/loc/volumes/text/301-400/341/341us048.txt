OCTOBER TERM, 1950.
Opinion of the Court.

341 U. S.

UNITED STATES v. ALCEA BAND OF
TILLAMOOKS ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 281.

Argued March 2, 1951.-Decided April 9, 1951.

In determining the amount of compensation to which respondents
were entitled after the decision of this Court in United States v.
Alcea Band of Tillamooks, 329 U. S. 40, the Court of Claims
entered judgment for the value of the lands as of 1855 plus interest
from that date. Held: The award of interest was erroneous, since
recovery was not grounded on a taking under the Fifth Amendment and the relevant statute contains no provision expressly
authorizing an award of interest. Pp. 48-49.
115 Ct. Cl. 463, 87 F. Supp. 938, reversed.

Solicitor General Perlman argued the cause for the
United States. With him on the brief were Assistant
Attorney General Vanech, Stanley M. Silverberg, Roger
P. Marquis, Fred W. Smith and Marvin J. Sonosky.
L. A. Gravelle and Edward F. Howrey argued the cause
for respondents. With them on the brief were Douglas
Whitlock and John G. Mullen.
PER CURIAM.

The facts leading to this controversy are fully set forth
in United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, 329 U. S.
40 (1946), where this Court affirmed a judgment of the
Court of Claims that certain named Indian tribes "are
entitled to recover" compensation for the taking of original Indian title by the United States in 1855. The
amount of recovery was reserved expressly for the further
proceedings which are before the Court in this case.
After the affirmance, the Court of Claims heard evidence
on the amount of recovery and entered a judgment for
the value of the lands as of 1855 plus interest from that

Opinion of the Court.

date. 115 Ct. Cl. 463, 87 F. Supp. 938. We granted certiorari limited to the question presented by the award of
interest. 340 U. S. 873 (1950).
It is the "traditional rule" that interest on claims
against the United States cannot be recovered in the
absence of an express provision to the contrary in the
relevant statute or contract. 28 U. S. C. (Supp. III)
ยง 2516 (a). United States v. Thayer-West Point Hotel
Co., 329 U. S. 585, 588 (1947), and cases cited therein.
This rule precludes an award of interest even though a
statute should direct an award of "just compensation"
for a particular taking. United States v. Goltra,312 U. S.
203 (1941). The only exception arises when the taking
entitles the claimant to just compensation under the
Fifth Amendment. Only in such cases does the award
of compensation include interest. Seaboard Air Line R.
Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 299 (1923); United States
v. Thayer-West Point Hotel Co., supra.
Looking to the former opinions in this case, we find
that none of them expressed the view that recovery was
grounded on a taking under the Fifth Amendment. And,
since the applicable jurisdictional Act, 49 Stat. 801 (1935),
contains no provision authorizing an award of interest,
such award must be
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
