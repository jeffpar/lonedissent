HAMMERSTEIN v. SUPERIOR COURT.

Opinion of the Court.

HAMMERSTEIN v. SUPERIOR COURT OF
CALIFORNIA ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA AND TO
THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL, SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT, OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 421.

Argued March 9, 1951.-Cause continued March 26,
1951.-Dismissed May 28, 1951.

1. The Supreme Court of California having based its denial of
certiorari on petitioner's failure to appeal from the Superior Court's
default judgment, this Court has no jurisdiction to review the
proceedings arising from the default judgment. P. 492.
2. The California District Court of Appeal's denial of a writ of
prohibition in this case being rested on its decision of a federal
question and not upon an independent state ground, this Court
has jurisdiction to review that judgment. P. 492.
3. Since petitioner could have obtained review of the final adjudication of the merits of this case by appealing from the default judgment, and since the Supreme Court of California apparently
refrained from taking action because of the existence of that
remedy, this Court deems it advisable not to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction and dismisses the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. Pp. 492-493.
Writ of certiorari, 340 U. S. 919, dismissed.

Robert E. Kopp and Milton A. Rudin for petitioner.
Saul Ross and E. Loyd Saunders for respondents.
PER CURIAM.

After argument, we continued this cause to enable the
petitioner to apply for a certificate or other expression
from the appropriate California courts to show whether
the judgments rested on adequate and independent state
grounds or whether decision of the federal question was
necessary to the judgments rendered. 340 U. S. 622
(1951).
Such expressions have been obtained.

OCTOBER TERM,, 1950.
Opinion of the Court.

341 U. S.

The Supreme Court has informed us that its refusal
to grant a writ of certiorari from the default judgment
entered by the Superior Court was based upon petitioner's
failure to utilize the proper channel of review, namely, his
failure to appeal from the default judgment. Inasmuch
as our jurisdiction to review state court judgments extends
only to final judgments rendered "by the highest court of
a State in which a decision could be had," 28 U. S. C.
ยง 1257, we have no jurisdiction to review the proceedings
arising from the default judgment.
The District Court of Appeal has informed us that the
decision of the federal question was essential to its denial
of the application for writ of prohibition, and that its
judgment did not rest upon an independent state ground.
The expression we have received from the California Supreme Court is also susceptible of the interpretation that
its denial of a hearing from the judgment of the District
Court of Appeal was based upon an adequate state ground.
We do not consider the force of that statement since it
is clear that the judgment properly before us is that of
the District Court of Appeal, which did decide the federal
question. See American Railway Express Co. v. Levee,
263 U. S. 19, 20-21 (1923). We have jurisdiction over
that judgment. Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331
U. S. 549, 565-568 (1947); Bandini Co. v. SuperiorCourt,
284 U. S. 8 (1931), and cases cited at 14.
The presence of jurisdiction upon petition for writ of
certiorari does not, of course, determine the exercise of
that jurisdiction, for the issuance of the writ is discretionary. In this case petitioner could have obtained review of the final adjudication of the merits by appealing
from the default judgment. The California Supreme
Court has apparently refrained from taking action because
of the existence of that remedy. In these circumstances
we think it advisable not to exercise our jurisdiction. The
