Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

Section 205 (e) of the Emergency Price Control Act of
1942, as amended, authorized the Price Administrator
under certain circumstances to institute damage actions
against sellers of commodities who charged more than
prescribed ceiling prices.1 Pursuant to this section, the
consolidated cases now before us were brought in the
District Court by the Administrator in his own name "for
and on behalf of the United States," and were properly
pending there on April 23, 1947.' On that day the President, in connection with the termination of price controls,
promulgated Executive Orders Nos. 9841 and 9842:' No.
9841, among other things, transferred various price administration functions to the Secretary of Commerce;
No. 9842, so far as here material, authorized the Attorney
General to conduct certain § 205 (e) litigation "in the
name of the United States or otherwise as permitted by
law .

. . ."

In view of these orders the Attorney General

promptly moved to substitute the United States as party
plaintiff in the present proceedings. Although the district judge granted the motion, he dismissed the complaints in 1950 on the ground that there had been an
156 Stat. 33, as amended, 58 Stat. 640, 50 U. S. C. App. § 925 (e) :
"If . . . the buyer either fails to institute an action . . . within
thirty days from the date of the occurrence of the violation or is not
entitled for any reason to bring the action, the Administrator may
institute such action on behalf of the United States . ... "
2 Actually, one of these six consolidated actions was instituted "for
and on behalf of the United States" in the name of Philip B. Fleming, Administrator of the Office of Temporary Controls after he had
become the successor to the Price Administrator. On April 23, 1947,
all six suits were properly pending in Fleming's name. See Fleming
v. Mohawk Co., 331 U. S. 111, 113-119. The manner in which he
became the successor of the Price Administrator is detailed by the
Court of Appeals in its opinion below. United States v. Allied Oil
Corp., 183 F. 2d 453.

Opinion of the Court.

improper substitution because the suits could not be maintained in the name of the United States
The Court of
Appeals affirmed. 183 F. 2d 453. It held that the President in his Executive Orders did not intend to authorize
conduct of § 205 (e) actions in the name of the United
States. A belief that the President had no power to do
so led the court to this conclusion. To resolve the conflict between the decision and those from other circuits,5
we granted certiorari. 340 U. S. 895.
We hold that it was error to construe the Executive
Orders as not allowing maintenance of these suits in the
name of the United States. It is true that Order No.
9841 which transferred various OPA functions to the
Secretary of Commerce empowered the Secretary to "institute, maintain, or defend in his own name civil proceedings in any court . . ., relating to the matters transferred to him, including any such proceedings pending on
the effective date of the transfer . . . ." (Emphasis
added.)' But this provision demonstrates no purpose to
4 The ruling was that the Secretary of Commerce was the real partyin-interest plaintiff and that the actions had abated for failure to substitute the Secretary within six months as required by Rule 25 (d),

6 Executive Order No. 9841, § 402 provides: "Functions under the
Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended, transferred under
the provisions of this order shall be deemed to include authority on
the part of each officer to whom such functions are transferred hereunder to institute, maintain, or defend in his own name civil proceedings in any court (including the Emergency Court of Appeals), relating to the matters transferred to him, including any such proceedings
pending on the effective date of the transfer of any such function
under this order. The provisions of this paragraph shall be subject
to the provisions of the Executive order entitled 'Conduct of Certain
Litigation Arising under Wartime Legislation,' [Order No. 9842]
issued on the date of this order . .. ."

vest exclusive power in the Secretary to maintain all § 205
(e) enforcement actions. By its express terms it is made
subject to Executive Order 9842' which directs the Attorney General to "coordinate, conduct, initiate, maintain
or defend" litigation against violators of price control "in
the name of the United States or otherwise as permitted
by law . . .,,
All interested government agencies have
construed the two orders together as authorizing the Attorney General to carry on § 205 (e) enforcement cases
and to do so in the name of the United States. The
Emergency Court of Appeals and other courts of appeal
have taken the same view.' We believe that such a reading of the orders is the most reasonable construction of the
language employed.
The substitution of the United States in these cases
therefore was proper unless, as the Court of Appeals
thought, the President lacked power to authorize it. The
view below was that § 205 (e) of the Price Control Act
permitted enforcement suits to be brought only in the
name of the Price Administrator, or, when the bulk of his
duties were transferred to the Secretary of Commerce, in
the name of the latter. Such a conclusion, however, is
certainly not compelled by the section which provides
7 See Executive Order No. 9841, § 402, note 6, supra.
"Executive Order No. 9842 provides: "1. The Attorney General is
authorized and directed, in the name of the United States or otherwise as permitted by law, to coordinate, conduct, initiate, maintain
or defend:
"(b) Litigation against violators of regulations, schedules or orders
relating to maximum prices pertaining to any commodity which has
been removed from price control . .. ."
Price controls had been lifted on the commodities involved in the
present actions prior to the promulgation of Executive Orders Nos.
9841 and 9842.

Opinion of the Court.

merely for the bringing of actions by "the Administrator
...on behalf of the United States . . . ." There can be
no question but that the President as a step in the winding-up process had power to transfer any or all of the price
administration functions to the Attorney General. Fleming v. Mohawk Co., 331 U. S. 111, 113-119. Accordingly,
Executive Order 9842 could lawfully delegate the control
and direction of the present actions to that official. Moreover, nothing in § 205 (e) prevents the Attorney General,
who is customarily charged with representing the Government's interests in court, from following his normal procedure of maintaining enforcement suits in the name of
the United States itself. 0 No unfairness to the defendants will result. Regardless of captions, the issues in
these cases could not change and the real party-in-interest
plaintiff has always been the same. Cf. United States v.
Remund, 330 U. S. 539, 542-543. The handling of this
litigation in the name of the United States is a fair and
orderly method for carrying out the congressional mandate
to wind up the OPA affairs. These cases should not have
been dismissed."

n1Respondents have contended in their brief that by virtue of 28
U. S. C. § 2105 the orders of the District Court dismissing these
actions as abated were not subject to review. This contention is
untenable in view of the recent decision in Snyder v. Buck, 340
U. S. 15, 21-22.
