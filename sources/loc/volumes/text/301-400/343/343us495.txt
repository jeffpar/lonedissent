APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW YORK.

No. 522.

Argued April 24, 1952.-Decided May 26, 1952.

Provisions of the New York Education Law which forbid the commercial showing of any motion picture film without a license and
authorize denial of a license on a censor's conclusion that a film
is "sacrilegious," held void as a prior restraint on freedom of,
speech and of the press under the First Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 497506.
1. Expression by means- of motion pictures is included within
the free speech and free press guaranty of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 499-502.

that they are designed to entertain as well as to inform. P. 501.
(b) That the production, distribution and exhibition of motion pictures is a large-scale business conducted for private profit
does not prevent motion pictures from being a form of expression
whose liberty is safeguarded by the First Amendment. Pp. 501502.
(c) Even if it be assumed that motion pictures possess a
greater capacity for evil, particularly among the youth of a community, than other modes of expression, it does not follow that
they are not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment or'
may be subjected to substantially unbridled censorship. P. 502.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue here is the constitutionality, under the First
and Fourteenth Amendments, of a New York statute
which permits the banning of motion picture films on the
ground that they are "sacrilegious." That statute makes
it unlawful "to exhibit, or to sell, lease or lend for exhibition at any place of amusement for pay or in connection
with any business in the state of New York, any motion
picture film or reel [with-specified exceptions not relevant
here], unless there is at the time in full force and effect
a valid license or permit therefor of the education department ... ," The statute further provides:

-

"The director of the [motion picture] division
[of the education department] or, when authorized
by the regents, the officers of a local office or bureau
shall cause to be promptly examined every motion
picture film submitted to them as herein required,
and unless such film or a part thereof is obscene,
indecent, immoral, inhuman, sacrilegious, or is of
such a character that its exhibition would tend to
corrupt morals or incite to crime, shall issue a license
therefor. If such director or, when so authorized,
such officer shall not license any film submitted, he
shall furnish to the applicant therefor a written report of the reasons for his refusal and a description
of each rejected part of a film not rejected in toto." 2

Appellant is a corporation engaged in the business of
distributing motion, pictures. It owns the exclusive
rights to distribute throughout the United States a film
produced in Italy entitled "The Miracle." On November 30, 1950, after having examined the picture, the motion picture division of the New York education depart"McKinney's

ment, acting under the statute quoted above, issued to
appellant a license authorizing exhibition of "The Miracle," with English subtitles, as- one part, of a trilogy
called "Ways of Love."') Thereafter, for a period of
approximately eight weeks, "'Ways of Love" was exhibited publicly in a motion picture theater in New York
City under an agreement between appellant and the
owner of the theater whereby appellant received a stated
percentage of the admission price.
During this period, the New York State Board of
Regents, which by statute is made the head of the education department,' received "hundreds of letters, telegrams, post cards, affidavits and other communications"
both protesting against and defending the public exhibition of "The Miracle." 5 The Chancellor of the Board
,of Regents requested three members of the Board to view
the picture and to make a report to the entire Board.
After viewing the film, this committee reported to the
Board that in its opinion there was basis for the claim
that the picture was "sacrilegious." Thereafter, on January 19, 1951, the Regents directed appellant to show
cause, at a hearing to be held on January 30, why its
license to show "The Miracle" should not be rescinded
on that ground. Appellant appeared at this hearing,
which was conducted, by the same three-member committee of the Regents which had previously viewed the
picture, and challenged the jurisdiction of the committee
and of the Regents to proceed with the case.' With the
consent of the committee, various interested persons and
8The motion picture division had previously issued a license for
exhibition of "The Miracle" without English subtitles, but the film
was never shown under that license.

organizations submitted to it briefs and exhibits bearing
upon the merits of the picture and upon the constitutional and statutory questions involved. On February
16, 1951, the Regents, after viewing "The Miracle," determined that it was "sacrilegious" and for that reason
ordered the Commissioner of Education to .rescind appellant's license to exhibit the picture. The Commissioner
did so.
Appellant brought the present action in the New York
courts to review the determination of the Regents.'
Among the claims advanced by appellant were (1) that
the statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment as a
prior restraint upon freedom of speech and of the press;
(2) that it is invalid under the same Amendment as a
violation of the guaranty of separate church and state
ano as a-prohibition of the free exercise of religion; and,
(3) that the term "sacrilegious" is so vague and indefinite
as to offend due process. The Appellate Division rejected all of appellant's contentions and upheld the
Regents' determination. 278 App. Div. 253, 104 N. Y. S.
2d 740. On appeal the New York Court of Appeals, two
judges dissenting, affirmed the order of the Appellate
Division. 303 N. Y. 242, 101 N. E. 2d 665. The case
is here on appeal. 28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2).
As we view the case, we need consider only appellant's
contention that the New York statute is an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech and a free press. In
,Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm'n, 236 U. S. 230
(1915), a distributor of motion pictures sought to enjoin
the enforcement of an Ohio statute which required theprior approval of a board of censors before any motion

picture could be publicly exhibited in the state, and
which directed the board to approve only such films as
it adjudged to be "of a moral, educational or amusing
and harmless character." The statute was assailed in
part as an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom
of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. The District Court rejected this contention, stating that the first eight Amendments were not
a restriction on state action. 215 F. 138, 141 (D. C.
N. D. Ohio 1914). On appeal to this Court, plaintiff in
its brief abandoned this claim and contended merely that
the statute in question violated the freedom of speech
and publication guaranteed by the Constitution of Ohio.
In affirming the decree of the District Court denying
injunctive relief, this Court stated:
"It cannot be put out of view that the exhibition of
moving pictures is a business pure and simple, originated and conducted for profit, like other spectacles,
not to be regarded, nor intended to be regarded by
the Ohio constitution, we think, as part of the press
of the country or as organs of public opinion."
In a series of decisions beginning with Gitlow v. New
York, 268 U. S. 652 (1925), this Court held that the
liberty of speech.and of the press which the First Amendment 'guarantees against abridgment by the federal government is within the liberty safeguarded by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from
invasion by state action.' That principle has been

Opinion of the Court.

followed and reaffirmed to the present day. Since
this series of decisions came after the Mutual decision, the present case is the first to present squarely
to us the question whether motion pictures are within
the ambit of protection which the First Amendment,
through the Fourteenth, secures to any form of "speech"
or "the press."'
It cannot be doubted that motion pictures are a significant medium for the communication of ideas. They
may affect public attitudes and behavior in a variety of
ways, ranging from direct espousal of a political or social
doctrine to the subtle shaping of thought which characterizes all artistic expression." The importance of motion pictures as an organ of public opinion is not lessened
by the fact that they are designed to entertain as well as
to inform. As was said in Winters v. N~w York, 333
U. S.507, 510 (1948):
"The line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive for the protection of that basic
right [a free press]. Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one
man's amusement, teaches another's doctrine."
It is urged that motion pictures do not fall within
the First Amendment's aegis because their production,
distribution, and exhibition is a large-scale business conducted for private profit. We cannot agree. That books,
newspapers, and magazines are published and sold for
profit does not prevent them from being a form of expression whose liberty is safeguarded by the First AmendSSee Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 452 (1938).

ment.1 We fail to see why operation for profit should
have any different effect in the case of motion pictures.
It is further urged that motion pictures possess a greater
capacity for evil, particularly among the youth of a community, than other modes of expression. Even if one
were to accept this hypothesis, it does not follow that
motion pictures should be disqualified from First Amendment protection. If there be capacity for evil it may
be relevant in determining the permissible scope of community control, but it does not authorize substantially
unbridled censorship such as we have here.
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that expression
by means of motion pictures is included within the free
speech and free press guaranty of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. To the extent that language in
the opinion in Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm'n,

supra, is out of harmony with the views here set forth,
we no longer adhere to it.1"
. To hold that liberty of expression by means of motion
pictures is guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, however, is not the end of our problem.
It does not follow that the Constitution requires absolute
freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at
all times and all places. That much is evident from the
series of decisions of this Court with respect to other

Mutual decision. Hampton, A History of the Movies (1931), 382-.

media of communication of ideas.13 Nor does it follow
that motion pictures are necessarily subject to the precise
rules governing any other particular method of expression. Each method tends to present its own peculiar
problems. But the basic principles of freedom of speech
and the press, like the First Amendment's command, do
not vary. Those principles, as they have frequently
been enunciated by this Court, make freedom of expression the rule. There is no justification in this case for
making an exception to that rule.
The statute involved here does not seek to punish, as
a past offense, speech or writing falling within the permissible scope of subsequent punishment. On the contrary, New York requires that permission to communicate
ideas be obtained in advance from state officials who
judge the 'content of the words and pictures sought to
be cop.nmunicated. This Court recognized many years
ago that such a previous restraint is a form of infringement upon freedom of expression to be especially condemned. Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S.
697 (1931). The Court there recounted the history
which indicates that a major purpose of the First Amendment guaranty of a free press was to prevent prior restraints upon publication, although it was - carefully
pointed out that the liberty of the press is not limited
to that protection.14 It was further stated that "the protection even as to previous restraint is not absolutely
unlimited. But the limitation has been recognized only

in exceptional cases." Id., at 716. In the light of the
First Amendment's history and of the Near decision, the
State has a heavy burden to demonstrate that the limitation challenged here presents such an exceptional case.
New York's highest court says there is "nothing mysterious" about the statutory provision applied in this
case: "It is simply this: that no religion, as that word
is understood by the ordinary, reasonable person, shall
be treated with contempt, mockery, scorn and ridicule .... 2' " This is far from the kind of narrow exception to freedom of expression which a state may carve
out to satisfy the adverse demands of other interests of
society."8 In seeking to apply the broad and all-inclusive
definition of "sacrilegious" given by the New York courts,
the censor is set adrift upon a boundless sea amid a myriad of conflicting currents of religious views, with no
15 303 N. Y. 242, 258, 101 N. E. 2d 665, 672. At another point
the Court of Appeals gave "sacrilegious" the following definition:
"the act of violating or profaning anything sacred." Id., at 255, 101
N. E. 2d at 670. The Court of Appeals also approved the Appellate Division's interpretation: "As the court below said of the statute in question, 'All it purports to do is to bar a visual caricature of
religious beliefs held sacred by one sect or another . . . . ' Id., at
258, 101 N. E. 2d at 672. Judge Fuld, dissenting, concluded from
all the statements in the majority opinion that "the basic criterion
appears to be whether the film treats a religious theme in such a
manner as to offend the religious beliefs of any group of persons.
If the film does have that effect, and it is 'offered as a form of entertainment,' it apparently falls within the statutory ban regardless of
the sincerity and good faith of the producer of the film, no matter
how temperate the treatment of the theme, and no matter how
unlikely a public disturbance or breach of the peace. The drastic
nature of such a ban is highlighted by the fact that the film in
question makes no direct attack on, or criticism of, any religious
dogma 'or principle, and it is not claimed to be obscene, scurrilous,
intemperate or abusive." Id., at 271-272, 101 N. E. 2d at 680.

charts but those provided by the most vocal and powerful orthodoxies. New York cannot vest such unlimited
restraining control over motion pictures in a censor. Cf.
Kunz v. New York, 340 U. S.290 (1951)." 7 Under such
a standard the most careful and tolerant censor would
find it virtually impossible to avoid favoring one religion
over another, and he would be subject to an inevitable
tendency to ban the expression of unpopular sentiments
sacred to a religious minority. Application of the "sacrilegious" test, in these or other respects, mightraise substantial questions under the First Amendment's guaranty
of separate church and state with freedom of worship for
all.18 However, from the standpoint of freedom of speech
and the press, it is enough to point out that the state has
no legitimate interest i4 protecting any or all religions
from views distasteful to them which is sufficient to justify prior restraints upon the expression of those views.
It is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious
doctrine, whether they appear in publications, speeches,
or motion pictures.19
Since the term "sacrilegious" is the sole standard under
attack here, it is not necessary for us to decide, for ex17Cf. Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268 (1951); Saia v. New

exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or axe, prominent

Assuming that a state may establish a system for the
licensing of motion pictures, an issue not foreclosed by
the Court's opinion, :our duty requires us to examine the
facts of the refusal of a license in each case to determine
this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite of the
probability of excesses and abuses, these liberties are, in the long
view, essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part
of the citizens of a democracy.
"The essential characteristic of these liberties is, that under their
shield many types of life, character, opinion and belief can develop
unmolested and unobstructed. Nowhere is this shield more necessary than in our own country for a people composed of many races
and of many creeds."
20 In. the Near case, this Court stated that "the primary, requirements of decency may be enforced against obscene publications."
283 U. S. 697, 716. In Chaplinsky V. New Hampshire, 315 U. S.

Court: "There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of
speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the
lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or
'fighting' words-those which by their very utterance inflict injury
or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace." But see Kovacs
v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 82 (1949): "When ordinances undertake
censorship of speech or religious practices before permitting their
exercise, the Constitution forbids their enforcement."

A practised hand has thus summarized the story of
"The Miracle":
"A poor, simple-minded girl is tending a herd of
goats on a mountainside one day, when a bearded
stranger passes. Suddenly it strikes her fancy that
he is St. Joseph, her favorite saint, and that he has
come to take her to heaven, where she will be happy
and free. While she pleads with him to transport
her, the stranger gently plies the girl with wine, and
when she is in a state of tumult, he apparently
ravishes her. (This incident in the story is only
briefly and discreetly implied.)
"The girl awakens later, finds the stranger gone,
and climbs down from the mountain not knowing
whether he was real or a dream. She meets an old
priest who tells her that it is quite possible that she
did see a saint, but a younger priest scoffs at the
notion. 'Materialist!' the old priest says.
"There follows now a brief sequence-intended to
be symbolic, obviously-in which the girl is reverently sitting with other villagers in church. Moved
by a whim of appetite, she snitches an apple from
the basket of a woman next to her. When she leaves
the church, a cackling beggar tries to make her share

the apple with him, but she chases him away, as by
habit and munches the fruit contentedly.
"Then, one day, while tending the village youngsters as their mothers work at the vines, the girl faints
and the women discover that she is going to have
a child. Frightened and bewildered, she suddenly
murmurs, 'It is the grace of God!' and she runs to
the church in great excitement, looks for the statue
of St. Joseph, and then prostrates herself on the floor.
"Thereafter she meekly refuses to do any menial
work and the housewives humor her gently but the
young people are not so kind. In a scene of brutal
torment, they first flatter and laughingly mock her,
then they cruelly shove and hit her and clamp a basin
as a halo on her head. Even abused by the beggars,
the poor girl gathers together her pitiful rags and
sadly departs from the village to live alone in a cave.
"When she feels her time coming upon her, she
starts back towards the village. But then she sees
the crowds in the streets; dark memories haunt her;
so she turns towards a church on a high hill and instinctively struggles towards it, crying desperately to
God. A goat is her sole companion. She drinks
water dripping from a rock. And when she comes
to the church and finds the door locked, the goat attracts her to a small side door. Inside the church,
the poor girl braces herself for her labor pains. There
is a dissolve, and when we next see her sad face, in
close-up, it is full of a tender light. There is the cry
of an unseen baby. The girl reaches towards it and
murmurs, 'My son! My love! My flesh!' "
"The Miracle"- a film lasting forty minutes-was produced. in Italy by Roberto Rossellini. Anna Magnani
played the lead as the demented goat-tender. It was

combined with another moving picture, "L'Umano Voce,"
into a diptych called "Amore." According to an affidavit
from the Director of that Festival, if the motion picture had been "blasphemous" it would have been barred
by the Festival Committee. In a review of the film in
L'Osservamore Romano, the organ of the Vatican, its film
critic, Piero Regnoli, wrote: "Opinions may vary and questions may arise-even serious ones-of a religious nature
(not to be diminished by the fact that the woman portrayed is mad [because] the author who attributed madness to her is-not mad)
. 2 While acknowledging
that there were "passages of undoubted cinematic distinction," Regnoli criticized the film as being "on such a pretentiously cerebral plane that it reminds one of the early
d'Annunzio." The Vatican newspaper's critic concluded:
"we continue to believe in Rossellini's art and we look forward to his next achievement." 3 In October, 1948, a
month after the Rome premiere of "The Miracle," the
Vatican's censorship agency, the Catholic Cinematographic Centre, declared that the picture "constitutes in
effect an abominable profanation from religious and moral
viewpoints." I .By the Lateran agreements and the Italian
Constitution the Italian Government is bound to bar
whatever may offend the Catholic religion. However, the
Catholic Cinematographic Centre did not invoke any
governmental sanction thereby afforded. The Italian
Government's censorship agency gave "The Miracle" the
regular nulla osta clearance. The film was freely shown
throughout Italy, but was not a great success.' Italian
movie critics divided in opinion. The critic for Il Popolo,

party, profusely praised the picture as a "beautiful thing,
humanly felt, alive, true and without religious profanation
as someone has said, because in our opinion the meaning
of the characters is clear and there is no possibility of
misunderstanding." ' Regnoli again reviewed "The Miracle" for L'Osservatore Romano.7 After criticising the
film for technical faults, he found "the most courageous

and interesting passage of Rossellini's work" in contrasting portrayals in the film; he added: "Unfortunately, concerning morals, it is necessary to note some slight defects."

He objected to its "carnality" and to the representation
of illegitimate motherhood. But he did not suggest that
the picture was "sacrilegious." The tone of Regnoli's
critique was one of respect for Rossellini, "the illustrious
Italian producer." 8
On March 2, 1949, "The Miracle" was licensed in New
York State for showing without English subtitles.' However, it was never exhibited until after a-second license
was issued on November 30, 1950, for the trilogy, "Ways
of Love," combining "The Miracle" with two French
films, Jean Renoir's "A Day in the Country" and Marcel
Pagnol's "Jofroi." 10 All had English subtitles. Both li6 Il Popolo, Nov. 3, 1948, p. 2, col. 9, translated by Camille M.

censes were issued in the usual course after viewings of
the picture by the Motion Picture Division of the New
York State Education Department. The Division is directed by statute to "issue a license" "unless [the] film or
a part thereof is obscene, indecent, immoral, inhuman,
sacrilegious, or is of such a character that its exhibition
would tend to corrupt morals or incite to crime." N. Y.
Education Law, § 122. The trilogy opened on December
12, 1950, at the Paris Theatre on 58th Street in Manhattan. It was promptly attacked as "a sacrilegious and
blasphemous mockery of Christian religious truth"" by
the National Legion of Decency, a private Catholic organization for film censorship, whose objectives have intermittently been approved by various non-Catholic
church and social groups since its formation in 1933."2
However, the National Board of Review (a non-industry
lay organization devoted to raising -the level of motion
pictures by mobilizing public opinion, under the slogan
"Selection Not Censorship") 3 recommended the picture
as "especially worth seeing." New York critics on the
whole praised "The Miracle"; those who dispraised did
not suggest sacrilege. 1 On December 27 the critics selected the "Ways of Love" as the best foreign language

License Commissioner had exceeded his authority in that
he was without powers of movie censorship. 7
Upon the failure of the License Commissioner's effort
to cut off showings of "The Miracle," the controversy
took a new turn. On Sunday, January 7, 1951, a statement of His Eminence, Francis Cardinal Spellman, condemning the picture and calling on "all right thinking citizens" to unite to tighten censorship laws, was read at all
masses in St. Patrick's Cathedral.l"
The views of Cardinal Spellman aroused dissent among
-other devout Christians. Protestant clergymen, repre'"Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. McCaffrey, 198 Misc. 884, 101 N. Y. S.

Miracle" -"a vile and harmful picture," "a. despicable affront to every
Christian" ("We believe in miracles. This picture ridicules that
belief"), and finally "a vicious insult to Italian womanhood." As a
consequence, he declared: "we, as the guardians of the moral law,

prominent in Catholic lay activities:
"At the outbreak of the controversy, I immediately
arranged for a private showing of. the film. I invited
a group of Catholics, competent and respected for

Commonweal itself questioned the wisdom of transforming Church dogma which Catholics may obey as "a free
act" into state-enforced censorship for all.23 Allen Tate,
the well-known Catholic poet and critic, wrote: "The picture seems to me to be superior in acting and photography but inferior dramatically. . . . In the long run

Order, cabled Cardinal Spellman protesting against boycott of "The Miracle":
"In The Miracle men are still without pity because
they still have not come back to God, but God is
already present in 'the faith, however confused, of
that poor, persecuted woman; and since God is
wherever a human being suffers and is misunderstood, The Miracle occurs when at the birth of the
child the poor, demented woman regains sanity in her

maternal love."
In view of the controversy thus aroused by the picture,
the Chairman of the Board of Regents appointed a committee of three Board members to review the action of the
Motion Picture Division in granting the two licenses.
After viewing the picture on Jan. 15, 1951, the committee
declared it "sacrilegious." The Board four days later
issued an order to the licensees to show cause why the
licenses should not be cancelled in that the picture was
"sacrilegious." The Board of Regents rescinded the
-licenses on Feb. 16, 1951, saying that the "mockery or
profaning of these beliefs that are sacred to any portion
of our citizenship is abhorrent to the laws of this great
State." On review the Appellate Division upheld the
Board of Regents, holding that the banning of any -motion picture "that may fairly be deemed sacrilegious to
the adherents of any religious group . . . is directly related to public peace and order" and is not a denial of.

affirmed the order of the Appellate Division. 303 N. Y.
242, 101 N. E. 2d 665. After concluding that the Board
of Regents acted within its authority and that its determination was not "one that no reasonable mind could
reach," id., at 250-255, 256-257, 101 N. E. 2d 665, 667671, the majority held, first, that "sacrilegious" was
an adequately definite standard, quoting a definition
from Funk & Wagnalls' Dictionary and referring to opinions in this Court that in passing used-the term "profane,"
which the New York court said was a synonym of "sacrilegious"; second, that the State's assurance "that no religion . . .shall be treated with contempt, mockery, scorn
and ridicule . . .by those engaged in selling entertainment by way of motion pictures" does not violate the
religious guarantee of the First Amendment; and third,
that motion pictures are not entitled to the immunities
from regulation enjoyed by the press, in view of the decision in Mutual Film Corp. v. Ohio Industrial Comm'n,

that the standard "sacrilegious" is unconstitutionally

freedom of speech applied equally to motion pictures and
prevented this censorship. 303 N. Y. 242, 264, 101 N. E.

must be allowed to be shown under any circumstances.
But only the tyranny of absolutes would rely on such
alternatives to meet the problems generated by the need
to accommodate the diverse interests affected by the motion pictures in compact modern communities. It would
startle Madison and Jefferson and George Mason, could
they adjust themselves to our day, to be told that the freedom of speech which they espoused in the Bill of Rights
authorizes a showing of "The Miracle" from windows facing St. Patrick's Cathedral in the forenoon of Easter Sunday," just as it would startle them to be told that any
picture, whatever its theme and its expression, could be
barred from being commercially exhibited. The general
principle of free speech, expressed in the First Amendment as to encroachments by Congress,. and included as
it is in the Fourteenth Amendment, binding on the States,
must be placed in its historical and legal contexts. The
Constitution, we cannot recall too often, is an organism,
not -merely a literary composition.
If the New York Court of Appeals had given '"sacrilegious" the meaning it has had in Catholic thought since
St. Thomas Aquinas formulated its scope, and had sustained a finding by the Board of Regents that "The Miracle" came within that scope, this Court would have to
meet some of the broader questions regarding the relation
to the motion picture industry of the guarantees of the
First Amendment so far as reflected in the Fourteenth.
But the New York court did not confine "sacrilegious"
within such technical, Thomist limits, nor within any
specific, or even approximately specified, limits. It may
fairly be said that that court deemed "sacrilegious" a selfdefining term, a word that carries a well-known, settled
meaning in the common speech of.men.

is not a.fanciful hypothesis, see'N. Y. Times, April 14, 1952, p. 1,

So far as the Court of Appeals sought to support its
notion that "sacrilegious" has the necessary precision of
meaning which the Due Process Clause enjoins for statutes regulating men's activities, it relied on this definition from Funk & Wagnalls' Dictionary: "The act of
violating or profaning anything sacred." ' But this merely
defines by turning an adjective into a noun and bringing in two new words equally undefined. It leaves wide
open the question as to what persons, doctrines or things
are "sacred." It sheds no light on what representations
on the motion picture screen will constitute "profaning"
those things which the State censors find to be "sacred."
To criticize or assail religious doctrine may wound to
the quick those who are attached to the doctrine and profoundly cherish it. But to bar such pictorial discussion
is to subject non-conformists to the rule of sects.
Even in Mutual Film "Corp.v. Ohio IndustrialComm'n,
236 U. S. 230, it. was deemed necessary to find that the
terms "educational, moral, amusing or harmless" do not
leave "decision to arbitrary judgment." Such general
words were found to "get precision from the sense and
experience of men." Id., at 245, 246. This cannot be
said of "sacrilegious." If there is one thing that the history of religious conflicts shows, it is that the term "sacrilegious"7-if by that is implied offense to the deep convictions of members of different sects, which is what the
Court of Appeals seems to mean so far as it means anything precisely---does not gain "precision from the sense
and experience of men."
The vast apparatus of indices and digests, which mirrors our law, affords no clue to a judicial definition of
sacrilege. Not one case, barring the present, has been
uncovered which considers the meaning of the term in
any context. Nor has the practice under the New York
law contributed light. The Motion Picture Divisioni of
the Education Department does not support with ex-

planatory statements its action on any specific motion
picture, which we are advised is itself not made public.
Of the fifty-odd reported appeals to the Board of Regents
from denials of licenses by the Division, only three concern the category "sacrilegious.' ' I In these cases, as in
others under the Act, the Board's reported opinion confines itself to a bare finding that the film was or was not
"sacrilegious," without so much as a description of the
allegedly offensive matter, or even of the film as a whole
to enlighten the inquirer. Well-equipped law libraries
are not niggardly in their reflection of "the sense and
experience of men," but we must search elsewhere for any
which gives to "sacrilege" its meaning.
Sacrilege,' as a restricted ecclesiastical concept, has a
long history. Naturally enough, religions have sought
to protect their priests and anointed symbols from physical injury.' But history demonstrates that the term is
hopelessly vague when it goes beyond such ecclesiastical
definiteness and is used at large as the basis for punishing
deviation from doctrine.
Etymologically "sacrilege" is limited to church-robbing:
sacer, sacred, and legere, to steal or pick out. But we are

28 Since almost without exception "Aacrilegious" is defined in terms
of "sacrilege,"- our discussion will be directed to the latter ierm. See
Bailey, Universal Etymological English Dictionary (London, 1730),
"Sacrilegious"-"of, pertaining to, or guilty of Sacrilege"; Funk &
Wagnalls' New Standard Dictionary (1937), "Sacrilegious"--"Having

told that "already in Cicero's time it had grown to include
in popular speech any insult or injury to [sacred
things]." ' "In primitive religions [sacrilege is] inclusive of almost every serious offence even in fields now regarded as merely social or political .
.
The concept of "tabu" in primitive society is thus close to that
of "sacrilege." 32 And in "the Theodosian Code the various crimes which are accounted sacrilege include-apostasy, heresy, schism, Judaism, paganism, attempts against
the immunity of churches and clergy or privileges of
church courts, the desecration of sacraments, etc., and
even Sunday. Along with. these crimes against religion
went treason to the emperor, offences against the laws,
especially counterfeiting, defraudation in taxes, seizure
of confiscated property, evil conduct of imperial officers,
etc." I During the Middle Ages the Church considerably delimited the application of the term. St. Thomas
Aquinas classified the objects of "sacrilege" as persons,
places, and thing.' The injuries which would constitute

"Sacrilege consists in the unworthy use or treatment of sacred things
and sacred persons. Certain things are of their nature sacred (e. g.,
the Sacraments); others become so by blessing or consecration legitimately bestowed on things or places by authority of the Church.
Persons are redered sacred by ordination or consecration or by other
forms of dedication to the divine service by authority of the Church
(e. g., by first tonsure, by religious profession)."

"sacrilege" received specific and detailed illustration.'
This teaching of Aquinas is, I believe, still substantially
the basis of the official Catholic doctrine of sacrilege.
Thus, for the Roman Catholic Church, the term came to
have a fairly definite meaning, but one, in general, limited
to protecting things physical against injurious acts."
Apostasy, heresy, and blasphemy coexisted as religious
crimes alongside sacrilege; they were peculiarly in the
realm of religious dogma and doctrine, as "sacrilege" was
not. It is true that Spelman, writing "The History and
Fate of Sacrilege" in 1632, included in "sacrilege" acts
whereby "the very Deity is invaded, profaned, or robbed
of its glory . . . . In this high sin are blasphemers,
mAfter his method of raising objections and then refuting them,
St. Thomas Aquinas defends including within the proscription of
"sacrilege," anyone "who disagree[s] about the sovereign's decision,
and doubt[s] whether the person chosen by the sovereign be worthy
of honor" and "any man [who] shall allow the Jews to hold public
offices." Summa Theologica, part II-II, question 99, art. 1.
36Rev. Thomas Slater, S. J., A Manual of Moral Theology (1908),
c. VI, classifies and illustrates the modern theological view of "sacrilege":
Sacrilege against sacred persons: to use physical violence against
a member of the clergy; to violate "the privilege of immunity of
the clergy from civil jurisdiction, as far as this is still in force"; to
violate a vow of chastity.
Sacrilege against sacred places: to violate the immunity of churches
and other sacred places "as far as this is still in force"; to commit
a crime such as homicide, suicide, bloody attack there; to break by
sexual act a vow of chastity there; to bury an infidel, heretic, or excommunicate in churches or cemeteries canonically established; or to
put the sacred place to a profane use, as a secular courtroom, public
market, banquet hall, stable, etc.
Sacrilege against sacred things: to treat with irreverence, contempt,
or obscenity the sacraments (particularly the Eucharist), Holy
Scriptures, relics, sacred images, etc., to steal sacred things, or profane
things from sacred places; to commit simony; or to steal, confiscate,
or danmage wilfully ecclesiastical property. See also, The Catholic
Encyclopedia, "Sacrilege."

sorcerers, witches, and enchanters." ' But his main
theme was the "spoil of church lands done by Henry
VIII" and the misfortunes that subsequently befell the
families of the recipients of former ecclesiastical property
as divine punishment.
To the extent that English law took jurisdiction to
punish "sacrilege," the term meant the stealing from a
church, or otherwise doing damage to church property. '8
This special protection against "sacrilege," that is, property damage, was granted only to the Established
Church.'8 Since the repeal less than a century ago of
the English law punishing "sacrilege" against the property of the Established Church, religious property has received little special protection. The property of all sects
has had substantially the same protection as is accorded non-religious property.'

At no time up to the

present has English law known "sacrilege" to be used in
any wider sense than the physical injury to church property.

taken jurisdiction to punish departures from accepted
dogma or religious practice or the expression of particular
religious opinions, but never have these "offenses" been
denominated "sacrilege." Apostasy, heresy, offenses
against the Established Church, blasphemy, profanation

of the Lord's Day, etc., were distinct criminal offenses,
characterized by Blackstone as "offences against God and
religion." 41 These invidious reflections upon religious
susceptibilities were not covered under sacrilege as they
might be under the Court of Appeals' opinion. Anyone
doubting the dangerous uncertainty of the New York definition, which.makes "sacrilege" overlap these other "offenses against religion," need only read Blackstone's
account of the broad and varying content given each of
these offenses.
A student of English lexicography would despair of
finding the meaning attributed to "sacrilege" by the
New York court..'
Most dictionaries define the concept in the limited sense of the physical abuse of physi-,
cal objects. The definitions given for "sacrilege" by
two dictionaries published in 1742 and 1782 are typical.
Bailey's defined it as "the stealing of Sacred Things,
Church Robbing; an Alienation to Laymen, and to profane and common Purposes, of what was given to religious
Persons, and to pious Uses." "a Barclay's said it is "the
crime of taking any thing dedicated to divine worship,
or profaning any thing sacred," where "to profane" is
defined "to apply any thing sacred to common uses.
To be irreverent to sacred persons or things.""

same dictionaries defined "blasphemy," a peculiarly
verbal offense, in much broader terms than "sacrilege,"
indeed in terms which the New York court finds encompassed by "sacrilegious." For example, Barclay
said "blasphemy" is "an offering some indignity to God,
any person of the Trinity, ,any messengers from God,
his holy writ, or the doctrines of revelation.""
It is
hardly necessary to comment that the limits of this definition remain too uncertain to justify constraining the
creative efforts of the imagination by fear of pains and
penalties imposed by a necessarily subjective censorship.
It is true that some earlier dictionaries assigned to "sacrilege" the broader meaning of "abusing Sacraments or
holy Mysteries," 4 but the broader meaning is more indefinite, not less. Noah Webster first published his
American Dictionary in 1828. Both it and the later dictionaries published by the Merriam Company, Webster's
International Dictionary and Webster's New International Dictionary, have gone through dozens of editions
and printings, revisions and expansions. In all editions
throughout 125 years, these American dictionaries have
defined "sacrilege" and "sacrilegious" to echo substantially the narrow, technical definitions from the earlier

The New York Cot~rt of Appeals' statement that the

without regard to the lexicographic history of the term.

Wagnalls' definition uses "sacrilege" in its historically
restricted meaning, which was not, and could hardly have
been, the basis for condemning "The Miracle." If the
New York court reads the Funk-& Wagnalls' definition in
a broader sense, in a sense for which history and experience provide no gloss, it inevitably left the censor free
to judge by whatever dogma he deems "sacred" and to
ban whatever motion pictures he 'may assume would
"profane" religious doctrine widely enough held to arouse
protest.
Examination of successive editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica over nearly two centuries up to the present
day gives no more help than the dictionaries. From
1768 to the eleventh edition in 1911, merely a brief dictionary-type definition was given for "sacrilege." ,1 The
eleventh edition, which first published a longer article,
was introduced as follows: "the violation or profanation of sacred things, a crime of varying scope in different religions. It is naturally much more general and
accounted more dreadful in those primitive religions in
act of violating or profaning anything sacred, including sacramental
vows.'
Funk & Wagnalls' Standard Dictionary (1895) defined "to profane"
as "1. To treat with irreverence or abuse; make common or unholy;
desecrate; pollute. 2. Hence, to put to a wrong or degrading use;
debase." The New Standard Dictionary adds a third meaning:
"3.- To vulgarize; give over to the crowd."

which cultural objects play so great a part, than in more
highly spiritualized religions where they tend to disappear. But wherever the idea of sacred exists, sacrilege
is possible." I The article on "sacrilege" in the current
edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica is substantially
the same as that in the 1911 edition.
History teaches us the indefiniteness of the concept
"sacrilegious" in another respect. In the case 'of most
countries and times where the concept of sacrilege has
been of importance, there has existed an established
church or a state religion. That which was "sacred," and
so was protected against "profaning," was designated in
each case by ecclesiastical authority. What might have
been definite when a. controlling church imposed a detailed scheme of observances becomes impossibly confused and uncertain when hundreds of sects, with widely
disparate and often directly conflicting ideas of sacredness, enjoy, without discrimination' and in, equal measure,
constitutionally guaranteed religious freedom. In the
Rome of the late emperors, the England of James I, or the
Geneva of Calvin, and today in Roman Catholic Spain,
Mohammedan Saudi Arabia, or any other country with a
monolithic religion, the category of things sacred might
have clearly definable limits. But in "America the multiz
plicity of the ideas of "sacredness" held with equal but
conflicting fervor by the great number of religious groups
makes the term "sacrilegious" too indefinite to satisfy
constitutional demands based on reason and fairness.
If "sacrilegious" bans more than the physical abuse
of sacred persons, places, or things, if it permits censorship of religious opinions' which is the effect of the holding below, the term will include what may be found
to be "blasphemous." England's 'experience with that
treacherous word should give us pause, apart from our

requirements for the separation of Church and State.
The crime of blasphemy in Seventeenth Century England
was the crime of dissenting from whatever was the current religious dogma." King James I's "Book of Sports"
was first required reading in the churches; later all copies
were consigned to the flames. To attack the mass was
once blasphemous; to perform it became so. At different
times during that century, with the shifts in the attitude
of government towards particular religious views, persons who doubted the doctrine of the Trinity (e. g., Unitarians, Universalists, etc.) or the divinity of Christ,
observed the Sabbath on Saturday,' denied the possibility of witchcraft, repudiated child baptism or urged
methods of baptism other than sprinkling, were charged as
blasphemers, or their books were burned or banned as
blasphemous. Blasphemy was the chameleon phrase
which meant the criticism of whatever the ruling authority of the moment established as orthodox religious doctrine. 2 While it is true that blasphemy prosecutions

writes thus of the prosecution of Thomas Woolston for blasphemy:
"The offence, in the first place, consisted in the publication in 1725
of a tract entitled A Moderator between an Infidel and an Apostate,
in which the author questioned the historical accuracy of the Resurrection and the Virgin Birth. Such speculations, however much they
might offend the religious feeling of the nation, would not now arouse
apprehensions in the civil government, or incur legal penalties; but
at the time of which we are writing, when the authority of government was far less stable and secure and rested on far narrower foundation6s than at present, such audacious opinions were considered, not
without some reason, as a menace, not only to religion but to the
state."

have continued in England-although in lessening numbers-into the present century," the existence there of an
established church gives more definite contours to the
crime in England than the term "sacrilegious" can possibly hav in this country. Moreover, the scope of the
English common-law crime of blasphemy has been considerably limited by the declaration that "if the decencies
of controversy are observed, even the fundamentals of
religion may be attacked," " a limitation which the New
York court has not put upon the Board of Regents' power
to declare a motion picture "sacrilegious."
In Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 310, Mr.
Justice Roberts, speaking for the whole Court, said: "In
the realm of religious faith, and in that of political
belief, sharp differences arise. In both fields the tenets
of one man may seem the rankest error to his neighbor."
Conduct and beliefs dear to one may seem the rankest
"sacrilege" to another. A few examples suffice to show the
difficulties facing a conscientious censor or motion picture
producer or distributor in determining what the New
York statute condemns as sacrilegious. A motion picture portraying Christ as divine-for example, 'a movie
showing medieval Church art-would offend the religious opinions of the members of several Protestant
denominations who do not believe in the Trinity, as well
as those of a non-Christian faith. Conversely, one showing Christ as merely an ethical teacher could not but
offend millions of Christians of many denominations.

Catholics, are offensive to a great many Protestants, and
therefore for them sacrilegious in the view of the New
York court. Is a picture treating either subject, whether
sympathetically, unsympathetically, or neutrally, "sacrilegious"? It is not a sufficient answer to say that "sacrilegious" is definite, because all subjects that in any way
might be interpreted as offending the religious beliefs of
any one of the 300 sects of the United States " are banned
in New York. To allow such vague, undefinable powers
of censorship to be exercised is bound to have stultifying
consequences on the creative process of literature and
art-for the films are derived largely from literature.
History does not encourage reliance on the wisdom and
moderation of the censor as a safeguard in the exercise
of such drastic power over the minds of men, We not
only do not know but cannot know what is condemnable
by "sacrilegious." And if we cannot tell, how are those
to be governed by the statute to tell?
It is this impossibility of knowing how far the form of
words by which the New York Court of Appeals explained
"sacrilegious" carries the proscription of religious subjects that makes the term unconstitutionally vague." To
stop short of proscribing all subjects that might conceiv'ably be interpreted to be religious, inevitably creates a
situation whereby the censor bans only that against which

56It is not mere fantasy to suggest that the effect of a ban of the
"sacrilegious" may be to ban all motion pictures dealing with any
subject that might be deemed religious by any sect. -The industry's
self-censorship has already had a distorting influence on the portrayal
of historical figures. "Pressure forced deletion of the clerical background of Cardinal Richelieu from The Three Musketeers. The [Motion. Picture Production] code provision appealed to was the section

there is a substantial outcry from a religious group. And
that is the fair inference to be drawn, as a matter of experience, from what has been happening under the New
York censorship. Consequently the film industry, normally not guided by creative artists, and cautious in
putting large capital to the hazards of courage, would be
governed by its notions of the feelings likely to be aroused
by diverse religious sects, certainly the powerful ones.
The effect of such demands upon art and upon those
whose function is to enhance the culture of a society need
not be labored.
To paraphrase Doctor Johnson, if nothing may be shown
but what licensors may have previously approved, power,
the yea-or-nay-saying by officials, becomes the standard
of the permissible. Prohibition through words that fail to
convey what is permitted and what is prohibited for want
of appropriate objective standards, offends Due Process in
two ways. First, it does not sufficiently apprise those bent
on obedience of law of what may reasonably be fQreseen
*to be found illicit by the law-enforcing authority, whether
court or jury or administrative agency. Secondly, where
licensing is rested, in the first instance, in an administrative agency, the available judicial review is in effect rendered inoperative. On the basis of such a portmanteau
word as "sacrilegious," the judiciary has no standards
with which to judge the validity of administrative action
which necessarily involves, at least in large measure, subjective determinations. Thus, the administrative first
step becomes the last step.

From all that has been said one is compelled to conclude that the term "sacrilegious'? has come down the
stream of time encrusted with a specialized, strictly confined meaning, pertaining to things in space not things in
the mind. The New York Court of Appeals did not give
the term this calculable content. It applied it to things
in the mind, and things in the mind so undefined, so at
large, as to be more patently in disregard of the requirement for definiteness, as the basis of proscriptions and
legal sanctions for their disobedience, than the measures
that were condemned as violative of Due Process in
