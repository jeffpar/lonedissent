LUMBER CO. LTAL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH DAKOTA.

No. 76. Argued October 23, 1941.-Decided November 10, 1941.
1. As construed by the highest court of the State, the purchaser is
liable for the sales tax imposed by North Dakota Laws of 1937, c.
249, and this construction is controlling. P. 99.
2. Section 26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 exempts a federal
land bank from the tax-imposed by North Dakota Laws of 1937, c.
249, in respect of purchases, made by the bank from a retail dealer,
of materials for the improvement of property theretofore acquired
by thebank in the course of its operations. P. 99.
3. In the provision of § 26 that every federal land bank, "including the
capital and reserve or surplus therein and the income derived therefrom," shall be exempt from state taxation, the words quoted do hot
delimit the scope of the exemption. P. 99.
4. Nothing in the legislative history of § 26, nor of similar exemption
clauses in other statutes, requires a result contrary to that here
reached. P. 100.

5. A tax upon the sale of materials to be used in improving real
estate is not a tax upon the real estate; and therefore the tax here
involved is not within the exception from the exemption. P. 101.
•6. The exercise by the Federal Government of a power delegated to
it by the Constitution is governmental; and when Congress constitutionally creates a corporation through which the Federal Government lawfully acts, the activities of such corporation are
governmental. P. 102.
7. Federal land banks are created constitutionally; they are federal
instrumentalities engaged in the performance of an important
governmental function. P. 102.
8. Congress constitutionally may immunize from state taxation the
lending functions (or activities incidental thereto) of federal land
banks. P. 103.

of tax, rather than another, is wise. P. 104.

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

Petitioner, the Federal Land Bank of St. Paul, was created pursuant to the Federal Farm Loan Act, supra. In
the course of its operations it acquired by foreclosure proceedings certain farm properties in Burleigh County,
North Dakota.4 To effect necessary repairs and improvements to the buildings and fences on these properties, petitioner purchased lumber and other building materials of
an aggregate value of $408.26 from the Bismarck Lumber
Company, a retail dealer. The Lumber Company demanded the sum of $8.02 from petitioner, representing the
total amount of the state sales tax on the various purchases. This, petitioner refused to pay. On March 9,
1938, petitioner filed a complaint in the District Court of
Burleigh County against the Lumber Company and the
State Tax Commissioner,' alleging the foregoing facts and
praying for an adjudication of non-liability for the sales
tax on the ground that petitioner is exempt under § 26 of
the Federal Farm Loan Act, supra,and the federal Constitution. To this complaint respondents demurred. In
sustaining the demurrer the trial court held that the sales
to petitioner were subject to the tax, that the Lumber
Company was required to collect the tax, and that petitioner was under a legal duty to pay it. Accordingly,
"§ 7. UNMWFu ACTS. It shall be unlawful for any retailer to advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any consumer, directly
or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof imposed by this Act
will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer or that it will not be considered as an element in the price to the consumer, or if added, that it or
any part thereof will be refunded."
"Section 13 of the Federal Farm Loan Act (39 Stat. 360, 372) gives
federal land banks the power "To acquire and dispose of . . .Parcels

of land acquired in satisfaction of debts or purchased at sales under
judgments, decrees, or mortgages held by it."
'Owen T. Owen was named as the original defendant. He resigned
the office of Tax Commissioner on December 26, 1938. His successor,
respondent Gray, who took office on May 18, 1939, was substituted by
order of this Court on May 26, 1941.

Opinion of the Court.

judgment was entered against petitioner in the amount of
the tax. The Supreme Court of North Dakota affirmed
the judgment of the trial court. Federal Land Bank v.
Bismarck Lumber Co., 70 N. D. 607, 297 N. W. 42. The
case is here because it presents a question of importance
in the administration of the Federal Farm Loan Act.
We are confronted with two questions:
First. Does § 26 include within its ban a state sales tax
such as this? We hold that it does.
Second. Can Congress constitutionally immunize from
state taxation activities in furtherance of the lending functions of federal land banks? We hold that it can.
I. It is clear that the North Dakota statute makes the
purchaser, petitioner here, liable for the sales tax. Section
6 of the Act requires the retailer to add the tax to the sales
price and declares the tax to be a delbt from the consumer
to the retailer. Section 7 makes it unlawful for the retailer to hold out that he will absorb or refund the tax in
whole or in part. The Supreme Court of North Dakota
has held that the sales tax is laid upon the purchaser.
Jewel Tea Co. v. State Tax Commissioner, 70 N. D. 229,
293 N.W. 386. This holding was reaffirmed in the decision
below. These determinations of the incidence of the tax
by the state court are controlling, and. respondents
concede the point.
The unqualified term "taxation" used.in § 26 clearly
encompasses within its scope a sales tax such as the instant
one, and this conclusion is confirmed by the structure of
the section. In reaching an opposite conclusion the court
below ignored the plain language, "That every Federal
land bank . . . shall be exempt from Federal, State,
municipal, and local taxation," and seized upon the phrase,
"including the capital and reserve or surplus therein and
the income derived therefrom," as delimiting the scope
of the exemption. The protection of § 26 cannot thus
be frittered away. We recently had occasion, under other

circumstances, to point out that the term "including" is
not one of all-embracing definition, but connotes simply
an illustrative application of the general principle.
Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, 313 U. S. 177, 189;
see also Helvering v. Morgan's, Inc., 293 U. S. 121, 125.
If the broad exemption accorded to "every Federal land
bank" were limited to the specific illustrations mentioned
in the participial phrase introduced by "including," there
would have been no necessity to except from the purview
of § 26 the real estate held by the land banks.
The additional exemptions granted to farm loan bonds
and first mortgages executed to the land banks are proper
additions to the general exemption of § 26. The bonds
may be held by private persons, and, of course, the general
exemption of § 26 would not extend to them. Likewise,
the general exemption would protect mortgages executed
to the land banks and held by them, but it would not
survive a transfer.
Nothing in the legislative history of § 26 commands a
contrary result; 6 and a broad construction is indicated
by Congress's intention to advance credit to farm borrowers at the lowest possible interest rate. The legislative
history of similar exemption clauses in other statutes
supports our interpretation of § 26."
The committee reports emphasize the tax exempt character of the
farm loan bonds. S. Rpt. No. 144, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 7; H. Rpt.
No. 630, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 8; H. R. Doe. No. 494, 64th Cong.,
lt Sess., p. 11. The lengthy debates in the Senate over the constitutionality of § 26 may be explainable in part on the ground that the
broad exemption thereby created would deprive the States of a large
source of potential revenue. See 53 Cong. Ree. 6851-6854, 6961-6970,
7245-7247, 7305-7318, 7372-7378.
'Most enlightening is the recent amendment (Ac of June' 10, 1941,
c. 190, 55 Stat. 248) to § 10 of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation

Act (47 Stat. 5, 9), which declares that exemption includes sales taxes.
The committee reports make it clear that Congress sought only to
confirm its original understanding of the scope of the exemption by

FED. LAND BANK v. BISMARCK CO.

101

Opinion of the Court.

It cannot be seriously contended that the tax falls within
the real estate exception to § 26. Obviously, a tax upon
the sale of building materials to be used on the real estate
of a federal land bank is not a tax upon that real estate.
II. The principal argument of respondents, and the major ground of the decision below, is that Congress cannot
constitutionally immunize the lending functions, or the
activities incidental thereto, of federal land banks, from
state taxation. It runs in this fashion , Congress has authority to extend immunity only to the governmental
functions of the federal land banks; the only governmental functions of the land banks are those performed by
acting as depositaries and fiscal agents for the federal government 8 and providing a market for government bonds; 9
all other functions of the land banks are private; petitioner
here was engaged in an activity incidental to its business
of lending money, an essentially private function; therefore § 26 cannot operate to strike down a sales tax upon
purchases made in furtherance of petitioner's lending
functions.

No. 292, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2. See also 87 Cong. Rec. 42554256, 4616, 4626-4629 (pamph.).

When Congress moved to avoid the effect of our decision in Baltimore
National Bank v. State Tax Commission, 297 U. S. 209, that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was taxable on its national bank
shares, the committee reports explain that § 10 "was intended to give
as wide immunity as possible to the functions and activities of the
corporation." H. Rpt. No. 1995, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 1-2; H.

Opinion of the Court.

314 U.S.

The argument that the lending functions of the federal
land banks are proprietary rather than governmental misconceives the nature of the federal government with respect to every function which it performs. The federal
government is one of delegated powers, and from that it
necessarily follows that any constitutional exercise of its
delegated powers is governmental. Graves v. New York
ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 477. It also follows that,
when Congress constitutionally creates a corporation
through which the federal government lawfully acts, the
activities of such corporation are governmental. Pittman
v. Home Owners' Loan Corp., 308 U. S. 21, 32; Graves v.
New York ex rel. O'Keefe, supra, 477.
The federal land banks are constitutionally created,
Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U. S. 180, and
respondents do not urge otherwise. Through the land
banks the federal government makes possible the extension
of credit on liberal terms to farm borrowers. As part of
their general lending functions, the land banks are authorized to foreclose their mortgages and to purchase the real
estate at the resulting sale."0 They are "instrumentalities
of the federal government, engaged in the performance of
an important governmental function." Federal Land
Bank v. Priddy,295 U. S. 229, 231; FederalLand Bank v.
Gaines, 290 U. S. 247, 254. The national farm loan associations, 1 ' the local co-operative organizations of borrowers
through which the land banks make loans to individuals,
are also, federal instrumentalities. Knox National Farm
Loan Assn. v. Phillips, 300 U. S. 194, 202; Federal Land
Bank v. Gaines, supra, 254.
Congress has the power to protect the instrumentalities
which it has constithtionaly created. This conclusion
follows naturally from the express grant of power ft Congress "to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper

Art. I, § 8, par. 18." Pittmanv. Home Owners' Loan Corp.,
308 U. S. 21, 33, and cases cited. We have held on three
occasions that Congress has authority to prescribe tax
immunity for activities connected with, or in furtherance
of, the lending functions of federal credit agencies. Smith
v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., supra; Federal Land
Bank v. Crosland,261 U. S.374; Pittman v. Home Owners'
Loan Corp., supra.1 2 The first two of these cases dealt
with the very § 26 now in issue. They are conclusive
here.
In support of their argument respondents rely on Smith
v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., supra, and FederalLand
Bank v. Priddy, supra. In the Smith case we held that
farm loan bonds, which might be secured by first mortgages accumulated in the course of the land banks' lending
activities,"3 could be exempted from state taxation. In
the Priddy case, merely as an aid to the proper construction of § 4 of the Federal Farm Loan Act, giving the land
banks the right to sue and be sued "as fully as natural
persons," we noted that the land banks possessed some
of the characteristics of private business corporations. 4
Their character as federal instrumentalities was specifically affirmed and the broad tax immunity granted to
them was not questioned. Manifestly, these cases do not
support respondents' constitutional theories.
We cannot accede to the suggestion that the Smith and
Crosland cases can be distinguished, as they were by the
state court, on the ground that a sales tax upon purchases
made by petitioner in furtherance of its lending functions,
unlike the taxes in those cases, bears so, remotely upon

petitioner's functions as to be beyond the power of Congress to prohibit. We have found that the instant tax is
within the scope of § 26; and that section is a valid enactment. It is not our function to speculate whether the immunity from one type of tax, as contrasted with another,
is wise. That is a question solely for Congress, acting
within its constitutional sphere, to determine. Pittman

1. In the case of an unexplained sinking of a vessel under circumstances
which may give rise to an inference of unseaworthiness, the party on

whom the burden of proof rests must do more than make a case upon
the whole evidence so evenly balanced that the trier of fact is unable
to resolve doubts as to the validity of the inference. Pp. 105, 114.
2. Where the owner of a vessel has not assumed the common carrier's
special undertaking to deliver the cargo safely, the burden of proving
a breach of the shipowner's duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel rests
upon the bailor. P. 110.
3. The burden of proof in such a case does not shift with the evidence,
but remains with the baslor, who must prove ins case by a preponderance of all the evidence. P. 110.
