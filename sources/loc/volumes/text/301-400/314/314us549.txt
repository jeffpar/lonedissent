Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question presented by this case is whether the
United States District Court for tha Southern District
of Iowa had jurisdiction to determine a dispute between
the Iowa receiver of American Life Insurance Co., on
the one hand, and the Michigan and Texas receivers, on
the other,' as respects the title to, and the right to administer, certain assets of the company in the possession
of the Iowa receiver. The District Court held that it
had jurisdiction Over the controversy; and it made a
determination of the issues on the merits. The Circuit
Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed, 117 F.
2d 811, holding that, in light of such cases as Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, 262 U. S.77, the suit in the
District Court could not be maintained and that the bill
should be dismissed "for want of jurisdiction." We
granted the petition for certiorari because an application
of the principles underlying United States v. Klein, 303
U. S. 276, and Commonwealth Trust Co. v. Bradford,
297 U. S. 613, which were disregarded by the court below,
would probably lead to a different result.
The Iowa receiver brought the suit pursuant to the
authority and direction of the Iowa court. It is based
upon diversity of citizenship (Judicial Code, § 24, 28
U. S. C. § 41) and seeks to enforce against nonresident
defendants, as authorized by § 57 of the Judicial Code,
'The Iowa receiver also sought relief against respondent American
United Life Insurance Co. which, after institution of the receivership
proceedings and the appointment of receivers for American Life
Insurance Co., entered into a written agreement for the reinsurance
of the business of American Life Insurance Co. and issued a certificate of assumption for all insurance policies outstanding of American Life Insurance Co. We mention the fact without more, because
the presence of that respondent is not material to the jurisdictional
aspects of the case with which we are here solely concerned.

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

28 U. S. C. § 118, a "legal or equitable lien upon or
claim to" personal property within the district where the
suit is brought and to remove an "incumbrance or lien
or cloud upon the title" to such property. The bill in
substance alleged and the District Court found that the
Iowa receiver was in possession of securities of a face
amount in excess of $3,000,000; that those securities had
been deposited with the Insurance Commissioner of Iowa,
pursuant to statutes of Iowa and certain reinsurance
agreements between American Life Insurance Co. and
its Iowa predecessor, for protection of the policy holders
of the latter company on its insolvency; that Iowa had
title to those funds and the Iowa receiver had the sole
and exclusive right to administer them. The District

Court held that although the action was in rem it had
not only jurisdiction over the subject matter but also
over the defendants, since they all answered, and since

two of them filed counterclaims asking that the securities
in possession of the Iowa receiver be delivered to them,
and since the other asked for general equitable relief.
Accordingly, it ordered, inter alia, that the Michigan and
Texas receivers account for certain collections2 which
they had made on the securities in the Iowa fund; that
they deliver to the Iowa receiver certain records pertaining to those securities; that the Michigan receiver deliver
to the Iowa receiver certain records pertaining to the
policies protected by that fund; and that the Michigan
and Texas receivers be enjoined from making collections
on those securities and from interfering in any way with
the Iowa receiver's administration of them.
The Michigan receiver had been collecting in Michigan, and the
Texas receiver in Texas, principal and income on the securities deposited in Iowa, from obligors residing in their respective states.
Certiin remittances have beenmade by the Michigan receiver to the
Iowa receiver pursuant to an agreement between them. The Texas
receiver holds the amounts collected in Texas.

Opinion of the Court.

We express no opinion on the merits of the controversy. Nor do we pass on the contention that Ladew v.
Tennessee Copper Co., 218 U. S. 357, prevents the entry
of an in personam judgment in the circumstances of this
case. For the sole question passed upon by the court
below was the power and propriety of the action of the
District Court in taking jurisdiction of the cause under
§ 57 of the Judicial Code.
It is immaterial to this inquiry whether the Michigan
receiver acquired no interest in or power over assets outside of Michigan (Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322), or, as
held by the court below, was the statutory successor under
Michigan law of American Life Insurance Co. and as such
had title to all of its assets wherever situated. Relfe v.
Rundle, 103 U. S. 222, 225; Clark v. Williard, 292 U. S.
112, 120. Cf. Converse v. Hamilton., 224 U. S. 243. Even
though the latter were true, claimants entitled to the benefits of the fund in Iowa might pursue their suits and remedies against it in derogation of the claim of the Michigan
receiver, if that were Iowa's policy. -Clark v. Williard,
294 U. S. 211. That is the asserted Iowa policy here.
The Iowa receiver is in possession of the securities in
question. He seeks, with the approval of the Iowa court,
an authoritative determination by the federal court of
the question whether under Iowa law those securities and
the collections thereon should not be held for the special
class of claimants for whom the fund was allegedly established. The federal court has the power to resolve the
controversy. And there is no consideration of judicial
administration, based on appropriate deference to the
state courts, why it should not exercise it.
Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz,.supra, does not
stand in the way. There the federal court, through its
receivers, assumed command over property which wasin
the possession of the state court. That action was taken
in violation of the well-settled principle (pp. 88-89) that

554

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

"Where a court of competent jurisdiction has, by appropriate promedings, taken property into its possession
through its officers, the property is thereby withdrawn,
from the jurisdiction of all other courts." Such possession of the res by the state court disenabled the federal
court from exercising any control over it. But a determination of the issues in this controversy does not necessarily involve a disturbance of the possession or control of
the Michigan and Texas courts over the property in their
possession. It would indeed have no such necessary consequence even though the securities in question were in
their possession. As held in UnitedStates v. Klein, supra,
p. 281, a state court may properly adjudicate rights in
property in possession of a federal court 8 and render any
judgment "riot in conflict with that court's authority to
decide questions within its jurisdiction and to make effective such decisions by its control of the property." And
see Riehle v. Margolies,279 U.S. 218, 224-226. The same
procedure may be followed by a federal court with respect
to property in the possession of a state court. General
Baking Co. v. Harr, 300 U. S. 433; Commonwealth Trust
Co. v. Bradford, supra,297 U. S. 613; Waterman v. CanalLouisiana Bank & Trust Co., 215 U. S. 33; Ingersoll v.
Coram, 211 U. S. 335; Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S. 608,
60. The appropriate exercise of the discretion of a federal court of equity may require it to refuse even to adjudicate rights in specific property if the state court ha
already undertaken such a determination. Kelleam v.
Maryland CasualtyCo., 312 U. S. 377, 382. Furthermore,
the federal court may not "seize and control the property
which is in the possession of the state court" nor interfere
with the state court or its functions. Waterman v. CanalLouisiana Bank & Trust Co., supra, pp. 44, 45; Princess
Lida v. Thompson, 305 U. S. 456. Short of that, how'As to bankruptcy, see Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & Timber Co., 282 U. S.
734; Straton.v. New, 283 U. S. 318.

Opinion of the Court.

ever, the federal court may go. Cf.. Oakes v. Lake,
290 U. S. 59.
Tested by those standards, assumption of jurisdiction
by the federal court was wholly proper. A determination
by it of the rights of the parties.in the res could be had
"with proper regard for the rightful independence of state
governments in carrying out their' domestic policy"
(Pennsylvaniav. Williams, 94 U. S. 176, 185) and in full
recognition of the necessity for "harmonious coSperation
of federal and state tribunals." PrincessLida v. Thompson, supra,p. 466. We repeat that neither Michigan nor
Texas is entitled to the securities if such a disposition of
them would contravene Iowa law. A determination of
the nature and the extent of the rights of Iowa, and its
receiver, in the secirities clearly would not constitute an
interference with the jurisdiction of the Michigan and
Texas courts. For even if those courts were in possession
of the fund, their jurisdiction would not be so exclusive
as to bar an adjudication by the federal court of the rights
of a claimant to the res or the quantum of his interest in it.
United States v. Klein, supra. It follows a fortiori that
where, as here, they are not in possession of the res, such'
a decree of the federal court is proper. Though binding
on the parties, both as respects their rights to the fundand the collections thereon, it is not disruptive of orderly,
administration by the state courts nor conducive to unseemly collisions between the state and federal authorities.
For, unlike the situation in Kelleam v. Maryland Casualty
Co., supra, the state court which has command over the
res has not only not undertaken an adjudication of the
controversy; it has referred the matter to the federal court.
Whether the scope of the decree entered by the District
Court was proper we do not decide. We only hold that
the District Court had jurisdiction to resolve the coritroversy under § 57 of the Judicial Code. The Circuit Court
of Appeals should have decided what rights, under Iowa

law, Iowa and its receiver had to the securities and the
collections thereon, and whether the decree entered by the
District Court was kept within the appropriate limits.
Since the Circuit Court of Appeals did not decide those
questions, we reverse its judgment and remand the cause
to it for further proceedings in conformity with this
opinion.

Argued December 11, 1941.-Decided January 5, 1942.

1. Where a state statute is challenged as violative of the contract
clause of the Federal Constitution, the existence of the contract and
the nature and extent of its obligations are federal questions, and the
rulings of the state court thereon are not conclusive here. P. 561.
2. A State is not forbidden by the Federal Constitution to limit, condition, or even abolish the power of testamentary disposition over
property within its jurisdiction. P. 562.
3. Section 18 of the New York Decedent Estate Law, which, in the
case of wills thereafter executed, gives to a surviving spouse a right
of election to take as in intestacy, held not an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of a previously executed waiver by the
surviving spouse of any right in the estate of the decedent, and not
inconsistent with due process of law, where, subsequently to the enactment of the Section, the decedent executed a codicil to his will and
