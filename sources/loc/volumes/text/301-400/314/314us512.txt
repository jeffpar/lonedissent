OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v.
P. LORILLARD CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 71.

Argued December 18, 19, 1941.-Decided January 5, 1942.

Whether an employer should be required to bargain with a union
previously selected as employees' bargaining representative or, in
view of lapse of time and changed conditions,' a new election should
be held is a question for decision by the Board and not by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. ' P. 513.
117 F. 2d 921, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 313 U. S. 557, to review a judgment entered
on a petition of the National Labor Relations Board for
enforcement of an order, 16 N. L. R. B. 684. The judgment sustained the order as made but introduced a modification requiring the Board to conduct an election as
prayed by the respondent-employer in a petition for
rehearing.

Mr. Richard H. Demuth, with whom Solicitor General
Fahy and Messrs. Archibald Cox, Robert B. Watts,
Laurence A. Knapp, and Morris P. Glushien were on the
brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Homer Cummings, with whom Messrs. William
Stanley, CarlMcFarland,and Win. R. Perkins were on the
brief, for respondent.
PER CURIAM:

The Board found that the respondent, P. Lorillard Company, had committed an unfair labor practice within the
meaning of ยง 8 (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49
Stat. 449, 453, by refusing to bargain collectively with
Pioneer Tobacco Workers' Local Industrial Union No. 55,
which was at the time the duly selected bargaining representative of a majority of Lorillard's employees. The
Board affirmatively ordered Lorillard to bargain collec-

fively with Local No. 55.

On the Board's petition for

enforcement the court below sustained the Board's find-

ing, but, expressing the belief that because of lapse of
time and changed conditions the Local might no longer
represent the majority of employees, modified the Board's
order so as to require it to conduct an election to determine'whether the Local had lost its majority due to a
shift of employees to a rival independent association.
The Board had considered the effect of a possible shift in
membership, alleged to have occurred subsequent to
Lorillard's unfair labor practice. But it had reached the
conclusion- that, in order to effectuate the policies of the
Act, Lorillard must remedy the effect of its prior unlawful refusal to bargain by bargaining with the union shown
to have had a majority on the date of Lorillard's refusal to
bargain. This was for the Board to determine, and the
court below was in error in modifying the Board's order
in this respect. Labor Board v. Bradford Dyeing Assn.,
310 U. S. 318,339-340; I. A. of M. v. LaborBoard, 311 U. S.

with directions to enforce the order of the Board.
