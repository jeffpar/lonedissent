BALTIMORE & OHIO RAILROAD CO. v. KEPNER.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO.

No. 20. Reargued October 20, 1941.-Decided November 10, 1941.
1. Under § 6 of the Federal Employers Liability Act, as amended, the
injured employee has the federal privilege of bringing his action
in any district in which the railroad is doing business, though the
district chosen be far from the district in which he resides, or in
which the cause of action arose, and in another State. P. 52.
2. A state court may not validly exercise its equitable jurisdiction to
enjoin a resident of the State from prosecuting a cause of action arising under the Federal Employers Liability Act in a federal court of
another State where the Act gave venue, on the ground that the
prosecution in that district is inequitable, vexatious and harassing
to the carrier. P. 53.

CERTIORARI, 312 U. S. 671, to review a decree affirming
the dismissal on demurrer of a bill by the railroad company to enjoin Kepner from further prosecution of a suit
in the federal court for the Eastern District of New York
seeking recovery of damages under the Federal Employers
Liability Act for injuries resulting from an accident in
Ohio. The judgment was affirmed here by an equally
divided court, 313 U. S. 542; subsequently, a petition for
rehearing was granted, the judgment was vacated, and
the case was restored to the docket for reargument, 313

Opinion of the Court.

314 U.S.

This proceeding originally was brought by the petitioner, an interstate railroad, in the Court of Common
Pleas of Hamilton. County, Ohio, against the respondent
Kepner, an injured resident employee, to enjoin his continued prosecution of a suit in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act for his injuries. The
accident, according to the petition, occurred in Butler
County, Ohio, a county adjacent to that of respondent's
residence, through both of which counties petitioner's
railroad ran. The petition further showed that suitable
courts, state and federal, were constantly open and that
petitioner and the witnesses were available for process
therein. It was stated the federal court chosen was seven
hundred miles from the residence of the respondent and
numerous witnesses; that to present the case properly required the personal attendance of approximately twentyfive locally available witnesses-the crew, inspectors and
the medical attendants-at a cost estimated to exceed
the cost of the presentation of the case at a convenient
point by $4,000, with no resulting benefit to the injured
employee. Petitioner asserted these facts established that
the continued prosecution of the federal court action would
be an undue burden on interstate commerce and an unreasonable, improper and inequitable burden upon petitioner itself.
The defendant railroad was doing business in the New
York district where the damage suit was filed, as appears
from a copy of the complaint in the federal case made a
part of the petition.
Respondent demurred for failure to state a cause of
action and lack of jurisdiction of the subject of the action. The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action, by an order which was sustained by the
Court of Appeals and, on rehearing, by the Supreme

Opinion of the Court.

Court of Ohio.' The basis for the decision below was
that the respondent employee was privileged to enjoy,
without interference from a state court, the venue allowed
by the Federal Employers' Liability Act.'
The statutory provision in regard to venue is in § 6,
which so far as pertinent reads as follows:
"Under this chapter an action may be brought in a
district court of the United States, in the district of the
residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action
arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business
at the time of commencing such action." (Apr. 5, 1910, c.
143, § 1, 36 Stat. 291, as amended March 3, 1911, c. 231,
§ 291, 36 Stat. 1167; 45 U. S. C. § 56.
When the second Employers' Liability Act was enacted,
venue of actions under it was left to the general venue
statute, 35 Stat. 65, which fixed the venue of suits in the
United States courts, based in whole or in part upon the
Act, in districts of which the defendant was an inhabitant.'
Litigation promptly disclosed what Congress considered
deficiencies in such a limitation of the right of railroad
employees to bring personal injury actions,' with the result
that the present language was added.!
The reason for the addition was said to be the injustice
to an injured employee of compelling him to go to the
possibly far distant place of habitation of the defendant

carrier, with consequent increased expense for the transportation and maintenance of witnesses, lawyers and
parties, away from their homes.8 The legislative history
throws little light on the reason for.the choice of the three
standards for determining venue: the residence of the
carrier, the place where it is doing business, or the place
where the cause of action arose. At one time, the amendatory bill fixed venue as "the district of the residence of
either the plaintiff or the defendant, or in which the cause
of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be found
at the time of commencing such action." ' Fears were
expressed that so wide a choice might result in injustice
to the carrier, p. 2257. No doubt this language was actually considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, as
well as the language of the general venue statute for which
the Committee was providing an exception. Specific attention was called in the Senate report to the Macon
Grocery case, interpreting the general venue statute.
That statute placed venue in the residence of either party,
where the jurisdiction was founded on diversity of citizenship alone. The language finally adopted must have been
deliberately chosen to enable the plaintiff, in the words
of Senator Borah, who submitted the report on the bill,
"to find the corporation at any point or place or State
where it is actually carrying on business, and there lodge
his action, if he chooses to do so." "0
When petitioner sought an injunction in the Ohio court
against the further prosecution of the federal court action
in New York, the petition alleged that prosecution of the
New York action would entail "an undue burden" on
interstate commerce. No objection to the decree below,
upon that explicit ground, appears in the petition for

certiorari, either in the specification of errors or reasons for
granting the writ. In petitioner's brief on the merits, it
is pointed out that this Court held in Denver & R. G. W.
R. Co. v. Terte, 284 U. S. 284, that the disadvantages of
litigation far from the scene of the accident are not substantial enough to justify a state court in forbidding the
continuation of the litigation in a district where the lines
of the carrier run. This accords with Hoffman v. Missouri ex rel. Foraker,274 U. S. 21, where it was said the
carrier must "submit, if there is jurisdiction, to the requirements of orderly, effective administration of justice,
although thereby interstate commerce is incidentally burdened." "' Since the carrier's exhibit of respondent's New
York petition shows an allegation that it is doing business
in New York, we assume that business to be such as is
contemplated by the venue provisions of § 6. There is
therefore no occasion to consider further the suggestion
that the suit in New York creates an inadmissible burden
upon interstate commerce.
The real contention of petitioner is that, despite the admitted venue, respondent is acting in a vexatious and inequitable manner in maintaining the federal court suit
in a distant jurisdiction when a convenient and suitable
forum is at respondent's doorstep. Under such circumstances, petitioner asserts power, abstractly speaking, in
the Ohio cour, to prevent a resident under its jurisdiction

absence or inconsequential character of business done within the states
where the railroads were sued. The Mix case is differentiated from
the Foraker and Taylor cases because the carrier's lines or contracts
did not run or call for performance in the territory over which the court
where the objectionable action was filed had jurisdiction.

from doing inequity. Such power does exist.1 2 In the
Matzinger case, the Supreme Court of Ohio exercised this
power to prevent the continuation of a personal injury
suit in Illinois, by a resident under its jurisdiction, on an
Ohio cause of action. Such power has occasionally been
exercised by one state over its citizens, seeking to enforce
in other states remedies under the Employers' Liability
Act, against defendants locally available for the litigation." At times the injunction has been refused."4
We read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio to
express the view that, if it were not for § 6 of the Employers' Liability Act, the requested injunction would be
granted; on the undisputed facts of the petition. Section
6 establishes venue for an action in the federal courts.
As such venue is a privilege created by federal statute ""
and claimed by respondent, the Supreme Court of Ohio
felt constrained by the Supremacy Clause to treat § 6 as
decisive of the issue. It is clear that the allowance or
denial of this federal privilege is a matter of federal law,
not a matter of state law under Erie RailroadCo. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 72.18 Its correct decision depends upon
a construction of a federal act. 7 Consequently, the action
of a state court must be in accord with the federal statute

and the federal rule as to its application, rather than state
statute, rule or policy. 1'8
Petitioner presses upon us the argument that the action
of Congress gave an injured railway employee the privilege
of extended venue, subject to the usual powers of the state
to enjoin what in the judgment of the state courts would
be considered an improper use of that privilege. This
results, says petitioner, because the Act does not in terms
exclude this state power." As courts of equity admittedly
possessed this power before the enactment of § 6, the argument continues, it is not to be lightly inferred that the
venue privilege was in disregard of this policy. But the
federal courts have felt they could not interfere with suits
in far federal districts where the inequity alleged was
based only on inconvenience." There is no occasion to
distinguish between the power and the propriety of its
exercise in this instance, since the limits of the two are
here co-extensive. The privilege was granted because the
general venue provisions worked injustices to employees.

fere with the privilege, for the benefit of the carrier or the
national transportation system, on the ground of inequity
based on cost, inconvenience or harassment. When the
section was enacted it filled the entire field of venue in
federal courts.22 A privilege of venue, granted by the
legislative body which created this right of action, cannot
be frustrated for reasons of convenience or expense. If it
is deemed unjust, the remedy is legislative-a course followed in securing the amendment of April 5, 1910, for the
benefit of employees. This Court held in Hoffman v.
Missouri ex rel. Foraker,274 U. S. 21, that the burden on
interstate commerce would be disregarded where the
carrier had lines in the distant state. The importance of
unhampered commerce is at least as great as that of a
carrier's freedom from harassing incidents of litigation.
Whatever burden there is here upon the railroad, because
of inconvenience or cost, does not outweigh the plain grant
of privilege for suit in New York.2"

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting:
Disagreement with the views of the majority on the
construction of a venue provision does not ordinarily call
for expression. But inasmuch as the decision in this case
unjustifiably limits long-settled powers of the state courts
and thereby brings into disequilibrium the relationship
of federal and state courts, I think it proper to express my
views.
'Cf. New York CentralR. Co. v. Winfield, 244 U. S. 147, 151.
"We do not think petitioner's attempted distinction between a prohibited injunction directed at the court and a permitted one directed
at the parties is valid. An order to the parties forbidding prosecution
would destroy venue effectually. Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Gas Co.,

All Continent Corp., 301 U. S. 278, relied upon by petitioner, would be
pertinent only if there were occasion for the state court to control
federal venue. It would then be exercised against the parties.

FRANKFURTzR,

55

J., dissenting.

The decision of the Court seems to be epitomized in this
sentence: "A privilege of venue, granted by the legislative
body which created this right of action, cannot be frustrated for reasons of convenience or expense." As a general proposition, the suggestion that a privilege of venue
granted by the legislative body which creates the right
of action "cannot be frustrated for reasons of convenience
or expense" would be as novel as it is untenable. To give
unique scope to this venue provision different from the significance accorded all other provisions of venue "granted
by the legislative body which created" the right is no less
novel doctrine. For this departure from the effect customarily given to venue provisions, no warrant is avouched
in the specific provisions (f the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the general provisions of legislation defining
the relationship between federal and state courts, the
principles applied in the decisions of this Court, or settled
doctrines of equity jurisdiction. None is avouched because none is available.
The opinion does not deny the historic power of courts
of equity to prevent a misuse of litigation by enjoining
resort to vexatious and oppressive foreign suits. See e. g.,
Cole v. Cunningham, 133 U. S. 107, 118-20, Pere Marquette Ry. Co. v. Slutz, 268 Mich. 388, 256 N. W. 458;
Mason v. Harlow,84 Kan. 277,114 P. 218; Wilser v. Wilser,
132 Minn. 167, 156 N. W. 271; Northern Pacific Ry. Co.
v. Richey & Gilbert Co., 132 Wash. 526, 232 P. 355; O'Haire
v. Burns, 45 Colo. 432, 101 P. 755; Millerv. Gittings, 85
Md. 601, 37 A. 372. Nor does it question the familiar
doctrine of forum non conveniens, under which a court
having statutory jurisdiction may decline its facilities to
a suit that in justice should be tried elsewhere. See Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Co., 285 U. S. 413, 422-23;
Massachusetts v. Missouri, 308 U. S. 1, 19; Rogers v.
Guaranty Trust Co., 288 U. S. 123, 130-31. These manifestations of a civilized judicial system are firmly imbedded

in our law. See Foster, Place of Trial in Civil Actions, 43
Harv. L. Rev. 1217; Blair, The Doctrine of Forum Non
Conveniens in Anglo-American Law, 29 Col. L. Rev. 1.
Nor does the decision give new currency to the discredited
notion that there is a general lack of power in the state
courts to enjoin proceedings in federal courts. Cf. Princess Lida v. Thompson, 305 U. S. 456,466; Warren, Federal
and State Court Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345.
Nothing in Article III of the Constitution or in the legislation by which Congress has vested judicial power in the
federal courts justifies such a doctrine.
And so the basis of the decision of the Court must be
found, if anywhere, in the terms of the venue provision
of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The section
provides, simply, that an action under the Act "may be
brought in a District Court of the United States, in the
district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the
cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be
doing business at the time of commencing such action,"
that the jurisdiction of the federal courts shall be "concurrent" with that of the state courts? and that no action
brought in a state court of competent jurisdiction shall be
removed to a federal court. 36 Stat. 291; 45 U. S. C. § 56.
The phrasing of the section is not unique: it follows the
familiar pattern generally employed by Congress in framing venue provisions. E. g., 28 U. S. C. § 112 (suits based
upon diversity of citizenship); 28 U. S. C. § 53 (suits by
or against China Trade Act corporations); 28 U. S. C.
§ 104 (suits for penalties and forfeitures); 28 U. S. C.

upon any peculiarities of the language of the provision.
Nor can justification for the Court's conclusion be found
in the legislative history of the section or the clearly expressed reasons of policy underlying its enactment. As

No. 513, pp. 6-7, S. Rept. No. 432, pp. 3-4, 61st Cong., 2d
Sess., Congress was aware of the hardship by which, under
the original Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, 35
Stat. 65, the plaintiff could bring his action only at the
railroad's "residence." Cound v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry.
Co., 173 F. 527. The amendment of 1910 greatly enlarged
the range of a plaintiff's convenience in bringing suit. It
is not disputed that the amendment was intended to open
to a plaintiff courts from which he previously was barred.
But that is not the question before us. The problem is
whether the Act was intended to give a plaintiff an absolute and unqualified right to compel trial of his action in
any of the specified places he chooses, thereby not only
depriving state courts of their old power to protect against
unjustly oppressive foreign suits, but also forbidding federal courts to decline jurisdiction "in the interest of justice"
on familiar grounds of forum non conveniens. See
CanadaMalting Co. v. PatersonCo., 285 U. S. 413, 422-23.
Nothing in the history of the 1910 amendment indicates
that its framers contemplated any such vast transformation in the established relationship between federal and
state courts and in the duty of the federal courts to decline
jurisdiction "in the interest of justice." On the contrary,
the expressed considerations of policy underlying the
amendment were fundamentally the same as those underlying the equitable power to restrain oppressive suits and
the reciprocal doctrine of forum non conveniens: It does
not comport with equity and justice to allow a suit to be
litigated in a forum where, on the balance, unnecessary
hardship and inconvenience would be cast upon one party
without any compensatingly fair convenience to the other
party, but where, on the contrary, the suit might more
conveniently be litigated in another forum available
equally to both parties.
This doctrine of justice applies with especially compelling force where tf conveniences to be balanced are not

merely conveniences of conflicting private interests but
where there is added the controlling factor of public
interest. The so-called "convenience" of a railroad
concerns the important national function of which the
railroads are the agency. As in other phases of federal
railroad regulation, the interests of carriers, employees,
and the public must be balanced. Because of the "direct
concern of the public" in maintaining an economic and
efficient railroad system, a unanimous Court, speaking
through Mr. Justice Brandeis, held that a carrier may not
be sued by a plaintiff where, under the circumstances of
the particular facts, such suit would impose an unfair
burden upon railroads and thereby upon the nation.
Davis v. Farmers Co-operative Co., 262 U. S. 312. The
declaration by Congress that a court has jurisdiction and
venue is not a command that it must exercise, its authority
in such a case to the unnecessary injury of a defendant
and the public. This doctrine has been consistently followed in a series of unanimous decisions. Atchison, T. &
S. F. Ry. Co. v. Wells, 265 U. S. 101; Michigan CentralR.
Co. v. Mix, 278 U. S. 492; Hoffman v. Foraker,274 U. S.
21; Denver & R. G. W. R. Co. v. Terte, 284 U. S. 284.1
Of course, Congress, if it chose, could subject interstate
carriers to the jurisdiction of the state courts, even in the
situations in which this Court found that assumption of
jurisdiction would be an injustice to the public. But
Congress has not expressed a different view of the governing public interest-and these cases stand as unchallenged
1International
Milling Co. v. Columbia Co., 292 U. S. 511, did not
restrict but expressly recognized the doctrine of the Davis case. In
finding the scope of the Davis doctrine in the circumstances which gave
rise to it, the opinion in the Milling Co. ease only followed traditional
technique in the use of precedents. It made precisely the same differn
entiation that Mr. Justice Brandeis, who articulated the doctrine in the
Davis case, made in applying the principle of the case to subsequent

situations. See St. Louis, B. & M. Ry. Co. v. Taylor, 266 U. S. 200,
and Hoffman v. Foraker, 274 U. S. 21. The doctrine itself stands
unchallenged. The present decision does not challenge it.

authorities that, notwithstanding the provision of the
Federal Employers' Liability Act conferring unqualified
"concurrent jurisdiction" upon the state courts, a plaintiff
may in some circumstances be barred from bringing his
suit in one of the places specified by the Act. In this
respect, at least, a plaintiff's "privilege of venue, granted
by the legislative body which created this right of action,"
can "be frustrated for reasons of convenience or
expense."
The opinion of the Court attaches importance to a
phrase taken from Senator Borah's remarks on the floor
of the Senate in submitting the bill.to amend the Act:
"The bill enables the plaintiff to find the corporation at
any point or place or State where it is actually carrying
on business, and there lodge his action, if he chooses to do
so." 45 Cong. Rec. 4034. The context of this statement
is set out in the footnote.2
The intrinsic difficulties of language and the emergence,
after enactment, of situations not anticipated by even the
"Mr. President, I wish to discuss very briefly the bill. The bill as
it is now pending provides for three amendments to the employers'
liability law which is now upon the statute books. The first has reference to the venue . . . The objection which has been made to the
existing law, and this objection arises by reason of the decision of
some of the courts, is that the plaintiff may sometimes be compelled
to go a great distance in order to have his cause of action against the
defendant by reason of the fact that now the action must be brought
in certain instances in the district in which the defendant is an inhabitant. In other words, the corporation being an inhabitant of the
State which creates it, it might follow that the plaintiff would lave to
travel a long distance in order, under certain conditions, to bring his
action against the defendant and come within the terms of the law.
So, if this bill should be passed the law will be remedied in that respect,
in enabling the plaintiff to bring his action where the cause of action
arose or where the defendant may be doing business. The bill enables
the plaintiff to find the corporation at any point or place or State
where it is actually carrying on business, and there lodge his action,
if he chooses to do so." 45 Cong. Rec. 4034.

most gifted legislative imagination reveal the doubts and
ambiguities in statutes that so often compel judicial construction. To illumine these dark places in legislative
composition all the sources of light must be drawn upon.
But the various aids to construction are guides of experience, not technical rules of law. See Boston Sand Co. v.
UnitedStates, 278 U. S. 41, 48. One of the sources which
may be used for extracting meaning from legislation is the
deliberative commentary of the legislators immediately in
charge of a measure. Contemporary answers by those
authorized to give answers to questions raised about the
meaning of pending legislation obviously go a long way
to elucidating doubtful legislative purpose. But this rule
of good sense does not mean that every loose phrase, even
of the proponent of a measure, is to be given the authority
of an encyclical. The language of a chairman of a committee, like the language of all people, is merely a symbol
of thought. A speaker's casual, isolated general observation should not be tortured into an expression of disregard
for an established, far-reaching policy of the law. Especially in the case of Senator Borah, such imputation
should not be made. As is well known, he eyed most
jealously the absorption of state authority by extension
of federal power. It would have been easy to vest the
enforcement of the Federal Employers' Liability Act entirely in the federal courts. Instead, not only was concurrent jurisdiction given to the state courts in the
enforcement of this federal right, but removal of a state
action to the federal courts was prohibited. Instead of
being deemed hostile to the purposes of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and not to be entrusted with its
administration, the state courts were accepted as the most
active agencies for its enforcement. And yet, although
nowhere in the course of the whole legislative history of the
Act in question-the hearings, the reports in both houses,
the debates on the floor-is there the slightest intimation
that the problem before us entered the mind of any legis-

lator, we are asked to attribute to Senator Borah the uprooting of a doctrine which is an old and fruitful part of
the fabric of the law of the states as well as the law of the
land, by a general observation which has ncr relation to
this doctrine and to which respectful meaning can be given
without such distortion.
To read the venue provision of the Act as do the majority of the Court, is to translate the permission given a
plaintiff to enter courts previously closed to him into a
withdrawal from the state courts of power historically
exercised by them, and into an absolute direction to the
specified federal and state courts to take jurisdiction. The
implications of such a construction extend far beyond the
situation we now have here, of an attempt by a state court
to enjoin an action brought in a federal court sitting in
another state. It seems to be generally held that the
grant to the state courts of jurisdiction concurrent with
the federal courts does not deprive one state court of the
power to enjoin an oppressive suit under the Act in a foreign state court." Moreover, this Court has expressly held
that the venue provision of the Employers' Liability Act
does not prevent a state court from declining jurisdiction
as a forum non conveniens. Douglas v. New York, N. H.
& H. R. Co., 279 U. S. 377. To be sure, under the guise
of applying local doctrines of equity jurisdiction, a state
court cannot defeat the proper assertion of a federal right.
See Reed's Admrz. v. Illinois CentralR. Co., 182 Ky. 455, 206 S. W.
794; Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. McGinley, 175 Wis. 565, 185 N. W.

Ind. 595, 185 N. E. 446, with which compare McConnell v. Thomson,
213 Ind. 16, 8 N. E. 2d 986, 11 N. E. 2d 183; cf. Ex parte Crandall, 53
F. 2d 969. The lower federal courts have usually declined to enjoin
suits under the Act brought in other federal courts. See Rader v.
Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 108 F. 2d 980, 985-86; Chesapeake & Ohio
Ry. Co. v. Vigor, 90 F. 2d 7; Southern Ry. Co. v. Cochran, 56 F. 2d

Resort to this Court may always be had to lay bare such an
unwarranted frustration. American Railway Express Co.
v. Levee, 263 U. S. 19; Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U. S. 22.
But such supervisory power by this Court over the determination of federal rights by state courts does not imply
the denial of power in the state courts to make such
determinations in the first instance. Second Employers'
Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 56-57; Claflin v. Houseman,
93 U. S. 130,136-37; Robb v. Connolly, 111 U. S. 624, 637;
cf. Warren, Federal Criminal Laws and State Courts, 38
Harv. L. Rev. 545, 596-97. The long history of leaving
the effective enforcement of federal rights to state courts
has proceeded on recognition of the power of the state
courts to exercise in the first instance their settled doctrines
of law and equity. The opinion of the Court ignores these
settled principles. In an area demanding the utmost judicial circumspection, dislocating uncertainty is thereby
introduced.
If the privilege afforded a plaintiff to bring suit under
the Employers' Liability Act in one place rather than in
another is to be regarded as an absolute command to the
federal courts to take jurisdiction regardless of any considerations of justice and fairness, why is not the same
effect to be given the comparable general venue provisions
of § 51 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 112? Nothing
in the language or the history of the venue provision of the
Act differentiates it from the numerous other venue provisions of the Judicial Code. Is the settled doctrine of
forum non conveniens to be deemed impliedly repealed
by every such venue provision? Surely, it is much more
consonant with reason and right to read venue provisions
in the familiar context of established law rather than to
impute to Congress an unconsidered, profound alteration
in the relationship between the federal and the state

Nos. 10 and 11. Argued February 6, 7, 1941. Reargued October 15,
16, 1941.--Decided November 10, 1941.
1. To sustain federal jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship, there must exist an actual, substantial controversy, on one
side of which the parties must all be citizens of States different from
those of which the parties on the other side are citizens. P. 69.
2. Diversity jurisdiction can not be conferred upon the federal courts
by the parties' own determination of who are plaintiffs and who
are defendants; and it is the duty of this Court, as well as of the
lower courts, to look beyond the pleadings and arrange the parties
according to their sides in the dispute. P. 69.
3. Whether there exists the necessary collision of interests to sustain
diversity jurisdiction, must be ascertained from the principal purpose of the suit and the primary and controlling matter in dispute.
P. 69.
4. Upon the facts of this case, which was a suit brought, in a federal
court of Indiana, by a New York bank against two Indiana gas companies and an Indiana city, this Court holds that the "primary and
controlling matter in dispute" is whether a lease, whereby one of the
gas companies conveyed all of its gas plant property to the other, was
binding upon the city, to which the property had been afterwards
conveyed by the lessee corporation pursuant to its franchise; that,
with respect to that dispute, one of the gas companies and the city
("citizens" of the same State) are on opposite sides; and that, there*Together with No. 12, Chase National Bank, Trustee, v. Citizens
