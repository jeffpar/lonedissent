Syllabus.

-UNITED STATES v. LESLIE SALT CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 74.

Argued December 7, 1955.-Decided March 5, 1956.

In 1949, a corporation in need of funds to meet maturing bank loans
and for working capital borrowed $3,000,000 from one insurance
company and $1,000,000 from another for 15 years, giving each
a single typewritten instrument entitled "31/4% Sinking Fund
Promissory Note Due February 1, 164." Each note was subject to the terms of an underlying agreement containing elaborate
provisions for the protection of the note holders and a provision
under which each insurance company could require the borrower
to convert its note into a series of new notes in denominations of
$1,000 or multiples thereof, "either in registered forin without
coupons or in coupon form, and in printed or in fully engraved
form." This option had not been exercised by either note holder.
Held: These two notes are not subject to the documentary stamp
taxes laid under §§ 1800 and 1801 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1939 on "all bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness
issued by any corporation . . . ." Pp. 384-398.
(a) It is significant that the stamp tax which was levied on
"promissory notes" for many years, but which has been repealed,
was always carried in a separate section from that containing the
tax on "bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness" and was
always at a lower rate than the tax on the latter instruments.
P. 388.
(b) That these notes are for large amounts and of long maturity
and are secured by an elaborate underlying agreement does not
prevent them from being promissory notes, nor does anything in
the earlier legislation or its history indicate that this type of note
would not have been taxable at the lower rate provided in the
promissory-note section of the former statute. P. 389.
(c) Even if these notes could not fairly be called "promissory
notes," it does not follow that they must be regarded as "debentures" or "certificates of indebtedness." P. 389.
(d) The administrative history of the statute establishes that,
until-1947, when General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Higgins,
161 F. 2d 593, was decided, the Treasury considered no instruments

subject to the "debenture" tax except those which were issued
(1) in series, (2) under trust indentures, and (3) in registered form
or with coupons attached. Pp. 389-393.
(e) Since 1920, the Treasury has considered "certificates of
indebtedness" as akin to bonds and debentures and as including
"only instruments having the general character of investment
securities," which these notes do not have. Pp. 393-395.
(f) The stamp taxes on "debentures" and "certificates of indebtedness" are based upon the character of the instruments employed,
not upon the nature of the transactions involved; and an instrument which is neither a "debenture" nor a "certificate of indebtedness" does not become such merely because it evidences a longterm debt obli!!ation supported by elaborate protective covenants.
Pp. 395-396.
(g) In view of the Treasury's prior long-standing and consistent
administrative interpretation of the terms "debentures" and "certificates of indebtedness" and the fact that Congress has let that
administrative interpretation remain undisturbed for many years,
the Treasury's present ad hoc contention that those terms should
now be construed as including the notes here involved cannot
stand. Pp. 396-397.(h) The fact that the agreement underlying these notes provides
for the substitution of instruments which might qualify as "debentures" does not render these notes taxable as "debentures." P. 398.

ing capital, borrowed $3,000,000 from the Mutual Life
Insurance Company of New York and $1,000,000 from the
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company. As evidence
of the indebtedness Leslie Salt delivered to each insurance
company its "31/4% Sinking Fund Promissory Note Due
February 1, 1964" in these amounts. The question presented is whether these instruments are subject to the
documentary stamp taxes laid on "all bonds, debentures,
or certificates of indebtedness issued by any corporation . . . ." under §§ 1800 and 1801 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1939.1
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held the tax
applicable, considering the two instruments to be "debentures" within the meaning of § 1801. However, in a tax
recovery suit instituted by Leslie Salt, following payment
of the tax under protest and the Commissioner's denial
of a refund, the District Court 2 and the Court of Appeals I
held the instruments not to be "debentures" or otherwise
subject to stamp taxes. We brought the case here, 349
U. S. 951, to resolve the uncertainty left by lower court

respect of the several bonds, debentures, or certificates of stock and

or for or in respect of the vellum, parchment, or paper upon which
such instruments, matters, or things, or any of them, are written or

quire Leslie Salt to convert its note, which was typewritten on ordinary white paper, into a series of new notes in
denominations of $1,000 or multiples thereof, "either in
registered form without coupons or in coupon form, and
in printed or in fully engraved form." I This option has
not been exercised by either note holder.
These transactions with the two -insurance companies
constituted a variety of "private placement," a method
of corporate financing which, because of its economies
and conveniences, has become popular since the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933. The Government
claims that these notes are taxable under § 1801 either as
"debentures" or "certificates of indebtedness." The taxpayer, on the other hand, contends that these terms,
undefined in the statute, do not include notes of the type
5 Other provisions of these agreements. may be summarized as follows: (1) The basic terms under which the insurance companies agreed
to "purchase" the Leslie Salt notes. (2) Representations by Leslie
Salt that financial statements and lists of property holdings submitted
by it were complete and accurate. (3) Various conditions precedent
to the purchase of the notes, including: opinion by counsel that the
transaction was authorized under the applicable state law; that the
balance of the $4)00,000 loan was subscribed; and that the loan
documents would be in form satisfactory to counsel. (4) A representation by the lender that it was not acquiring the note for the purpose
ofi cale. (5) A provision for prepayment by Leslie Salt of $285,000
principal amount for each year, without premium, and of an additional $285,000 annually at the option of Leslie Salt, also without
premium, as long as the prepayment came from earnings or liquidation of assets. Leslie Salt hAd the right to make further prepayments, but subject to a premium of 3%, which after the first three
years of the note descended in amount at the rate of 1/% each year.
(6) Leslie S,-lt promised to pay all its taxes, keep its property in
repair, keep accurate records, insure its properties, and make regular
financial statements to the holders of the notes. (7) Leslie Salt
promised not to become indebted, not to pay dividends or retire
stock, except as provided in the agreement, and not to change the
nature of its business or let its working capital decline beneath a
specified amount.

here in issue. Taking the statute in light of its legislative
and administrative history, we agree with the taxpayer's
contention.
"Debentures" and "certificates of indebtedness," along
with other kinds of corporate securities, have been subject
to stamp taxes since 1898, except for the period between
1902 and 1914.6 "Promissory notes" were also subject to
stamp duties from 1898 to 1901 and from 1914 until 1924,
when the tax was repealed; "it has never been re-enacted.
The tax on "promissory notes," however, was always carried in a section separate from that containing the tax
on "bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness,"
and was always at a rate lower than the tax on those
instruments. Since promissory notes, debentures, and
certificates of indebtedness all serve the same basic purpose-that is, as evidence of a debt-this former legislative distinction between promissory notes and the other
instruments assumes significance in determining whether
the present notes are taxable. For unless the earlier
statutes were intended to impose two taxes on the same
instrument, which we should not assume, or the present
tax on debentures and certificates of indebtedness is
broader in scope than that in effect in 1924, of which
there is no indication, it would seem to follow that these
notes should not now be taxed if they can be said to fall
within the class of "promissory notes" on which the tax
was repealed.

Opinion of the Court.

The Government argues that the repealed promissory
note provision related only to ordinary short-term paper
customarily used in day-to-day commercial transactions,
and that it did not embrace notes, like those here involved,
of large amounts, long maturity, and secured by an
elaborate underlying agreement. See General Motors
Acceptance Corp.,v. Higgins, 161 R 2d 593, 595. The
existence of these features, however, does not render either
of the Leslie Salt instruments any the less a promissory
note, as each was captioned. Nor do we find anything
in the earlier legislation or in its history which satisfies
us that this type of note would not have been taxable
at the lower rate provided in the promissory note section
of the former statute. See Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v.
Fitzpatrick, 213 F. 2d 305, 308-310. Moreover, the
administrative interpretations of the Treasury, discussed
below, affirmatively indicate that they would have been
considered taxable under that section.
. But even assuming that these notes could not
fairly be
called "promissory notes," it does not follow that they
must therefore be regarded as "debentures" or "certificates
of indebtedness." That depends upon the meaning of
those terms in the statute, and upon whether these notes,
regardless of their descriptive caption, have the essential
characteristics of "debentures" or "certificates of indebtedness," as those terms are used in the statute. General
Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Higgins, supra; NilesBement-Pond Co. v. Fitzpatrick, supra. And in determining the scope of the statute, which has remained
substantially unchanged since its first enactment, the
Treasury's interpretations of it are entitled to great
weight. White v. Winchester Club, 315 U. S. 32, 41.
The administrative history of the statute establishes
that until 1947, when the GeneralMotors case, supra, was
decided, only those instruments were considered subject
to the "debenture" tax which were issued (1) in series,

390

Opinion of the Court.

350 U. S.

(2) under a trust indenture, and (3) in registered form
or with coupons attached. In other words, that tax was
considered to apply only to marketable corporate securities, as that term is generally understood. Conversely,
corporate promissory notes lacking any of those features,
such as those issued by respondent, were taxed at the
lower promissory note rate until that tax was repealed
in 1924, and were not taxed thereafter until the Government's success in the General Motors case in 1947.
As early as 1918 the Treasury, in distinguishing instruments taxable at the "bond" and "debenture" rate from
those taxable at the lower "promissory note" rate, then
still in force drew the line as follows:
"(3) Instruments containing the essential features
of a promissory note, but issued by corporations in
numbers under a trust indenture, either in registered
form or with coupons attached, embodying provisions
for acceleration of maturity in the event of any default by the obligor, for optional registration in the
case of bearer bonds, for authentication by the trustee, and sometimes for redemption before maturity,
or similar provisions, are bonds within the meaning
of the statute, whether called bonds, debentures, or
notes. However, a short-term instrument, although
issued by a corporation under a trust indenture, may
be regarded as a note if every instrument of such
issue both (a) is payable to bearer and incapable of
registration and (b) lacks interest coupons and so
requires presentation upon each payment of interest." T. D. 2713, May 14, 1918, 20 Treas. Dec. Int.
Rev. 358 (1918).8

In this same Treasury Decision "promissory note" was defined

as "An instrument not under seal containing a simple promise to

Opinion of the Court.

When Congress in 1918 amended the existing statute by
adding the language "and all instruments, however
termed, issued by any corporation with interest coupons
or in registered form, known generally as corporate securities . . . ," still found in § 1801, the Treasury recognized that this was in effect an enactment of its prior
restrictive interpretation.' The regulations which. followed the repeal in 1924 of the tax on promissory notes
did not purport to enlarge the scope of the tax on "bonds"
or "debentures"; the Treasury adhered to the same interpretation issued under the previous statute." The regustatute." It should be noted that the qualification which we have
italicized was omitted from the definition of "promissory note"
in the Regulations promulgated one year later. See note 10,
infra.
9 The then Solicitor of Internal Revenue, Mr. Robert N. Miller,
expressed this view:
"The words 'all instruments, however tertned, isued by any corporation with interest coupons or in registered form, known generally
as corporate securities,' were clearly added in iecognition of the
varied forms in which corporate securities are issued, and tb defeat
any attempt by a corporation to avoid the tax by issuing instruments
of the general character of bonds, debentures, or certificates of
indebtedness under a different name." Sales Tax Rulings, L. 0. 909,

lations were amended in 1941 to the less specific, but not
inconsistent, form under which the present notes were
taxed.' 1 Finally, explicit recognition that the attempt
to tax notes not having the features of marketable corfeatures of a promissory note, but issued by corporations in series,

secured by a trust indenture, either in registered form or with coupons
attached, embodying provisions for acceleration of maturity in the
event of any default by the obligor, for optional registration in the
case of bearer bonds, for authentication by the trustee, and in some
instances for redemption before maturity, or similar provisions, are
bonds within the meaning of the statute, whether called bonds,
debentures, or notes.
"ART. 48. 'Promissory note' defined.-A promissory note is an
unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another
signed by the maker engaging to pay on demand or at a fixed or
determinable future time, a sum certain in money to such other
person or to order or to bearer, free from restrictions as to registration or transfer and usually without coupons." Treasury Regulations
55, June 11, 1919.
The 1920 revision of Regulations 55 was substantially identical,
as were the Regulations issued under the Revenue Act of 1921
(Regulations 55, Articles 8 and 35).
"SEc. 113.50. "Scope of tax. Section 1801 imposes a tax upon
the issue by any corporation of bonds, debentures, certificates of
indebtedness, and all instruments, however- termed, with interest
coupons or in registered form and known generally as corporate
securities. Every renewal of the above described instruments is
taxable as a new issue."
SEC. 113.55. "Issues subject to tax. Ordinarily, a corporate instrument styled a bond, debenture, or certificate of indebtedness is
subject to the tfx. However, the taxability of an instrument is not
determined by the name alone but depends upon all the circumstances, such as the name, form, and terms of the instrument, etc.
Hence, an instrument, however designated, having all -the essential
characteristics of a bond, debenture, or certificate of indebtedness
is taxable as such. Similarly, an instrument issued with interest
coupons, or with provision for registration, and coming within the
class known generally as corporate securities will be held subject to
the tax regardless of the name by which it may be called." 26

Opinion of the Court.

porate securities was a departure from prior Treasury
practice is found in a ruling by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue that General Motors would not be
applied retroactively:
"The Bureau has for a considerable period of time
held that an instrument termed 'note,' not in registered form and issued without interest coupons,
is not subject to the stamp tax upon issuance or
transfer. Because of this long and uniform holding
of the Bureau and the consequent reliance of corporations on these rulings, it has been concluded that,
under the authority contained in section 3791 (b) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the decision in General
Motors Acceptance Corporation v. Higgins, supra,
will not be applied retroactively, except that any tax
which has been paid on the issuance or transfer of
instruments falling within the scope of the decision
will not be refunded." Cum. Bull. 1948-2, M. T. 32,
p. 160.
The term "certificate of indebtedness" has a similar
administrative background. Since 1920 the Treasury has
considered certificates of indebtedness as akin to bonds
and debentures, including "only instruments having the
general character of investment securities, as distinguished from instruments evidencing debts arising in
ordinary transaction between individuals .

is, of course, marketability, and this basic feature the
Leslie Salt notes did not have. The Treasury itself has
acknowledged that promissory notes lacking this quality
have never been taxed as "certificates of indebtedness,"
definition was adopted by the court in Barton Nat. Bank v. Atkins,
72 Vt. 55; 47 Atl. 176, 180. The term 'certificates of indebtedness'
has also come to have in commercial use a similar meaning. In
Denver v. Home Savings Bank, 236 U. S.101, 105, the court said:
"'What is true about bonds is true about certificates of indebtedness. Indeed it is difficult to see any distinction between them as
they are commonly known to the business world. The essence of
each is that they contain a promise under seal of the corporation to
pay a certain sum to order or bearer.'
"If the term 'certificates of indebtedness' standing by itself be
susceptible of a broader meaning than that given to it above, its
association here with bonds and debentures excludes such broader
meaning. The maxim noscitur a sociis applies.
"A consideration of Title XI as a whole supports the conclusion
above arrived at. Three classes of paper issued by individuals,
partnerships, and corporations are subject thereunder to stamp tax:
Bonds of indebtedness (subdivision 1), certificates of stock (subdivision 3), and drafts or checks and promissory notes (subdivision
6) ; i. e., instruments possessing to a greater or less extent the attributes of commercial paper.
"The premises lead inevitably to the conclusion that it was not
the intention of Congress to tax under subdivision 1 of the said
Schedule A every evidence of indebtedness other than those included
under the heads of shares or certificates of stock, promissory notes, or
bills of exchange, but only those evidences of indebtedness which
have the general character of investment securities and which may
properly be included under the term 'bonds of indebtedness.' The
definition of 'certificate of indebtedness' as 'primarily any instrument
acknowledging liability for the payment of money, not in the recognized form of a.promissory note or bill of exchange,' contained in
T. D. 2713, is too inclusive and does not sufficiently delimit the
instrunents includec in the term:
"It is therefore held that the term 'certificate of indebtedness'
as used in subdivision :1 of Schedule A, Title XI, Revenue Act of
1918, includes only instruments having the general character of in-

Opinion of the Court.

Cum. Bull. 1948-2, M. T. 32, p. 160 (supra, p. 393), and
none of the lower court cases, including General Motors,
supra, have regarded instruments such as the Leslie Salt
notes as being certificates of indebtedness. Moreover, it
may be observed that in the stamp tax sections of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 the words "certificates of
indebtedness," consistently with this administrative history, have been eliminated as a separate taxable category
of corporate instruments, and are employed simply as a
term of art embracing all the instruments taxed, that is,
"bonds," "debentures" and other instruments in registered
form or with coupons. Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
§§ 4311, 4381, 68A Stat. 514, 523, 26 U. S. C. §§ 4311,
4381.
In contrast to the position ithad consistently taken
throughout the many years preceding the decision inthe
General Motors case, the Treasury now argues "that Congress intended inSection 1801 to cover all long-term debt
obligations supported by elaborate protective covenants
and that this isso regardless of the details of the papers
used, the language by which the transaction was consummated or the nature of the purchaser's business." This
contention seems to stem from the belief that had the
"private placement" method of financing been as widely
known in 1924 as itisnow, Congress would not have
repealed the promissory note tax inits entirety, as itdid.
But ifthat be so itisnevertheless for Congress, not the
courts, to change the statute. We must deal with the
statute as we find it, and if these instruments are neither
vestment securities, as distinguished from instruments evidencing
debts arising in ordinary transaction between individuals; and that
conditional bills of sale are not certificates of indebtedness.
"T. D. 2713 should be modified to conform with this holding.

"debentures" nor "certificates of indebtedness" they may
not be taxed under the uresent statute. These taxes are
based not upon the nature of the transaction involved, but
upon the character of the instruments employed. As long
ago as 1873, this Court said: "The liability of an instrument to a stamp duty, as well as the amount of such duty,
is determined by the form and face of the instrument, and
cannot be affected by proof of facts outside of the
instrument itself." United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496,
504.
There are persuasive reasons for construing "debentures" and "certificates of indebtedness" in accordance
with the Treasury's original interpretation of those terms
in this statute's altogether comparable predecessors. In
Norwegian Nitrogen Prod. Co. v. United States, 288 U. S.
294, 315, Mr. Justice Cardozo said:
"administrative practice, consistent and generally
unchallenged, will not be overturned except for very
cogent reasons if the scope of the command is indefinite and doubtful. United States v. Moore, 95 U. S.
760, 763; Logan v. Davis, 233 U. S. 613, 627; Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 336; Fawcus Machine
Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 375; Interstate Commerce Commni. v. N. Y., N. H. & H. R. Co., 287 U. S.
178. The practice has peculiar weight when it involves a contemporaneous construction of a statute
by the men charged with the responsibility of setting
its machinery in motion, of making the parts work
efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried
and new."
Against the Treasury's prior longstanding and consistent
administrative interpretation its more recent ad hoc
contention as to how the statute should be construed cannot stand. Moreover, that original interpretation has had
both express and implied congressional acquiescence,

through the 1918 amendment to the statute (supra,
p. 391), which has ever since continued in effect, and
through Congress having let the administrative interpretation remain undisturbed for so many years. See Corn
Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner, 350 U. S. 46, 53;
Norwegian Nitrogen Prod. Co. v. United States, supra, at
p. 313.1" Still further, it is an interpretation which is in
accord with the generally understood meaning of the term
"debentures." Cf. FirstNat. Bank v. Flershem, 290 U. S.
504, 508.'" "The words of the statute [a stamp tax
-statute] are to be taken in the sense in which they will be
understood by that public in which they are to take
effect." United States v. Isham, supra, at p. 504.
1- It should be said that the administrative practice, which we
consider as crucial here, was not brought to the attention of the
Court of Appeals in Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Fitzpatrick, supra.
Nor do General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Higgins, supra, or any of
the cases cited in note 4, supra, advert to that practice.
14As long ago as 1916, no less an authority on corporate finance
than the late Mr. F. L. Stetson described debentures in the following
terms:
"In the United States, as already mentioned, the term 'debenture'
is understood to mean serial obligations of a corporation not secured
by a specific mortgage, pledge or assignment of property. Of course
a series of debentures may be issued without the execution of any
indenture relating thereto. Prior to 1900 the few issues that had
been made of such debentures were not accompanied by a trust
agreement. In such case the rights and privileges given to bondholders were set forth at length in the obligation, thus making a somewhat
lengthy instrument. Since an issue of debentures under trust agreements by the Lake Shore R. R. Co. and by the New York Central,
the custoin of adopting such agreements has become general. Originally in 1893 the General Electric Company made a large issue of
debentures without an agreement, but at the time of the refunding
in 1912 a trust agreement was executed." "Preparation of Corporate
Bonds, Mortgages, Collateral Trusts and Debenture Indentures," in
Some Legal Phases of Corporate Financing, Reorganization and
Regulation, p. 66 (Assn. of the Bar of the City of New York, 1917).

OCTOBER TERM, 1955.
Opinion of the Court.

350 U. S.

Construing the statute as we have, we conclude that
the Leslie Salt notes are neither "debentures" nor "certificates of indebtedness" within its meaning. The fact
that the agreement underlying these notes provides for
the substitution of instruments which might qualify as
debentures does not render these notes taxable, for until
debentures are in existence the "debenture" tax cannot
be imposed.
We hold these notes are not subject to stamp taxes
under the statute.
Affirmed.
