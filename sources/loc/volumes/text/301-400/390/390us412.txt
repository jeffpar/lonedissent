PER CURIAM.

The motion to dismiss is granted and the appeal is
dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The stay heretofore
granted, post, p. 914, is continued for 30 days in order
to afford the appellants an opportunity to apply to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
for a stay. If such timely application is made, the stay
entered by this Court shall remain in effect until the
Court of Appeals acts on that application.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK

and MR.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS

are of

the opinion that probable jurisdiction should be noted
and the case set for oral argument.
