ET AL. V.
ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI.

No. 324.

Argued January 25, 1968.-Decided March 11, 1968.

Appellant N & W, a predominantly coal-carrying railroad with
operations centered in the eastern part of the country and which
owned no fixed property and only minimal rolling stock in Missouri, leased the property of the Wabash Railroad and became
obligated to pay 1965 taxes on fixed property and rolling stock
located in Missouri. A state statute prescribes a formula for determining the amount of rolling stock of an interstate railroad that
Missouri shall assess for purposes of ad valorem taxation. The
statute apportions to Missouri a part of the entire value of all rolling stock of an interstate railroad on the ratio of miles operated in
Missouri to the railroad's total road mileage. Applying that
formula, which resulted in the postulation that N & W's rolling
stock in Missouri constituted 8.2824% of its total rolling stock,
the Missouri Tax Commission put N & W's rolling stock assessment at $19,981,757. N & W challenged the assessment, which
it showed was more than 21/2 times the value of N & W's rolling
stock in the State on tax day and more than twice Wabash's assessment for practically the same property in the previous year.
Neither N & W's rolling stock in Missouri (about 2.71% of
N & W's total rolling stock by number of units and 3.16% by
value), the overwhelming amount of which had been leased from
Wabash, nor the Missouri operations of N & W and Wabash had
materially increased in the intervening period. N & W's coal
operations require a great deal of specialized equipment, scarcely
any of which enters Missouri, and traffic density on Missouri
tracks is but 54% of traffic density on the N & W system as a
whole. The Tax Commission's assessment against N & W was
affirmed on appeal. The Missouri Supreme Court held that use
of the mileage formula could be justified on the theory that the
rolling stock regularly employed in one State has an "enhanced

value" when connected to "an integrated operational whole."
Held:
1. Application of the mileage formula resulted in an assessment
which on the record in this case went far beyond the value of
appellants' rolling stock in Missouri and violated the Due Process
and Commerce Clauses. Pp. 323-329.
(a) A State may impose a property tax upon its fair share
of an interstate transportation enterprise, including a portion of
the enterprise's intangible value. Pp. 323-324.
(b) Though a State has considerable latitude in devising
formulas to measure tangible property within its borders, it is
not entitled to tax tangible or intangible property unconnected
with the State. Pp. 324-325.
(c) Appellants' evidence satisfied the burden which rests on
a railroad attacking a mileage formula of showing that the formula
reached assets outside the State, and Missouri has not countered
such evidence here. Pp. 326-327.
(d) Though this Court's decisions recognize the practical
difficulties in applying a mileage formula, they forbid an unexplained discrepancy as gross as that here revealed. P. 327.
(e) The record is totally barren of evidence relating to the
enhanced value of property in Missouri by reason of the incorporation of such property into the entire N & W system.
Pp. 327-329.
2. The Missouri Supreme Court may remand the case to the
appropriate tribunal to reopen the record for additional evidence
supporting the assessment. P. 330.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE FORTAS

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case brings before us, once again, troublesome
problems arising from state taxation of an interstate
commercial enterprise. At issue is a tax assessment pursuant to a Missouri statute specifying the manner in
which railroad rolling stock is to be assessed for the
State's ad valorem tax on that property.'
In 1964 the Norfolk & Western Railway Co. (N & W),
a Virginia corporation with interstate rail operations,
leased all of the property of appellant Wabash Railroad
Company. The Wabash owned substantial fixed property and rolling stock, and did substantial business in
Missouri as well as in other States. Prior to the lease,
N & W owned no fixed property and only a minimal
amount of rolling stock in Missouri. N & W is primarily
a coal-carrying railroad. Much of its equipment and
all of its specialized coal-carrying equipment are generally located in the coal regions of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky, and along the coal-ferrying routes
from those regions to the eastern seaboard and the Great
Lakes. Scarcely any of the specialized equipment ever
enters Missouri. According to appellants, the Wabash
property in Missouri was leased by N & W in order to
diversify its business, not to provide the opportunity for
an integrated through movement of traffic.
By the terms of the lease, the N & W became obligated
to pay the 1965 taxes on the property of the Wabash in
Missouri and elsewhere. ' Upon receiving notice of the

[and]

tangible personal property . . . owned, hired or leased by any railroad company . . . in this state." Intangible personal property is
explicitly exempted from this tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. ยง 151.010 (1959).
2 As of January 1, 1966, the N & W purchased the Wabash rolling
stock that it had previously leased, while continuing to lease Wabash
fixed property. This change in the relationship between N & W
and the Wabash has no effect on the issues presented to us. Our

1965 assessment from the appellee Missouri Tax Commission, the N & W filed a request for an adjustment
and hearing before the Commission. The hearing was
held, and the Commission sustained its assessment
against the taxpayer's challenge. On judicial review,
the Commission's decision was affirmed without opinion
by the Circuit Court of Cole County, and then by the
Supreme Court of Missouri. Appellants filed an appeal
in this Court, contending that the assessment in effect
reached property not located in Missouri and thus violated the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause
of the United States Constitution. We noted probable
jurisdiction. 389 U. S.810 (1967).
I.
The Missouri property taxable to the N & W was
assessed by the State Tax Commission at $31,298,939.
Of this sum, $12,177,597 relates to fixed property within
the State, an assessment that is not challenged by appellants. Their attack is aimed only at that portion of the
assessment relating to rolling stock, $19,981,757.'
With respect to the assessment of rolling stock, the
Commission used the familiar mileage formula authorized by the Missouri statute. In relevant part, this
provides (ยง 151.060 subd. 3):
a... when any railroad shall extend beyond the
limits of this state and into another state in which
a tax is levied and paid on the rolling stock of such
road, then the said commission shall assess, equalize
analysis would apply both before and after the purchase of the
Wabash rolling stock.
3The Commission deducted from the sum of these two figures
$860,415, representing an "economic factor" which is allowed to all
railroads in varying amounts. Exactly the same deduction had
been allowed the Wabash in each of the three preceding years.

Opinion of the Court.

and adjust only such proportion of the total value
of all the rolling stock of such railroad company as
the number of miles of such road in this state bears
to the total length of the road as owned or controlled
by such company."
The Commission arrived at the assessment of rolling
stock by first determining the value of all rolling stock,
regardless of where located, owned or leased by the
N & W as of the tax day, January 1, 1965. Value was
ascertained by totaling the original cost, less accrued
depreciation at 5% a year up to 75% of cost, of each
locomotive, car, and other piece of mobile equipment.
To the total value, $513,309,877, was applied an "equalizing factor" of 47%, employed in assessing all railroad
property in an attempt to bring such assessments down
to the level of other property assessments in Missouri.
The Commission next found that 8.2824% of all the main
and branch line road (excluding secondary and side
tracks) owned, leased, or controlled by the N & W was
situated in Missouri. This percentage was applied to
the equalized value of all N & W rolling stock, and the
resulting figure was $19,981,757.
There is no suggestion in this case that the Commission failed to follow the literal command of the statute.
The problem arises because of appellants' contention
that, in mechanically applying the statutory formula, the
Commission here arrived at an unconscionable and unconstitutional result. It is their submission that the
assessment was so far out of line with the actual facts of
record with respect to the value of taxable rolling stock
in the State as to amount to an unconstitutional attempt
to exercise state taxing power on out-of-state property.
Appellants submitted evidence based upon an inventory of all N & W rolling stock that was actually in
Missouri on tax day. The equalized value of this rolling

stock, calculated on the same cost-less-depreciation
basis employed by the Commission, was approximately
$7,600,000, as compared with the assessed value of
$19,981,000. Appellants also submitted evidence to
show that the tax-day inventory was not unusual. The
evidence showed that, both before and in the months
immediately after the Wabash lease, the equalized value
of the N & W rolling stock actually in Missouri never
ranged far above the $7,600,000 figure. In the preceding
year, 1964, the rolling stock assessment against the
Wabash was only $9,177,683, and appellants demonstrated that neither the amount of rolling stock in Missouri nor the Missouri operations of the N & W and Wabash had materially increased in the intervening period.4
The assessment of the fixed properties (for which no
mileage formula was applied) hardly increased between
1964 and 1965. In 1964, prior to the lease, the fixed
properties in Missouri were assessed at $12,092,594; in
1965, after the lease, the assessment was $12,177,597.
The Supreme Court of Missouri concluded that the
result reached by the Commission was justifiable. It
pointed out that the statutory method used by the Commission proceeds on the assumption that "rolling stock
is substantially evenly divided throughout the railroad's
entire system, and the percentage of all units which are
located in Missouri at any given time, or for any given
period of time, will be substantially the same as the percentage of all the miles of road of the railroad located in
Missouri." It then held that the evaluation found by the
Commission could be justified on the theory of "enhanceAppellants further argue that the arbitrariness of the result
reached here is shown by the fact that if the rolling stock in
Missouri had been taxable to the Wabash in 1965, rather than to
N & W, the application of the formula to the same rolling stock
would have resulted in an assessment of little more than half of
that which was actually levied ($10,103,340).

Opinion of the Court.

ment," although the Commission had not referred to that
principle. The court described the theory as follows:
"The theory underlying such method of assessment
is that rolling stock regularly employed in one state
has an enhanced or augmented value when it is connected to, and because of its connection with, an
integrated operational whole and may, therefore, be
taxed according to its value 'as part of the system,
although the other parts be outside the State;-in
other words, the tax may be made to cover the enhanced value which comes to the property in the
State through its organic relation to the system.'
Pullman Co. v. Richardson, 261 U. S. 330, 338."
The court correctly noted, however, that "even if the
validity of such methods be conceded, the results, to be
valid, must be free of excessiveness and discrimination."
It concluded that in the present case, the result reached
by the Commission was justifiable. We disagree. In
our opinion, the assessment violates the Due Process and
Commerce Clauses of the Constitution.
II.
Established principles are not lacking in this much
discussed area of the law. It is of course settled that a
State may impose a property tax upon its fair share of
an interstate transportation enterprise. Marye v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 127 U. S. 117, 123-124 (1888);
Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S.18
(1891); Ott v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., 336
U. S.169 (1949); Braniff Airways, Inc. v. Nebraska State
Board of Equalization and Assessment, 347 U. S. 590
(1954). That fair share may be regarded as the value,
appropriately ascertained, of tangible assets permanently
or habitually employed in the taxing State, including a
portion of the intangible, or "going-concern," value of

the enterprise. Railway Express Agency v. Virginia,347
U. S. 359, 364 (1954) ; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota,
246 U. S. 450, 455 (1918); Adams Express Co. v. Ohio
State Auditor, 166 U. S. 185, 218-225 (1897). The value
may be ascertained by reference to the total system of
which the intrastate assets are a part. As the Court has
stated the rule, "the tax may be made to cover the enhanced value which comes to the [tangible] property in
the State through its organic relation to the [interstate]
system." Pullman Co. v. Richardson, 261 U. S. 330,
338 (1923). Going-concern value, of course, is an elusive
concept not susceptible of exact measurement. Rowley
v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 293 U. S. 102, 109 (1934);
Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U. S. 362,
365-366 (1940). As a consequence, the States have been
permitted considerable latitude in devising formulas to
measure the value of tangible property located within
their borders. Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, 249 U. S.
275, 282 (1919). Such formulas usually involve a determination of the percentage of the taxpayer's tangible
assets situated in the taxing State and the application
of this percentage to a figure representing the total goingconcern value of the enterprise. See, e. g., Rowley v.
Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 293 U. S. 102 (1934); Pittsburgh, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, 154 U. S. 421
(1894). A number of such formulas have been sustained
by the Court, even though it could not be demonstrated
that the results they yielded were precise evaluations of
assets located within the taxing State. See, e. g., Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U. S. 362,
365-366 (1940).
On the other hand, the Court has insisted for many
years that a State is not entitled to tax tangible or
intangible property that is unconnected with the State.
The Delaware Railroad Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 229 (1874);
Fargo v. Hart, 193 U. S. 490, 499 (1904). In some cases

NORFOLK & W. R. CO. v. TAX COMM'N.
317

Opinion of the Court.

the Court has concluded that States have, in fact, cast
their tax burden upon property located beyond their borders. Fargo v. Hart, 193 U. S. 490, 499-503 (1904);
Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, 249 U. S. 275, 283-286
(1919); Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66, 69-70 (1920);
Southern R. Co. v. Kentucky, 274 U. S.76, 81-84 (1927).
The taxation of property not located in the taxing State is
constitutionally invalid, both because it imposes an illegitimate restraint on interstate commerce and because
it denies to the taxpayer the process that is his due.'
A State will not be permitted, under the shelter of an
imprecise allocation formula or by ignoring the peculiarities of a given enterprise, to "project the taxing power
of the state plainly beyond its borders." Nashville,
C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U. S. 362, 365 (1940).

Any formula used must bear a rational relationship, both
on its face and in its application, to property values connected with the taxing State. Fargo v. Hart, 193 U. S.

490, 499-500 (1904).'
5We have said: "The problem under the Commerce Clause is to
determine 'what portion of an interstate organism may appropriately be attributed to each of the various states in which it functions.'
Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U. S. 362, 365. So
far as due process is concerned the only question is whether the tax
in practical operation has relation to opportunities, benefits, or protection conferred or afforded by the taxing State. See Wisconsin v.
J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S.435, 444. Those requirements are satisfied if the tax is fairly apportioned to the commerce carried on within
the State." Ott v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169,
174 (1949). Neither appellants nor appellees contend that these two
analyses bear different implications insofar as our present case is
concerned.
6 As the Court stated in Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S., at 69:
"The only reason for allowing a State to look beyond its borders
when it taxes the property of foreign corporations is that it may
get the true value of the things within it, when they are part of
an organic system of wide extent, that gives them a value above
what they otherwise would possess. The purpose is not ... to

III.
Applying these principles to the facts of the case now
before us, we conclude that Missouri's assessment of
N & W's rolling stock cannot be sustained. This Court
has, in various contexts, permitted mileage formulas as
a basis for taxation. See, e. g., Pittsburgh, C., C. & St.
L. R. Co. v. Backus, 154 U. S. 421 (1894). A railroad
challenging the result reached by the application of such
a formula has a heavy burden. See Butler Brothers v.
McColgan, 315 U. S.501, 507 (1942); Norfolk & Western
R. Co. v. North Carolina,297 U. S. 682, 688 (1936). It
is confronted by the vastness of the State's taxing power
and the latitude that the exercise of that power must be
given before it encounters constitutional restraints. Its
task is to show that application of the mileage method in
its case has resulted in such gross overreaching, beyond
the values represented by the intrastate assets purported
to be taxed, as to violate the Due Process and Commerce
Clauses of the Constitution. Cf. Capitol Greyhound
Lines v. Brice, 339 U. S.542, 547 (1950). But here the
appellants have borne that burden, and the State has
made no effort to offset the convincing case that they
have made.
Here, the record shows that rigid application of the
mileage formula led to a grossly distorted result. The
rolling stock in Missouri was assessed to N & W at
$19,981,757. It was practically the same property that
had been assessed the preceding year at $9,177,683 to
the Wabash. Appellants introduced evidence of the
results of an actual count of the rolling stock in Missouri.
open to taxation what is not within the State. Therefore no property of . . .an interstate road situated elsewhere can be taken into
account unless it can be seen in some plain and fairly intelligible
way that it adds to the value of the road and the rights exercised
in the State."

NORFOLK & W. R. CO. v. TAX COMM'N.
317

327

Opinion of the Court.

On the basis of this actual count, the equalized assessment would have been less than half of the value assessed by the State Commission. The Commission's
mileage formula resulted in postulating that N & W's
rolling stock in Missouri constituted 8.2824% of its rolling stock. But appellants showed that the rolling stock
usually employed in the State comprised only about
2.71% by number of units (and only 3.16% by cost-lessdepreciation value) of the total N & W fleet.
Our decisions recognize the practical difficulties involved and do not require any close correspondence between the result of computations using the mileage
formula and the value of property actually located in the
State, but our cases certainly forbid an unexplained discrepancy as gross as that in this case.7 Such discrepancy
certainly means that the impact of the state tax is not
confined to intrastate property even within the broad
tolerance permitted. The facts of life do not neatly
lend themselves to the niceties of constitutionalism;
but neither does the Constitution tolerate any result,
however distorted, just because it is the product of a
convenient mathematical formula which, in most situations, may produce a tolerable product.
The basic difficulty here is that the record is totally
barren of any evidence relating to enhancement or to
going-concern or intangible value, or to any other factor
which might offset the devastating effect of the demonstrated discrepancy. The Missouri Supreme Court
attempted to justify the result by reference to "en7 ,,[i]f

the ratio of the value of the property in [the State] to the
value of the whole property of the company be less than that which
the length of the road in [the State] bears to its entire length ....
a tax imposed upon the property in [the State] according to the
ratio of the length of its road to the length of the whole road must
necessarily fall upon property out of the State." The Delaware
Railroad Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 230-231 (1874).

hanced" value, but the Missouri Commission made no
effort to show such value or to measure the extent to
which it might be attributed to the rolling stock in the
State. In fact, N & W showed that it is chiefly a
coal-carrying railroad, 70% of whose 1964 revenue was
derived from coal traffic. It demonstrated that its coal
operations require a great deal of specialized equipment,
scarcely any of which ever enters Missouri. It showed
that traffic density on its Missouri tracks was only 54%
of traffic density on the N & W system as a whole.
Finally, it proved that the overwhelming majority of
its rolling stock regularly present in Missouri was rolling
stock it had leased from the Wabash. As long ago as
Pittsburgh,C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, 154 U. S.421
(1894), we indicated that an otherwise valid mileage
formula might not be validly applied to ascertain the
value of tangible assets within the taxing State in exceptional situations, for example, "where in certain localities
the company is engaged in a particular kind of business
requiring for sole use in such localities an extra amount
of rolling stock." Id., at 431.
The Missouri Supreme Court did not challenge the
factual data submitted by the N & W. Its decision that
these data did not place this case within the realm of
"exceptional situations" recognized by this Court was
apparently based on the conclusion that the lease transaction between Wabash and the N & W had increased
the value of tangible assets formerly belonging to the
two separate lines. This may be true, but it does not
follow that the Constitution permits us, without evidence
as to the amount of enhancement that may be assumed,
to bridge the chasm between the formula and the facts
of record. The difference between the assessed value
and the actual value as shown by the evidence to which
we have referred is too great to be explained by the mere
assertion, without more, that it is due to an assumed and

NORFOLK & W. R. CO. v. TAX COMM'N.

Opinion of the Court.

nonparticularized increase in intangible value. See
Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66, 69 (1920).
As the Court recognized in Fargo v. Hart, 193 U. S.
490, 499-500 (1904), care must be exercised lest the
mileage formula
"be made a means of unlawfully taxing the privilege,
or property outside the State, under the name of
enhanced value or good will, if it is not closely confined to its true meaning. So long as it fairly may
be assumed that the different parts of a line are
about equal in value a division by mileage is justifiable. But it is recognized in the cases that if for
instance a railroad company had terminals in one
State equal in value to all the rest of the line
through another, the latter State could not make use
of the unity of the road to equalize the value of
every mile. That would be taxing property outside
of the State under a pretense."
We repeat that it is not necessary that a State demonstrate that its use of the mileage formula has resulted in
an exact measure of value. But when a taxpayer comes
forward with strong evidence tending to prove that the
mileage formula will yield a grossly distorted result in
its particular case, the State is obliged to counter that
evidence or to make the accommodations necessary to
assure that its taxing power is confined to its constitutional limits. If it fails to do so and if the record
shows that the taxpayer has sustained the burden of
proof to show that the tax is so excessive as to burden
interstate commerce, the taxpayer must prevail.
IV.
Accordingly, we conclude that, on the present record,
Missouri has in this case exceeded the limits of her constitutional power to tax, as defined by the Due Process

dissenting.

It is established law, as the Court apparently recognizes in its opinion, that an interstate company challenging a state apportionment of the company's property
taxable in the State has the heavy burden of proving by
"clear and cogent evidence" that the apportionment is
grossly and flagrantly excessive. See, e. g., Railway
Express Agency v. Virginia, 358 U. S. 434, 444, and cases
cited. I agree with the Supreme Court of Missouri that
appellant railroad failed to meet that burden and would
therefore affirm its judgment. See its opinion at 426
S. W. 2d 362.
It is true that most of the cars used in Missouri by
N & W were owned by the Wabash Railroad and that
before transfer to N & W they had been assessed at
$9,177,683 as against the assessment here of $19,981,757.
But this, of course, does not prove that the higher assessment was too much. For, as the Supreme Court of
Missouri pointed out, this Court has held that "a mere
increase in the assessment does not prove that the last
assessment is wrong. Something more is necessary before
it can be adjudged that the assessment is illegal and
excessive . . . ." Pittsburgh, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v.
Backus, 154 U. S. 421, 432. The court below held, and
this Court agrees, that in pricing the value of the rolling stock the Commission was authorized to consider

NORFOLK & W. R. CO. v. TAX COMM'N.

J., dissenting.

intangible values, such as goodwill and values added
because of the enhancement to the property in Missouri
brought about by being merged into the entire N & W
system. This consideration of enhanced value is not
new (see, e. g., Pullman Co. v. Richardson, 261 U. S.
330, 338), and, as the Court points out, it is because
of this intangible factor of enhancement that States are
allowed wide discretion in determining the value of
tangible property located within their borders. Thus,
mileage formulas, such as the one used here, have generally been upheld. As this Court said in Nashville,
C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U. S. 362, "In basing its apportionment on mileage, the Tennessee Commission adopted a familiar and frequently sanctioned
formula [cases cited]." 310 U. S., at 365. It has never
been contended that mileage formulas are completely
accurate, but because States must consider such intangibles as enhancement value, these formulas are allowed
except where the taxpayer can show, as the Court puts it,
"that application of the mileage method in its case has
resulted in such gross overreaching, beyond the values
represented by the intrastate assets purported to be
taxed, as to violate the Due Process and Commerce
Clauses of the Constitution." I do not believe that appellants have made such a showing here. The fatal flaw
with the appellants' case is that they have not proved that
the tax is excessive when possible enhancement of value
due to the merger is considered. The Court's opinion
admits as much when it says that "the record is totally
barren of any evidence relating to enhancement or to
going-concern or intangible value, or to any other factor .... ." Where I differ with the Court is that I believe
the burden of proof is on the railroad to show that the tax
is excessive under all considerations rather than on the
Commission to show sufficient enhancement of value to
justify the tax.

J., dissenting.

390 U. S.

This Court has recognized before, and indeed the
majority pays lip service to the fact today, that it is
impossible for a State to develop tax statutes with
mathematical perfection. Indeed, as was stated in International Harvester Co. v. Evatt, 329 U. S. 416: "Unless
a palpably disproportionate result comes from an apportionment, a result which makes it patent that the tax
is levied upon interstate commerce rather than upon an
intrastate privilege, this Court has not been willing to
nullify honest state efforts to make apportionments."
329 U. S., at 422-423. And the "burden is on the taxpayer to make oppression manifest by clear and cogent
evidence." Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. North Carolina,
297 U. S. 682, 688. Since appellants here did not prove
that the enhanced value* of the rolling stock was less
than the tax assessment, or that the State was imposing
on N & W taxes that were exorbitant on the full value of
all its property, cf. Capitol Greyhound Lines v. Brice, 339
U. S. 542, I would affirm the decision of the Missouri
Supreme Court.

*This is a familiar principle of valuation in such tax cases. See
Fargo v. Hart, 193 U. S. 490, 499; Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v.
Texas, 210 U. S. 217, 225; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota,
223 U. S. 335, 347; Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, 249 U. S.
275, 282.
