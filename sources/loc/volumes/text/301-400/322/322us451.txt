I do not think any fact in this case shows jurisdiction in
Wisconsin to lay a tax on a privilege she does not grant
and could not deny, which is exercised wholly outside of
her borders and by those who are not her citizens or her
corporate creatures. I see no foundation for the tax Wisconsin has laid and no better foundation for the substitute

DE CASTRO v. BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF
SAN JUAN.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 349. Argued April 24, 1944.-Decided May 29, 1944.
1. On review by the federal courts, a decision of the Supreme Court
of Puerto Rico on a question of local law will be rejected only on a
clear showing that the rule applied by the insular court does
violence to recognized principles of local law or established practices
of the local community. Diaz v. Gonzalez, 261 U. S. 102, followed.

Pp. 455-456.
2. The ruling in Bonet v. Texas Company, 308 U. S. 463, that to
justify reversal of a decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico
on a matter of local law, "the error must be clear or manifest; the
interpretation must be inescapably wrong," does not warrant summary disposition of appeals from the insular court but imposes
on the Circuit Court of Appeals and on this Court the duty to
examine and appraise the local law in its setting, with the sympathetic disposition to safeguard in matters of local concern the
adaptability of the law to local practices and needs. P. 458.
3. The deference due by the federal courts on review of decisions
of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico to that court's understanding
of matters of local concern is due likewise by the federal district
court for Puerto Rico in cases there pending and by the federal
courts on appeals therefrom. P. 459.

4. The decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that, under the
applicable local legislation properly construed, the term of office
of the City Manager of San Juan is for "four years, provided that
during the same he observe good behavior" was not clearly
erroneous and must be sustained on review. P. 464.

CERTIORARI,

321 U. S. 757, to review the affirmance of

a judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico staying
execution of a prior judgment which ordered reinstatement of the petitioner in a local public office.
Mr. William Cattron Rigby, with whom Messrs. Fred
W. Llewellyn, Gabriel de la Haba, and Hugh R. Francis
were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. F. Fernandez Cuyar for respondent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In this case the petition urged as a ground for certiorari,
which moved us to grant it, that the decision of the Court
of Appeals below, as in a conipanion case, Mario Mercado
E Hijos v. Commins, post, p. 465, "practically closes the
doors of the appellate court below" to appeals which the
statutes of the United States allow to Puerto Rican litigants in the insular courts and "discriminates in favor of
the fortunate persons" who, through diversity of citizenship, can take their cases to the United States District
Court for Puerto Rico,1 instead of to the insular courts.
Petitioner brought the present proceeding by petition
for certiorari in the District Court of San Juan, Puerto
Rico, to review the action of respondent, the Board of
Commissioners governing the City of San Juan, in removing petitioner from the office of city manager to which the

Board had appointed him. The District Court of San
Juan sustained the Board. On appeal the Supreme Court
of Puerto Rico reversed the insular District Court and
directed petitioner's reinstatement. 57 P. R. 149. On
appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit under
28 U. S. C. § 225, that court affirmed, 116 F. 2d 806, and
this Court denied certiorari, 314 U. S.614.
On the remand the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, on
motion of respondent, entered judgment staying execution of its first judgment insofar as it ordered petitioner's
reinstatement, on the ground that petitioner's term of
office had expired in February, 1941, after the decision of
the Court of Appeals on the first appeal. 59 D. P. R. 676
(Spanish Edition). Construing the applicable statutes
of Puerto Rico jn the light of the practical construction
given to them by public officials and political parties of
the island, and other matters of which it took judicial
notice, the insular court came to the conclusion that "the
tenure of office of the City Manager . . . is that of four
years, provided that during the same he observe good
behavior." On appeal from this judgment the Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed, 136 F. 2d 419. We granted
certiorari, 321 U. S. 757, for the reason already stated and
because some observations in the opinion of the Circuit
Court of Appeals have raised serious questions with respect to the appropriate rule governing decision of cases
involving local laws, brought from the insular courts of
Puerto Rico for review by the Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit and by this Court.
The Court of Appeals, in affirming the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, pointed out that § 21 of
Act No. 99 of 1931, which established the government of
the city of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, provided
that the city manager "shall be appointed by the Board of
Commissioners created by this Act and shall hold office

during good conduct." It said, "If we were free to take
a wholly independent view of the point at issue we would
be inclined to conclude that the meaning of § 21 is clear,
and that the court below went beyond the permissible
limits of interpretation in reading the clause 'and shall
hold office during good conduct' as meaning that 'the
tenure of office of the city manager of the capital is that
of four years, provided that during the same he observe
good behavior.'" But it felt constrained to affirm the
judgment of the Puerto Rican tribunal by our decision and
opinion in Bonet v. Texas Company, 308 U. S. 463, 471.
In that case, in reversing a decree of the Circuit Court
of Appeals which had reversed the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico on a point of local law, we said, "to justify
reversal in such cases, the error must be clear or manifest;
the interpretation must be inescapably wrong; the decision must be patently erroneous." And since the Court
of Appeals in this case was not prepared to say that the
judgment now under review is "inescapably wrong," and
as it thought that this Court's statement in the Bonet case
had reduced the duty of the Court of Appeals to the performance of a mere mechanical function, it felt compelled
to affirm the judgment. It also suggested that, as the rule
of decision applicable to appeals from the insular Supreme
Court, as announced by the Bonet case, had not been applied in appeals from the United States District Court for
Puerto Rico, different interpretations of local law might
be established in the Court of Appeals, depending on
whether the case was appealed from the insular court or
from the United States District Court for Puerto Rico.
Our opinion in the Bonet case was the culmination of
efforts by this Court, beginning with Garcia v. Vela, 216
U. S. 598, 602 (1910); Lewers & Cooke v. Atcherly, 222
U3. S.285, 294 (1911); and Ker & Co. v. Couden, 223 U. S.
268, 279 (1912), to insure a review by the federal courts of
decisions of the local courts of our insular possessions in

Opinion of the Court.

matters of peculiarly local concern which should leave
appropriate scope for the development by those courts of
a system of law which, differing from our own in its origins
and principles, would nevertheless be suitable to local
customs and needs. In thus interpreting the function of
the federal appellate courts in reviewing decisions of the
insular tribunals we only followed a principle which had
long been established for appeals to federal courts from the
courts of our territories within the United States 2
From the beginning we have recognized that the appellate review of insular cases was not given to the federal
courts for the purpose of superimposing upon the Spanish
law our common law preconceptions, except so far as that
law must yield to the expressed will of the United States.
Diaz v. Gonzalez, 261 U. S. 102, 105-6. Hence we have
emphasized as a cardinal principle of review in such cases
that the mere fact that our own system of law and statutory construction would call for the application of one rule
to a given set of facts, does not preclude the adoption of a
different one by the insular courts. See Waialua Co. v.
Christian,305 U. S. 91, 109. If the rule thus announced
by the insular court is one which is not plainly inconsistent
with established principles of the local law, or in their
absence is one accepted by the practice of the community,
it will not be rejected here merely because it is not in
logical harmony with the rules which we would apply to

a community within the United States. It will be rejected only on a clear showing that the rule applied by the
local court does violence to recognized principles of local
law or established practices of the local community.
The guiding principle, which is incapable of statement
in a short formula, has been variously phrased in terms
which in every case must be interpreted in the light of
the particular situation to which they were applied." But
the principle which these phrases were intended to express
has not been more accurately and comprehensively stated
than by Mr. Justice Holmes in words which are completely
applicable to the present case, in Diaz v. Gonzalez, supra,
105-6:
11Given the conditions which, as we have pointed out, call for the
acceptance here of the decision of the local court, this Court has said
that its decree must be accepted here unless "we thought it clearly
wrong," Santa Fe Central Ry. Co. v. Friday,232 U. S. 694, 700, unless
"constrained to the contrary by a sense of clear error committed,"
Villanueva v. Villanueva, 239 U. S. 293, 299, Matos v. Alonso Hermanos, 300 U. S. 429, unless "manifest error be disclosed," Fox v.
Haarstick, 156 U. S. 674, 679; English v. Arizona, 214 U. S. 359, 363;
Santa Fe County v. Coler, 215 U. S. 296, 305; Treat v. Grand

U. S. 91, 109, "except upon an inescapable conclusion that it was
wrong," Diaz v. Gonzalez, 261 U. S. 102, 105, unless "plainly incorrect," Puerto Rico v. Rubert Hermanos, 315 U. S. 637, 646. In
other cases, in affirming the decision of the local court, we have said
that we will accord to its decision "great if not controlling weight,"
Lewis v. Herrera, 208 U. S. 309, 314; or "great weight," Lewers &
Cooke v. Atcherly, 222 U. S. 285, 294; cf. Cordova v. Folgueras,227
U. S. 375, 378-9; or that we would "lean toward the interpretation
adopted by the local court," Copper Queen Mining Co. v. Board of
Equalization, 206 U. S. 474, 479; English v. Arizona, supra, 361;
Clason v. Matke, 223 U. S. 646, 653; Gray v. Taylor, 227 U. S. 51,

558, 561; cf. Phoenix Ry. Co. v. Landis, 231 U. S. 578, 579-80; and
have spoken of the "caution to be used before overruling" local decisions, Fernandez & Bros. v. Ojeda, 266 U. S. 144, 146.

DE CASTRO v. BOARD OF COMM'RS.

Opinion of the Court.

"This Court has stated many times the deference due
to the understanding of the local courts upon matters of
purely local concern. It is enough to cite Villanueva v.
Villanueva, 239 U. S. 293, 299; Nadal v. May, 233 U. S.
447, 454. This is especially true in dealing with the decisions of a Court inheriting and brought up in a different
system from that which prevails here. When we contemplate such a system from the outside it seems like a wall
of stone, every part even with all the others, except so
far as our own local education may lead us to see subordinations to which we are accustomed. But to one brought
up within it, varying emphasis, tacit assumptions, unwritten practices, a thousand influences gained only from life,
may give to the different parts wholly new values that
logic and grammar never could have got from the books.
In this case a slight difference in the caution felt in dealing with the interest of minors (Baerga v. Registrar of
Humacao, 29 P. R. 440, 442), and a slight change of emphasis in the reading of statutes, explain the divergence
between the Supreme Court and the Circuit Court of
Appeals."
Beyond the fact that common law judges in such cases
are reviewing civil law decisions, it is of significance that
considerations relevant for decision must be drawn from
an environment unfamiliar to and far removed from that
in which the reviewing court sits. That which is familiar
and accepted in the island forum, in construing a statute
or formulating a rule of law, may appear strange or unorthodox in a common law setting. In bridging gaps between legal systems having different origins and history,
and governing two different polities, the rule we have
announced has special importance.
Repeated admonitions that in cases coming from the
Puerto Rican insular courts to the federal courts for review, where the Constitution or statutes of the United
States were not involved, great deference must be paid to

local decisions, having failed of their purpose, see Bonet
v. Yabucoa Sugar Co., 306 U. S. 505,' we restated them in
more emphatic form in Bonet v. Texas Company, supra,
470, in the sentence quoted in the opinion below which
we have repeated here. In order that its true purport
might not be misunderstood we accompanied the sentence
by the statement of Mr. Justice Holmes in Diaz v. Gonzalez, supra,105-6, which we have quoted, and in the light
of that exposition we added: "Such judgment of reversal
[by the Circuit Court of Appeals] would not be sustained
here even though we felt that of several possible interpretations that of the Circuit Court of Appeals was the most
reasonable one."
Thus interpreted and read in its context the principle, as
restated in the Bonet case, that to justify reversal by the
federal courts of a decision of an insular supreme court
in a matter of local concern, "the error must be clear or
manifest; the interpretation must be inescapably wrong,"
is not a mere mechanical device which requires or admits,
save in exceptional cases, of the summary disposition of
appeals from that court. Nor does it minimize the importance or dignity of the appellate function in such cases.
On the contrary, we think that it imposes on the Court of
Appeals and on this Court the peculiarly delicate task of
examining and appraising the local law in its setting, with
the sympathetic disposition to safeguard in matters of
local concern the adaptability of the law to local practices
and needs. It is one which ordinarily cannot be performed
summarily or without full argument and examination of
the legal questions involved. But if in the light of such
an examination it is found that the rule adopted by the lo4

Rico v. Rubert Hermanos, 315 U. S. 637; and similarly as to review

cal tribunal is an intelligible one, not shown to be out of
harmony with local law or practice, it is not to be rejected
because we think a better could have been devised or because we find it out of harmony with our own traditional
system of law and statutory construction.
Nor does it follow that the deference due, on appeals
from the local tribunals, to their understanding of matters
of local concern will lead to the establishment of a local
law differing from that developed in decisions in appeals
from the federal district courts sitting in our insular
possessions. It is not any the less the duty of the federal
courts in cases pending in the federal district court or on
appeal from it to defer to that understanding, when it has
found expression in the judicial pronouncements of the insular courts, Nadal v. May, 233 U. S. 447, 454; Diaz v.
Gonzalez, supra, 105; Waialua Co. v. Christian,supra, 109.
Once understood what deference is to be paid, the problem is comparable to that presented when, upon appeals
from federal district courts sitting in the states, the federal appellate courts are required to follow state law under the rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64. See
Wichita Companyv. City Bank, 306 U. S. 103; Huddleston
v. Dwyer, 322 U. S. 232.
There remains for consideration the appropriate application of these principles to the facts of the present case.
The Act of the Puerto Rican legislature of May 15, 1931,
Act No. 99 of 1931, established a special form of city government for the capital city, San Juan.5 Legislative powers
are vested in a Board of five Commissioners; the first Commissioners were to be appointed by the Governor with the
advice and consent of the Senate, for terms of one, two,
1 The form of government for other municipalities in Puerto Rico is
prescribed by Act No. 53 of 1928, which provides for a Mayor to be
elected "in the same manner required by this Act for members of the
municipal assembly" (§ 29), and hence presumably to serve a term
of four years (cf. § 17).

three, four and five years, respectively (§ 9), but the Commissioners so appointed were to hold office only until the
first Monday in January, 1937, (§ 50), and thereafter the
"Board of Commissioners created by this Act" was to be
elected at the general election held in 1936 and every
fourth year thereafter (§ 50).' The Act provides that the
City Manager, who is the.chief executive of the city, "shall
be appointed by the Board of Commissioners created by
this Act and shall hold office during good conduct" (§ 21).
He "may be removed by the Board of Commissioners, for
just cause" after hearing, and causes for removal axe enumerated (§ 22). Five other administrative officers are
appointed by the City Manager (§ 26), and an Auditor is
appointed by the Board of Commissioners (§ 36); the
provisions as to their tenure of office and removal by the
agency appointing them (§§ 27, 36) are identical with
those for the City Manager 7save that only as to the City
Manager does the Act specify a tenure of office "during
good conduct." Other employees, appointed by the officers under whom they serve, "shall be appointed for the
term for which each officer is appointed," and are also
removable for cause after hearing, the causes not being
specified, however (§ 39). No provision is made for bringing such employees within the Puerto Rican Civil Service
Act, Act No. 88 of 1931, adopted four days before the
adoption of Act No. 99.
The Puerto Rican Supreme Court refused to hold that
the provision that the City Manager "shall hold office
6By Act No. 10 of 1937 the Board was increased to nine, beginning
in 1941, four Commissioners to be appointed every four years by the
Governor with the advice and consent of the Puerto Rican Senate,
and five to be elected as previously provided.
In the English text the City Manager is removable for "inexcusable negligence in the performance of his duties," the officers appointed by him for "inexcusable ignorancein the performance of their
duties" (italics added). In the Spanish text the word is "negligencia"
in both cases.

during good conduct" so conclusively established that he
was to hold office for'life as to preclude resort to extrinsic
evidence of legislative intention. It held that his term
was the same as that of the Board of Commissioners which
appointed him, so that petitioner, who was appointed in
1937, by a Board of Commissioners elected for four years,
held office for "four years provided that during the same
he observe good behavior."'
We cannot say that these
holdings were so clearly wrong as to require a federal
appellate court to refuse to pay deference to the insular
court's decision.
While a provision that an office be held "during good
behavior" is generally deemed indicative of an intention
to create a life tenure unless cause for removal arises, see
Matter of Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259; Smith v. Bryan, 100
Va. 199, 203, 40 S. E. 652, 653; Chesley v. Council of
Lunenburg, 28 Dominion Law Rep. 571, 572, it has not
been regarded, even where traditional notions of AngloAmerican law prevail, as a rigid formula precluding any
other construction.' And , tenure for.a period of years
8

We need not consider what, under this construction, was the term
of office of the City Manager first appointed in May, 1931. An admissible construction would be that the Board of Commissioners
appointed by the Governor to serve until January 1937 was regarded
as a single body with a five-year term, despite the annual changes
in its membership, and hence the City Manager, whose term of office
was that of the body appointing him, also had a tenure of some six
and one-half years. At least this conforms to what in fact occurred.
1 State courts have held that a provision for tenure "during good
behavior" does not preclude the termination of the tenure by good
faith abolition of the office, Shirav. State, 187 Ind. 441, 119 N. E. 833;
that such a provision is not necessarily inconsistent with a constitutional restriction on the number of years for which the office can be
held but will be read as creating a tenure for a term of years during
good behavior, Callaghan v. Tobin, 40 Tex. Civ. App. 441, 448, 90
S. W. 328, 331; Callaghan v. Irvin, 40 Tex. Civ. App. 453, 459, 90

during good behavior has not been regarded as a contradiction in terms by American courts."° In Shurtleff v.
United States, 189 U. S. 311, 316, this Court recognized
and applied the strong presumption against the creation of
a life tenure in a public office under the federal government. To hold that the City Manager was appointed for
life would, according to the terms of § 39, give to all employees appointed by him a tenure for his life. An intention to create such an estate pur autre vie in a public office
would at least be somewhat unusual. On the other hand,
if they are to be deemed appointed for their own lives, the
result would be that on the death or resignation of one
City Manager, his successor would be unable to select even
his most immediate subordinates and a life tenure would
be implied for a large group of municipal employees in
disregard of the rule of Shurtleff v. United States.
Moreover there is no provision that the other municipal
officers are to serve during good conduct, and § 39 seems
to assume that they shall have defined terms of office. To
hold that they could be appointed for life would be inconsistent with the rule of Shurtleff v. United States, supra,
which the insular court accepted and approved. Since the
Act is silent as to their terms of office, they can presumably
but cf. Stuart v. Ellsworth, 105 Me. 523, 75 A. 59; Roth v. State, 158
Ind. 242, 266-8, 63 N. E. 460, 468-9; and that a provision that officers
appointed by the Mayor and Council shall hold office "during good
behavior or until they may be severally removed by the Mayor or by
three-fourths vote of the Council . . ." authorizes removal at will by
the Mayor or Council, Smith v. Bryan, 100 Va. 199, 40 S. E. 652; cf.

Rep. 571. And in construing such provisions the courts have attributed weight to the practical construction placed on them by the
public officials concerned, Klink v. State, 207 Ind. 628, 633, 194 N. E.

Opinion of the Court.

be appointed for any term not exceeding that of the officer
appointing them. The interpretation contended for by
petitioner would seemingly produce the result that all of
the other city officers, save the Auditor, and the employees
in their respective offices, could be appointed for the life
of the City Manager, unless he should, as the Puerto Rican
court assumed he could, decide to appoint them for a
shorter term (see §§ 26, 39). In.the latter case appointees
of other officials, themselves appointed for short terms,
would necessarily have a like tenure of office (§ 39), while
those of the City Manager would have a tenure for his
life, and those of the Auditor a tenure of four years. Such
incongruities the Puerto Rican court thought weighed
heavily against the contention that petitioner's tenure
was for life. This is the more so because the appointees
of the City Manager and of officers appointed by him
include most of the municipal officers and employees, none
of whom are subject to the insular civil service laws, but
who could be appointed for petitioner's life should petitioner's construction of the Act prevail.
In addition to considering the consequences of such a
holding the Puerto Rican Supreme Court looked to the
practical construction placed on the Act by the political
parties of Puerto Rico, as shown by facts of which it could
properly take judicial notice. It said that "the political
parties of the Island have always construed this statute
in the sense that the term of office of the City Manager
of the capital is that of four years." It pointed out that at
the general election held in 1936 and at that held in 1940
each of the political parties participating proposed a candidate for the office of City Manager, although that office
did not appear on the ballot. It said that it was well
known that petitioner was the candidate of the winning
party at the 1936 election and was appointed City Manager by the newly elected Board of Commissioners to
replace the then incumbent, and that another was -the

candidate of petitioner's party at the 1940 election, and
was appointed City Manager by the newly elected Board
of Commissioners. This practical construction by the
electorate and political parties, of which petitioner was
himself the beneficiary," strongly supports the interpretation of the Act as conferring on the City Manager a
tenure no longer than that of the Board of Commissioners
which appointed him.
In view of these considerations and of the principles
long observed by this Court in reviewing decisions of
the insular courts, which we have stated, we cannot say
that we should not defer to the view of the Supreme Court
of Puerto Rico that the meaning of § 21, when examined
with the related provisions of Act No. 99, in the light of
the prevailing practical construction of it, is not so plain
and unambiguous as to preclude resort to extrinsic aids
to interpretation. Nor can we say, that the practical
construction given the Act, together with the strong presumption against life tenures, and the principle, accepted
by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico on the authority
of numerous American decisions, that ambiguities should
be resolved in favor of the shorter term of office, 12 were
clearly insufficient to support the construction which it
adopted.
Petitioner calls to our attention an opinion of the Attorney General of Puerto Rico, dated January 30, 1937,
stating that "The administrative officers of the Capin The courts below did not consider, and the facts before us do not
enable us to decide, whether should petitioner have prevailed in his
construction of the Act as providing a life tenure, he could also establish his right to the office over that of the first incumbent, whom he
superseded.

217 Cal. 429, 19 P. 2d 241; Lowrie v. Brennan,283 Mich. 63, 276 N. W.

tal . . . were appointed during good behavior" and that
the appointments "participate of the nature of a life
tenure." He also refers to correspondence of the first
City Manager which could be taken as supporting respondent's position as much as it does petitioner's. It
does not appear that these were called to the attention of
the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, but in any event they
do not, in our opinion, counterbalance the weight rightly
to be given to the decision of the insular Supreme Court
as the ultimate insular interpreter of the local law. We
have considered but do not find it necessary to discuss
other contentions of lesser moment, most of which were
dealt with in the opinion of the Court of Appeals below,
and none of which call for a conclusion different from that
which it reached.

MARIO MERCADO E HIJOS v. COMMINS ET

AL.

CERTIORARI TO THID CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 497.

Argued April 24, 1944.-Decided May 29, 1944.

Although the duty of the Circuit Court of Appeals and of this Court
to examine and appraise local law in cases brought for review from
the insular courts can not ordinarily be discharged summarily, full
argument in this case has not developed any issue of Puerto
Rican law, or any question of the deference rightly to be paid to
the decisions of the highest court of Puerto Rico, so substantial
as to preclude the summary judgment of affirmance entered by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. P. 471.

Affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 321 U. S. 758, to review the affirmance of a
judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.
