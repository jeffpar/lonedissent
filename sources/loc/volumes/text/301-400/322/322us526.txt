WISCONSIN GAS & ELECTRIC CO. v. UNITED
STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
SEVENTH

FOR THE

CIRCUIT.

No. 565. Argued March 10, 1944.-Decided May 29, 1944.
1. Payments made by a corporation of the tax levied by the Wisconsin
Privilege Dividend Tax Act, held, for federal income tax purposes,
not deductible from gross income of the corporation, either under
§ 23 (c) or § 23 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1934. Pp. 529, 531.
2. The payments were not deductible under § 23 (c) as "taxes
paid," since, within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations,
the tax was not "imposed" on the corporation. P. 529.
3. Nor were the payments deductible under § 23 (d) as "taxes
imposed upon a shareholder of the corporation upon his interest
as shareholder which are paid by the corporation without reimbursement from the shareholder," since, within the meaning of the
section, the tax was not "paid by the corporation without reimbursement from the shareholder." P. 531.
138 F. 2d 597, affirmed.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Wisconsin Gas and Electric Company is a Wisconsin
corporation engaged in public utility and associated operations wholly within that State. In 1935 it declared a
dividend from jts public utility earnings, and in accord-

ance with the requirements of Wisconsin's Privilege
Dividend Tax Act (Wisconsin Laws of 1935, c. 505, § 3; c.
552), it paid to the State two and one-half per cent of the
amount of dividends thus declared. It now claims this
sum, $3,750, as a deduction from its gross income for 1935
for federal income tax purposes.
After the claim was disallowed and a deficiency assessed, the company paid the tax and brought this suit
for refund under 28 U. S. C. § 41 (20). The District
Court was of the opinion that the decision in Wisconsin
v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, required permitting the
deduction under § 23 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48
Stat. 680, 688. It therefore gave judgment for the company. 46 F. Supp. 929. The Circuit Court of Appeals
disagreed on this question and, holding the deficiency
correctly determined, reversed the judgment. 138 F. 2d
597. We granted certiorari, 321 U. S. 757, because of the
claimed conflict with the Penney case and the importance
of the question in the administration of the revenue
laws.
Petitioner's claim for a refund rests on the assertion it
was entitled to deduct the Privilege Dividend Tax payments under either § 23 (c) or § 23 (d) of the Revenue
Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 688, 689.
Section 23 (c) allows a taxpayer to deduct from gross
income "taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year."
The relevant Treasury Regulation, which is of long standing,1 includes among "taxes paid" those imposed by any
State, and provides: "In general taxes are deductible only
by the person upon whom they are imposed." The question in this branch of the case, therefore, comes down to
whether the Privilege Dividend Tax is "imposed" upon
the corporation declaring the dividends.

Resolution of that question requires examination of
the Wisconsin statute and its application and interpretation by the courts of that State. Keith v. Johnson,
271 U. S. 1; United States v. Kombst, 286 U. S. 424;
Magruder v. Supplee, 316 U. S. 394. In 1935 the state
Act2 provided:
"(1) For the privilege of declaring and receiving dividends, out of income derived from property located and
business transacted in this state, there is hereby imposed
a tax equal to two and one-half per centum of the amount
of such dividends declared and paid by all corporations
(foreign and local) after the passage and publication of this
act and prior to July 1, 1937. Such tax shall be deducted
and withheld from such dividends payable to residents
and nonresidents by the payor corporation.
"(2) Every corporation required to deduct and withhold any tax under this section shall, on or before the last
day of the month following the payment of the dividend,
make return thereof and pay the tax to the tax commission, reporting such tax on the forms to be prescribed by
the tax commission.
"(3) Every such corporation hereby made liable for
such tax, shall deduct the amount of such tax from the
dividends so declared." 8
The tax is aimed at corporate earnings "derived from
property located and business transacted in" Wisconsin.
Doubtless all taxes on corporate earnings are, to a greater
or lesser extent, translated into economic burdens upon
the shareholder. And not all such taxes can be said, for
2 Wisconsin Laws of 1935, c. 505, § 3 as amended by Wisconsin Laws
of 1935, c. 552. The Act was subsequently amended (Wisconsin Laws
of 1937, c. 233; c. 309, § 3; Wisconsin Laws of 1939, c. 198; Wisconsin
Laws of 1941, c. 63, § 3; Wisconsin Laws of 1943, c. 367, § 2), but the

amendments leave the present question unaffected.

that reason, to be "imposed" upon the shareholder. Cf.
Biddle v. Commissioner, 302 U. S. 573. However, here
the burden is placed upon him, not derivatively as through
an income tax upon the corporation, but directly and exclusively. While corporate earnings are the target of
this tax, its specific thrust, according to the Wisconsin
Supreme Court, is at their transfer as dividends to the
shareholder, rather than at their receipt as income by the
corporation. J. C. Penney Co. v. Tax Commission, 238
Wis. 69, 298 N. W. 186. It is not imposed until dividends
are declared. When imposed it is to be deducted and
withheld not from earnings received by the corporation,
but "from the dividends so declared." The sums thus
paid to the State are to be deducted from the fixed dividends owed to the preferred stockholder who cannot recover his loss from the corporation. Blied v. Wisconsin
Foundry Co., 243 Wis. 221, 10 N. W. 2d 142. And the
corporation which seeks to leave the stockholder's dividend whole by absorbing the tax itself receives no credit
therefor under those provisions of the Wisconsin income
tax law comparable to § 23 (c), because the State "puts
the burden of this tax upon the stockholder and not upon
the corporation." Wisconsin Gas Co. v. Department of
Taxation, 243 Wis. 216, 10 N. W. 2d 140.
That Wisconsin has made the corporation its tax collector by requiring it to withhold payment of a portion
of the-dividends and to turn that portion over to the State
does not make the tax one "imposed" upon the corporation, at least under § 23 (c) and the relevant Treasury
Regulation. Compare Eliot National Bank v. Gill, 218
F. 600 (C. C. A.); Porter v. United States, 27 F. 2d 882
(C. C. A.). The fact is'that the tax is extracted from fixed
dividends owed to the stockholder, not merely from his
common interest in corporate earnings. Under Wisconsin
decisions the impact of the tax is focused narrowly and

falls independently upon each recipient of the dividend
without affecting the tax burden of the corporation or
other shareholders. The operation thus disclosed for the
tax amply sustains the emphatic declaration of the Wisconsin Supreme Court that it is imposed upon the shareholder, not upon the corporation. This view is complemented by the interpretation of the Bureau of Internal
Revenue that the tax payments, although formally made
by the corporation, are deductible by the shareholder.'
We conclude that the Privilege Dividend Tax is not "imposed" upon petitioner and therefore payments of it are
not deductible under § 23 (c).
There is of course no question in this case that Wisconsin has the power, under the Federal Constitution, to impose this tax. That question was involved in Wisconsin
v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, where this Court was
concerned with dividends declared by a foreign corpora,
tion doing a local business in Wisconsin. The decision was
that the relationship of the State to the enterprises there
shown to have been carried on within its boundaries and
under the protection of its police power was such that its
taxing power could constitutionally reach earnings derived from those operations, regardless of how the impost
was characterized by the State. The State's power to tax
earnings of that character is not dependent upon whether
the tax is hinged on the receipt of them as corporate income or on the transfer and receipt of them as dividends.
Nor does it depend upon whether the tax here involved is
"imposed" upon the corporation or upon the stockholder.

Taxation, ante, p. 435; Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. v. Wisconsin Department of Taxation,ante, p. 435.

dividends, the State's power to tax their transfer and
impose that tax upon the stockholder cannot be doubted.
Petitioner also urges that if the payments are not deductible from its gross income under § 23 (c), they are
deductible under § 23 (d) as "taxes imposed upon a shareholder of the corporation upon his interest as shareholder
which are paid by the corporation without reimbursement
from the shareholder." I The Government responds that
the Privilege Dividend Tax is not the kind of tax "upon his
interest as shareholder" which § 23 (d) contemplates, and
that in any event it is not one which is "paid by the corporation without reimbursement from the shareholder"
within the meaning of the section. Since we think the
Government is correct in the latter contention, we have no
occasion to consider whether this tax is one "upon his
interest as shareholder."
The origins of the present § 23 (d) in the Revenue Act
of 1921 disclose that its adoption was prompted by the
plight of various banking corporations which paid and
voluntarily absorbed the burden of certain local taxes imposed upon their shareholders, but were not permitted to
deduct those payments from gross income.' This history
suggests it is the voluntary assumption of the burden of
the tax, rather than acting as tax collector and paying it
for another on whom the burden falls, which underpins the
6 Section 23 (d) provides: "Taxes of Shareholder Paid by Corporation.-The deduction for taxes allowed by subsection (c) shall be allowed to a corporation in the case of taxes imposed upon a shareholder of the corporation upon his interest as shareholder which are
paid by the corporation without reimbursement from the shareholder,

but in such cases no deduction shall be allowed the shareholder for
the amount of such taxes."

deduction. And this is plainly demonstrated by the requirement that to be entitled to the deduction the corporation must not be reimbursed by the shareholder for
paying the tax. To pay the tax with sums which have
been deducted and withheld from dividends declared and
distributed amounts to obtaining the reimbursement
which renders the deduction unavailable. Hence petitioner cannot prevail on § 23 (d).
Accordingly, the judgment is
Affirmed.
MR. JUsTIcE ROBERTS took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON:
Since I think this tax was not one on the corporation
(see dissent in InternationalHarvester Co. v. Wisconsin
Department of Taxation, ante, p. 445) I see no basis for
the corporation to claim a deduction under § 23 (c) of the
Revenue Act of 1934. The tax was on the stockholder,
and it was paid by the corporation. The Company would
be entitled to deductions under § 23 (d) if it were not re"imbursed. The credit given to the corporation against a
declared dividend is in my opinion a "reimbursement" of
the corporation for payment of the tax if the Wisconsin
Taxing Act is valid. Notwithstanding dissenting views on
that subject, I consider myself now bound by the conclusion of the Court. Hence I agree that no right to a
deduction exists.
