GREAT NORTHERN LIFE INSURANCE CO. v.
READ, INSURANCE COMMISSIONER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 235. Argued January 31, 1944.-Decided April 24, 1944.
1. On review by certiorari of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, the respondent may urge in support of the judgment a contention which was sustained by the District Court. P. 49.
2. A foreign insurance company brought suit in the federal district
court of Oklahoma against the Insurance Commissioner of Oklahoma, to recover payments made to him pursuant to a state statute which levied a tax of four per cent on premiums received by
foreign insurance companies in the State. Section 12665, Oklahoma Statutes of 1931, prescribed a judicial procedure for recovery
of money wrongfully collected as taxes. Held:
(1) The suit was a suit against the State, and not maintainable
without its consent. Eleventh Amendment; Smith v. Reeves, 178
U. S. 436. P. 53.
(2) The State had consented to its being sued only in its own
courts, and the suit was therefore not maintainable in the federal
court. P. 55.
3. A State may limit to its own courts suits against it to recover taxes;
and its intent in respect of such suits to submit to the jurisdiction
of courts other than those of its own creation must clearly appear.
P. 54.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Fred Hansen, First Assistant Attorney General of
Oklahoma, with whom Mr. Randell S. Cobb, Attorney
General, was on the brief, for respondent.
Mr. JohnH. Miley filed a brief, as amicus curiae,in support of petitioner.
delivered the opinion of the Court.
This writ brings here for review the action of petitioner,
a foreign insurance company, to recover taxes paid to
respondent, the Insurance Commissioner of Oklahoma,
which were levied by § 10478, Oklahoma Statutes 1931, as
amended by Chapter 1 (a), Title 36, Session Laws of
Oklahoma 1941. This was an annual four per cent tax on
premiums received by foreign insurance companies in
Oklahoma, and it, together with certain specified fees, was
in lieu of all other taxes and fees in Oklahoma. Petitioner
paid the tax under protest and, alleging diversity of citizenship, 28 U. S. C. § 41, brought suit against the Insurance
Commissioner in the District Court of the United States.
The procedure for recovery is laid down by § 12665, Oklahoma Statutes 1931.1
MR. JUSTICE REED

1 "12665. Payment Under Protest Where Relief by Appeal Not
Provided-Action to Recover.
"In all cases where the illegality of the tax is alleged to arise by reason
of some action from which the laws provide no appeal, the aggrieved
person shall pay the full amount of the taxes at the time and in the
manner provided by law, and shall give-notice to the officer collecting
the taxes showing the grounds of complaint and that suit will be
brought against the officer for recovery of them. It shall be the duty
of such collecting officer to hold such taxes separate and apart from all
other taxes collected by him, for a period of thirty days and if
within such time summons shall be served upon such officer in a suit
for recovery of such taxes, the officer shall further hold such taxes
until the final determination of such suit. All such suits shall be
brought in the court having jurisdiction thereof, and they shall have
precedence therein; if, upon final determination of any such suit, the
court shall determine that the taxes were illegally collected, as not

Opinion of the Court.

The percentage of premiums due was increased from two
to four per cent by the amendment of 1941, effective April
25th of that year. The District Court refused recovery.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. Great Northern
Life Insurance Co. v. Read, 136 F. 2d 44. Certiorari was
granted on petitioner's assertion of error in requiring it to
pay a tax allegedly discriminatory under the Fourteenth
Amendment as compared with the taxation of domestic
insurance companies, and also unconstitutional as levied
after the company's admission to the state and on premiums collected during the business year for which a
license was already in force. A conflict in principle was
suggested with Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding,
272 U. S. 494. We granted certiorari, 320 U. S.726, and
asked discussion of the right of petitioner to maintain its
suit in a federal court. As we.conclude that this suit could
not be maintained in the federal court, we do not reach
the merits of the issue as to the validity of the tax.
The right of petitioner to maintain this suit in a federal court depends, first, upon whether the action is against
an individual or against the State of Oklahoma. Secondly,
if the action is determined to be against the state, the
question arises as to whether or not the state has consented to suit against itself in the federal court.
Respondent challenged the right of petitioner to seek
relief in the District Court by the defense in its answer
that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief
can be granted. R. C. P. 12 (b) and (e).2 This challenge,
being due the state, county or subdivision of the county, the court shall
render judgment showing the correct and legal amount of taxes due
by such person, and shall issue such order in accordance with the
court's findings, and if such order shows that the taxes so paid are in
excess of the legal and correct amount due, the collecting officer shall
pay to such person the excess and shall take his receipt therefor."

on the ground that the state had not consented to be sued,
was sustained by the District Court. The contention is
available here to sustain the judgment on appeal. LeTulle v. Scofield, 308 U. S. 415.
In Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, an action was instituted in the federal trial court by railroad receivers against
the defendant "as Treasurer of the State of California" to
recover taxes assessed against and paid by the railroad.
The proceeding was brought under § 3669 of the California
Political Code, as amended by California Statutes (1891)
442, which authorized a suit against the State Treasurer
for the recovery of taxes which were illegally exacted.
The defendant could demand trial of the action in the
Superior Court of the County of Sacramento, California.
If the final judgment was against the Treasurer, the Comptroller of the state was directed to draw his warrant on state
funds for its satisfaction.
As the suit was against a state official as such, through
proceedings which were authorized by statute, to compel
him to carry out with the state's funds the state's agreement to reimburse moneys illegally exacted under color of
the tax power, this Court held, p. 439, it was a suit against
the state. The state would be required to pay.' The case
therefore is plainly distinguishable from those to recover
personally from a tax collector money wrongfully exacted
by him under color of state law, Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry.
Co. v. O'Connor, 223 U. S. 280; cf. Matthews v. Rodgers,
284 U. S. 521, 528; to recover under general law possession
of specific property likewise wrongfully obtained or held,
Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S. 204, 221; Virginia Coupon
diction such as arose under the Act of March 3, 1891, § 5, 26 Stat.
827, in Illinois Central R. Co. v. Adams, 180 U. S. 28, 37. If this is a
suit against the state, a failure to show the state's consent to be sued
in the face of this answer would be fatal. Cf. Berryessa Cattle Co. v.
Sunset Pacific Oil Co., 87 F. 2d 972, 974.

Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 220; In re Tyler, 149 U. S. 164,
190. Only in Smith v. Reeves was the action authorized
by statute against the officer in his official capacity. In
the other instances relief was sought under general law
from wrongful acts of officials. In such cases the immunity of the sovereign does not extend to wrongful individual action and the citizen is allowed a remedy against the
wrongdoer personally.
This ruling that a state could not be controlled by courts
in the performance of its political duties through suits
against its officials has been consistently followed. Chandler v. Dix, 194 U. S. 590; Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U. S. 516,
529; Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U. S. 151, 167;

seq.; Ex parteState of New York, No. 1,256 U. S. 490,500;
Worcester County Co. v. Riley, 302 U. S. 292, 296, 299.
Efforts to force, through suits against officials, performance
of promises by a state collide directly with the necessity
that a sovereign must be free from judicial compulsion in
the carrying out of its policies within the limits of the
Constitution. Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 320;
Louisianav. Jumel, 107 U. S. 711, 720. A state's freedom
from litigation was established as a constitutional right
through the Eleventh Amendment. The inherent nature
of sovereignty prevents actions against a state by its own
citizens without its consent. Hans v. Louisiana,134 U. S.
1, 10, 16.
Oklahoma provides for recovery of unlawful exactions
paid to its collectors under protest. § 12665 Oklahoma
Statutes 1931. Note 1, supra. In our view of this case it

is unnecessary for us to pass upon whether this method of
protecting taxpayers was intended to be exclusive of all
other remedies, including actions against an individual
who happened to be a tax collector, or whether if it were so
intended it would surmount all constitutional objections.
Compare Burrillv. Locomobile Co., 258 U. S. 34, and Anniston MJfg. Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 337, 341-43. See also Antrim Lumber Co. v. Sneed, 175 Okla. 47, 49-51, 52 P. 2d
1040, 1043-45.
A suit against a state official under § 12665 to recover
taxes is held to be a suit against the state by Oklahoma and
the remedy exclusive of other state remedies. Antrim
Lumber Co. v. Sneed, supra, 175 Okla. at 51, 52 P. 2d at
1045. This interpretation of an Oklahoma statute by the
Supreme Court of the state accords with our view, as set
out above, of the meaning of a suit against a state. Petitioner brought this action against the collector, the Insurance Commissioner, in strict accord with the requirements
of § 12665. It alleged that there was no appeal provided
by Oklahoma laws from defendant's action in collecting
and gave notice of protest and suit to defendant at the time
of payment in the language of the section. By so doing
petitioner was relieved of the necessity of establishing that
the payment was not voluntary 4 and obtained the advantage of a statutory lien lis pendens on the tax payment.
By § 12665, Oklahoma creates a judicial procedure for
the prompt recovery by the citizen of money wrongfully
collected as taxes. It is the sovereign's method of tax
administration. Oklahoma designates the official to be
sued, orders him to hold the tax, empowers its courts to

Opinion of the Court.

do complete justice by determining the amount properly
due and directs its collector to pay back any excess received to the taxpayer. The state provides this procedure
in lieu of the common law right to claim reimbursement
from the collector. The issue of coercion and duress was
eliminated at the pre-trial conference without objection
by the petitioner. The section makes sure the taxpayer's
recovery of illegal payments. The section is like the California statute involved in Smith v. Reeves, supra, except
for the immaterial difference that the money collected is
directed to be held separate and apart by the collector
instead of being held in the general funds of the State
Treasurer. See § 3669, California Political Code, as
amended by California Statutes (1891) 442. In the
Reeves case, as here, the suit was against the official, not
the individual. The Oklahoma section differs from the
Colorado law, § 6, Chapter 211, Session Laws of Colorado
1907, considered in Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, supra,in that the Colorado statute left the taxpayer
to his remedy against the collector and merely directed
the refund of the tax by the Treasurer in accordance with
any judgment or decree which might be obtained. In the
O'Connor case, in accordance with the statute, the suit,
as this Court's opinion shows, was against the individual,
not the official. We are of the view that the present proceeding under § 12665 is like Smith v. Reeves, a suit against
the state.
But it is urged that if this is a suit against the state,
Oklahoma has consented to this action in the federal
court. Cf. Reagan v. Farmers'Loan & Trust Co., 154 U. S.
362, 391.
The principle of immunity from litigation assures the
states and the nation from unanticipated intervention in
the processes of government, while its rigors are mitigated
by a sense of justice which has continually expanded by
consent the suability of the sovereign. The history of

sovereign immunity and the practical necessity of unfettered freedom for government from crippling interferences require a restriction of suability to the terms of the
consent, as to persons, courts and procedures. Antrim
Lumber Co. v. Sneed, 175 Okla. 47, 52 P. 2d 1040; Patterson v. City of Checotah, 187 Okla. 587, 103 P. 2d 97; Beers
v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527; Kawananakoa v. Polyblank,
205 U. S. 349; Minnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382,
388; United States v. U. S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309
U. S. 506, 512.' The immunity may, of course, be waived.
Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 447. When a state authorizes a suit against itself to do justice to taxpayers who
deem themselves injured by any exaction, it is not consonant with our dual system for the federal courts to be
astute to read the consent to embrace federal as well as
state courts. Federal courts, sitting within states, are for
many purposes courts of that state, Madisonville Traction
Co. v. Mining Co., 196 U. S. 239, 255, but when we are
dealing with the sovereign exemption from judicial interference in the vital field of financial administration a clear
declaration of the state's intention to submit its fiscal
problems to other courts than those of its own creation
must be found.'
The Oklahoma section in question, 12665, was enacted
in 1915 as a part of a general amendment to then existing
tax laws. Session Laws 1915, p. 149, Chap. 107, Art. One,
subdivision B, § 7.7 This subdivision of the act of 1915 is
5 Keifer & Keifer v. R. F. C., 306 U. S. 381, is not to the contrary.
When authority to sue is given, that authority is liberally construed
to accomplish its purpose. United States v. Shaw, 309 U. S. 495, 501.
6 Cf. Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U. S. 521, 525. The Federal Government's consent to suit against itself, without more, in a field of
federal power does not authorize a suit in a state court. Stanley v.
Schwalby, 162 U. S. 255,270; Minnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382,
384, 389.

Opinion of the Court.

concerned with administrative review of boards of equalization and provides a complete procedure including review by the district and Supreme Court of Oklahoma, as
the case may be, which are given authority to affirm,
modify or annul the action of the boards. §§ 2 and 3.
Section 6 requires the payment of the taxes which fall
due, pending administrative review, and provides for recovery of such taxes in accordance with the ultimate finding on review in language practically identical with that
of § 7 (§ 12665) here involved. Furthermore, § 12665
gives directions to the Oklahoma officer as to his obligations, requires the court to give precedence to these cases
and directs the kind of judgment to be returned, see note
1, supra, which is quite different in language, if not in
effect, from the judgment a federal court would render.
It is clear to us that the legislature of Oklahoma was consenting to suit in its own courts only. Chandlerv. Dix,
194 U. S. 590.
Smith v. Reeves, supra, p. 445, holds that an act of a
state is valid which limits to its own courts suits against
it to recover taxes. There California's intention to so
limit was made manifest by authorizing the state officer
to demand trial in the Superior Court of Sacramento
County. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, considered above at p. 53, is not applicable since it was not a
suit against the state.
Petitioner urges that Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, 517,
and Reagan v. Farmers'Loan & Trust Co., 154 U. S. 362,
391, 392, are precedents which lead to a contrary conclusion on this issue of the suability of Oklahoma in the District Court of the United States. The former is clearly
inapposite. That case involved proceedings to enjoin
enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional state statute providing for intrastate railroad rates. Since the
state act provided a remedy, the state took the position

56

Opinion of the Court.

322 U. S.

that federal equity jurisdiction was ousted. This Court
held the federal equity jurisdiction continued to restrain
unconstitutional acts by state officers which threatened
irreparable damage. pp. 474, 477, 515-19.
In the Reagan case, a proceeding for injunction to
restrain the members of the Texas Railroad Commission
from enforcing rates which were alleged to be unconstitutional was allowed to be maintained in equity in a federal court. This Court said it was maintainable against
the defendants both under the general equity jurisdiction
of the federal courts and under the provisions of the state
statute which allowed review "in a court of competent
jurisdiction in Travis County, Texas. .. ." It was
thought that the United States Circuit Court, sitting in
Travis County, was covered by this language. As it was
concluded, however, that this was not a suit against the
state, page 392, we do not feel impelled to extend the ruling of the Reagan case on this alternative basis of jurisdiction to a suit, such as this, against a state for recovery
of taxes.
Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273, is also
distinguishable. There the Attorney General of South
Carolina appeared in a federal court to answer for the
state in an injunction suit under the authority of a statute which read as follows:
"if the State be interested in the revenue in said action,
the county auditor shall, immediately upon the commencement of said action, inform the Auditor of State of
its commencement, of the alleged cause thereof, and the
Auditor of State shall submit the same to the Attorney
General, who shall defend said action for and on behalf of
the State." p. 286.
This Court construed this to consent to an appearance in
the federal court and held its decision res judicata against
the state and added at p. 287:

"If there were doubt-which we think there is not-as
to the construction which we give to the act of 1868, that
doubt is entirely dispelled by a consideration of the contemporaneous interpretation given to the act by the officials charged with its execution, by the view which this
court took as to the real party in interest on the record in
the Pegues case, and by the action as well as non-action
which followed the decision of that case by the state government in all its departments through a long period of
years."
The administrative construction by a state of these
statutes of consent have influence in determining our conclusions. Cf. Farish v. State Banking Board, 235 U. S.
498, 512; Richardsonv. FajardoSugar Co., 241 U. S. 44,
47; Missouriv. Fiske, 290 U. S. 18, 24.
It may be well to add that the construction given the
Oklahoma statute leaves open the road to review in this
Court on constitutional grounds after the issues have been
passed upon by the state courts. Chandler v. Dix, 194
U. S. 590, 592; Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, 445.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is vacated
and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, with whom the CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE RoBErS concur, dissenting:
To avoid the imposition of penalties and other serious
hazards, the plaintiff paid money under claim of a tax
which Oklahoma, we must assume, had no power to exact.
Concededly, he could sue to recover the moneys so paid to
the defendant, a tax collector, in a state court in Oklahoma. But to allow the suit to be brought in a federal
court sitting in Oklahoma would derogate, this Court now
holds, from the sovereignty of Oklahoma. Such a result,
I believe, derives from an excessive regard for formalism

and from a disregard of the whole trend of legislation, ad-

judication and legal thought in subjecting the collective
responsibility of society to those rules of law which govern
as between man and man.
To repeat, this is a simple suit to get back money from
a collector who for present purposes had no right to demand it. So far as the federal fiscal system is concerned,
this common law remedy has been enforced throughout
our history, barring only a brief interruption.' See
United States v. Nunnally Investment Co., 316 U. S. 258.
And if, instead of avoiding the serious consequences of
not paying this state tax, the plaintiff had resisted payment and sought an injunction against the tax collector
for seeking to enforce the unconstitutional tax, under appropriate circumstances the federal courts would not have
been without jurisdiction. See, e. g., Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Trapp, 186 F. 114; Ward v. Love County,
253 U. S. 17; Carpenterv. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363. Finally,
as I read the opinion of the Court, even a suit of this very
nature for the recovery of money paid for a disputed tax
will lie against the collector in what is called his individual
capacity; that is, a suit against the same person on the
same cause of action. for the same remedy can be brought,
if only differently entitled. In view of the history of such
a suit as this and of the incongruous consequences of disThe Swartwout scandal led to the Act of March 3, 1839 (§ 2, 5
Stat. 339, 348), which this Court construed as a withdrawal of the
suability of the collector. Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236. That decision
was rendered on January 21, 1845, and Congress promptly restored the
old liability. Act of Feb. 26, 1845, c. XXII, 5 Stat. 727. See Brown,
A Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Justice Story (1940) 26 Va. L. Rev. 759.
Again, in view of the complicated administrative problems raised by
the invalidation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Congress de-

vised a special scheme for the recovery of the illegal exactions made
under the Act. 49 Stat. 1747, 7 U. S. C. § 644 et seq.; Anniston Mfg.

allowing it in the form in which it was a case in the federal
court in Oklahoma, the claims of sovereignty which are
sought to be respected must surely be attenuated and
capricious.
The Eleventh Amendment has put state immunity from
suit into the Constitution. Therefore, it is not in the
power of individuals to bring any State into court-the
State's or that of the United States-except with its consent. But consent does not depend on some ritualistic
formula. Nor are any words needed to indicate submission to the law of the land. The readiness or reluctance
with which courts find such consent has naturally been
influenced by prevailing views regarding the moral sanction to be attributed to a State's freedom from suability.
Whether this immunity is an absolute survival of the
monarchial privilege, or is a manifestation merely of
power, or rests on abstract logical grounds, see Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, it undoubtedly runs
counter to modern democratic notions of the moral responsibility of the State. Accordingly, courts reflect a
strong legislative momentum in their tendency to extend
the legal responsibility of Government and to confirm
Maitland's belief, expressed nearly fifty years ago, that "it
is a wholesome sight to see 'the Crown' sued and answering
for its torts." 3 Maitland, Collected Papers, 263.2
Assuming that the proceeding in this case to recover
from the individual moneys demanded by him in defiance
of the Constitution is a suit against the State, compare
Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 155; Atchison, T. & S. F.

"With us every official, from the Prime Minister down to a constable or a collector of taxes, is under the same responsibility for every
act done without legal justification as any other citizen." Doubtless
this statement of Dicey's, Law of the Constitution,8th ed., at p. 189,

9th ed. at p. 193, was an idealization of actuality. But in the perspective of our time its validity as an ideal has gained and not lost.

Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, 223 U. S. 280, Oklahoma has consented that he be sued. The only question therefore is as
to the scope of the consent. Has she confined the right to
sue to her own courts and excluded the federal courts
within her boundaries? She has not said so. Is such
restriction indicated by practical considerations in the administration of state affairs? If it makes any difference to
Oklahoma whether this suit against a tax collector is
pressed in an Oklahoma state court rather than in a federal
court sitting in Oklahoma, the difference has not been revealed. There is here an entire absence of the considerations that led to the decision in Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319
U. S. 315. There it was deemed desirable, as a matter of
discretion, that a federal equity court should step aside and
leave a specialized system of state administration to function. Here the suit in a federal court would not supplant a
specially adaptable state scheme of administration nor
bring into play the expert knowledge of a state court regarding local conditions. The subject matter and the
course of the litigation in the federal court would be precisely the same as in the state court. The case would
merely be argued in a different building and before a different judge. Language restrictive of suit in a federal court
is lacking, and intrinsic policy does not suggest restrictive
interpretation to withdraw from a federal court questions
of federal constitutional law.
Legislation giving consent to sue is not to be treated
in the spirit in which seventeenth century criminal pleading was construed. Only by such overstrained rendering
of the Oklahoma statute does the Court finaily achieve
exclusion of the right of the plaintiff to go to a federal
court. To the language of that statute I now turn. By
§ 12665 Oklahoma Statutes, 1931, the State authorized an
action to recover moneys illegally exacted as a tax, in a
situation like the present, where the exaction is one "from
which the laws provide no appeal." The relevant juris-

dictional provision is as follows: "All such suits shall be
brought in the court having jurisdiction thereof, and they
shall have precedence therein. .. ." The part that the
federal courts play in the grant of such jurisdiction by the
States is not a new problem. With his customary hardheadedness Chief Justice Waite, for this Court, stated the
guiding consideration in ascertaining the relation of the
federal court within a State to the judicial process recognized by that State: "While the Circuit Court may not
be technically a court of the Commonwealth, it is a court
within it; and that, as we think, is all the legislature
intended to provide for." Ex parte Schollenberger, 96
U. S. 369, 377. This conception of a federal court as a
court within the State of its location has ever since dominated our decisions. See, e. g., Madisonville Traction Co.
v. Mining Co., 196 U. S. 239, 255-56; Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Corp., 308 U. S. 165, 171. It is a conception which has
been acted upon by state legislatures. For jurisdictional
purposes federal courts have been assimilated to the courts
of the States in which they may sit. When we are dealing
with jurisdictional matters legislation should be interpreted in the light of such professional history. Even if
an ambiguity could be squeezed out of a grant of jurisdiction which applies so aptly to a federal court in Oklahoma as to an Oklahoma state court-"suits shall be
brought in the court having jurisdiction thereof"-neither
logic nor history nor reason counsels an interpretation that
attributes to the State hostility against a suit in a federal
court on an exclusively federal right as to which the last
say in any event belongs to a federal court.'

Of course the State can at any time withdraw its consent to be
sued. See Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527. But statutes have steadily
enlarged the range of a State's suability and rarely has there been a
recession. See, generally, Borchard, State and Municipal Liability in
Tort-Proposed Statutory Reform (1934) 20 A. B. A. J. 747; Borchard, Governmental Responsibility in Tort (1926) 36 Yale L. J. 1,
17, (1927) 36 Yale L. J, 757, 1039, (1928) 28 Col. L. Rev. 577, 735.

In the past, even when the jurisdictional grant has been
couched in language giving substantial ground for the
argument of restriction of jurisdiction to the state court,
this Court has not found denial by a State of the right to go
to a federal court within that State when it in fact opened
the door of its own courts. Thus, in Madisonville Traction Co. v. Mining Co., supra,a Kentucky statute required,
among other things, appointment of commissioners in a
condemnation proceeding by the county court, examination of the report at its first regular term, issuance of
orders in conformity with the Kentucky Civil Code of
Practice and allowance of appeals from the county courts.
And yet this Court held, as a matter of construction, that
it was "not to be implied from the statute in question that
the State intended to exclude . . . the federal courts."
196 U. S. at 256. The section now under consideration is
only one of several statutory provisions for challenging like
tax assessments in courts. In all the other provisions, the
jurisdiction is explicitly given only to state courts. See,
e. g., §§ 12651, 12660, 12661. If in § 12665 Oklahoma has
seen fit to allow suits to be brought "in the court having
jurisdiction thereof," which as a matter of federal jurisdictional law certainly includes the federal court in Oklahoma,
and has not seen fit to designate the state courts for such
jurisdiction, why should this Court interpolate a restriction which the Oklahoma Legislature has omitted? The
fact that the Legislature has also provided that such suits
"shall have precedence" is no more embarrassment to federal jurisdiction than to state jurisdiction. That is merely
an admonition to courts of the importance of disposing
of litigation affecting revenue with all convenient dispatch.
Nor is there any other provision of the statute giving this
right of action that remotely requires a procedure to be
followed or relief to be given peculiar to state courts or
different from established procedure and relief in the fed-

eral courts. Only on the assumption that federal courts
are alien courts is there anything in § 12665 that is not as
suited to a proceeding in a federal court as it is to one in a
state court.
The situation thus presented by the Oklahoma legislation is very different from that which was here in Chandler
v. Dix, 194 U. S. 590. There a suit was brought against
state officials to remove a cloud on title to lands claimed by
the State. The relief that was sought and the procedure
for pursuing it plainly indicated "that the legislature had
in mind only proceedings in the courts of the State. A
copy of the complaint is to be served upon the prosecuting
attorney, who is to send a copy thereof within five days to
the Auditor General, and this is to be in lieu of service of
process. It then is left to the discretion of the Auditor
General to cause the Attorney General to represent him,
and it is provided that in such suits no costs shall be taxed.
These provisions with regard to procedure and costs show
that the statute is dealing with a matter supposed to remain under state control. . . . [The] statute does not
warrant the beginning of a suit in the federal court to set
aside the title of the State." 194 U. S. at 591-592. The
marked differenee between the Michigan statute and this
Oklahoma statute is further evidenced by the fact that
§ 12665 gives an action to recover not merely illegal state
taxes but also taxes of the "county or sub-division of the
county" that have been illegally collected. But counties
or their subdivisions do not enjoy immunity from suit.
Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529; Seattle v. Oregon
& Washington R. Co., 255 U. S. 56, 71. If the other jurisdictional requirements are present, they can be sued in a
federal court without the leave of Oklahoma. It is not, I
submit, a rational way to construe the Oklahoma statute,
dealing with a particular type of illegal exaction raising
the same kind of issue and involving the same procedure.

so as to recognize jurisdiction of federal courts over suits
against the county and its sub-division but to find a purpose to exclude suits as to illegal state exactions.
I have proceeded on the assumption that the action
below was under § 12665, and as such an action against
the State. But the suit was not brought under § 12665.
It was brought as an ordinary common law action for the
recovery of money against an officer acting under an unconstitutional statute. The defendant answered the suit,
but did not claim the State's immunity from suit and
the court's resulting lack of jurisdiction. What is even
more significant is that he did allege lack of jurisdiction
on another ground not now relevant. In a word, the defendant did not claim, on behalf of the State, the immunity which this Court now affords him. He did not even
make this claim at the pre-trial conference and the claim
did not emerge as one of the issues defined by the pre-trial
conference under Rule 16. In disposing of the case, the
Judge interpreted the action as having been brought under
§ 12665, although the pleadings gave no warrant for such
conclusion, and on such interpretation, he found that the
defendant could claim and had not waived Oklahoma's
immunity. Evidently, however, the District Court was
not content with its own finding of want of "jurisdiction"
for it proceeded to dispose of the constitutional issues on
their merits. I think that the claim of the State's immunity was not in the case under Illinois Central R. Co.
v. Adams, 180 U. S. 28, which held that in a suit nominally
against an individual sovereign immunity is a defense that
must be raised by appropriate pleading. Doubtless for
this reason, the jurisdictional question on which the case
is now made to turn was not even discussed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals.
That court, I believe, properly passed on the constitutional merits, but since the case here goes off on jurisdiction, I intimate no views upon them.
