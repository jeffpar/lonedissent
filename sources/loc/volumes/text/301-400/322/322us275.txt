NOS. 130 AND 131.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.*

Argued March 7, 1944.-Decided May 15, 1944.

1. Article 23 (m)-10 (c) of Treasury Regulations 94, which, in the
case of a lease of an iron ore mine terminated in 1937 without
any ore having been extracted during the existence of the lease,
requires that depletion deductions taken in prior years on receipt
of advance royalties be restored to the lessor's capital account
and that a corresponding amount be returned as income for the
year in which the lease was terminated, held valid, as authorized
by and consistent with § 23 (m) of the Revenue Act of 1936, and
not inconsistent with §§ 113 (b) (1) (B) and 114 (b) (1) or §§ 41
and 42 of the Act. P. 280.
2. A judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing a decision
of the Board of Tax Appeals which refused to treat as income
of the taxpayer for the year in which the lease was terminated the
amount of a depletion deduction which, in the year taken and
allowed, resulted in no tax benefit, affirmed here by an equally
divided court. P. 287.

MR. JUSTICE REED

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed income tax deficiencies against the petitioners for the year
1937, because of their failure to include in income for that
year sums required to be reported by the terms of Article
23 (m)-10 (c) of Treasury Regulations 94, issued pursuant to §23 (m), Revenue Act of 1936. The facts were
not in dispute. Bessie P. Douglas, the petitioner in Nos.
130 and 131, was in 1929 co-owner with Adeline R. Morse,
Charles H. Robinson, and Irene B. Robinson Cirkler of
an iron ore mine in St. Louis County, Minnesota, known
as the Pettit mine. The petitioners in No. 132 are the
executors of the estate of Charles H. Robinson, and the
petitioner in No. 133 is the transferee of the assets of the
estate of Irene B. Robinson Cirkler, deceased.1 In 1929
its co-owners leased this mine to the Republic Steel Corporation. The lease, as amended in 1933, ran for a term
of thirty years, but the lessee was given the power to
cancel it at the end of eight years. The lessee undertook
to pay a royalty of 40 cents a ton for the ore removed and
guaranteed minimum royalties of $20,000 a year for the
first five years and $40,000 a year thereafter, subject after
'Bessie P. Douglas owned a one-half interest; each of the other
co-tenants owned a one-sixth interest. The executor of the estate
of Adeline R. Morse did not appeal from an adverse decision of the
Board of Tax Appeals.

Opinion of the Court.

five years to the payment of $60,000 a year as a minimum
during the time it failed to remove certain water from
the mine. In case the guarantee required the lessee to
pay in any one year for more ore than it actually removed,
it was entitled to have the excess payment applied against
removals in later years. The lessee paid the minimum
royalties each year, but it removed no ore at all, and as
of July 1, 1937, at the end of the eight-year period, it surrendered the lease. Each lessor took a proper depletion
deduction in the respective years the royalties were paid,
1929 to 1936, inclusive. In the year 1933, Bessie P.
Douglas claimed a depletion deduction of $4,958.05, but
since she had sustained a net loss of $13,947.51, this deduction did not affect her tax liability. The Commissioner required all of the deductions to be taxed as income
in 1937. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed his conclusion, except as to the 1933 deductions by Bessie P.
Douglas, which was reversed. 46 B. T. A. 943. Upon
appeals by the taxpayers and, in No. 131, by the Commissioner, the Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the original
assessments. 134 F. 2d 762. We granted petitions for
writs of certiorari to settle a question reserved by our decision in Herring v. Commissioner, 293 U. S. 322, 328, as
to cost depletion, and to consider an issue similar to that
involved in Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S.489.
The Revenue Act of 1913, § II (G) (b), granted a deduction for depletion based solely on actual production
and "not to exceed 5 per centum of the gross value at the
mine of the output for the year." Under this Act, advance royalties were taxed without deduction for depletion. In 1916 Congress removed the 5% ceiling, but the
deduction was still limited to the year of actual extraction. Revenue Act of 1916, § 5 (a) Eighth (b). The
relevant parts of the depletion section reached substantially their present form in the Revenue Act of 1918,
which, like the 1916 Act, authorized "a reasonable allow-

ance for depletion ... under rules and regulations to be
prescribed" with the approval of the Secretary of the
Treasury; but the 1918 Act no longer limited the allowance to the product actually mined and sold during the
year. The section now reads as follows:
"SEC. 23. Deductions from Gross Income.
"In computing net income there shall be allowed as
deductions:
"(m) Depletion.-In the case of mines, oil and gas

Wells, other natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable
allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case;
such reasonable allowance in all cases to be made under
rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary. In any case
in which it is ascertained as a result of operations or of
development work that the recoverable units are greater
or less than the prior estimate thereof, then such prior
.estimate (but not the basis for depletion) shall be revised and the allowance under this subsection for subsequent taxable years shall be based upon such revised
estimate. .. ." Revenue Act of 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat.
1648, 1658-60.
From the beginning of income taxation, as now, the
regulations covered the conventional situations of payments for ores as mined and made provision for depletion
measured by the volume actually extracted. The 1918
Act permitted the new regulations, Regulations 45, Article
215 (c), to provide for the first time a deduction in the
year of receipt of advance royalties of a depletion allowance calculated on the unit value of the mineral in place.
This met a frequently recurring variation from the normal lease. As a corollary the regulations required that
in case a lease was surrendered before the lessee had extracted all the ore for which advance royalties had been

paid, a sum equal to the depletion allowance previously
granted on such ore should be taxed as income in the year
of the surrender of the lease. The bonus or advanced
royalty regulations have remained practically unchanged
since 1919.2 The subsections applicable to prepaid royalties are as follows:
"ART. 23 (m)-10. Depletion-Adjustments of accounts
based on bonus or advanced royalty
"(b) If the owner has leased a mineral property for a
term of years with a requirement in the lease that the
lessee shall extract and pay for, annually, a specified
number of tons, or other agreed units of measurement, of
such mineral, or shall pay, annually, a specified sum of
money which shall be applied in payment of the purchase price or royalty per unit of such mineral whenever
the same shall thereafter be extracted and removed from
the leased premises, an amount equal to that part of the
basis for depletion allocable to the number of units so
paid for in advance of extraction will constitute an allowable deduction from the gross income of the year in which
such payment or payments shall be made; but no deduction for depletion by the lessor shall be claimed or allowed
in any subsequent year on account of the extraction or
removal in such year of any mineral so paid for in advance
and for which deduction has once been made.

under § 214 (a) of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926; Regulations

of 1932; Regulations 86 and 94, Article 23 (m)-10, issued under
§ 23 (m) of the Revenue Acts of .1934 and 1936. They have remained unchanged under the Code, Regulations 111, § 29.23 (m)-10.

has been paid for in advance has been extracted and removed, the lessor shall adjust his capital account by restoring thereto the depletion deductions made in prior
years on account of royalties on mineral paid for but not
removed, and a corresponding amount must be returned
as income for the year in which the lease expires, terminates, or is abandoned." Treasury Regulations 94, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1936.
The deficiency here assessed falls squarely under the
subsections. Their validity is therefore the decisive issue.
In our opinion the regulations are valid.
Since the revenue acts have not forbidden recognition
of bonus or advanced royalties as a basis for the calculation of appropriate depletion, the provision of the regulations for a depletion offset against their receipt is within
the broad rule-making delegation of § 23 (m).

Royalty

or bonus payments in advance of actual extraction of
minerals are, like sales after severance or royalty payments on actual production, gross income and not a recovery of capital. Stratton's Independence v. Howbert,
231 U. S. 399, 418; Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U. S.
103, 114; Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U. S. 103; Herring v.
Commissioner, 293 U. S. 322, 324. Cf. Anderson v. Helvering, 310 U. S. 404, 407-8. Any deduction from this
income for depletion, of course, may be allowed upon
such terms as Congress may deem advisable. Helvering
v. Bankline Oil Co., 303 U. S.362, 366; United States v.
Ludey, 274 U. S. 295, 302. Depletion based on cost is like
depreciation. Congress has allowed a recovery of the
capital invested in a mine but, except in discovery or percentage depletion in special instances which are not here
involved, see § 114, allowed nothing beyond that investment. §§ 23 (m) and (n), 113, 114; 49 Stat. 1648, 1660,

the property-the bre mass. Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens

Co., 267 U. S. 364, 370. It may be in step with extraction,
where extraction and sale synchronize with payments for
the ore or the deduction may be allowed against advance
payments of royalties or bonus. The theory of depletion
is the same in both cases. In either situation, the depletion deduction is allowed in the ore extracted or expected
to be extracted. Regulations 45, Art. 23 (m)-2 and -10
.(a) and (b). Thus the mine owner under Article 23
(m)-10 is compensated for the use of his mineral reserves
in the production of gross income.
By the 1919 Regulations, the plan of restoring the sum
of depletion deductions to capital and carrying a corresponding amount to income in the year of the termination of a lease without production was adopted instead
of a permanent reduction of basis or a restoration of the
depletion deductions to income for the years in which
they were deducted. The Act-§ 23 (m)-did not specifically authorize this handling of unrealized depletion.
By the terms of the section a reasonable allowance for depletion was required, "according to the peculiar conditions in each case." As Congress obviously could not
foresee the multifarious circumstances which would involve questions of depletion, it delegated to the Commissioner the duty of making the regulations. Article 23
(m)-10 (c) was developed to take care of the type of situation where because of a lease's cancellation without extraction, the reason for allowing depletion disappeared.
As no diminution occurred in the ore mass, no depletion
was appropriate. Congress has enacted numerous revenue acts since that time and has seen no occasion to
change the statutory delegation of authority to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue which is the basis of this
long-standing regulation. This evidences that subsections 23 (m)-10 (b) and (c) are within the rule-making
authority which was intended to be granted the Commis587770*-45------22

140, 145-46; Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, 287 U. S. 299,
307.
As-no depletion of the ore mass occurred or can occur
under the lease which produced the gross income, the issue
is not whether the regulation gives a reasonable allowance
for depletion when prepaid royalties are involved. That
issue has been decided in favor of the validity of such
allowances in other cases. Herring v. Commissioner, 293
U. S. 322; Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, 287 U. S. 299. The
problem here is the validity of Article 23 (m)-10 (c) when
the depletion for which a deduction has been previously
allowed fails in the manner anticipated as a possibility
at the time of deduction.
A. Petitioners attack the validity of the regulation on
the ground that the restoration of the accumulated deductions to capital, i. e., the depletion basis, with a corresponding increase of the taxpayers' annual income for the
year of the restoration, is contrary to the requirements of
certain sections of the 1936 Act. §§ 23 (m), 114 (b) (1)
and 113 (b) (1) (B). It is unnecessary to appraise the
effect in other years of the antecedents of these sections.
Petitioners urge that the depletion deductions which were
the untaxed portion of the royalties paid in prior years
were capital recoveries in those prior years which resulted
in a statutory, permanent reduction of basis which cannot
be restored to basis and hence cannot be treated as income
for 1937. Petitioners point to § 23 (m), supra,p. 278, as
providing for the deduction for depletion on payment of
advance royalties. It is contended that §§ 114 (b) (1)
and 113 (b) (1) (B) 8 supplement the statutory direction

of 23 (m) for depletion by requiring the permanent lowering of the basis to reflect the depletion which § 23 offers.'
This, of course, is a contention that depletion for advance
royalties is, as a matter of statute, not necessarily and inevitably tied to extraction, actual or prospective. Summarily expressed, it is that the depletion was permanent,
not conditional, and not subject to recovery when it became clear that no minerals were to be extracted.
To accept these arguments as a sound interpretation
of the meaning of these provisions, however, would put
into § 23 (m) of the Act of 1936 a requirement for depletion against advance royalties which the words of § 114
do not import. We think the Government is correct in
its argument that the adjustment of basis authorized by
§ 113 (b) (1) (A) includes a restoration of depletion to
capital account (basis) under the words "or other items,
in section 113 (b) for the purpose of determining the gain upon the
sale or other disposition of such property, except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection. .. ."
"SEc. 113. AnaUSTED BASIS FOR DETERMINING GAIN OR Loss,

4The
second sentence of § 23 (m), relating to a change of estimate
as to recoverable mineral, is said to indicate a legislative intention

properly chargeable to capital account," when the termination of the lease without extraction of ore forces the
reconsideration of depletion. Consequently, we hold that
§§ 23 (m), 114 (b) (1) and 113 (b) (1) (B) do not affect the power of the Commissioner under § 23 (m) to
restore to the basis the amounts previously deducted
in accordance with Article 23 (m)-10 (b) of Regulations
94. The taxpayer who receives advance royalties receives a gross income but has no statutory right to depletion apart from actual or prospective extraction. To grant
irrecoverable depletion in circumstances where cancellation of the lease occurs prior to extraction would sever
depletion from extraction and, if no later extraction followed, deflect income into the capital account without any
corresponding capital loss.
B. Petitioners vigorously press another argument
against the validity of the regulations. This is that the
separate annual instalments of untaxed royalties (prior
depletion deductions), since these untaxed portions of
the royalties were income for the prior years, may not be
accumulated and taxed for 1937 because such treatment
is fictional, distorts the 1937 income to petitioners' detriment, is unreasonable and violates §§ 23 (m), 41 and 42
of the Act. The latter two sections require the computation of income, net and gross, upon the basis of an annual accounting period and the inclusion of gross income
in the year received by the taxpayer. The applicability
of all three sections depends upon whether a sum equal
to depletion deductions allowed in prior years may be
treated as income for 1937. Petitioners deny that this
may be done and rely for the soundness of their position
upon the familiar principle of annual computation of
income, "as the net result of all transactions within the
year." Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., 282 U. S. 359,
365.

DOUGLAS v. COMMISSIONER.
275

Opinion of the Court.

It is true that the advanced royalties were income to
the taxpayers for the respective years in which they were
received. A certain portion of each of such payments
was, however, properly deducted from this income for
depletion under Article 23 (m)-10 (b). In accordance
with our position and conclusion, as set out in the paragraphs under the preceding section A of this opinion, such
deductions were not finally charged to basis but were
tentatively so charged, subject to the contingency that
there should occur under the lease an actual extraction
of mineral units which would be allocable to the deduction. Under subsection (c) there was the further requirement that if the contingency failed, the suspended
sums should fall into income in the year that the failure
was manifested by the termination of the lease. It
seems entirely proper for.the Commissioner not only to
provide for a reasonable allowance for depletion when
advance royalties are paid but also to provide for the
situation when the expected depletion did not take place.
Annual deductions were made by the taxpayer from his
income. These were allowed to compensate for the exhaustion of capital. An event occurred in 1937, the termination of the lease, which restored the deductions for
depletion to income. This requirement is, we think,
within the delegation of authority to the Commissioner.
The power delegated to him to make regulations for depletion must necessarily include power to provide for
situations where the anticipated depletion of the mineral
mass does not occur.
The manner in which the Commissioner exercised that
power by attributing the sums restored to basis to the
1937 income, rather than to the years 1929 to 1936, is not
invalid as an arbitrary penalty or an improper attribution under the theory of an annual period for determination of income taxes. On the termination of the lease, the

lessee surrendered the right to extract without royalty the
ore for which royalty had been prepaid. This surrender
returned to the taxpayer in 1937 a legal right. Thereupon
the taxpayer was in position to again sell the right to extract this ore or to mine that selfsame ore itself. The
record does not show any valuation of this right which the
lessee surrendered. The lessee paid for the right the
amount attributed to the petitioners' income. Irrespective of the actual value of the right in 1937, it does not
seem unfair for a general regulation to put this value on
the right restored to the taxpayer in the year of its restoration. The decisions uphold the regulation. Sneed v.
Commissioner, 119 F. 2d 767, 770-771; 121 F. 2d 725; Lamont v. Commissioner, 120 F. 2d 996; Grace M. Barnett,

1928; Acquiescence withdrawn December 31, 1932, XI-2 Cum. Bul.
12, 14. Petitioners' point is that whatever may be the validity of the
regulations, taxpayers should not have their depletion deductions,
for the years when the Commissioner's acquiescence was in effect, carried to income in a later year. We agree that these decisions held invalid a regulation like Art. 23 (m)-10 (c) which includes in income
for a taxable year deductions allowed in prior years. The effect of

the Commissioner's acquiescence is uncertain. Cf. C. B. XIII-2-IV.
During the period of acquiescence, the regulation continued in existence and was republished in the edition of December 1, 1931, approved February 15, 1929, of Regulations 74 under the Revenue Act

of 1928, Art. 236 (c). This was prior to the decision in Murphy Oil
Co. v. Burnet, 287 U. S. 299, 304, decided December 5, 1932, thought
by petitioner to have brought about the withdrawal of the acquiescence. Acquiescence by the Commissioner in a Tax Court ruling followed by action which is inconsistent with the withdrawal of an affected
regulation is not a sufficiently definite administrative practice to justify a judicial ruling against the regulation on the strength of the acquiescence. Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U. S. 39, 49; Hig-

RUTLEDGE,

J., dissenting.

The restoration of the right to petitioners in 1937 is
analogous to the surrender of a leasehold, improved by the
lessee, to the lessor. In such a case, the value of the improvements is income to the lessor at the time of the surrender. Helvering v. Bruun, 309 U. S. 461. Cf. Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 342.
C. The last contention of petitioners for our consideration is that where depletion deductions were taken in
years when no equivalent tax benefit resulted, the amount
of the deduction which resulted in no tax benefit should
not be attributed to the year of the surrender of the lease.
This question arises only in No. 131. The Board of Tax
Appeals refused to allow the addition to the 1937 income
of the taxpayer of sums which represented the amount
of deductions for depletion beyond amounts of deductions which offset income. The Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed.
Upon this last point, the decision below in No. 131 is
affirmed by an equally divided court. The members of
this Court who join in the dissent do not reach this question but their position on other issues results in their voting for a reversal of the entire judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals. Two other members of this Court are
of the view that in No. 131 the judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals should be reversed and that the decision
of the Board of Tax Appeals should be affirmed.
In Nos. 130, 132 and 133, the foregoing leads us to the
conclusion that the regulations are valid and the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals are
Affirmed.

By that section Congress provided: "In computing net
income there shall be allowed as deductions . . . a rea,sonable allowance for depletion . . . according to the
peculiar conditions in each case . . . under rules and
regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the
approval of the Secretary." Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat.
1648. (Emphasis added.) Since adoption of the Revenue
Act of 1918 this authority has been executed in part by
Regulations 45, Article 215 (c) and its successors, which
permit the deduction in years when advance royalties are
received. It is not urged, nor could it well be, that the
deduction in such circumstances is not one comprehended
by the statute. In making that mandate Congress clearly
did not intend the privilege to be granted merely on terms
which would defeat its operation. Yet this, in my judgment, is exactly the effect of Article 23 (m)-10 (c).
In requiring that "a corresponding amount must be
returned as income for the year in which the lease expires,
terminates, or is abandoned," the regulation piles up as
"income" for a single year the sum of all the deductions
taken in the previous ones. Wholly apart from whether
in theory or in fact "income" can be said to be realized by
thus piling up the deductions,' this requirement imposes
risks and burdens upon taking the deduction heavier
than any advantage to be gained from it and therefore
prohibitive.
The consequences hardly could be illustrated better than
by the case of Bessie P. Douglas. By taking the deduction during the eight years when she received advance
royalties, 1929 to 1936 inclusive, she saved a total in taxes
of about $7,000. Then her lease was canceled by the
lessee. And in 1937, a year in which she received no cash
return from the lease, her tax liability was increased by

about $26,500 for having taken the deduction in previous
years. She was thus forced to pay approximately $19,500
more in taxes than if she had never taken it.
The regulation's destructive effect bears on all who
receive advance royalties, not merely on those who actually must return accumulated prior deductions as "income"
in a single year. The taxpayer must take the deduction,
if at all, as his royalties accrue, not later as the ore is removed. The system of annual accounting is said to
require this. Cf. Burnet v. Thompson Oil & Gas Co., 283
U. S.301, 306; Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., 282 U. S.
359. Yet it is said also to require that the deductions be
telescoped into "income" for a single year in which the
returns they represent are not received, and with an
effect in tax burden, by the mere fact of the aggregation,
far beyond any which would be imposed if the deductions
never had been authorized or taken. Hence all who receive advance royalties are faced with the choice of taking
the deductions and thus risking this pyramiding of "income," against the chance the lessee will some day deplete
the property, or of foregoing the deductions altogether.
It is true the taxpayer may receive an economic benefit
in the release of his ore from the right of another to remove it. And by the regulation's requirement that he
restore to his capital account an amount equal to the sum
of the accumulated deductions, he also receives a possible
future tax benefit in larger deductions allowable if and
when he sells or leases the minerals again. But these
benefits are wholly uncertain. In fact, release of his ore
from the right of removal gives him not income then
realized in cash to the amount of accumulated deductions, but unsold ore in the ground which the lessee has
found it unprofitable to remove although he has paid for
it. The only contingency on which the taxpayer really
benefits by the deductions is in the event the lessee ultimately does deplete the property. But it is difficult to

believe Congress deliberately extended the opportunity
for deduction to lessors whose property is not in fact depleted by the lessee's operations 2 only to authorize the
Commissioner to nullify and penalize that opportunity.
This the regulation does, in effect, when it imposes on one
who takes the deduction the risk, on a contingency beyond
his control, of having to pay in taxes several times
the amount of the deductions on the happening of the
contingency.
Nor is the regulation reasonably adapted to recoupment of the losses in revenue, wholly proper when incurred
but which later events require to be made up. On the contrary, it perverts recoupment by pyramiding income
spread in receipt over many years into "income" received
in a single, entirely different one. And in a day when the
tax rate mounts more often than yearly the skyrocketing
effect of the process operates with wholly incalculable
effect on the taxpayer, who it will be noted has no control
over the contingency which brings it into play.
A regulation which would require the taxpayer to pay
the taxes deducted for the prior years together with the
usual interest and penalties would be harsh enough in discouragement of taking the deduction. In effect it would
penalize one who rightfully takes an allowance as much
as one who wrongfully does so. But, even so, this would
bear some semblance of reasonable relation to recouping
the losses sustained by the revenue and to allocating income to the year in which it is received. However, to
amalgamate the deductions into "income" for a single
year, in which none of it is actually received, is an entirely different thing. It is to make of the so-called scheme
of deductions a snare for the unwary who violate no law

but comply with it fully; and at the same time to strain
the theory of annual accounting beyond any reasonable
application.
The regulation, therefore, both effectively nullifies a
privilege which Congress provided the taxpayer shall have
and reaches farther than any reasonable recouping provision should go. It is no answer to say deduction is a
privilege which Congress need not have extended, or having extended can qualify out of existence. The question
is whether Congress did, or authorized the Commissioner
to do, the latter. Its language, its prior treatment of the
problem 3 and its treatment of a related problem in the
identical section of the Revenue Act all point to the conclusion it did neither.
Other questions are raised on the record. It is unnecessary to consider them. In my opinion Congress would not
have nullified its grant of the privilege to take "a reasonable allowance for depletion" by enacting Article 23 (in)10 (c) to make exercising it so hazardous, capricious, and
unjust in consequence." That being true, I do not think
authority was delegated to the Commissioner to adopt
or to the Secretary to approve it. I would reverse the
judgment.

joins in this opinion.

8Cf. note 2 supra.
'The uncertain career of Article 23 (m)-10 (c), adverted to in the
Court's opinion, offers no support for Congressional acquiescence in
the Commissioner's position before 1932 and only doubtfully suggests it after that date. In this case the nullifying effect of the limitation upon the privilege granted prevents removal of that doubt.
