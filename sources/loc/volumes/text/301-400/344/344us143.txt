DIXON v. DUFFY, WARDEN.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 4. Argued October 16, 1951.-Continued November 5, 1951.Further continued May 12, 1952.-Decided December 8, 1952.
In a state cc-,.rt, petitioner was convicted of a crime and sentenced
to imprisonment. He did not appeal, but petitioned the State
Supreme Court for habeas corpus, which was denied without opinion. This Court granted certiorari because of a serious claim that
petitioner had been deprived of his rights under the Federal Constitution. At the bar of this Court, the State Attorney General
argued that the State Supreme Court's judgment rested on an
adequate state ground. After twice continuing the cause on its
docket to enable petitioner's counsel to obtain from the State
Supreme Court a determination as to whether its judgment was
intended to rest upon an adequate state ground, this Court is
now informed that the State Supreme Court considers that it has
no jurisdiction to render such a determination. Held:
1. To the end that the doubt as to the jurisdiction of this Court
to review the judgment of the State Supreme Court may be resolved, that judgment is vacated and the cause is remanded for
further proceedings. Pp. 144-146.
2. A new judgment may be entered, and petitioner may also be
informed by an official determination from the State Supreme
Court whether Or not that judgment rests on an adequate state
ground. Pp. 144-146.
Judgment vacated and cause remanded.
Petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus
was denied by the Supreme Court of California without

opinion.

This Court granted certiorari.

341 U. S. 938.

Judgment vacated and cause remanded, p. 146.

Franklin C. Stark, acting under appointment by the
Court, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.
Clarence A. Linn, Assistant Attorney General of Cali-.
fornia, argued the cause for respondent. With him on
the brief were Edmund G. Brown, Attorney General, and

Howard S. Goldin, Deputy Attorney General.

OCTOBER TERM, 1952.
Opinion of the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE

344 U. S.

VINSON delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This case originated on October 21, 1950, when petitioner, a prisoner in San Quentin, filed an application for
a writ of 'habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of California. That court, summarily, but with two disents,
denied the application. To review this decision, petitioner applied to this Court for certiorari. The Court
grantedthe petition, 341 U. S. 938, and thereafter appointed counsel to represent the petitioner. 342 U. S.
805.
The Attorney General of California appeared for respondent. At the bar of this Court, he argued that the
judgment of the Supreme Court of California rested on
an adequate nonfederal ground. Admitting that habeas
corpus is ordinarily an available means to California prisoners to challenge the constitutionality of the proceedings
which resulted in their incarceration, the Attorney General told us that the writ was unavailable in this particular case, to this particular petitioner because he could
have and should have presented his federal claim in an
appeal from his original conviction. Counsel for petitioner vigorously opposed this contention, insisting that
habeas corpus was an available remedy under California
law, that the federal question was properly before the
court.
This Court, of course, does not sit to determine matters
of state law; nor is it the appropriate forum to resolve the
argument raised by the earnest objections of the Attorney
General of California.
. Accordingly, we followed our precedents.' We continued the cause "for such period" as would "enable
counsel for petitioner to secure a determinationfrom the

Opinion of the Court.

Supreme Court of California as to whether the judgment
herein was intended to rest on an adequate independent
state ground or whether decision of the federal claim was
necessary to the judgment rendered." 342 U. S. 33, 34.
(Emphasi.s supplied.)
Counsel for petitioner, in December 1951, duly filed in
the Supreme Court of California a "Petition for Determination of Basis Of Judgment" which requested an expression by that court on the issue raised by our order.
Subsequently, the Clerk of this Court received a letter
from the Clerk of the Supreme Court of California relative to this question. But we received no official determination of the issue from the Supreme Court of California.
We could not regard the letter from the Clerk of the
Supreme Court of California as a "sufficient 'determination' of the question raised in our order of November 5,
1951." Therefore, on May 12, 1952, we "further continued" the cause on our docket to enable counsel for
petitioner to secure from the Supreme Court of California
its official determination as requested by our earlier
order. 343 U. S. 393.
Though some months have now elapsed, we still have
received no advice from the Supreme Court of California.
We are informed, however, that the California court advised petitioner's counsel informally that it doubted its
jurisdiction to render such a determination. And, although counsel subsequently submitted briefs to the contrary, the California court again informed counsel,
through its Clerk, that it was powerless, for want of jurisdiction, to issue any further official expression on the
case. It appears, then, that so long as this cause continues on our docket, counsel cannot procure that which
we asked him to procure.
We granted certiorari in this case "because of a serious
claim that petitioner had been deprived of his rights under
the Federal Constitution." 342 U. S. 33. This Court,

alone, is the final arbiter of such a claim, and our grant
of certiorari should entitle petitioner to the chance to
have the matter resolved by this Court-provided that
the state judgment was not based on an adequatestate
ground. If the state judgment was based on an adequate
state ground, the Court, of course, would be without
jurisdiction to pass upon the federal question. Doubt
has since arisen that such jurisdiction exists. These
circumstances should not now act to deprive petitioner
of his day in this Court,' but they do require that, we
take scrupulous care, as we have so often done beforea
to determine our jurisdiction. This involves further delay, and in this case further delay is regrettable. But
delay is necessary unless we are to resolve the jurisdictional issue by simply assuming the nonexistence of an
adequate state ground though in fact one may exist.
To the end that the doubt in this case may be resolved,
we vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of California and remand the cause for further proceedings. A
new judgment may be entered, and petitioner also may be
informed by an official determination from the Supreme
Court of California whether or not that judgment rests
on an adequate state ground.'
So ordered.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON, dissenting.

Both the wisdom and the legality of this policy toward
the highest court of a state appear dubious to me. What
we are doing, in essence, is to vacate a state court judg2

ment, not because it is found to be inconsistent with
federal law, but because the st,.'
ourt has not told us,
with an acceptable degree of formality, what reasons led
to rendering it.
This Court has blazed the way for the practice of dispensing with opinions in denying petitions for discretionary orders, such as certiorari and motions for leave
to file petitions for habeas corpus. Unless we mean to
impose on state courts a burden we are unwilling to assume ourselves, we should not vacate this state judgment.
Doubt of our jurisdiction is no justification for exercising
it; quite the contrary is the rule.
Those few of the cases cited by the Court in which this
procedure was followed are not persuasive. There was
no examination of the Court's power to vacate, and the
results do not encourage its repetition. In two cases, the
judgment vacated was simply reinstated by the State
Supreme Court and the litigants were never heard from
again. Compare Minnesota v. National Tea Co., 309
U. S.551, with National Tea Co. v. State, 208 Minn. 607,
294 N. W. 230; State Tax Comm'n v. Van Cott, 306 U. S.
511, with Van Cott v. State Tax Comm'n, 98 Utah 264,
96 P. 2d 740. In another instance, however, we pursued
a less drastic course; we stayed our own. hand while petitioner applied to the state court for clarification of its
grounds of decision. Compare Herb v. Pitcairn,324 U. S.
117, with id., 325 U. S.77.
In this case, the Supreme Court of California, having
promptly and officially, albeit informally, advised us of
its ground of decision, feels itself without power to make
a formal order therein. One reason is that it has long
since closed the case with a final determination, and
another is that we, by grant of certiorari, have lifted the
case, record and all, out of that court. I cannot say that
it is unreasonable for a state court to refrain from enter-

ing formal orders in a case which is no longer pending
before it.
The plain truth of the matter 'is that the grant of certiorari was an irresponsible exercise of our own power
without requiring or considering adequate jurisdictional
information. The California Supreme Court has a perfect right to deny an application for habeas corpus to
review a contention that under state practice could have,
and should have, been urged on appeal. We are without
power to require states to allow retrial de novo via habeas
corpus of issues tried and open to review on the original
record. It seems to me probable that this is the ground
the California Supreme Court has taken, not, as this
Court intimates, for this particular case, but as a general
rule of state law, and I think a wise and proper one. It
probably will reaffirm by reinstating the judgment we upset today. I think dismissal of our own writ of certiorari
on the candid admission that it was improvidently
granted is our wise and lawful course.
