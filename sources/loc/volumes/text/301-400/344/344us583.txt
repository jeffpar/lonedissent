v. BARRETT, SECRETARY
OF STATE, ET AL.

ET AL.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF
T

YLINOIS.*

Submitted January 5, i953.-Decided February 9, 1953.
Appellants, most of whom are interstate carriers and all of whom
are intrastate carriers in Illinois, challenged the constitutionality
of an Illinois law which imposes a tax for the use of the public
highways and measures the tax exclusively by the gross weight
of each vehicle. None of the appellants showed -that the tax bore
'no reasonable relation to the use he made of the highways in his
intrastate operations or that the tax was increased by reason of
his interstate operations. Held:
1. Appellants have failed to carry the burden of showing that
the tax deprives them of rights which the Commerce Clause protects. Pp. 584-585.
* 2. The tax does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, though private carriers are taxed at the same
rate as carriers for hire. cPp. 585-586.
3. Since no showing is made that any of the' appellants is the
victim of an invidious classification, the statute does not violate the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 586.
4. The fact that the statute requires Illinois residents to pay the
tax, whereas nonresidents are exempt if the states of their residence reciprocate and grant like exemptions to Illinois residents,
does not violate the Compact Clause of Art. I, § 10 of the Constitution. P. 586.
412 Ill. 204, 106 N. E. 2d 521, and 412 Ill. 321, 106 N. E. 2d 510,
affirmed.

The Supreme Court of Illinois sustained the constitutionality of a state tax on trucks. 412 Ill. 204, 321, 106
N. E. 2d 521, 510. On appeal to this Court, affirmed, p.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases challenge the constitutionality of §§ 9, 11,
and 20 of the .Illinois Motor Vehicle Law, as amended.
Ill. Rev. Stat., 1951, c. 951/2. The statute imposes a tax
for the use of the public highways and measures the tax
exclusively by gross weight of the vehicle. Appellants,
most of whom are interstate carriers, challenged the tax
as violating the :Commerce Clause (Art. I, § 8) of the
Constitution and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Illinois
sustained the statute. 412 Ill. 204, 321, 106 N. E. 2d
521, 510. The cases are here by appeal. 28 U. S. C.
§ 1257 (2).
The main emphasis of the argument is on the Com,merce Clause. The argument starts from the premise
found in our opinions that a state may levy a tax on an
interstate motor vehicle that is "measured by or has some
fair relationship to the use of the highways for which
the charge is made." McCarroll v. Dixie Lines, 309 U. S.
176, 181. It is contended that the present tax is not so
measured but has the same infirmities as the tax on motor
vehicles which the Court invalidated in Interstate
Transit, Inc. v. Lindsey, 283 U. S. 183. An elaborate
argument is advanced to the effect that f large fraction
'of the costs of installing and maintaining highways has

no relation to the weight of the vehicles that pass over
them. Therefore, a tax such as this one, which is determined solely with reference to weight, is a tax part of
which is exacted for a purpose other than the use of the
highways.
We do not stop to analyze the evidence tendered by
appellants. For we do not reach the issue in this case.
It is true that some of the appellants are interstate carriers. But it is also true that each of the interstate carriers does an intrastate business as well. The tax is
required from any motor vehicle that moves on the highways. It is, indeed, a tax for the privilege of using the
highways of Illinois. Clearly it is within the police
power of Illinois to exact such a tax at least from intrastate operators. Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U. S. 610.
No showing has been made by any of the appellants
that the tax bears no reasonable relation to the use he
makes of the highways in his intrastate operations.
No effort is made to show that in that way or in some
other manner the tax is-increased by reason of the interstate operations of any appellant. In short appellants
have failed to carry the burden of showing that the tax
deprives them of rights which the Commerce Clause protects. Cf. Southern R. Co. v. King, 217 U. S. 524, 534.
The case is therefore to be distinguished from those situations where by nature of the tax or its incidence (Sprout
v. South Bend, 277 U. S. 163, 170, 171; Spector Motor.
Service v. O'Connor, 340 U. S. 602, 609) an issue of unreasonable burden on interstate commerce is presented.
The objections under the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment are without substance. The
power of a state to tax, basic to its sovereignty, is limited
only if in substance and effect it is the exertion of a different and a forbidden power (Magnano Co. v. Hamilton,
292 U. S. 40, 44), as for example the taxation of a privilege protected by the First Amendment. See Murdock
v. Pennsylvania,319 U. S.105, 112. No such problem is

even remotely involved here. Complaint is made that
private carriers are taxed at the same rate as carriers for
hire. Yet so far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, that objection is frivolous, since neither private
nor public carriers have the right to use the highways
without payment of a fee (see Hendrick v. Maryland,
supra); and we cannot say that the exaction of the same
fee from each is out of bounds. Appellants make other
arguments to the effect that the statute is so inconsistent,
vague, and uncertain in its classification as to violate the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
But even if we assume that the vagaries of the law reach
that dignity, no showing is made that any of the appellants is the victim of an invidious classification. Cf.
Stephenson v. Binford, 287 U. S. 251, 277.
We need notice only one other argument and that is
that the statute requires Illinois residents to pay the tax,
whereas nonresidents are exempted provided the states of
their residence reciprocate and grant like exemptions to
Illinois residents. That objection, so far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, was adequately answered in Storaasli v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 57, 62. And
contrary to appellants' suggestions, that kind of reciprocal arrangement between states has never been thought
to violate the Compact Clause of Art. I, § 10 of the Constitution. See St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. James, 161 U. S.
545, 562; Kane v. New Jersey, 242 U. S. 160, 168.
Affirmed.

or decision of these cases.

sent an issue under the Commerce Clause because the
carriers do intrastate as well as interstate business and
the tax, therefore, does not as a matter of law affect commerce among the States. (The Court apparently deems
the size of the tax. immaterial since it does not mention
the amounts involved.) It has been suggested in a
cognate situation, though one involving a comparatively
trifling exaction, that interstate commerce is unconstitutionally, burdened solely because the taxpayer's interstate business increases the number of trucks on which
the tax is levied and hence the total amount due from
him. One does not have to embrace this suggestion to
find the Court's position in this case unsupportable. For
the Court declares appellants' claim under the Commerce
Clause baseless although it does not "stop to analyze the
evidence tendered by appellants."
The Court disposes of the contention that the judgments below offend the Commerce Clause, by concluding
that it need not "reach the issue in this case." Its reasoning is as follows: all the interstate carriers here are
engaged in intrastate commerce as well; were they not
engaged in interstate commerce at all, they could betaxed 'on account of their intrastate operations; since
none of the appellants thus pays an additional tax for
its interstate operations, none is in a position to claim
the protection of the Commerce Clause. Consideration
of a challenge to a tax under the Due Process Clause,
which the Court does undertake (reaching conclusions I
agree with), does not, of course, bar appellants from
challenging the tax under the Commerce Clause. Hence
the Court's refusal, on the ground that it does "not reach
the issue," "to analyze the evidence" on which the Commerce Clause contention rests can only mean that the
Court finds that appellants had no standing to sue under
the Commerce Clause, albeit the formal phrase is
withheld.

For this truly startling conclusion we are vouchsafed
no authority except: "Cf. Southern R. Co. v. King, 217
U. S. 524, 534." On its facts the King case has nothing
whatever to do with the problem before us. The passage
to which the citation refers simply repeats the self-evident proposition that. only one whose alleged constitutional rights are affected by a State statute can assail
it. But whether appellants are so affected is the very
question at the threshold of the constitutional issue: is the
tax forbidden by the Commerce Clause. Being engaged
in interstate commerce, appellants invoke the Commerce
Clause against an IlInois statute which affects them because it taxes them. Whether or not the effect on them
is unconstitutional is the question which, in compliance
with settled procedural rules, they have brought here
on appeal.
If it is indeed true, as the Court holds, that one who
is engaged both in intrastate and interstate coinmerce
has no standing to challenge a tax such as this under
the Commerce Clause because the State might, perchance, extract the same dollars and cents from him even
if he engaged in intrastate commerce alone, then this
Court has long-been entertaining, ignorantly and wastefully, cases which it had no power to hear.
The taxation, and licensing by the States of .commingled, though not necessarily inextricably commingled,
intrastate and interstate business, or of the instrumentalities of such commingled business, have again and
again been considered here to determine whether such
an assertion of the taxing power by the States had, in
its practical incidence, cast an inadmissible burden upon
the interstate aspect of the joint enterprise. Can it be
that all these cases could quickly and easily have been
disposed of by suggesting that the taxpayer could in any
event have been taxed on his intrastate *operations?

J., dissenting.

As far back as 1888, in Leloup v. Port of Mobile, 127
U. S. 640, the Court struck down because of the Commerce Clause a tax attacked by a taxpayer doing both
intrastate and interstate business. In a hundred-odd
cases since, a claim under the Commerce Clause in similar situations was considered. (This does not mean it
always prevailed.) Can it be that all our predecessors
bothered their heads needlessly? Indeed, ever since
Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1, and Pullman Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 56,'it has been settled that
a State may not exclude a foreign corporation from
doing merely local business if such exclusion would "unreasonably burden" the nonexcludable interstate business.
(I am not now concerned with what is and what is not
such an "unreasonable burden.") Under today's holding, was there standing in these cases?
A word on the merits. Of course a State may tax for
the use of its roads by carriers engaged in interstate commerce, whether they carry local goods as well or do an
exclusive interstate business. But this states the beginning of a problem in constitutional law; it does not give
the answer. The real question is how the State makes
the exaction-that is, what is the nature of the exaction,
its basis and its practical operation. As the Court does
not reach this question, it would serve no purpQse for me
to-do so.
