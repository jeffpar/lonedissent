FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. MINNEAPOLIS-HONEYWELL REGULATOR CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 11.

Argued October 15-16, 1952.-Decided December 22, 1952.

The Court of Appeals entered a judgment reversing the first of three
parts of a cease and desist order issued by the Federal Trade Commission against respondent. After expiration of the period allowed
for a petition for rehearing, the Commission filed a memorandum
calling attention to the Court's failure to decree enforcement of

Parts I and II; but it requested no alteration of the judgment
relative to Part III. Subsequently, the Court of Appeals issued
a ."Final Decree" reversing Part III of the order and decreeing
enforcement of Parts I and II. More than 90 days after entry
of the first judgment, the Commission petitioned this Court for
certiorari to review the judgment reversing Part III of its order.
Held: The 90-day period allowed by 28 U. S. C. § 2101 (c) for
filing a petition for certiorari began to run on the date of the first
judgment, and the petition was not timely. Pp. .207-213.
(a) Only when the lower court changes matters of substance, or
resolves a genuine ambiguity, in a judgment previously rendered
should the period within which an appeal must be taken or a petition for certiorari filed begin to run anew. Pp. 211-212.
. (b) A different result is not required by the fact that the
Court
of Appeals labeled its second order a "Final Decree," whereas
the word "Final" was missing from its first judgment. Pp. 212213.

(c) Statutes which limit the appellate jurisdiction of this Court
to cases in which review is sought within a prescribed period are
not to be applied so as to permit a tolling of the time limitations
because some event occurred in the lower court after judgment was
rendered which is of no import on the matters to be dealt with on
review. P. 213.

another judgment reversing that part and decreeing enforcement of the other two parts of the order. On petition of the Federal Trade Commission, this Court granted
certiorari to review the judgment reversing part of its
order, and requested counsel to discuss the "timeliness of

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The initial question in this case is one of jurisdictionwhether the petition for certiorari was filed within the
period allowed by law.1 We hold that it was not.
The cause grows out of a proceeding i nitiated by petitioner, the Federal Trade Commission, in 1943. At that
time, the Commission issued a three-count complaint
against respondent. Count I charged a violation of § 5
of the Federal Trade Commission Act; 2 Count II charged
a violation of § 3 of the Clayton Act; I Count III dealt
with an alleged violation of § 2 (a) of the Clayton Act as
amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.' A protracted
administrative proceeding followed. The Commission
finally determined against respondent on all three counts,

and it issued a cease and desist order, in three parts,
covering each of the three violations.
Respondent petitioned ,the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit to review and set aside this order. The
Commission sought enforcement of all parts of its order
in a cross-petition.
Respondent abandoned completely its attack on Parts
I and II of the order. In briefs and in oral argument,
respondent made it clear, that the legality of Part III was
the only contested issue before the Court of Appeals.
Neither party briefed or argued any question arising out
of Parts I and II.
On July 5, 1951, the Court of Appeals announced its
decision. The opinion stated that since respondent did
not "challenge Parts I and II of the order based on the
first two counts of the complaint we shall make no further
reference to them." The court then went on to hold
that Part III of petitioner's order could not be sustained
by substantial evidence and should be reversed. 191 F.
2d 786. On the same day, the court entered its judgment,
the pertinent portion reading as follows:
"... it is ordered and adjudged by this Court
that Part III Of the decision of the Federal Trade
Commission entered in this cause on January 14,
1948, be, and the same is hereby,- Reversed, and
Count III "of the complaint upon which it is based
be, and the same is hereby Dismissed."
The Court of Appeals requires petitions for rehearing
to be filed "within 15 days after entry of judgment."
The Commission filed no such petition. On August. 21,
1951, long after the expiration of this 15-day period, and
after a certified copy of said judgment, in lieu of mandate, was issued, the Commission filed a memorandum
with the court which reads in part as follows:

F. T. C. v. MINNEAPOLIS-HONEYWELL CO.

209

Opinion of the Court.

"On July 5, 1951 the Court entered its opinion and
judgment reversing-Part III of the decision of the
Federal Trade Commission dated January 14, 1948
and dismissing Count III of the complaint upon
which it is based. No disposition has been made of
the Cross-Petition filed by the Commission for affirmance and enforcement of the entire decision. The
Commission takes the position that its Cross-Petition should be in part sustained, i. e., to the extent
that the Court should make and enter herein a decree
affirming Parts I and II of the Commission's order
to cease and desist and commanding MinneapolisHoneywell Regulator Company to obey the same and
comply therewith ...
"11. In its briefs filed herein the petitioner abandoned its attack upon Parts I and II of the order
and challenged only the validity of Part III of the
order (see page 1 of petitioner's brief dated March
15, 1951). Thus, petitioner concedes the validity of
Parts I and II of the order and does not contest the
prayer of th.e Commission's Cross-Petition and brief
with respect to the affirmance and enforcement of
Parts I and II of the order."
Clearly, by this memorandum the Commission sought
no alteration of the judgment relative to Part III; in
fact, it acknowledged the entry of judgment reversing
Part III on July 5,.1951. It did not, even claim it to be
a petition for rehearing. It was submitted that Parts
I and II of, the order were uncontested, and "In conclusion . . .submitted that the Court should make and
enter . . . a decree affirming and enforcing Parts I and
II of the Commission's order to cease and desist."
On September 18, 1951, the Court of Appeals issued
what it called its "Final Decree." Again the court

"ordered, adjudged and decreed" that Part III of the
Commission's order "is hereby reversed and Count III of
the complaint upon which it is based be and the same.is
hereby dismissed." The court then went on to affirm
Parts I and II, and it entered a judgment providing for
their enforcement, after reciting again that there was no
contest over this phase of the order.
On December 14, 1951, the Commission filed its petition for certiorari. Obviously, the petition was out of
time unless the ninety-day filing period began to run
anew from the second judgment entered on September
18, 1951. In .our order granting certiorari, 342 U. S.940,
we asked counsel to discuss the "timeliness of the application for the writ."
Petitioner refers us to cases which have held that when
a court considers on its merits an untimely petition for a
rehearing, or an untimely motion to amend matters of
substance in a judgment, the time for appeal may begin
to run anew from the date on which the court disposed
of the untimely application.'
Petitioner apparently would equate its memorandum
.of August 21, 1951, with an untimely petition for a rehearing affecting Part III. But certainly its language
and every inference therein is to the contrary. When
petitioner filed its memorandum, the time for seeking a
rehearing had long since expired.
Moreover, the memorandum was labeled neither as a
petition for a rehearing nor as a motion to amend the
previous judgment, and in no manner did it purport to
seek such relief. On the contrary, the Commission indicated that it was quite content to let the Court of Appeals'
decision of July 5 stand undisturbed. Since we cannot

treat the memorandum of August 21 as petitioner would
have us treat it, we cannot hold that the time for filing a
petition for certiorari was enlarged simply because this
paper may have prompted the court below to take some
further action which had no effect on the merits of the
decision that we are now asked to review in the petition
for certiorari.
Petitioner tells us that the application must be deemed
to be in time because "when a court actually changes its
judgment, the time to appeal or petition begins to run
anew irrespective of whether a petition for rehearing has
been filed."
We think petitioner's interpretation of our
decisions is too liberal.
While it may be true that the Court of Appeals had
the power to supersede the judgment of July 5 with a new
one,7 it is also true, as that court itself has recognized,
that the time within which a losing party must seek review cannot be enlarged just because the lower court in
its discretion thinks it should be enlarged
Thus, the
mere fact that a judgment previously entered has been
reentered or revised in an immaterial way does not toll
the time within which review must be sought. Only
when the lower'court changes matters of substance, 10 or
resolves a genuine ambiguity," in a judgment previously
rendered should the period within which an appeal must
be taken or a petition for certiorari filed begin to run

anew. The test is a practical one. The question is
whether the lower court, in its second order, has disturbed
or revised legal rights and obligations which, by its prior
judgment, had been plainly and properly settled with
12
finality.
The judgment of September 18, which petitioner now
seeks to have us review, does not meet this test. It reiterated, without change, everything which had been decided on July 5. Since the one controversy between the
parties related only to the matters which had been adjudicated on July 5, we cannot ascribe any significance,
as far as timeliness is concerned, to the later judgment."3
Petitioner puts great emphasis on the fact that the
judgment of September 18 was labeled a "Final Decree" by the Court of Appeals, whereas the word "Final"
was missing from the judgment entered on July 5. But
we think the question of whether the time for petitioning
for certiorari was to be enlarged cannot turn on the adjec-

tive which the court below chose to use in the caption
of its second judgment. Indeed, the judgment of July 5
12 Compare-Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 6 Wall. 153 (1868)
(appeal
allowed from a second decree, restating most provisions of the first
because the first decree, at the time of entry, was only regarded by
the parties and the court as tentative); Memphis v. Brown, 94 U. S.
715 (1877) (appeal allowed from second judgment on the ground
that the second made material changes in the first). See United
States v. Hark, 320 U. S.531, 533-534 (1944); Hill v. Hawes, 320
U. S. 520, 523 (1944).
13The suggestion is made that the September 18 judgment injected
a new controversy into the litigation-the question of whether the
Court of Appeals had the power to affirm and enforce the Commission's order after it had cross-petitioned for such relief. Cf. Federal
Trade Commission v. Ruberoid Co., 343 U. S.470 (1952). But if
the respondent had sought to contest that issue, it could have done
so from the start, by raising objections to enforcement of all parts of
the Commission's cross-petition. Instead, respondent' refused to contest these' parts of the Commission's order. Having done so, it removed the question involved in the Ruberoid case from this case.

was for all purposes final. It put to rest the questions
which the parties had litigated in the Court of Appeals.
It was neither "tentative, informal nor incomplete." 14
Consequently, we cannot accept the Commission's view
that a decision against it on the time question will constitute an invitation to other litigants to seek piecemeal
review in this Court in the future.
Thus, while we do not mean to encourage applications
for piecemeal review by today's decision, we do mean to
encourage applicants to this Court to take heed of another
principle-the principle that litigation must at some
definite point be brought to an end." It is a principle
reflected in the statutes which limit our appellate jurisdiction to those cases where review is sought within a
prescribed period. Those statutes are not to be applied
so as to permit a tolling of their time limitations because
some event occurred in the lower court after judgment
was rendered which is of no import to the matters to be
dealt with on review.
Accordingly, the writ of certiorari is
Dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE .BLACK, dissenting.

The end result of what the Court does today is to leave
standing a Court of Appeals decree which I think is so
clearly wrong that it could well be reversed without argument. The decree set aside an order of the Federal Trade
Commission directing Minneapolis-Honeywell to stop
violating § 2 (a) of the •Robinson-Patman Act by selling
oil burner controls. to some customers cheaper than to
others. The Court of Appeals not only set aside the
Commission's order as permitted under some circumstances. It went much further and ordered the Commis14See

sion to dismiss Count III of the complaint against
Minneapolis-Honeywell. In doing so the Court of
Appeals invaded an area which Congress has made
the exclusive concern of the Federal Trade Commission. See Federal Trade Commission v. Morton Salt
Co., 334 U. S. 37, 55; FederalPower Commission v. Idaho
Power Co., 344 U. S. 17, 20; Federal Communications
Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S.134
145-146.
Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that there was no
evidence at all to substantiate the Commission finding
that a quantity discount pricing system of MinneapolisHonqeywell resulted in price discriminations that violated
§ 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act. But tlere was evidence before the Commission that some customers of
Minneapolis-Honeywell were given substantially bigger
discounts on purchases than those given their competitors.
And the Commission found that these variations were
not justified by any differences in costs of manufacture,
sale or delivery. We have emphasized that such a showing amply supports a Commission cease and desist order.
Federal Trade Commission ' . Morton Salt Co., 334 U. S.
37, 47. The Court of Appeals here failed to follow our
holding in the Morton Salt case. For this reason also
it should be reversed.
I think the following facts show that the petition for
certiorari here was filed in time. The Court of Appeals
was petitioned by Minneapolis-Honeywell to review and
set aside a Trade Commission order in its entirety. Later
Minneapolis-Honeywell apparently conceded validity of
part of the order and the court's first decree of July 5,
1951, failed to pass on all the provisions of the Commission's order.' The Commission had ninety days to ask

to be done, this Court cannot pass upon the subject. If from any

that we review that partial order if it was a "final" one.
Within that ninety days, on August 21, 1951, the Commission asked the Court of Appeals to pass on the remainder of the order. In response a new and expanded
decree of the Court of Appeals came down September 18,
1951, marked "Final Decree." December 14,1951, within
ninety days after rendition of this "Final Decree," the
Commission filed here its petition for certiorari which
the Court now dismisses.
I think that no statute, precedent or reason relied on
by the Court requires dismissal of this cause. Of course
appealability of a judgment depends on its being "final"
in the legalistic sense. But there is no more ambiguous
word in all the legal lexicon. 2 The Court of Appeals
thought its second not its first decree was "final." Counsel for the Commission evidently believed the second
judgment was the "final" one. I am confident many
lawyers would have thought the same under this Court's
former cases. So I would have viewed the second judgment before today's holding. Former cases would have,
intermediate stage in the proceedings an appeal might be taken to
the Supreme Court, the appeal might be repeated to the great oppression of the parties." Mr. Chief Justice Marshall speaking for the
Court in Life &,Fire Ins. Co. of New York v. Adams, 9 Pet. 573, 602
(1835).
'We think that the decree is not a final decree, and that
this court has no jurisdiction of the appeal. The decree is not final,
because it does not dispose of the entire controversy between the
parties." Keystone Iron Co. v. Martin, 132 U. S. 91, 93 (1889). "It
is the settled practice of this court, and the same in the King's Bench
in England, that the writ will not lie until the whole of the matters in
coniroversy in the suit below are disposed of. . . . The cause is not
to be sent up in fragments." Holconbe v. McKusick, 20 How. 552,

554 (1858).

more frequent discussion in this court than the finality of decrees. . . . The cases, it must be conceded, are not altogether harmonious." McGourkey v. Toledo & Ohio R. Co., 146 U. S.536, 54454. Cf. Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U. S. 507, 511.

pointed strongly to rejection of appeal from the incomplete first decree as an attempted "piecemeal" review.$
The majority advances logical and rational grounds for
its conclusion that the first judgment rather than the
second one was "final." That the second judgment was
"final," legalistically speaking, is equally supportable by
logic, reason and precedent, if not more so.' But in arguing over "finality" we should not ignore the fact that
Congress has declared that this type of proceeding should
be reviewable both in the Court of Appeals and here.
We frustrate that declaration when review is denied a

A multitude of cases would have supported such a belief on the
part of Commission counsel. See, e. g., Note 1 and the following:
"But piecemeal appeals have never been encouraged." Morgantown
v. Royal Ins. Co., 337 U. S. 254, 258. "Congress from the very beginning has, by forbidding piecemeal disposition on appeal of what for
practical purposes is a single controversy, set itself against enfeebling
judicial adninistration." Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323,
325. "The f6undation of this policy is not in merely technical conceptions of 'finality.' It is one against piecemeal litigation. 'The case is
not to be sent up in fragments.....' Luxton v. North River Bridge
Co., 147 U. S. 337,,341." Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229,
233-234.
' "Upon these facts we cannot doubt that the entry of the 28th of
November was intended as an order settling the terms of the decree
to be entered thereafter; and that the entry made on the 5th of
December was regarded both by the court and the counsel as the final
decree -in the cause.
"We do not question that the first entry had all the essential elements of a final decree, and if it had been followed by no other action
of the court, might very properly have been treated as such. But
we must be governed by the obvious intent of the Circuit Court,
apparent on the face of the proceedings. We must hold, therefore,
the decree of the 5th of December to be the final decree." Rubber
Company v. Goodyear, 6 Wall. 153, 155-156 (1868). See also Federal Power Commission v. Idaho Power Co., 344 U. S. 17, 20-21; Hill

litigant because of his failure to guess right when confronted in August 1951 with a puzzle, the answer to which
no one could know until today.
In prior cases cited in the Court's opinion this Court
has found ways to grant review to litigants bedeviled
and confused by the judicially created fog of "finality."
In those, prior cases the Court recognized the vagueness
of the finality rule and refused to throw out of court
litigants who had acted bona fide. It is unfortunate that
the Court today fails to utilize this same kind of judicial
ingenuity to afford this litigant the review Congress saw
fit to provide in the public interest.
-The proceedings against Minneapolis-Honeywell began
before the Commission nine years ago. Sixteen hundred
pages of evidence were put on the record. It all goes to
nought apparently because Commission counsel lacked
sufficient clairvoyance to anticipate that this Court
would hold that the July judgment rather than the one
in September was final. Rules of practice and procedure
.should be used to promote the ends of justice, not to defeat them.'
