SILBER v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.

No. 454.

Argued April 19, 1962.-Decided June 25, 1962.

Petitioner's indictment for violating 2 U. S. C. ยง 192 was identical to
those held defective in Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749; the
District Court erroneously denied a timely motion to dismiss it;
and petitioner was convicted. The issue raised by the motion to
dismiss apparently was not presented to the Court of Appeals, and
it was not briefed or argued in this Court. Held: This Court, at
its option, may notice a plain error not presented, and the judgment
sustaining the conviction is reversed on the authority of Russell v.
United States. Pp. 717-718.
111 U. S. App. D. C. 331, 296 F. 2d 588, reversed.

Victor Rabinowitz argued the cause for petitioner.
With him on the briefs was Leonard B. Boudin.
Bruce J. Terris argued the cause for the United States.
On the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Yeagley, George B. Searls and Kevin T.
Maroney.
PER CURIAM.

The judgment is reversed. Russell v. United States,
369 U. S. 749. The indictmentupon which the petitioner
was tried was identical to those held defective in Russell.
The petitioner's timely motion to dismiss the indictment,
made in accord with Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 12 (b)(2),
was erroneously denied by the District Court.
Although the trial court squarely considered and
decided the issue raised by the motion to dismiss, it was
apparently not presented to the Court of Appeals and was
not briefed or argued in this Court. While ordinarily we
do not take note of errors not called to the attention of
the Court of Appeals nor properly raised here, that rule

is not without exception. The Court has "the power to
notice a 'plain error' though it is not assigned or specified,"
Brotherhood of Carpenters v. United States, 330 U. S.
395, 412.* "In exceptional circumstances, especially in
criminal cases, appellate courts, in the public interest,
may, of their own motion, notice errors to which no exception has been taken, if the errors are obvious, or if they
otherwise seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public
reputation of judicial proceedings." United States v.
Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157, 160. Our own rules provide that
"the court, at its option, may notice a plain error not
presented." Revised Rules of the Supreme Court of the
United States, Rule 40 (1) (d) (2). See also Fed. Rules
Crim. Proc. 52 (b).
