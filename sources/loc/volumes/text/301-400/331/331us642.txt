conscionable contracts. By permitting its insurance corporations, particularly mutual companies, to make contracts barring an insured's access to state courts, New
York, for example, could thus render all the other states
helpless to provide a judicial haven for their own wronged
citizens.
Such a doctrine is not only novel; it is revolutionary.
I think the doctrine violates the very Constitution that
it is our duty to interpret. For the Court today, in part,
nullifies a great purpose of the original Constitution, as
later expressed in the Tenth Amendment, to leave the several states free to govern themselves in their domestic
affairs. Hereafter, if today's doctrine should be carried to
its logical end, the state in which the most powerful corporations are concentrated, or those corporations themselves, might well be able to pass laws which would govern
contracts made by the people in all of the other states.
I would affirm this judgment.

Argued April 10, 11, 1947.-Decided June 16, 1947.

Trustees in a reorganization proceeding under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by the Chandler Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 840,
who have been authorized by the reorganization court to sue officers
and directors of the debtor corporation and affiliated interests alleging misappropriation of corporate assets (discovered in an investigation under § 167) and seeking an accounting and other relief,
may bring such suit in another federal district court, even in the
absence of diversity of citizenship or other usual grounds of federal
jurisdiction. Pp. 646-662.

(c) Section 102 of Chapter X, making § 23 inapplicable in proceedings under that Chapter, removes this limitation and gives
all federal district courts jurisdiction under § 2 over plenary

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
Section 2,(a) of the Bankruptcy Act' confers upon all
bankruptcy courts "such jurisdiction at law and in equity
as will enable them to exercise original jurisdiction in proceedings under this Act . . . to . . . (7) Cause the estates of bankrupts to be collected, reduced to money and
distributed, and determine controversies in relation
thereto, except as herein otherwise provided . . ." The
exception has reference to § 23 (b), which requires that
"Suits by the receiver and the trustee shall be brought or
prosecuted only in the courts where the bankrupt might
have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings under this
Act had not been instituted, unless by consent of the defendant, except as provided in sections 60, 67, and 70 of
this Act."' Congress, however, in the Chandler Act of
1938 declared the inapplicability of § 23 in reorganization
proceedings under Chapter X; and it is upon the signifi' The Chandler Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 840, generally revised the
Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 544, as amended. Section 2 in its
original form was substantially as set out in the text except that
jurisdiction was conferred "in bankruptcy proceedings," instead of
"in proceedings under this Act." The change in language was made
in 1938.

cance of this action to the jurisdiction of the federal courts
that this case turns.'
Respondents were appointed trustees for the Central
States Electric Corporation, a Virginia Corporation in
reorganization in the District Court of the United States
for the Eastern District of Virginia. Following an investigation under § 167 of the Act, respondents were
authorized to institute suit against petitioners, who are
past and present officers and directors of the debtor and
others having connection therewith. This suit was then
filed against petitioners in the District Court of the United
States for the Southern District of New York, alleging
a conspiracy to misappropriate corporate assets and asking an accounting and other relief. There was no allegation of diversity and jurisdiction was rested upon "the
Constitution of the United States (Article I, Section 8,
Clause 4, and Article III, Section 2), the Act of Congress
relating to Bankruptcies (U. S. Code Title 11), and . . .
unless by consent of the defendant, except as provided in sections 60,

3 Chapter X, containing the reorganization provisions, superseded
§ 77B. Section 102 of Chapter X provides: "The provisions of chapters I to VII, inclusive, of this Act shall, insofar as they are not inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, apply in proceedings under this chapter: Provided, however, That section 23, subdivisions h and n of section 57, section 64, and subdivision f of section
70, shall not apply in such proceedings unless an order shall be entered
directing that bankruptcy be proceeded with pursuant to the provisions of chapters I to VII, inclusive. For the purposes of such application, provisions relating to 'bankrupts' shall be deemed to relate also
to 'debtors', and 'bankruptcy proceedings' or 'proceedings in bankruptcy' shall be deemed to include proceedings under this chapter."

the provisions of Section 24 (1), (19) of the Judicial
Code .....
The District Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;
but the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that
since the governing provisions of § 23, to which the
"except" clause of § 2 (a) (7) refers, were suspended in
Chapter X proceedings, jurisdiction to hear this plenary
suit could be rested upon the general language of § 2.
Other alleged grounds for jurisdiction were not considered.
159 F. 2d 67 (1946).
1. Petitioners construe "proceedings under this Act,"
within which the jurisdictional grant contained in § 2 is
confined, as extending only to matters proper for summary
disposition," and interpret the suspension of § 23 in Chapter X cases, without providing a substitute therefor, as
removing from the Act an affirmative grant to federal
courts of jurisdiction to hear plenary suits, rather than
as an action aimed at expanding that jurisdiction.7 But
these views rest, in the main, upon what we think is an
erroneous appraisal of the history of §§ 2 and 23.
Section 2 is substantially identical with § 1 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867,8 Babbitt v. Dutcher, 216 U. S. 102,
5 Petitioners also based their motion to dismiss on the applicable
statute of limitations; but the District Court indicated that if there
had been jurisdiction to proceed, the motion to dismiss would otherwise have been denied, because of factual issues which first required
determination.
1 ,
"Proceedings under this chapter," referred to in §§ 101 and 102
of Chapter X, is similarly construed.
7 According to this view there would, in Chapter X cases, be no
provisions in the Bankruptcy Act conferring jurisdiction upon federal
courts to hear plenary suits other than in §§ 60, 67, and 70. A reorganization trustee would be left, where he could, to take advantage of
the ordinary grounds for federal jurisdiction.

107 (1910); and cases dealing with that Act, while recognizing that certain suits brought by bankruptcy assignees
should proceed in plenary, rather than summary, fashion,
held that § 1 gave jurisdiction to the bankruptcy courts
to proceed in both ways. And although certain aspects
of a bankruptcy proceeding could be handled only by
the court in which the adjudication was had, § 1 conferred
upon all bankuptcy courts jurisdiction to hear plenary
suits brought by bankruptcy assignees against adverse
claimants or against debtors of the bankrupt."
Lathrop v. Drake, 91 U. S. 516 (1875), viewed the jurisdiction of the district courts in this manner and, we think,
contrary to the statements later made in Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, 178 U. S. 524 (1900), and Schumacher v. Beeler,
293 U. S. 367 (1934), upon which petitioners rely, considered the jurisdiction of the district courts over plenary

Goodall v. Tuttle, 10 Fed. Cas. 579, No. 5,533 (1872). The requirement of plenary proceedings, though not expressly appearing in the
Act, was well recognized. Marshall v. Knox, 16 Wall. 551 (1872);
Smith v. Mason, 14 Wall. 419 (1871).
10 Sherman v. Bingham, 21 Fed. Cas. 1270, No. 12,762 (1872);
Goodall v. Tuttle, 10 Fed. Cas. 579, No. 5,533 (1872).
11 The references to the Act contained in the discussion of the juris-

diction of the district courts obviously referred to § 1; and Sherman v.
Bingham, 21 Fed. Cas. 1270, No. 12,762 (1872), which expressly based
upon § 1 the jurisdiction of the district courts to hear plenary suits,
was cited with unreserved approval. The pertinent passage in the
Lathrop case is as follows:
"The language conferring this jurisdiction of the district courts is
very broad and general. It is, that they shall have original jurisdiction in their respective districts in all matters and proceedings in bankruptcy. The various branches of this jurisdiction are afterwards
specified; resulting, however, in the two general classes before mentioned ....

Each court within its own district may exercise the

331 U. S.

Section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 substantially
repeated the broad grant of jurisdiction contained in § 1
of the 1867 Act. The bankruptcy courts were given
"such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable
them to exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings
.
1 But § 2 (7), while granting to all bankruptcy courts jurisdiction to collect and to hear contropowers conferred; but those powers extend to all matters of bankruptcy, without limitation. . . . But the exclusion of other district
courts from jurisdiction over these proceedings does not prevent them
from exercising jurisdiction in matters growing out of or connected
with that identical bankruptcy, so far as it does not trench upon or
conflict with the jurisdiction of the court in which the case is pending.
Proceedings ancillary to and in aid of the proceedings in bankruptcy
may be necessary in other districts where the principal court cannot
exercise jurisdiction; and it may be necessary for the assignee to
institute suits in other districts for the recovery of assets of the
bankrupt. That the courts of such other districts may exercise jurisdiction in such cases would seem to be the necessary result of the
general jurisdiction conferred upon them, and is in harmony with the
scope and design of the act. The State courts may undoubtedly be
resorted to in cases of ordinary suits for the possession of property
or the collection of debts; and it is not to be presumed that embarrassments would be encountered in those courts in the way of a prompt
and fair administration of justice. But a uniform system of bankruptcy, national in its character, ought to be capable of execution in
the national tribunals, without dependence upon those of the States
in which it is possible that embarrassments might arise. The question
has been quite fully and satisfactorily discussed by a member of this
court in the first circuit, in the case of Shearman v. Bingham, 7 Bank.
Reg. 490; and we concur in the opinion there expressed, that the
several district courts have jurisdiction of suits brought by assignees
appointed by other district courts in cases of bankruptcy." 91 U. S.
516, 517-18.
12 Section 2 created the courts of bankruptcy and invested them
"with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to
exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings . . . to . . .
(7) cause the estates of bankrupts to be collected, reduced to money

provided: "Suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in
the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered
by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings

14 "A construction of the statute of 1898 which would deprive the

15When S.1035, which eventually became the Act of 1898, reached
the House, the judiciary committee recommended striking out all after
the enacting clause and substituting the committee's own bill. Section
23 of the House version,,31 Cong. Rec. 1781 (1898), survived both debate and conference action and became § 23 of the Act of 1898. In
reviewing the bill preliminary to debate, the chairman of the House
judiciary committee explained:
"The jurisdiction of State courts to try controversies between the
trustees of bankrupt estates and parties claiming adverse interest is
not in any way interfered with.
"Suits by the trustee shall only be brought in the courts where the
bankrupt might have brought them except for the misfortune of his
bankruptcy, unless by the consent of the proposed defendant.

settlement of estates was conducted almost wholly in United States

331 U. S.

Some lower federal courts, however, immediately held
that § 23 did not apply to suits brought to recover certain
transfers of the bankrupt's property and, relying upon § 2,
upheld the jurisdiction of federal courts.' Bardes v.
Hawarden Bank, supra, checked this trend and gave full
scope to the language of § 23. Suits to recover fraudulent
transfers, like other plenary suits, were to be tried in the
state courts. It was in the Bardes case unnecessary to
explore the scope of § 2; for whatever the grant of jurisdiction there made, the interpretation given § 23 would
have required the result reached. In any event, the construction of § 2, standing alone and without regard for the
influence of § 23, as being confined to summary matters rested to a great extent upon a reading of Lathrop v.
Drake, supra,with which, as has been indicated, we cannot
agree.
Congressional reaction to the Bardes case was almost
immediate. Wishing to allow the trustee to resort to federal courts in recovering fraudulent transfers and preferences, Congress in 1903 created exceptions to § 23 in favor
of suits brought under §§ 60 (b) and 67 (e); 17 and, being,
doubly cautious, Congress also inserted in §§ 60 (b) and
67 (e) clauses giving any bankruptcy court jurisdiction to
hear plenary suits brought under those sections. 8 It was
explained at the time by the House judiciary committee
courts. The result was great inconvenience and much expense to a
majority of the people interested in such litigation as principals, witnesses, and attorneys. Such will not be the effect under this bill. It
is proper that such should not be the case, speaking generally, in
behalf of the administration of justice." 31 Cong. Rec. 1785 (1898).

that § 2 (7) would probably have been ample basis
for the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts, and that it
was only to remove all doubt that §§ 60 (b) and 67 (e) had
also been amended."
Where §§ 60 (b), 67 (e), and 70 (e) were not involved,
the Bardes rule continued to be applied where plenary proceedings were required, as in cases relating to property ad' "Section 9: Under the law of 1867, the Federal and State courts
had concurrent jurisdiction of suits to recover property fraudulently or

preferentially transferred.

Bardes v. Bank of Hawarden (Ia.), 178

U. S., 524, has so construed section 23 b, of the law as to deny such
jurisdiction to the district courts, save with the consent of the proposed
defendant. In commercial centers this amounts to a denial of justice,
the calendars of the State courts being years behindhand; while,
growing out of Bardes v. Bank, have come decisions which have crippled the administration of the law to a marked degree. (See in re
Ward (Mass.), 5 Am. B. R., 215; Mueller v. Nugent (Ky.), 105 Fed.,
581; this latter, however, recently reversed by the Supreme Court.)
There is a very general demand for a return to the policy of the law
of 1867. Were it not for section 23 b, section 2 (7), would probably
confer ample jurisdictionon the district courts. The change in section

23, b, proposed by the bill simply excepts from the operation of it all
suits which can, under the specific words of the law, be brought to
recover property, and this merely by referring to the three sections

under which alone such suits can be brought. To remove all doubt,
also, sections 13 and 16 of the bill confer concurrent jurisdiction of all
such suits on the State courts and the Federal district courts, by adding
appropriate words to each of the three sections section 60 b, section
67 e, and section 70 e." H. Rep. No. 1698, 57th Cong., 1st Sess. 7

Substantially the same explanation was given on the floor of the
House by Representative George W. Ray, chairman of the judiciary
committee. 35 Cong. Rec.6941, 6942 (1902).
Representative Ray, we note, was second ranking member of the
judiciary committee at the time of the passage of the 1898 Act. It
was that committee which drafted §§ 2 and 23 in substantially the
form appearing in the 1898 Act. See note 15, supra. Representative Ray was also a member of the House conference committee, and
it was in conference that the Act of 1898 was finally drafted and the
serious differences between the House and Senate were resolved.

under § 2 were those proceedings in which the controversy
related to property in the possession or constructive possession of the court or to property held by those asserting
no truly adverse claim."
From its inception, § 23 contained a clause seemingly
mitigating the rigors of the jurisdictional requirements imposed. A trustee, "unless by consent of the proposed defendant," could bring suit only in courts where the bankrupt could have sued. Subsequent to the Bardes case
some lower federal courts held that, even with the consent
of a defendant, some independent ground for federal jurisdiction must be present." The conflict was resolved in
Schumacher v. Beeler, supra. It was held that in § 23

ent ground for federal jurisdiction was required. The case
turned upon the meaning of the consent clause in § 23.
The remarks offered concerning § 2 were unnecessary and,
in any event, were based upon the similar statements made
in Bardes v. HawardenBank, supra.
The Beeler decision, like that in the Bardes case, does
not direct a conclusion that § 2, in the absence of §23, confers only a summary jurisdiction; for it was because of the
limitations of § 23 that plenary suits had been excluded
from the otherwise broad scope of § 2.23 Cases construing
the latter in the presence of the overriding prohibitions of
suits and could prescribe the conditions upon which the federal courts
should have jurisdiction. . . . Exercising that power, the Congress
prescribed in § 23b the condition of consent on the part of the defendant sued by the trustee." Schumacher v. Beeler, 293 U. S. 367,
374 (1934).
25 The cases decided under the 1867 Act and referred to in notes
10-11, supra, recognized the broad scope of language similar to that of
§ 2; and cases arising under the 1898 Act and decided before Bardes
v. Hawarden Bank, 178 U. S. 524 (1900), based upon § 2 the jurisdiction of the federal courts to entertain plenary suits to recover
property adversely held. See note 16, supra.
Later cases have recognized the overriding consequence of § 23.
"Section 2, clause 7, confers upon the court of bankruptcy jurisdiction
to 'cause the estates of bankrupts to be collected, reduced to money
and distributed, and determine controversies in relation thereto, except as herein otherwise provided.' But § 23-b prohibits the
trustee (with exceptions not here applicable) from prosecuting, without the consent of the proposed defendant, a suit in a court other
than that in which the bankrupt might have brought it, had bankruptcy not intervened." Kelley v. Gill, 245 U. S. 116, 119 (1917).
"There is plainly a controversy in relation to the estate of a bankrupt,
and subdivision 7 of section 2 would confer jurisdiction if it were
not for the limiting words, 'except as herein otherwise provided.'"
Lynch v. Bronson, 160 F. 139, 140 (1908). See also Lowenstein v.
Reikes, 54 F. 2d 481, 485 (1931) (dissenting opinion), and the analysis
of the interplay of §§ 2 and 23 in Ross, Federal Jurisdiction in Suits

written after the Beeler decision.

OCTOBER TERM, 1946.
Opinion of the Court.

331 U. S.

§ 23 are not persuasive in a situation where, for the first
time, § 23 has been declared inoperative.
2. To accept petitioner's reading of § 2 would produce
consequences affording peculiar explanations for the express elimination of § 23 in Chapter X cases. For one
thing, there would be destroyed the consent basis for federal jurisdiction of plenary suits brought by a trustee; 2
and, for another, diversity jurisdiction would depend upon
the citizenship of the trustee rather than upon that of the
debtor. The latter is a formal change of no obvious value,
and the former puts a greater limitation upon the jurisdiction of a Chapter X court than has been placed upon
an equity receivership, 77B, or ordinary bankruptcy court,
a result in obvious contrast to discernible trends in
reorganization law.
The committee reports and Congressional debates do not
elaborate upon the decision to eliminate § 23, and the
hearings reveal only that § 23 was one of several sections
which the National Bankruptcy Conference desired to
eliminate, and which might be held applicable if not expressly deleted. 8 However, the action occurred in the
26Schumacher

v. Beeler, 293 U. S. 367 (1934).

See p. 652 and

note 24, supra. In Tilton v. Model Taxi Corp., 112 F. 2d 86 (1940),
a 77B case, the jurisdiction of the district court to entertain a plenary
suit was based upon consent.

receivership court had dependent jurisdiction, regardless
of diversity or other independent grounds for federal jurisdiction, to hear plenary suits related to the estate of the
did not at this time explain the reasons for the suggested suspension
of § 23. He stated as follows:
"Chapter X is not intended to be self-sufficient. All provisions
of the general bankruptcy act are applicable to proceedings under
chapter X, except such provisions are inconsistent with express provisions in chapter X. Some provisions of the general act are clearly
inconsistent with the corporate reorganization provisions and are
therefore inapplicable. Other provisions are clearly applicable.
However, there are certain sections which by their nature permit of
doubt as to whether or not they are applicable. Section 64 of the
general bankruptcy act, for example, provides for a fixed priority
in the payment of claims. This section deals solely with unsecured
claims, only unsecured claims being affected by bankruptcy. To
apply it in corporate reorganizations-where secured as well as unsecured claims are dealt with-would cause great confusion. To make
it clear that section 64 does not apply, we propose this amendment
which expressly provides that 64 shall not be applicable to chapter X. The priorities under chapter X would therefore be those
used in equity receiverships. That is the present practice under 77B,
which expressly provides that section 64 shall not be applicable. When
we adopt the same provision here we merely adopt the practice which
is already in existence under section 77B.
"In this enumeration of sections and subsections which are not
applicable, we include only those as to which there may be reasonable
doubt. The sections which we enumerate are 23, 57 (h), 57 (n),
64, and 70 (f). We propose that section 102 be amended to provide
that these sections and subsections shall not. be applicable to proceedings under chapter X."
A representative of the Association of the Bar of the City of New
York also listed § 23 among those sections which "have no applicability
to a reorganization procedure." Id. at 37. And the spokesman for
the Philadelphia Court Plan Committee suggested amending § 23
to give ordinary bankruptcy courts more effective powers to deal
with fraudulently transferred or concealed assets. Id. at 26.

debtor, 9 under § 77B, which made reorganization of nonrailroad corporations a part of the bankruptcy scheme, it
was believed in some quarters that § 23 would have its
traditional effect upon the jurisdiction of federal courts to
hear plenary suits, even though the reorganization court
was given the "powers" of an equity receivership court."s
Other commentators, thinking that § 77B should not provide a less efficient procedure than the equity receivership,
considered § 23 inapplicable to 77B cases and regarded the
reorganization courts as having jurisdiction to hear plenary suits." The controversy had not been settled when
congressional committees were considering the bill which
became the Chandler Act of 1938, and such a background
for the suspension of § 23 in Chapter X cases obviously
raises no inference of a desire to restrict, rather than to
expand, the jurisdiction of the federal courts.
To interpret the elimination of § 23 in Chapter X cases
as restricting the access of the trustee to the federal courts
would not be in harmony with other provisions contemporaneously written into Chapter X and defining anew the
position and functions of the reorganization trustee. The
appointment of a disinterested trustee was made mandatory in appropriate cases,32 his qualifications were pre29 White v. Ewing, 159 U. S. 36 (1895); see Riehle v. Margolies,

intended by the elimination of § 23 to establish the jurisdiction of federal courts to hear plenary suits brought by
a reorganization trustee, even though diversity or other
usual ground for federal jurisdiction is lacking.
The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is in entire
harmony with the foregoing considerations. The language of § 2, in its ordinary sense and no longer limited by
§ 23, easily comprehends the present type of suit; and so to
hold directly and effectively subserves Congressional desires as revealed in the plain policy of Chapter X and in the
express elimination of § 23, which has, since its enactment in 1898, been viewed as a sharp restriction upon the
jurisdiction theretofore exercised by bankruptcy courts
and as a strong preference for state courts.' Since all
reorganization courts are the objects of the jurisdiction
conferred by § 2,1 the District Court for the Southern District of New York has jurisdiction to hear the present suit,
which is brought by reorganization trustees and which
charges misappropriation of the assets of a Chapter X
debtor. 2 "This seems to be the only logical conclusion to
""The Bankruptcy Act of 1898, in respect to the matters now
under consideration, was a radical departure from the act of 1867,
in the evident purpose of Congress to limit the jurisdiction of the
United States courts in respect to controversies which did not come
simply within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts as bankruptcy
courts, and to preserve, to a greater extent than the former act,
the jurisdiction of the state courts over actions which were not distinctly matters and proceedings in bankruptcy." Bush v. Elliott,

Chapter X." "'
3. Respondents in the alternative argue that the equity
receivership powers conferred by § 115" include jurisdiction to hear plenary suits and that all reorganization
courts may exercise the jurisdiction so conferred. Petitioners would, in any event, confine the effects of § 115
to the reorganization court in which the reorganization
petition has been approved. We need not pass on these
contentions; for, assuming that § 115 is jurisdictional "
jurisdiction to circuit courts over "controversies at law and in equity,"
as distinguished from "proceedings in bankruptcy," and which seems
only to have recognized the rule existing under the 1867 Act that
certain bankruptcy matters were the exclusive concern of the bankruptcy court. If "proceedings" as used in § 23 (a) denoted those
instances in which summary jurisdiction was proper, to find that
"proceedings" in § 2 has no such precise meaning simply exemplifies
the variety of ways in which "proceedings" has been employed in
the bankruptcy statute. Section 11 (e) authorizes trustees to institute "proceedings in behalf of the estate upon any claim" and refers
to "any proceeding, judicial or otherwise." And §§ 60 (b), 67 (e)
and 70 (e) speak of "proceedings" in connection with plenary. In
Chapter X itself, §§ 101 and 102 refer to "proceedings under this
chapter." This term must extend to plenary suits, for otherwise
§ 23, which deals only with plenary suits, would not be suspended
at all. Significant too is that "bankruptcy proceedings" in § 2 was
in 1938 changed to "proceedings under this Act" in order that the
jurisdiction granted by § 2 would extend to "proceedings" under the
new debtor relief chapters, including Chapter X.

and that it extends only to the primary court, jurisdiction
in the present case may still be rested upon § 2. That
section, in the absence of § 23, supports the jurisdiction
of all district courts to hear plenary suits brought by a
reorganization trustee, a result consistent with the aims
of Chapter X and with the elimination of a section which
is itself applicable to all district courts. Congress could
have carved out of § 23 only a narrow exception in favor
of the court in which the reorganization proceedings are
pending and thereby left unchanged the jurisdiction of
other courts over a trustee's plenary suits. Limited exceptions are familiar in the history of § 23. But Congress
went further and eliminated § 23 entirely in Chapter X
proceedings. Because of the countrywide ramifications
of corporate debtors placed in Chapter X reorganization,
it is as usual as not for the trustee to resort to foreign
jurisdictions for the disposition of plenary suits. Allowing the primary court to hear these suits will not change
this situation, if it is true that the process of a reorganization court does not run nationwide in plenary cases.46
662 (1941); see In re Prima Co., 98 F. 2d 952, 958 (1938). These
cases were decided after the passage of the Chandler Act and considered § 23 fully applicable in pending 77B proceedings. In Tilton v.
Model Taxi Corp., 112 F. 2d 86 (1940), § 23 was considered applicable
in § 77B proceedings so as to permit jurisdiction of the district court
to be based upon a defendant's consent. And see Thompson v.
Terminal Shares, 104 F. 2d 1 (1939), for a treatment of a similar
provision contained in § 77. On the other hand, § 115 has been
interpreted as jurisdictional. In re Cuyahoga Finance Co., 136 F. 2d
18 (1943); see Warder v. Brady, 115 F. 2d 89, 93-94 (1940). Other
courts have thought the suspension of § 23 in Chapter X cases would
give the reorganization court jurisdiction to hear plenary suits. See

Opinion of the Court.

Congressional policy would receive only limited recognition if the suspension of § 23 is interpreted as allowing
the trustee access to only the appointing court and as
restricting his access to all other district courts. 7
4. Our holding is, of course, that Congress in 1938 extended the jurisdiction of the reorganization courts beyond
that exercised by ordinary bankruptcy courts. Section 2
of the 1898 Act contained the broad language borrowed
from § 1 of the Act of 1867. But the exception to § 2
(a) (7) acknowledged the overriding limitations of § 23,
which was the embodiment of Congressional policy to
exclude from the bankruptcy courts many of the trustee's
plenary suits. That same meaningful section was expressly eliminated in 1938 in the process of perfecting
a chapter of the Bankruptcy Act dealing with the distinctive and special proceedings in corporate reorganizations.
Cf. Continental Bank v. Rock Island R. Co., 294 U. S.
648, 676 (1935). This negation of long-standing policy
should be given effect consistent with the aims of Chapter X and should not be hedged by judge-made principles
not in accord with those aims. Congress need not document its specific actions in elaborate fashion in order to
direct this Court's attention to statutory policy and purThe Chapter X cases cited in note 45, supra, did not reach the
question of whether courts other than the primary court would have
jurisdiction to hear plenary suits where the latter had jurisdiction
of such a suit but could not exercise it because of personal service
or venue difficulties. Nor did Mr. Gerdes, who construed the suspension of § 23 as establishing, by way of § 115, the jurisdiction of
the reorganization court to hear plenary suits. Gerdes, Corporate
Reorganizations: Changes Effected by Chapter X of the Bankruptcy
Act, 52 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 21 (1938). But it was his opinion even
under § 77B, where the applicability of § 23 was left in doubt, that
all reorganization courts, not just the domiciliary court, had jurisdiction to hear plenary suits brought by the trustee, even though
the usual grounds for federal jurisdiction were lacking. 2 Gerdes,

pose. The failure to provide appropriate fanfare for the
suspension of § 23 in Chapter X cases, and for the consequent expansion of federal jurisdiction, hardly invites our
opinion as to the advisability of the action which Congress
has taken. Judicial drives to limit the jurisdiction of
federal courts should not lead to decision falling short
of complete effectuation of statutory scheme. With the
limitations of § 23 suspended, § 2 confers jurisdiction upon
all reorganization courts to hear plenary suits brought by
a Chapter X trustee.
5. Petitioners insist that certain consequences, which
they term undesirable, will flow from this decision. It
is said, for example, that the state courts will automatically
be deprived of jurisdiction to hear a trustee's plenary
suits. But whether or not this and other suggested consequences will follow we leave for consideration in cases
presenting such issues for decision.

On the surface this appears to be merely a bankruptcy
case raising technical questions of federal jurisdiction.
But the answers to these questions have far-reaching import. They involve the distribution of judicial power as
between United States and State courts, and thus concern federal-state relations generally. More immediately,
inasmuch as the allowable scope of the business of the
federal courts is in controversy, a proper disposition of the
case bears upon the quality of the work of those courts and
of this Court in particular.
The Court makes a shift in the distribution of judicial
power between State and federal courts which has prevailed for half a century. Such a break with the past is

not required by what Congress has written nor by any inference drawn from disclosed Congressional policies. On
the contrary, I believe that the result reached is repelled
by every consideration relevant to the proper construction
of the statutory materials by which the jurisdiction of the
federal courts is to be determined.
In 1867 Congress granted jurisdiction to the then lower
federal courts over suits on claims owing to one whose
estate was administered in bankruptcy, though the claims
were based wholly on local law and were devoid of any
federal aspect which would give a federal court jurisdiction
were the creditor not in bankruptcy. This was another
one of those enactments of the Reconstruction period when
the influences toward expansion of federal jurisdiction
were at flood-tide. As part of the recession from this Reconstruction tendency Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act
of 1898, withdrew from the federal courts suits that rested
solely on local law even though they involved claims asserted on behalf of one whose estate was being administered in the bankruptcy court. By a tenuous process of
implication the Court now concludes that Congress,
through the Chandler Act of 1938, enlarged federal jurisdiction in one aspect of the bankruptcy law, though
neither the terms of the legislation, nor its context, nor its
legislative history, nor considerations of policy heretofore
suggested, call for such construction, while the history and
structure of the legislation, its judicial interpretation, regard for congruity in finding meaning, and the larger
claims of the federal judicial system, support a different
reading of the statute. The large assumptions of the decision are that by indirection and without manifested
design Congress reversed its prevailing policy of limiting
federal jurisdiction and preserving a proper balance between federal and State courts; that Congress deviated
from a principle of our federalism especially respected in
recent times, according to which claims arising under State

law shall be tried under local trial procedure in the local
courts; that Congress has departed from a settled policy
of fifty years uniformly applicable in bankruptcy proceedings and which now continues as to all other proceedings
in bankruptcy, although this established policy of leaving
local claims to the State courts does not at all interfere
with those aims for effective reorganization through use
of the bankruptcy power which gave rise to Chapter X.
1. The facts in this case are not in dispute. The Central States Electric Corporation filed in the District Court
for the Eastern District of Virginia a voluntary petition
for reorganization under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy
Act. With the consent of the reorganization court, respondents, as trustees, brought this suit in the District
Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf
of the Corporation for an accounting and damages against
its officers and directors for alleged fraud and mismanagement. The District Court found want of jurisdiction, but
was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 159 F. 2d 67. This Court now affirms the
Circuit Court of Appeals and holds that a Chapter X
trustee may bring this plenary suit in personam in a federal district court not the reorganization court, although
neither diversity of citizenship nor other ground of federal
jurisdiction exists.
No doubt Congress could authorize such a suit. See
Schumacher v. Beeler, 293 U. S. 367, 374. Nor is there
any doubt that Congress has not conferred upon the district courts the power to entertain such a suit by an ordinary bankruptcy trustee. Section 23 of the Bankruptcy
Act specifically limits plenary jurisdiction to a few enumerated cases (of which this is not one), or where defendant consents. The Court finds, however, that Congress,
by making § 23 inapplicable to Chapter X proceedings,
opened all the federal courts to plenary suits by a Chapter X trustee. To determine the significance of the inap-

plicability of § 23 to Chapter X proceedings it is necessary to consider the affiliations between the Bankruptcy
Act of 1898 and the Chandler Act. That in turn makes
it necessary to examine the Act of 1898 in relation to its
predecessor, the Act of 1867. These three enactmentsthe Bankruptcy Act of 1867, the Bankruptcy Act of 1898,
and the Bankruptcy Act of 1938-are an interrelated process of legislation. The role of § 23 cannot be properly
assessed merely by a textual reading, or by ascertaining its presence or absence in these three Acts. It
must be placed in the context of the history of the Act
of 1867 and of the Act of 1898, and the relation of that
history to the aims of the Chandler Act.
2. To understand the full import of the Act of 1867,
so far as now relevant, it will bear repetition that it reflected the expansionist trend in federal jurisdiction after
the Civil War. Statute after statute gave to the federal
courts jurisdiction over cases which had previously been
left entirely to State tribunals, and this Court gave a broad
construction to such statutes. The Bankruptcy Act of
1867 gave to all district and circuit courts concurrent
jurisdiction over suits "by the assignee in bankruptcy
against any person claiming an adverse interest" in the
estate. Section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 517,
518. This provision was construed in Lathrop v. Drake,
91 U. S. 516. Mr. Justice Bradley, with characteristic
clarity, distinguished between "jurisdiction as a court of
bankruptcy over the proceedings in bankruptcy ...
[and] jurisdiction, as an ordinary court of suits at law
or in equity brought by or against the assignee in reference
to alleged property of the bankrupt, or to claims alleged
to be due from or to him." 91 U. S. at 517. But the
terms of the Act were read to confer the latter jurisdiction
on the lower federal courts. It is worth noting that Mr.
Justice Bradley was a well-known exponent of expansive

331 U. S.

federal jurisdiction. See, e. g., his dissenting opinion in
Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 639.
3. The business which this broad construction of the
Act of 1867 brought to the federal courts, together with
that from other sources, led to the overburdening of their
dockets, and inevitably of the dockets of this Court, and
gave rise to the various movements for their relief. The
history of the federal courts is to a considerable measure a
history of the rise and fall of the scope of the jurisdiction
given to them by Congress. Not to take account of these
underlying factors in the construction of judiciary acts
is to leave out the meaning in the interstices of the words
of enactments. The Act of 1898 explicitly reveals the
important shift in emphasis that had taken place within
thirty years in the distribution between State and federal
courts of the judicial power at the disposal of Congress.
By 1898 the expansionist trend in federal jurisdiction
had receded. The movement was toward a curtailment
for an overburdened judiciary. The new Bankruptcy Act
also showed the recession.
The Act of 1898 was not an amendment of the Act of
1867. The latter had been repealed by the Act of June 7,
1878, 20 Stat. 99, and for twenty years there was no
federal bankruptcy Act. Accordingly, the 1898 Act is
not to be read as a modification of an existing system. It
established a scheme of bankruptcy administration where
there was none. Its framers, of course, drew on history.
They borrowed heavily from the Act of 1867. But a comparison of the jurisdictional sections of the 1898 Act with
those of its predecessor reveals the great change in the

attitude of Congress regarding the withdrawal of essentially local litigation from the State courts.

4. The shift in jurisdictional direction was duly respected when the Act of 1898 first came here for construction. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice
Gray pointed out the marked structural differences be-

WILLIAMS v. AUSTRIAN.
642

FRANKFURTER,

J., dissenting.

tween the Act of 1898 and that of 1867. The latter
granted summary jurisdiction to the district court in
§ 1; plenary jurisdiction was conferred by § 2 on district
and circuit courts concurrently of "suits, at law or in
equity, between the assignee in bankruptcy and an adverse claimant . . . ." The Act of 1898 took over § 1 of
the Act of 1867, and discarded § 2. Section 2 of the Act of
1898, derived from § 1 of the 1867 Act, confers only summary jurisdiction. Plenary jurisdiction was not conferred
by the Act of 1898 on either the district or circuit courts
except to the very limited extent granted by § 23.
Such was the construction of the Act of 1898 made
almost contemporaneously with its enactment. Bardes
v. Hawarden Bank, 178 U. S. 524. This construction was
reaffirmed thirty-four years later by a unanimous Court,
speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Hughes. Schumacher
v. Beeler, supra.
5. This recognition of the drastic difference between
the two Acts was not drawn merely from the inert words
of the statutes. The words expressed the great differences of outlook, to which reference has been made, in regard to the transfer to the federal courts of what is
essentially State litigation. This Court found the accent
of the Act of 1867 to be on enforcement through "national
tribunals." The matter was put quite plainly by Mr.
Justice Bradley. "The State courts may undoubtedly be
resorted to in cases of ordinary suits for the possession of
property or the collection of debts; and it is not to be presumed that embarrassments would be encountered in
those courts in the way of a prompt and fair administration
of justice. But a uniform system of bankruptcy, national
in its character, ought to be capable of execution in the
national tribunals, without dependence upon those of the
States in which it is possible that embarrassments might
arise." Lathrop v. Drake,supra, at 518.

331 U. S.

The outlook of the Act of 1898 as to proceedings not in
bankruptcy "properly so called," Bardes v. Hawarden
Bank, 178 U. S. 524, 533, was precisely the opposite. The
emphasis was not on uniform enforcement through "national tribunals." Concern was with "the greater economy and convenience of litigants and witnesses" by
leaving the determination of what intrinsically are merely
local questions to the "local courts of the State." Bardes
v. Hawarden Bank, supra, at 538. The Court again referred to this purpose of the 1898 Act when it gave full
reconsideration to the legislation in Schumacher v. Beeler,
supra,at 374. Emphasis was placed on the importance of
ready accessibility to litigants afforded by local courts as
against the inconvenience often entailed in bringing suitors to the federal courts, particularly in Western States.
By reference to an earlier decision in which that consideration was treated as a controlling factor, the Court indicated
a guiding principle in deciding questions of doubtful
jurisdiction. See Shoshone Mining Company v. Rutter,
177 U. S. 505, 511, 513, cited in Bardes v. HawardenBank,
at 538.
6. But we are now told that the Bardes and Schumacher
cases misconstrued the Act of 1898 and its relation to
that of 1867. The opinions of Mr. Justice Gray and
Mr. Chief Justice Hughes were, according to this view, the
products of misreading of judicial history and of a faulty
analysis of the Act of 1898. Indeed, the foundation of
the decision of the court below and of the argument at
the bar of this Court is the claim that the construction
placed upon the jurisdictional Act of 1898 by the Bardes

dialectics. The fact of the matter is that it was rationally
relevant to the problem calling for adjudication in the
Bardes cases to consider comprehensively the relation of
the Act of 1898 to that of 1867. The view that was taken
had the strength that comes not only from a unanimous
Court but one contemporaneous with the legislation under
scrutiny. And when the construction so placed upon an
Act is reaffirmed thirty-four years later by a Court particularly strong in Justices who had had extensive experience in commercial law, it seems pretty late in the day
to suggest that such weighty constructions by this Court
are now to be found wrong.1 The court below was driven
to this drastic undertaking. For if § 2 of the Act of 1898
is the source solely of summary proceedings in bankruptcy,
and jurisdiction for plenary suits, to a limited extent, was
granted solely by § 23, the elimination of § 23 for purposes
of Chapter X cannot serve to put into § 2 a plenary jurisdiction which was never there.
7. To reexamine the ground covered in the Bardes and
Schumacher cases would, as it seems to me, be a work of
supererogation. And so I will content myself with some
observations pertinent to a proper view of the Act of 1898
as an entirety. The different features of an organic statute
1 In

view of his extensive commercial experience on matters of

bankruptcy, any observation by Mr. Justice Brandeis carries great
weight. But neither in Kelley v. Gill, 245 U. S. 116, nor elsewhere,
did he state that § 2 of the Bankruptcy Act was a grant of plenary
jurisdiction to all the courts and that § 23 merely operated as a
curtailment of such grant. What is significant is that when, in Schu-

macher v. Beeler, supra, upon a full dress consideration of the problem, a contrary analysis was made, Mr. Justice Brandeis joined
in it.
In another bankruptcy case, this Court said: "Only compelling
language in the statute itself would warrant the rejection of a construction so long and so generally accepted, especially where overturn-

ing the established practice would have such far reaching consequences
as in the present instance."

are not discrete parts. They cast light upon each other and
illumine the whole. The Act of 1898 was read as it was by
this Court because it established a comprehensive bankruptcy scheme. Sections 2 and 23 were read in combination, for they drew a sharp line between "proceedings in
bankruptcy" and plenary "suits at law or in equity." For
fifty years it has been the policy of Congress that a bankruptcy trustee bringing an action like that before us should
sue in a State court. (This, of course, includes a federal
court sitting in the State where there is diversity of citizenship. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64; Guaranty
Trust Company v. York, 326 U. S. 99.) Howsoever any
section of the Act of 1898 might have been read had it
existed by itself, on a view of the Act as an entirety it was
settled that summary proceedings may be brought in any
federal court, whereas plenary suits at law and in equity,
distinguished as such from proceedings in bankruptcy, can
be brought only where they could have been brought
between the bankrupt and the opposing party had there
been no bankruptcy. Section 2 had an intrinsically limited scope in its setting with § 23. The scope continues
so limited and does not automatically expand because
§ 23 is pro tanto eliminated.
This jurisdictional differentiation was not a matter of
Congressional whim or judicial technicality. It was easy
for this Court to discern that the object of Congress "may
well have been to leave such controversies to be tried
and determined, for the most part, in the local courts
of the State, to the greater economy and convenience of
litigants and witnesses." Bardes v. Hawarden Bank,
supra, at 538; Schumacher v. Beeler, supra, at 374. Congress saw good reason for not infringing on the ordinary
jurisdiction of State courts where a suit is not really part
of the bankruptcy proceedings. It chose to leave such
litigation to the appropriate local practice and local rules

concerning jury trial in the local court, and at the same
time to relieve thereby an overworked federal judiciary.
8. These important considerations touching the interplay of State and federal courts as well as the effective
administration of justice in the federal courts have not
lost force with time. Congress has continued to recognize their validity. As to bankruptcy trustees generally,
the Act of 1938 continues to require that local suits like
the present be brought in local courts. And in preparing
for the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives an analysis of a predecessor bill introduced by Mr.
Chandler, the National Bankruptcy Conference indicated
that the considerations relevant to a proper distribution
of business as between State and federal courts which
underlay the restrictive policy of the Act of 1898 were
more than ever applicable:
"In Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, 264 U. S.
426, Mr. Justice Brandeis declared obiter that Congress had power to confer on a bankruptcy court
jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights of trustees to
property not in possession of the bankruptcy court,
either actually or constructively, but adversely held
by a third person; but that Congress had not as yet
exercised that power, or conferred such jurisdiction
under any of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.
"The proceedings of Congress prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Law of 1898 show that the
exercise of that power was deliberately withheld,
because of the fear of flooding the federal courts with
a large volume of new litigation. That motive is
even stronger today [1936] than it was in 1898, and
for that reason we do not consider it wise to enlarge
the jurisdiction at this time; except as indicated to
include receivers and so-called 'debtor proceedings.' "

The indicated exceptions do not touch the jurisdiction
here asserted. Yet the Court now concludes that as to
Chapter X trustees Congress implied an exception so as
to allow the trustee to sue in any federal district court
in the country. If this be so, I see no escape from the
conclusion that not only have the federal courts jurisdiction but the State courts no longer have it. Consideration of so destructive a consequence ought not to be
postponed as though it were not immediately relevant to
the proper construction of the legislation before us. If
such suits are "bankruptcy proceedings" ' within the
jurisdictional grant of § 2-for it is necessary to find in
some language an explicit grant of jurisdiction, and only
§ 2 is invoked-how can the bankruptcy aspect of
the proceeding evaporate when it comes to "matters
and proceedings in bankruptcy" as to which "The jurisdiction vested in the courts of the United States ...
shall be exclusive of the courts of the several States"?
Rev. Stat. § 711, Judicial Code, § 256, 28 U. S. C. § 371.
No support can be found for this shifting attribution of
meaning to the same concept in the history of proceedings
under the Act of 1867. To be sure, it was held under
that Act that the State courts were not deprived of jurisdiction of such plenary suits. But that was so for the
conclusive reason that the provision making federal jurisdiction exclusive in bankruptcy proceedings came into the
law much later than the Act of 1867. Federal exclusiveness as to bankruptcy proceedings formally so-called was
brought in by § 711 of the Revised Statutes of 1874. During the few years within which the Bankruptcy Act of 1867
coexisted with the requirement of exclusiveness of jurisdiction in the federal courts, the occasion did not arise for
applying the provision excluding the State courts. But
this Court was well aware of the problem and carefully put

it to one side. See Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 133,
and Wilson v. Goodrich, 154 U. S. 640. Intrinsically, that
question now presses for decision. If plenary suits are
"bankruptcy proceedings" within § 2 of the Act of 1898,
as the Court holds, how do they cease to be "proceedings
in bankruptcy" as to which the federal courts have jurisdiction "exclusive" of the jurisdiction of the several
States? ' Only a forced disharmony can avoid the grievous consequences of a construction equally forced as to
the relations between §§ 2 and 23 of the Act of 1898.
9. The Court finds a reversal in the policy of contraction of federal jurisdiction which began with the end of
the Reconstruction era, found expression in cases culminating in Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U. S. 109,
and undoubtedly furnished the momentum for the radical
reversal of historic policy initiated by ErieR. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64. The Court extends the jurisdiction
of the federal courts and, I cannot escape concluding,
withdraws it from the State courts. It resolves whatever
ambiguity may be found in § 102 of Chapter X by interpolating an exception which effects a break with the past
and creates difficulties for the future. One would naturally expect that such an innovation in a matter of vital
concern to the scope of federal jurisdiction, with its resulting effect upon the relations between the State and federal
courts, would be explicitly stated and not depend for
discovery upon intricate exegesis. One would suppose
that some indication at least of Congressional awareness of the problem could be found. Diligence of counsel
has not unearthed the remotest hint that such shift
in jurisdiction was contemplated or that the need for
it was asserted. Our own investigation has been equally
fruitless. There is nothing in Chapter X, in its terms,

its antecedents, its history, its advocacy, that gives the
remotest hint of a purpose calling for a different policy
for reorganization trustees in this respect from other trustees in bankruptcy, or any intimation that the district
courts, other than the particular reorganization court,
would play a special role as to plenary suits in reorganization proceedings. Nor do the purposes of the Chandler
Act bear upon this aspect of jurisdiction. Chapter X provided new facilities for reorganization of bankrupt estates
and extended the scope of reorganizations. But it is
hardly relevant to the purpose of easier and more comprehensive methods of reorganization to establish a claim
through the federal courts rather than the State courts
when the basis of recovery is State law, calling for application of State law and procedure. The Court draws
support for its conclusion from the fact that other powers
are conferred upon the Chapter X trustee which were
not possessed by other bankruptcy trustees. But the
powers to which attention is called are all explicitly conferred and are not derived by roundabout inference. And
unlike the extension of jurisdiction here claimed, the additional powers conferred on the trustee all bear directly
upon the very process of reorganization and the purposes
for which Chapter X was designed.
The result has been spun largely out of words in the
Act of 1898 by disregarding the controlling facts of its
history and its long judicial and practical construction.
The other source from which the argument is spun is the
provision making § 23 inapplicable to proceedings under
Chapter X. As we have seen, our decisions ruled
that § 23 was not an exception to § 2 but an emphasis of
the limited scope of § 2, together with a grant, of little importance, of consent jurisdiction.' If § 2 did not grant

jurisdiction to the district courts over a plenary suit like
the one before us, merely eliminating § 23 could add no
new head of jurisdiction to § 2. And yet the Court finds
that the purpose of making § 23 inapplicable to Chapter X
was to throw all the federal courts open to plenary suits in
Chapter X proceedings, although, as we have seen, not
a clear expression either of such purpose, or an assessment
of its consequences, is to be found in all the literature
on this subject prior to this litigation. If a perfectly.
reasonable explanation can be given to the elimination
of § 23 from Chapter X proceedings, we ought not
lightly to attribute to Congress a radical change affecting
the jurisdiction of the federal courts, without even an
indirect mention of the need or desirability for such a
change in the thousands of pages of legislative hearings,
debates, and reports on the various bills leading up to
the Chandler Act.
10. There is an adequate explanation for the provision
making § 23 inapplicable that amply accounts for it, without using it as a springboard for a wholly unforeseen
result out of harmony with established jurisdictional
considerations.
The provision to make § 23 inapplicable did not appear
in the earlier drafts of Chapter X and was not in the bill
as it came from the House. It came into the Act
through amendments proposed before the Judiciary Committee of the Senate by the National Bankruptcy Conference through its spokesman, Mr. John Gerdes. His
statement is all we have by way of legislative history for
matter. In resolving what is at best a jurisdictional ambiguity a
result which closes the doors of the federal courts to consenting parties
is of minor consequence compared with opening wide the door to a
jurisdiction theretofore barred to the federal courts, when Congress
manifested no consciousness of such a new grant of jurisdiction.

the amendment.' It will be noted that Mr. Gerdes
intimated nothing regarding the need for extending
federal jurisdiction, nothing of the desirability of granthearings before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee
on the Judiciary, on H. R. 8046, 75th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 77:
"Chapter X is not intended to be self-sufficient. All provisions
of the general bankruptcy act are applicable to proceedings under
chapter X, except such provisions are inconsistent with express provisions in chapter X. Some provisions of the general act are clearly
inconsistent with the corporate reorganization provisions and are
therefore inapplicable. Other provisions are clearly applicable.
However, there are certain sections which by their nature permit of
doubt as to whether or not they are applicable. Section 64 of the
general bankruptcy act, for example, provides for a fixed priority
in the payment of claims. This section deals solely with unsecured
claims, only unsecured claims being affected by bankruptcy. To
apply it in corporate reorganizations-where secured as well as unsecured claims are dealt with-would cause great confusion. To make
it clear that section 64 does not apply, we propose this amendment
which expressly provides that 64 shall not be applicable to chapter X. The priorities under chapter X would therefore be those
used in equity receiverships. That is the present practice under 77B,
which expressly provides that section 64 shall not be applicable. When
we adopt the same provision here we merely adopt the practice which
is already in existence under section 77B.
"In this enumeration of sections and subsections which are not
applicable, we include only those as to which there may be reasonable
doubt. The sections which we enumerate are 23, 57 (h), 57 (n),
64, and 70 (f). We propose that section 102 be amended to provide
that these sections and subsections shall not be applicable to proceedings under chapter X."
Another amendment, proposed to the Committee by Mr. Heuston,
representing the Special Committee on Bankruptcy of the Association
of the Bar of the City of New York, would have made inapplicable
to Chapter X some thirty sections of the Act, among them § 23.
"The proposed amendment excludes from a reorganization procedure
all sections now expressly excluded by section 77B, subdivision (k), as
well as many additional sections which have no applicability to a reorganization procedure." The statement makes no reference to plenary
suits. "The sections excluded by the proposed amendment, include

ing plenary jurisdiction to all federal courts, nothing
to the effect that a Chapter X trustee needed such
greater freedom, nothing to indicate that the plan of
that Chapter required a different rule as to ordinary
plenary suits from that which was reaffirmed as to suits
by other bankruptcy trustees. Yet the court below
seemed to find in his statement warrant for its result.
And it sought to reenforce its conclusion by appeal to
an article by Mr. Gerdes elucidating the Chandler Act
after its passage. Gerdes, Corporate Reorganizations:
Changes Effected by Chapter X of the Reorganization
Act, 52 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 21.
The Circuit Court of Appeals, it seems to me, finds in
Mr. Gerdes' observations what he did not put into them.
Nowhere is there the remotest suggestion that in this
roundabout and undisclosed way he sought to throw all
litigation by or against a reorganization trustee into federal courts, other than the reorganization court, because
the federal courts might be a more convenient forum. He
was concerned with various provisions, of which § 23 was
one, which either were intrinsically in conflict with the new
provisions of Chapter X or might be deemed to be in conflict with them. He used the terms "inconsistent" and
"not applicable" interchangeably. He was concerned
with removing all limitations in the existing Bankruptcy
Act that were inconsistent with provisions in Chapter X,
limitations which might impair the new scheme for bankruptcy reorganization. While Mr. Gerdes was not explicit
as to possible inconsistency between § 23 and Chapter X,

the Chandler Act, and with which he was thoroughly
familiar, fully explains why Mr. Gerdes deemed it desirable that § 23 be made inapplicable to Chapter X.
The matter in controversy was this. Section 77B (a)
granted the reorganization court the power possessed by
an equity court with regard to equity receiverships. The
question arose whether a 77B trustee could bring a plenary
suit in the reorganization court without regard to diversity
citizenship, as could an equity receiver in his home court.
White v. Ewing, 159 U. S. 36. That the reorganization
court had such jurisdiction and that § 23 was no bar, was
Mr. Gerdes' view. But other bankruptcy specialists and
some lower federal courts were of opinion that § 23 precluded such suits. Compare 2 Gerdes, Corporate Reorganizations, 1478, with Finletter, Principles of Corporate
Reorganization, 186-87; and see In re Standard Gas &
Electric Co., 119 F. 2d 658; Tilton v. Model Taxi Corp.,
112 F. 2d 86; In re Prima Co., 98 F. 2d 952.
To remove doubt as to this effect of § 23, namely its
possible limitation upon the power of the reorganization
trustee to sue in his home court, is the full purpose and
scope of its elimination from Chapter X. It was not to
give the reorganization trustee roving authority for
plenary suits in all federal courts that § 23 was made inapplicable. It was a desire to remove the danger that
§ 23 might be deemed to deprive a reorganization trustee
of the power which he ought to have in his reorganization
court, that was implicit in the short statement of Mr.
Gerdes on behalf of the National Bankruptcy Conference.
It is this purpose that prevailed and it is. this purpose
that should be enforced, and not a radical departure upsetting the distribution of jurisdiction between State and
federal courts, for which there is not a vestige of a claim by
anybody in the history that led up to the legislation. The
article of Mr. Gerdes to which the court below refers seems
to leave no doubt as to the limited purpose of making

§ 23 inapplicable.

J., dissenting.

"The bankruptcy provision restricting

plenary jurisdiction," he wrote, "has been expressly ex-

cluded from application so that the equity receivership
jurisdiction over plenary actions which are ancillary to

the main proceedings is still available, even though the

controversy involves less than $3,000 and even though
there is no diversity of citizenship." 52 Harv. L. Rev. 1,
21.6 Section 23 was eliminated, then, to make clear that
when in § 115 of the Act of 1938 Congress gave to the
reorganization court equity powers like those which had

been conferred in § 77B (a), it authorized the trusteereceiver to bring plenary suits in his home court. Such
also is the view of another important witness in the hearings on the Chandler Bill, see Weinstein, The Bankruptcy Law of 1938, pp. 63-64, 193-94.

language susceptible of them, but this only serves to indicate that on
such tenuous materials ought not to be based a reversal of jurisdictional policy of far-reaching import.
It is worthy of note that Mr. Gerdes in his article cites as the effect
of the elimination of § 23 only the clarification of the jurisdiction of
the reorganization court itself over plenary suits. He does not note
any expansion of the jurisdiction of the other district courts although,
under § 77B, when § 23 was not made expressly inapplicable, it had
been his view that other district courts would have plenary jurisdiction
as ancillary to the receivership jurisdiction of the reorganization court.

finding that Congress, by implication and indirection,
without comment or discussion, changed the meaning
which this Court had given to its legislation for fifty years,
and expanded a federal jurisdiction which is already overburdened and which Congress has tended to contract;
that it upset the relation between federal and State courts
which demands that, even in bankruptcy, claims created
by State law be litigated in local courts, applying local
law under local rules of procedure and trial practice, "to
the greater economy and convenience of litigants and
witnesses."
11. This decision overturns the analysis which has
guided the Court in construing the distribution of jurisdiction between the federal and State courts which Congress devised by the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and attributes to the Act of 1938 a big change in this distribution,
although there is not a glimmer of a hint in its entire legislative history that Congress was aware that it was doing
so. Important shifts in jurisdiction ought to be the
product of something more persuasive than what is made
to appear as a fit of Congressional absent-mindedness. It
ought not to be deemed natural that Congress took from
the State courts long-established jurisdiction and transferred it to the federal courts, when there is nothing to
indicate that Congress wanted to do so or knew that it
was doing it.
When Congress has not, by plain language, extended
the jurisdiction of the district courts which are the feeders
of the Circuit Courts of Appeals and of this Court, an
unexpressed purpose to swell the dockets of the federal
judiciary ought not to be attributed to Congress by considering in isolation the desirability of allowing a particular
class of litigation to be brought in a federal court. Any
advantage of giving jurisdiction to the federal courts must
be balanced against the disadvantages of taking away
from the State courts causes of action rooted in State law.

And in considering the advantages of absorption by the
federal courts of jurisdiction theretofore vested in the
State courts, it should be our special concern to be mindful
that the district courts are part of a single judicial system.
Increase in the scope of the business of the district courts
inevitably reflects itself in the business of the Circuit
Courts of Appeals and of this Court. It is a truism, but
vital to keep in mind, that increase in the quantity of the
Court's business affects the quality of its work.'

Chief Justice Taft that the Judiciary Act of February 13, 1925, 43
Stat. 936, was passed to enable the Court to keep its business within
manageable limits by cutting off the flow of litigation at its various
sources. The total number of petitions for certiorari is the most
significant index of the Court's business. In the 1927 Term, the
first Term during which the influence of the Act of 1925 was fully
operative, the total number of such petitions was 587. In the 1946
Term, through June 9, 1947, 1,144 such petitions were considered.
Since most of the petitions come from the lower federal courts, any
enlargement of their jurisdiction is inevitably reflected in attempts
to review those courts here. If it be suggested that the volume of
business that will flow from the new head of jurisdiction established
by this decision is in itself not likely to be very heavy, it is pertinent
to say that it is true of the Court's business also that many a mickle

TO THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 733. Argued May 2, 1947.-Decided June 16, 1947.
A natural gas company subject to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, 52
Stat. 821, produces some gas and purchases some gas, which it
mingles and conducts through a system of field, branch and main
lines (all within a single state) into its main trunk line, whence it
is sold to interstate pipeline companies for transportation, resale
and ultimate consumption in other states. The entire movement
from the wells to the purchasing companies, through their compression pumps and across the state lines is a continuous process
without interruption for storage, processing or any other purpose.
Held: The Federal Power Commission has jurisdiction under § 1 (b)
of the Natural Gas Act to regulate such sales. Pp. 686-693.
(a) Such sales are "in interstate commerce" within the meaning
of § 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act. Pp. 687-689.
(b) They are not within the clause of § 1 (b) which excepts
"the production or gathering" of natural gas from the Commission's
regulatory jurisdiction. Pp. 689-693.
