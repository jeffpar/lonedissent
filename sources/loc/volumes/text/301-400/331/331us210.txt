delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Commissioner assessed deficiencies against respondents for failure to report as 1940 income dividends
paid to them on stock of Crandall-McKenzie & Henderson, Inc., which respondents had bought earlier in that
year.' These dividends are taxable as income to the respondents if the corporation paid them out of its earnings and profits. Int. Rev. Code §§ 22 (a), 115 (a), (b).
Since its organization in 1928, the corporation had not accumulated earnings and profits sufficient to pay the 1940
dividend in full.2 But the Commissioner found that the
1 The

Tax Court incorporated by reference a fact stipulation of

the parties as its finding of fact. Each of the respondents had bought
10,000 shares of the 38,922 shares of the corporation then outstanding.
The dividends declared in 1940 amounted to $35,166.25, of which
each of the taxpayers received $12,500.
2 At one point in the stipulation it was indicated that the new corporation had "no earnings or profits accumulated from December 4,

two old corporations which were merged in 1928 to form
this new corporation had at that time, and turned over to
the new corporation, accumulated earnings and profits sufficient to cover these dividends. One of these old corporations, L. Henderson & Sons, Inc., had about $75,000 in
earnings and profits accumulated since 1913; the other,
Crandall-McKenzie Company, had about $330,000.
Liability of respondents for these deficiencies depends
upon whether the new corporation acquired and retained
a sufficient amount of these earnings and profits of its
predecessors to cover the 1940 dividends.
The 1928 merger took place under the following circumstances. Stockholders of Henderson and certain stockholders of Crandall-McKenzie agreed together with a firm of
underwriters to effect a merger of the two corporations into
a new one. The underwriters agreed to buy for cash 52%
of the stock of the new corporation for public sale. In execution of this agreement the new corporation was formed
and acquired all the assets of Henderson and Crandall-McKenzie. The six stockholders of Henderson accepted stock
in the new corporation as full payment for surrendering
their old company stock. Holders of nearly one-half of the
stock of old Crandall-McKenzie did not accept new corporation stock but were paid some $355,000 in cash for their
old stock.' The other old Crandall-McKenzie stockholders
1928 to December 31, 1939," and no earnings or profits in the taxable
year 1940. But elsewhere in the stipulation it appears there may
have been some $32,000 earnings and profits accumulated between
1928 and 1940. The Tax Court apparently did not resolve these
contradictory statements.
3 Some of the Crandall-McKenzie stockholders were paid $356.00
plus per share; others were paid $315.53 per share for identical

stock.
A part of the old Crandall-McKenzie stock for which cash was paid
was bought for $300,000 cash by one old Crandall-McKenzie stockholder from another while the reorganization was being transacted.
The stockholder who made this purchase thereupon surrendered his

were satisfied to accept only new corporation stock.
When the reorganization was complete the new corporation stock had been distributed as follows: 14,607 shares
to old Crandall-McKenzie stockholders, 9,524 shares to
old Henderson stockholders, and 25,869 shares to the general public through the participating underwriters.
The Tax Court found that there was a failure of proof
that the earnings and profits of the old corporations had
been distributed in 1928. Relying upon the rule of Commissioner v. Sansome, 60 F. 2d 931, which, for tax purposes, treats a reorganized corporation as but a continuation of its predecessors, the Tax Court determined that
the new corporation acquired all the earnings and profits
of its predecessors in 1928. Then, without analyzing the
earnings and distribution history of the new corporation
after its inception in 1928 and prior to the 1940 distribution, the Tax Court concluded that the new corporation's
accumulated earnings and profits were sufficient in 1940
to make the questioned dividends taxable to respondents
as income. 5 T. C. 108. The Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit reversed, 157 F. 2d 132, following its
earlier decision in Campbell v. United States, 144 F. 2d 177,
which had narrowly limited the Sansome rule. The
theory of the Campbell decision, so far as relevant to the
only question directly presented here, was that change
in ownership brought about by the participation of new
investors in the reorganization made the new corporation
such an entirely different entity that it could not properly
be called, even for tax purposes, a continuation of its
original Crandall-McKenzie holdings, together with his recently purchased shares, to the new corporation in exchange for shares in the
new corporation and $300,000 cash. We do not decide whether the
sale from one old stockholder to another represents a transaction
separate from the reorganization. Whatever may be the ultimate
significance of this point, it does not affect the result we reach here.

predecessors.4 Thus, it was concluded, earnings and
profits of the predecessors were not acquired by the new
corporation.
We granted certiorari because of an alleged conflict with
the Sansome rule. 329 U. S. 709. In the state of the record presented we find it necessary to decide no more than
whether the distinction of the Sansome rule made by
the Campbell case is correct.
A basic principle of the income tax laws has long been
that corporate earnings and profits should be taxed when
they are distributed to the stockholders who own the distributing corporation. See Int. Rev. Code §§ 22, 115 (a),
(b). The controlling revenue acts in question, however,
exempt from taxation distributions of stock and money
distributions, at least in part, made pursuant to a reorganization such as transpired here in 1928. See Revenue Act
of 1928, § 112 (b), (c), (i) (1) (A); § 115 (c), (h), 45
Stat. 791, 816-818, 822-823. Thus unless those earnings
and profits accumulated by the predecessor corporations
and undistributed in this reorganization are deemed to
have been acquired by the successor corporation and taxable upon distribution by it, they would escape the taxation which Congress intended. See § 112 (h), Revenue
Act of 1928; Murchison'sEstate v. Commissioner,76 F. 2d
641; United States v. Kauffmann, 62 F. 2d 1045.
In Commissioner v. Sansome, supra, it was held that
implicit in the tax exemption of reorganization distributions was the understanding that the earnings and profits
4 There were two independent grounds for the decision in the Campbell case. One ground was that the earnings and profits of the
predecessor corporation there had actually been distributed in the
course of the reorganization. The Circuit Court of Appeals stated
expressly that it did not rest its decision in the instant case on this
theory.

so exempt were acquired by the new corporation and were
taxable as income to stockholders when subsequently distributed. Congress has repeatedly expressed its approval
of the so-called Sansome rule as a correct interpretation of
the purpose of the tax laws governing reorganizations.5
And Congress has apparently been satisfied with Treasury
Regulations which follow the Sansome doctrine.'
Of course, when, as in the Sansome case, all the stockholders of the old corporation swap all their old stock
for identical proportions of the new, there can be no
doubt that the earnings and profits of the old have not
been distributed and are passed on to the successor
corporation. But if the predecessors' earnings and profits
are not distributed in the course of the reorganization,
they do not disappear simply because the successor corporation has some assets and owners in addition to those
of the old corporation or corporations. See Putnam v.
United States, 149 F. 2d 721, 726. The congressional
purpose to tax all stockholders who receive distributions of corporate earnings and profits cannot be frustrated by any reorganization which leaves earnings
and profits undistributed in whole or in part. Insofar

the Revenue Act of 1936 cited the Sansome case with approval. It

clarity." S. Rep. No. 2156, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. (1936) 19. See

as accumulated earnings and profits have been distributed
contemporaneously with the reorganization so as to become taxable to the distributees, they, of course, cannot
be said to have been acquired by the successor corporation.
But insofar as payments to the predecessor corporations
or their stockholders do not actually represent taxable
distributions of earnings and profits, those earnings and
profits must be deemed to have become available for taxable distribution by the successor corporation.
It would be inappropriate for us to make the factual
analysis of this record necessary to trace the earnings and
profits involved in the 1928 reorganization in the absence
of such a determination by the Tax Court and review by
the Circuit Court of Appeals. See Helvering v. Rankin,
295 U. S. 123, 131-132; Helvering v. Safe Deposit & Trust
Co., 316 U. S. 56, 66-67; Commissionerv. Scottish American Investment Co., 323 U. S. 119, 124. It might be that
upon a full factual analysis the Tax Court would conclude
that the new corporation acquired and had retained earnings and profits of Henderson sufficient to cover the 1940
distribution. Or the Tax Court may find it necessary to
make further analysis of the 1928 distributions to Crandall-McKenzie's old stockholders. In this connection it
is urged that the cash paid for part of the Crandall-McKenzie stock in 1928 constituted a taxable distribution of
some or all of the accumulated earnings and profits. The
Tax Court, however, has previously declined to consider
these cash payments as such a distribution of earnings and
profits in the absence of proof that the recipients had been
taxed for them. But even if it were proved that old Crandall-McKenzie stockholders had been so taxed, the face
amount of that tax would not necessarily reflect the earnings and profits distribution they received. For example,
part or all of their tax may have represented capital gain as

COMMISSIONER v. MUNTER.

Opinion of the Court.

distinguished from earnings and profits. 7 Or the distribution may be found to have constituted a liquidation under
§ 115 of the Revenue Act of 1928.8 It may be necessary on
remand, therefore, for the Tax Court to consider, in the
light of §§ 112 (c) and 115 of the Revenue Act of 1928, how
much, if any, of the 1928 cash distribution to CrandallMcKenzie stockholders represented earnings and profits
deductible from the earnings and profits transferred
to the new corporation available for the 1940 dividend
payments.
The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed
with directions that the cause be remanded to the Tax
Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
So ordered.

'Section 112 (c) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1928 provides in effect
if a cash or property distribution is made in the course of a reorganization "then the gain, if any, to the recipient shall be recognized, but in
an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market
value of such other property." But § 112 (c) (2) makes taxable as
dividend income that portion of the gain which represents the distributee's share of the distributing corporation's earnings and profits.
8 Section 115 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1928 governs the taxability
of distributions in liquidation.
