Opinion of the Court.

RYAN v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 12.

Argued October 14, 1964.-Decided November 23, 1964.

Government need not show probable cause for suspecting fraud in
order to examine taxpayer's records for closed years. United
States v. Powell, ante, p. 48, followed. P. 62.
320 F. 2d 500, affirmed.

William R. Bagby argued the cause and filed briefs for
petitioner.
Bruce J. Terris argued the cause for the United States.
On the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Acting Assistant
Attorney General Jones, Joseph M. Howard and Norman
Sepenuk.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In August 1961, Internal Revenue Agent Whelan
issued a summons to taxpayer Ryan ordering him to produce his books for the years 1942 through 1953 inclusive.
Ryan appeared but refused to produce the records, claiming that because tax liability for those years was long
since barred except for fraud,1 the agent had no right to
examine the records unless he could show grounds for
suspecting fraud.
The Government then instituted an enforcement proceeding in a federal district court pursuant to § 7402 (b)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.2 The complaint
alleged that on the basis of estimated net worth calcula'I. R. C., § 6501. See United States v. Powell, decided today,
ante, p. 48, at p. 49, note 2.

Opinion of the Court.

tions the agent strongly suspected fraud, and that examination of the records for the years in question was relevant
and material in determining its existence. The taxpayer
answered, putting the question of probable cause in issue,
and, in addition, stating that he had not received the
letter required by § 7605 (b) informing him that the
Secretary or his delegate had determined the examination
to be necessary.'
At the hearing the District Judge clearly indicated his
opinion that the Government need not show probable
cause for suspecting fraud, and ordered Ryan to produce
those records which he had available. Although the
hearing confirmed Ryan's assertion that no "necessity
letter" had been sent to him, the judge made no mention
of this, probably because counsel did not press the point.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, 320 F. 2d 500, on the
theory that no full-scale showing of probable cause need
be made. Except for the records relating to the year
1945, which appeared to have been once previously examined, the court ruled that no necessity letter was required
by § 7605 (b) because the Government had made no
previous examination of those years.
We granted certiorari, 376 U. S. 904, on the only issue
raised by petitioner, whether the Government must show
4
probable cause for its examination of the records. On
that issue we sustain the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the reasons given in United States v. Powell,
decided today, ante, p. 48.

See id., at p. 52.
The propriety of the court's interpretation of the necessity letter
requirement of § 7605 (b) is, therefore, not before us. See Trailmobile Co. v. Whirls, 331 U. S. 40, 48.
