PER CURIAM.

The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The
judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals is reversed.
In this action under the Federal Employers' Liability
Act, 45 U. S. C. ยง 51 et seq., the petitioner was awarded
damages by a jury in the Superior Court of Baltimore
City. The Court of Appeals held that the issue of employer negligence should not have been submitted to the
jury and that the trial court erred in denying the motions
of the railroad for a directed verdict and for a judgment
n. o. v., 235 Md. 568, 202 A. 2d 348.

open elevator shaft he fell into the shaft and one of the
railroad's forklift trucks fell in on top of him. The crucial fact question in the case concerned the forklift truck.
There was testimony that the petitioner had mounted
the truck and backed it into the shaft. There was also
evidence, however, which, if believed by the jury, would
support a finding that the operator assigned to use the
truck negligently left it unattended, and that it rolled
toward the petitioner, either because it was not secured or
because it was set in motion by an unauthorized third person, and struck petitioner in the back, propelling him into
the shaft. In these circumstances, the Court of Appeals
improperly invaded the function and province of the jury.

concurring.

I continue to hold the views first expressed in my separate opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 352 U. S.
500, 559-562, and frequently reiterated since: * (1) cases
of this kind are not the proper business of this Court;
(2) once accepted for review, however, by the votes of at
least four members of the Court, I deem it my duty to
participate in their decision. On this basis I join the
opinion of the Court.
MR.

JUSTICE STEWART,

concurring.

I share the views of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN. See Sentilles v. Inter-CaribbeanShipping Corp., 361 U. S. 107,
