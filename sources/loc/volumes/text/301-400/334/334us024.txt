ET AL.

NO. 290. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.*
Argued January 15-16,1948.-Decided May 3,1948.
1. Covenants incorporated in private conveyances of real estate in
the District of Columbia which forbid the rental, lease, sale, transfer or conveyance of the land to any Negro are valid; but their
enforcement by the courts of the District of Columbia is prohibited
by R. S. § 1978 guaranteeing to all citizens of the United States
equal rights to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real
and personal property. Pp. 30-34.
(a) The District of Columbia is included in the phrase "every
State and Territory," as used in R. S. § 1978. P. 31.
(b) Congress has the constitutional power to enact such legislation for the District of Columbia. P. 31.
(c) The action toward which R. S. § 1978 is directed is governmental action; and it does not invalidate private agreements,
so long as their purpose is achieved through voluntary adherence
to their terms. P. 31.
(d) Judicial enforcement of such discriminatory covenants is
prohibited by R. S. § 1978, which is derived from. the Civil Rights
Act and closely related to the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 31-34.
2. The power of the federal courts to enforce the terms of private
agreements is at all times exercised subject to the restrictions and
limitations of the public policy of the United States as manifested
in the Constitution, treaties, federal statutes, and applicable legal
precedents. Pp. 34-35.
3. Even in the absence of a statute such as R. S. § 1978, it is not
consistent with the public policy of the United States to permit
federal courts in the Nation's capital to exercise general-equitable
powers to compel action denied the state courts by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 34-36.

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
These are companion cases to Shelley v. Kraemer and
McGhee v. Sipes, ante, p. 1, and come to this Court on
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.
In 1906, twenty of thirty-one lots in the 100 block
of Bryant Street, Northwest, in the City of Washington,
were sold subject to the following covenant:
"... that said lot shall never be rented, leased,
sold, transferred or conveyed unto any Negro or colored person, under a penalty of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000), which shall be a lien against said
pro)erty."
The covenanit imposes no time limitation on the restriction.
Prior to the sales which gave rise to these cases, the
twenty lots which are subject to the covenants were at
all times owned and occupied by white persons, except
for a brief period when three of the houses were occupied
by Negroes who were eventually induced to move without

legal action. The remaining eleven lots in the same
block,1 however, are not subject to a restrictive agreement
and, as found by the District Court, were occupied by
Negroes for the twenty years prior to the institution of
this litigation.
These cases involve seven of the twenty lots which
are subject to the terms of the restrictive covenants. In
No. 290, petitioners Hurd, found by the trial court to
be Negroes,2 purchased one of the restricted properties
from the white owners. In No. 291, petitioner Urciolo,
a white real estate dealer, sold and conveyed three of the
restricted properties to the Negro petitioners Rowe, Savage, and Stewart. Petitioner Urciolo also owns three
other lots in the block subject to the covenants. In both
cases, the Negro petitioners are presently occupying as
homes the respective properties which have been conveyed to them.
Suits were instituted in the District Court by respondents, who own other property in the block subject to the
terms of the covenants, praying for injunctive relief to
enforce the terms of the restrictive agreement. The
cases were consolidated for trial, and after a hearing,
the court entered a judgment declaring null and void the
deeds of the Negro petitioners; enjoining petitioner Urciolo and one Ryan, the white property owners who had
sold the houses to the Negro petitioners, from leasing,
selling or conveying the properties to any Negro or colored person; enjoining the Negro petitioners from leasing
or conveying the properties and directing those petitioners "to remove themselves and all of their personal
belongings" from the premises within sixty days.
All of the residential property in the block is on the south side
of the street, the northern side of the street providing a boundary
for a public park.

OCTOBER TERM, 1947.
Opinion of the Court.

334 U. S.

The United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, with one justice dissenting, affirmed the
judgment of the District Court.8 The majority of the
court was of the opinion that the action of the District
Court was consistent with earlier decisions of the Court
of Appeals and that those decisions should be held determinative in these cases.
Petitioners have attacked the judicial enforcement of
the restrictive covenants in these cases on a wide variety
of grounds. Primary reliance, however, is placed on the
contention that such governmental action on the part
of the courts of the District of Columbia is forbidden by
the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment of the
Federal Constitution.'
Whether judicial enforcement of racial restrictive agreements by the federal courts of the District of Columbia
violates the Fifth Amendment has never been adjudicated
by this Court. In Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323
(1926), an appeal was taken to this Court from a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia which had affirmed an order of
the lower court granting enforcement to a restrictive
covenant. But as was pointed out in our opinion in
Shelley v. Kraemer, supra, the only constitutional issue
which had been raised in the lower courts in the Corrigan
case, and, consequently, the only constitutional question
before this Court on appeal, related to the validity of
the private agreements as Shch. Nothing in the opinion

82 U. S, App. D. C. 180, 162 F. 2d 233 (1947).
'Other contentions made by petitioners include the following:
judicial enforcement of the covenants is contrary to § 1978 of the
Revised Statutes, derived from the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and to
treaty obligations of the United States contained in the United Nations' charter; enforcement of the covenants is contrary to the public
policy; enforcement of the covenants is inequitable.

of this Court in that case, therefore, may properly be
regarded as an adjudication of the issue presented by
petitioners in this case which concerns, not the validity
of the restrictive agreements standing alone, but the
validity of court enforcement of the restrictive covenants
under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.'
See Shelley v. Kraemer, supra at p. 8.

This Court has declared invalid municipal ordinances
restricting occupancy in designated areas to persons of
specified race and color as denying rights of white sellers

and Negro purchasers of property, guaranteed by the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60 (1917); Harmon v.

United States Court of Appeals and relied on in most of the subsequent decisions, the opinion of the court contains no consideration of
the specific issues presented to this CQurt in these cases. An appeal
from the decision in Corriganv. Buckley was dismissed by this Court.

white sellers and Negro purchasers of property, guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Petitioners point out that this' Court in Hirabayashi v.
United States, 320 U. S.81, 100 (1943), reached its decision in a case in which issues under the Fifth Amendment

were presented, on the assumption that "racial discriminations are in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited . . . ." And see Korematsu v. United
States, 323 U. S. 214, 216 (1944).

Upon full consideration, however, we have found it
unnecessary to resolve the constitutional issue which petitioners advance; for we have concluded that judicial
enforcement of restrictive covenants by the courts of the
District of Columbia is improper for other reasons hereinafter stated.'
Section 1978 of the Revised Statutes, derived from § 1
of the Civil Rights Act of 1866,' provides:
"All citizens of the United States shall have the
same right, in every State and Territory, as is en6 It
is a well-established principle that this Court will not decide
constitutional questions where other grounds are available and dispositive of the issues of the case. Recent expressions of that policy
are to be found in Alma Motor Co. v. Timken-Detroit Axle Co., 329
U. S.129 (1946); Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U. S. 549
(1947).
7 14 Stat. 27. Section 1 of the Act provided: "...
That all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power,
excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of
the United States; and such citizens, of every race and color, without
regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude,
except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have. been
duly convicted, shall have the same right, in every State and Territory in the United States, to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be

these cases, as found by the DisAll the petitioners in'

stitutional power of Congress to enact such legislation
with reference to the District of Columbia.1'
We may start with the proposition that the statute
does not invalidate private restrictive agreements so long
as the purposes of those agreements are achieved by the
parties through voluntary adherence to the terms. The
action toward which the provisions of the statute under
consideration is directed is governmental action. Such
was the holding of Corriganv. Buckley, supra.
In considering whether judicial enforcement of restrictive covenants is the kind of governmental action which
pains, and penalties, and to none other, any law, statute, ordinance,
regulation, or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding."
The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was reenacted in § 18 of the Act
of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 144, passed subsequent to the adoption
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 1977 of the Revised Statutes

(8 U. S. C. § 41), derived from § 1'9 of the Act of 1870, which in turn
was patterned after J 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, provides"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have
the same right in every State and Territory to make and rnforce
contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal
benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and
property as is 'enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like

the fi'st section of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was intended to prohibit, reference must be made to the scope
and purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment; for that
statute and the Amendment were closely related both
in inception and in the objectives which Congress sought
to achieve.
Both the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the joint resolution which was later adopted as the Fourteenth Amendment were passed in the first session of the Thirty-Ninth
Congress." Frequent references to the Civil Rights Act
are to be found in the record of the legislative debates on
the adoption of the Amendment. 2 It is clear that in
many significant respects the statute and the Amendment
were expressions of the same general congressional policy.
Indeed, as the legislative debates reveal, one of the primary purposes of many members of Congress in supporting the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was
to incorporate the guaranties of the Civil Rights Act of
1866 in the organic law of the land. 3 Others supported
the, adoption of the Amendment in order to eliminate
"The Civil Rights Act of 1866 became law on April 9, 1866. The

Opinion of the Court.

doubt as to the constitutional validity of the Civil Rights
Act as applied to the States.4
The close relationship between § 1 of the Civil Rights
Act and the Fourteenth Amendment was given specific
recognition by this Court in Buchanan v. Warley, supra
at 79. There, the Court observed that, not only through
the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment, but also by
virtue of the "statutes enacted in furtherance of its purpose," including the provisions here considered, a colored
man is granted the right to acquire property free from
interference by discriminatory state legislation. In Shelley v. Kraemer, supra, we have held that the Fourteenth
Amendment also forbids such discrimination where imposed by state courts in the enforcement of restrictive
covenants. That holding is clearly indicative of the construction to be given to the relevant provisions of the
Civil Rights Act in their application to the Courts of the
District of Columbia.
Moreover, the explicit language employed by Congress
to effectuate its purposes leaves no doubt that judicial
in reporting to the House the joint resolution which was subsequently
adopted as the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 2459. See also id.
at 2462, 2896, 2961. That such was understood to be a primary
purpose of the Amendment is made clear not only from statements
of the proponents of the Amendment but of its opponents. Id.at
2467, 2538. See Flack, The Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment
94-96.
14 No doubts were expressed as to the constitutionality of the Civil

Rights Act in its application to the District of Columbia. Senator
Poland of Vermont stated: "It certainly seems desirable thht no doubt
should be left existing as to the power of Congress to enforce principles lying at the very foundation of all republican government if
they be denied or violated by the States, and I cannot doubt but
that every Senator will rejoice in aiding to remove all doubt upon this
power of Congress." Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 2961. See
also id. at 2461, 2498, 2506, 2511,2896, 3035.

OCTOBER TERM, 1947.
Opinion of the Court.

334 U. S.

enforcement of the restrictive covenants by the courts
of the District of Columbia is prohibited by the Civil
Rights Act. That statute, by its termg, requires that all
citizens of the United States shall have the same right
"as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . to inherit, purchase,
lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property."
That the Negro petitioners have been denied that right
by virtue of the action of the federal courts of the District is clear. The Negro petitioners entered into contracts of sale with willing sellers for the purchase of
properties upon which they desired to establish homes.
Solely because of their race and color they are confronted
with orders of court divesting their titles in the properties
and ordering that the premises be vacated. White sellers,
one of whom is a petitioner here, have been enjoined
from selling the properties to any Negro or colored person.
Under such circumstances, to suggest that the Negro
petitioners have been accorded the same rights as white
citizens to purchase, hold, and convey real property is
to reject the plain meaning of language. We hold that
the action of the District Court directed against the Negro
purchasers and the white sellers denies rights intended
by Congress to be protected by the Civil Rights Act
and that, consequently, the action cannot stand.
But even in the absence of the statute, there are other
considerations which would indicate that enforcement of
restrictive covenants in these cases is judicial action contrary to the public policy of the United States, 5 and
as such should be corrected by this Court in the exercise
of its supervisory powers over the courts of the District
of Columbia." The power of the federal courts to en15See United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219, 235 (1941);

force the terms of private agreements is at all times
exercised subject to the restrictions and limitations of
the public policy of the United States as manifested in
the Constitution, tr'eaties, federal statutes, and applicable
legal precedents." Where the enforcement of private
agreements would be violative of that policy, it is the
obligation of courts to refrain from such exertions of
judicial power.18
We are here concerned with action of federal courts
of such a nature that if taken by the courts of a State
would violate the prohibitory provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Shelley v' Kraemer, supra. It is
not consistent with the public policy of the United States
to permit federal courts in the Nation's capital to exercise
general equitable powers to compel action denied the
state courts where such state action has been held to be
violative of the guaranty of the equal protection of the
laws." We cannot presume that the public policy of the
United States manifests a lesser concern for the protectioh
of appeals, or in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia,
it shall be competent for the Supreme Court of the United States,

upon the petition of any party thereto, whether Government or other
litigant, to require by certiorari, either before or after a judgment
or decree by such lower court, that the cause be certified to the
Supreme Court for determination by it with the same power and
authority, and with like effect, as if the cause had been brought
there by unrestricted writ of error or appeal."

In these cases, the plaintiffs ask equity to enjoin white
property owners who are desirous of selling their houses
to Negro buyers simply because the houses were subject
to an original agreement not to have them pass into
Negro ownership. Equity is rooted in conscience. An
injunction is, as it always has been, "an extraordinary
remedial process which is granted, not as a matter of
right but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion."
Morrison v. Work, 266 U. S. 481, 490. In good conscience, it cannot be "the exercise of a sound judicial
discretion" by a federal court to grant the relief here
asked for when the authorization of such an injunction
by the States of the Union violates the Constitutionand violates it, not for any narrow technical reason, but
for considerations that touch rights so basic to our society
that, after the Civil War, their protection against invasion
by the States was safeguarded by the Constitution. This
is to me a sufficient and conclusive ground for reaching
the Court's result.
