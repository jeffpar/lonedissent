PATERNO v, LYONS, COMMISSIONER OF
CORRECTION.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW YORK.

No. 583. Argued April 28, 1948.-Decided June 1, 1948.
Indicted in a New York state court for receiving stolen property,
petitioner was permitted to plead guilty to attempted grand larceny second degree, a lesser offense not charged in the indictment.
He failed to avail himself, within the time prescribed, of state
law remedies for challenging the validity -of the conviction under
state law. Later he was convicted for another offense and sentenced as a second offender. Thereafter he attacked the validity
of the first conviction under state and federal law. Upon review
here of a judgment denying relief, held:
1. The decision of the highest court of the State that acceptance
of the plea of guilty to the lesser offense did not deprive petitioner
of his right under the state constitution to be prosecuted for an
infamous crime only upon a grand jury indictment was binding
here. Pp. 318-319.
2. The remedies provided by state law for challenging the validity of the conviction under state law (viz., motion to withdraw
plea of guilty, motion in arrest of judgment, or direct appeal)
Were adequate from the standpoint of the due process of law
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, at least in the absence
of any showing that petitioner was without opportunity effectively
to take advantage of such remedies. P. 319.
3. In view of the relationship of the two offenses under the state
-statutes, the indictment charging only receiving stolen property
afforded petitioner reasonable notice and information of the lesser
offense to which he pleaded guilty; and he was not in this respect
denied due process of law. Pp. 319-322.

Opinion of the Court.

A county court of New York adjudged invalid a conviction of petitioner upon a plea of guilty in a criminal
prosecution, 187 Misc. 56, 60 N. Y. S. 2d 813,.but was
prevented from vacating the judgment by a writ of prohibition issued upon the application of the State. 272

William H. Collins argued the cause and filed a brief
for petitioner.
Irving I. Waxman, Assistant Attorney General of New
York, argued the cause for respondent. With him on
the brief were Nathaniel L. Goldstein, Attorney General,
and Wendell P. Brown, Solicitor General.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
October 30, 1936, the petitioner was indicted in the
County Court of Erie County, New York, on a charge of
"Buying, receiving, concealing and withholding
property, knowing the same to have been stolen or
appropriated wrongfully in such manner as to constitute larceny, contrary to the Penal Law, Section
1308, in that he, the said Joseph Paterno on or about
the 5th day of October, 1936, at the City of Tonawanda, in this County, feloniously brought [sic],
received, concealed and withheld property stolen from
Charles M. Rosen, doing business under the assumed
name and style of Arcade Jewelry Shop."
The punishments provided for this offense and for larceny
are substantially the same. Both may, according to circumstances, range up to ten years at hard labor.1 November 10, 1936, petitioner appeared in court with counsel,

pleaded not guilty to the indictment, and was released
on a bond of $2500. Five months later, on April 14,1937,
he again appeared in Erie County Court and upon agreement with the district attorney was "permitted to plead
guilty to the reduced charge of Attempted Grand Larceny
2nd Degree." Under New York law the punishment for
such an attempt can be no more than half the punishment provided for the offense attempted.2 The sentence,
not imposed until July 16, three months after the plea
of guilty, was for fifteen months minimum and thirty
months maximum at hard labor. This sentence was
suspended and petitioner was placed on probation with a
requirement that he "make restitution $75.00 cash balance
as determined by probation dept."
Although discharged from probation December 1, 1938,
petitioner on December 27, 1945, made a motion in the
nature of coram nobis in the Erie County Court asking
that court to vacate and set aside its former conviction of
petitioner, permit withdrawal of the plea of guilty, and
for leave to plead de novo. There was a special reason
why petitioner wished to vacate this judgment long after
the probationary restraints of the sentence had been lifted.
In the meantime he had pleaded guilty in the Chautauqua
County Court, New York, to the crime of robbery second
degree under an ndictment charging him with robbery
first degree. In accordance with the requirements of the
2

N. Y. Penal Law § 261.

Maximum punishment for grand larceny

second degree is 5 years. N. Y. Penal Law § 1297. The District
Attorney explained his reasons for the agreement in these words:
"Only a very small portion of the stolen property was recovered
and that was found in the possession of several admitted inmates of
a disorderly house who are of necessity the chief witnesses for the
People in this case. For these reasons and because of the character
of these witnesses, it is recommended that the defendant be permitted to plead guilty to the reduced charge of Attempted Grand
Larceny 2nd Degree."

PATERNO v. LYONS.
314

Opinion of the Court.

New York second felony offender law ' the Chautauqua
County judge had sentenced petitioner to 15 to 30 years
at hard labor, proof having been made before him of petitioner's prior Erie County conviction for attempted grand
larceny second degree.
The grounds of the motion in the nature of coram
nobis were that the Erie County Court had exceeded
its power in accepting his plea of guilty to the offense
of attempted grand larceny second degree under the
indictment which charged him with the offense of receiving, concealing, and withholding property knowing it to
have been st9len. He alleged that judgment of conviction in a case initiated by an indictment which did not
include the charge to which he had pleaded guilty denied
him his right under Art. 1, § 6 of the New York Constitution to be prosecuted for an infamous crime only on
indictment of a grand jury,4 and also denied him due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.'

: These questions had previously been raised by petitioner in other
New York courts without success. In 1943 he had moved the
Chautauqua County Court to vacate its judgment, under which he
had been sentenced 'as a second felony offender. That Court held
it was without power to pass upon the validity of the Erie County
judgment and dismissed his motion. People v. Paterno, 182 Misc.
491, 50 N. Y. S. 2d 713. In another proceeding the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, relying on People ex rel.
Wachowicz v. Martin, 293 N. Y. 361, 57 N. E. 2d 53, held that
habeas corpus was not available to obtain vacation of the judgment,
and that the only way to raise a question as t, whether a plea of
guilty to attempted larceny could be accepted under an indictment
such as that against Paterno was by appeal or motion in arrest of
judgment. People ex rel. Paterno v. Martin, 268 App. Div. 956,
51 N. Y. S. 2d 679.

OCTOBER TERM, 1947.
Opinion of the Court.

334 U. S.

The judge of the Erie County Court was of opinion that
acceptance of the plea of guilty to the lesser offense deprived him of rights guaranteed by the New York Constitution and that therefore his conviction was without due
process of law. 187 Misc. 56, 60 N. Y. S. 2d 813. That
judge was prevented from vacating the judgment, however, by a writ of prohibition issued upon the application
of the State by the Supreme Court of Erie County. That
court held that Paterno had "been denied no constitutional
or legal right." The Fourth Department of the Supreme
Court, Appellate Division, affirmed, 272 App. Div. 120,
69 N. Y. S. 2d 715, stating that acceptance of Paterno's
plea to the lesser offense might have been an error of
law which would have justified relief by motion in ar-rest of judgment or by appeal as of right; but that petitioner, having declined to avail himself of these remedies
within the statutory period, could not later raise the
question.' It failed to accept Paterno's claim that the
circumstances under which his plea was entered deprived
him of due process of law. The New York Court of
Appeals affirmed without opinion. 297 N. Y. 617, 75
N. E. 2d 630. We granted certiorari. 333 U. S. 831.
It is again contended here that acceptance of petitionier's plea of guilty to attempted grand larceny second
degree under an indictment which charged that he had
bought, received, concealed, and withheld stolen property
deprived him of his right under the New York Constitution to be prosecuted for an infamous crime only on
a grand jury indictment and that consequently the Erie
County judgment of conviction is a nullity. But this con8 The State argues here that while petitioner had a right.to appeal
and challenge acceptance of the plea of guilty under the circumstances
shown, neither People ex rel. Wachowicz v. Martini 293 N. Y. 361,

squarely held that the trial court's action would hive -constituted

tention as to New York law has previously been rejected
by the State's highest court, in People ex rel. Wachowicz v.
Martin, 293 N. Y. 361, 57 N. E.. 2d 53, and was again rejected by the New York courts in this case. Their decision on such a state question is final here. In re Duncan,
139 U. S. 449, 462; West v. Louisiana,194 U. S. 258, 261.
Petitioner next argues that the State has failed to supply him an available remedy to attack thie judgment
against him and that such a failure denies him due process
of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. See.
Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103, 113. But this contention falls, with its premise. Petitioner, within the
periods prescribed by New York statutes, could have challenged any alleged errors of state law either by filing a
motion to withdraw his plea of guilty, or a motion in
arrest of judgment, or by taking a direct appeal from the
original judgment.' Certainly in the absence of any
showing that petitioner was without an opportunity effectively to take advantage of these corrective remedies
to challenge purely state questions such remedies are
adequate from a due process standpoint. See Parker v.
Illinois, 333 U. S. 571; American Surety Co. v. Baldwin,
287 U. S. 156, 169, and cases cited n. 6.
Petitioner further. challenges the judgment as a denial
of due process upon the ground that the indictment
charged him with one offense and that the judgment was
based on a plea of guilty to an entirely separate offense.

334 U. S.

This challenge again basically rests on the allegation that
under New York law an indictment for receiving stolen
property does not necessarily include a charge of an attempt to steal the property. Petitioner's motion to vacate
on such a federal constitutional ground appears to be an
available procedure under New York law,' and the courts
below so assumed. Determination of this federal due
process question does not depend upon whether as a matter of New York law the Erie County judge erred in permitting petitioner to plead guilty.' The question turns
rather upon whether the petitioner under the circumstances here disclosed was given reasonable notice and
information of the specific charge against him and a fair
hearing in open court. In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273,
278; Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U. S. 196, 201. We agree with
the New York courts that this petitioner had such notice
and information. The fairness of the hearing afforded.
petitioner is not challenged.
There is close kinship between the offense of larceny
and that of receiving stolen property knowing that it was
stolen. When related to the same stolen goods, as here,
the two crimes certainly may fairly be said to be "connected with the same transaction" as the New York Court
of Appeals noted in the Wachowicz case. 293 N. Y. at
367, 57 N. E. 2d at 56. A person commits larceny under
New York law if he "unlawfully obtains or appropriates"
an article, N. Y. Penal Law § 1294; he violates the receiving of stolen property statute if he "in any way . . .
conceals, withholds, or aids in concealing or withholding
• . . property, knowing the same to have been stolen, or
appropriated wrongfully in such a manner as to constitute

larceny," N. Y. Penal Law § 1308. The overlapping nature of the two offenses is further emphasized by the
definition of larceny in § 1290, which includes conduct
whereby any person who "with the intent to deprive or
defraud another of the use and benefit of property, or to
appropriate the same to the use of . . . any other person
other than the true owner, wrongfully takes, obtains or
withholds [any property] by any means whatever, from
the possession of the true owner or of any other
person .
It would be exaltation of technical precision to an
unwarranted degree to say that the indictment here did
not inform petitioner that he was charged with substantial elements of the crime of larceny thereby enabling
him, as a means of cutting his sentence in half, to agree
to plead guilty to an attempted larceny. Procedural requirements are essential constitutional safeguards in our
system of criminal law. These safeguards should constantly and vigilantly be observed to afford those accused
of crime every fair opportunity to defend themselves.
This petitioner had such opportunity. Months after his
first appearance in court he came back and pleaded guilty
to an attempt wrongfully to "withhold" the very property
of another which the indictment had originally charged
him with wrongfully "withholding." 10 It would be a
strained interpretation of petitioner's constitutional rights
10The Appellate Division's opinion in this case said: "It is true
that the crime of attempted grand larceny, secQnd degree is not
necessarily included under a charge of criminally receiving stolen
property (the then indictment against Paterno) (People ex rel.
Wachowicz v. Martin, 293 N. Y. 361, supra) but one can conceive a set
of facts under which one guilty of criminally receiving stolen property
could be guilty of larceny in unlawfully withholding the stolen property from the owner thereof. (Penal Law, § 1290; see People v.
Vitolo, 271 App. Div. 959; 136 A. L. R. 1091; and 2 Wharton on
Criminal Law, §§ 1122, 1168.)" 272 App. Div. at 126, 69 N. Y. S.

MR. JUSTICE I"RANKFURTER, concurring.
The New York Constitution requires that prosecution
for an "infamous crime" be upon indictment by grand
jury. The New York Court of Appeals has held that this
constitutional requirement does not nullify the acceptance
by a trial court of a plea of guilty to the offense of attempted grand larceny, second degree, upon an indictment
for knowingly receiving stolen goods. Since, so far as
the United States Constitution is concerned, the States
may dispense with accusations by grand juries, it is for
New York and not for us to decide when the procedural
requirements of New York law, not touching those fundamental safeguards which the United States Constitution
protects, are satisfied. What is here challenged is New
York's determination that the knowing receipt of stolen
goods is sufficiently related to larceny so as to permit
acceptance of a plea of guilty of the latter on the assumption that an indictment for one affords adequate notice
of the other. Surely this does not rise to the dignity of
a substantial federal question. In the early days of the
Fourteenth Amendment, this Court deemed it appropriate
to remind that that Amendment had not made this Court
an appellate tribunal to supervise the administration of
the criminal law of the States. It is not irrelevant to
recall this admonition.

CERTIOI1ARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 560.

Argued April 21, 1948.-Decided June 1,1948.

Regulations of the Civil Service Commission applicable to reductions
in force of employees of the Federal Government prescribed the
following order of priority for retention of "permanent employees":
(1) A-1 Plus, World War II veterans for a one-year period after
return to duty; (2) A-I, Veteran's preference employees with
efficiency ratings of "good" or better; (3) A-2, Employees without
veteran's preference with. efficiency ratings of "good" or better.
Unde the regulations, every member of groups A-1 Plus and
A-1 was entitled to be retained in preference to those in group
A-2, without regard to length of service. Petitioner was classified
in group A-2 and was notified of a one-year furlough: He sued
for a declaratory judgment, praying that the Commission's A-1
Plus and A-1 classifications be declared void, that he be restored
to his position, and that the Commission be required to rescind
the regulations and promulgate new ones in accordance with law.

Held:
1. In the circumstances of this case, petitioner is entitled to
challenge the validity of the A-1 Plus as well as the A-1 classification. Pp. 325-328.
2. The A-1 Plus classification is authorized by § 8 of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. Pp. 328-333.
(a) The mandatory requirement of § 8 (b) (A) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 that the Government rehire
its returning veteran employees is not qualified, as in the case of
private employers under § 8 (b) (B), when "the employer's cir-

cumstances have so changed as to make it impossible or unreasonable to do so." Pp. 328-330, 331.
