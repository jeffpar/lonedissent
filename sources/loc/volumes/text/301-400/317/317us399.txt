KIESELBACH v. COMMISSIONER.

Syllabus.

of. government vessels into private hands,' a purpose,
clearly compatible with the Suits in Admiralty Act whicfi
through its limitation provisions cut off lingering liens.
There is nothing whatever in the 1920 Merchant Marine
Act, nor, so far as has been pointed out to us, anything in
its legislative history, indicating that Congress intended
to repeal, alter, or amend the Suits in Admiralty Act in
whole or in part. The 1920 re-enactment is not meaningless; it retains in the law that portion of the 1916 statute

unaffected by the Suits in Admiralty Act. It remains an
expression of the basic policy of waiver of immunity by
the government for maritime torts of the sort within its
scope.

We hold that when the government voluntarily appears
in an action authorized by § 4 of the Suits in Admiralty
Act, the proceedings are governed by § 5 with its limitation provisions.
Affirmed.

INTERNAL REVENUE.
U'J.VIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT..

No. 184. Argued December 11, 1942.-Decided January 4, 1943
Title *to real. property in the City of New York was taken by the City,
together with the possession and the right to all after-accruing rents,
by a proceeding in condemnation under § 976 of the Greater New
Yor Charter. Several months later, the final decree awarded the
former owners, as just compensation, the value of the property on
.the day of taking, with interest thereon from that date till the date
of payment. Held. that the part of the award designated as "interest," although it was part of the "just compensation" that must be
paid the owner to justify the taking, was not a part of the sale price
of a capital asset under § 117 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1936 and
was taxable as income under § 22 of that Act. P. 403.

reversed a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 44 B. T. A.

brief, for respondent.
Mr. John Jay McKelvey filed a brief on behalf of
* Isaac G. Johnson & Co., as amicus curiae, in support of
petitioners.
MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
This writ of certiorari was granted limited to a single
narrow point in the Jaw of income.taxes. The sum in
question was received as part of the compensation in
a condemnation proceeding instituted by the City of New
York. Payment was made several years after the actual
taking. The issue concerns the nature of that portion of
the payment which is called "interest" by the Greater
New York Charter and which the owner must receive,
in addition to the value of the property fixed as of the
time of the taking, to produce, when actually paid, the
full equivalent of that value. Was this portion a capital
gain or ordinary income?
The writ was granted because of conflict upon the point
between this case below, Commissioner v. Kieselbach,
127 F. 2d 359 (C. C. A. 3), and Seaside Improvement Co.
v. Commissioner, 105 F. 2d 990 (C. C. A. 2).
The taxpayers owned a piece, of realty in the City of
New York. In December, 1932, that city's Board of Estimate passed a resolution which directed that upon January 3, 1933, the title in fee to a large part of the parcel
would vest in the city. The condemnation proceeding, of
which the resolution was a part, was pursuant to § 976

KIESELBACH-v. COMMISSIONER.
Opinion of the Court.

399

of the Greater New York Charter, which provides in
part as follows:
"Upon the date of the entry of the order granting the
application to condemn, or of the filing of the damage
map in the proceeding, as the case may be,, or upon such
subsequent date as may be specified by resolution of
said board, the city of New York shall become and be
seized in fee of or of the easement, in, over, upon or
under, the said real property described in the said order or
damage map, as the board of estimate and apportionment
may determine, the same to be held, appropriated, converted and used to and for such purpose accordingly. Interest at the legal rate upon the sum or sums to which
the owners are justly entitled upon the date of the vesting of title in the city of New York, as aforesaid, from
said date to the date of the final decree shall be awarded
by the court as part of the compensation to which such
owners are entitled."
The city took possession on the date named in the resolution and received all rents thereafter accruing. The
Supreme Court of New York entered its final decree in
the proceedings on March 31, 1937. It was for $73,246.57
and was stated to be the just compensation which the
owners were entitled to receive. Payment was made on
May 12, 1937. It has been stipulated that:
"The amount of said payment was computed by adding
to the principal amount of $58,000.00, interest thereon as
provided by Section 976 of the Greater New York Charter,
in the sum of $15,246.57, computed at the rate of 6% per
annum from Janplar.y 3, 1933 to May 12, 1937, or'a total
of $73,246.57."'

'No question is raised involving 'the accuracy of this computation.
While § 976 requires-interest only to the date of the decree, § 981,
Greater New York Charter, as amended by- Laws of 1932, c. 391,
requires interest on the decree. Matter of City of New York (Chrystie

.Opinion of the Court.

317 U. S.

We accept as a fact that the $58,000, principal amount just
referred to, was, as petitioners allege, an award to them.
We assume it was the value on January 3, 1933, of this
property then taken by the city.
Section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat.
1648, 1657, contains the gefieral definition of gross income.
It reads as follows:
"(a) GeneralDefinition.-'Grossincome'includes gains,
profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service, of whatever kind and in
whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades,
businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property,
whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership
or use of or interest in such property; also from interest,
rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any
business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits
and income derived from any source whatever ..
The taxpayers' basis on the condemned property was
akotund $42,000. In their original return the difference
between the basis and the total sum received was treated
as capital gain and only a percentage was returned as
income pursuant to § 117.' The Commissioner assessed a
deficiency on the portion of the award computed as interest, on the ground that such portion was ordinary income.
2Section

117 reads as follows:

"(a) General Rule.-In the case of a taxpayer, other than a .cor-

poration, only the follqwing percentages of the gain or loss recognized
upon the sale or exchange of a capital asset shall be taken into account
in computing net income:
"40 per centum. if the capital asset has been held for more than 5
.years lut not for more than 10 years;

"30 per 'centum if 'the capital asset has been held for more than 10
years.
"(b) Definition of Capital Aesets.-FDr,the purposes of this title,
'capital assets' means property held by the taxpayer (whether or not
connected with his trade or business), . . ." 49 Stat. 1691,

KIESELBACH v. COMMISSIONER.
399

Opinion of the Court.

The Board of Tax Appeals reversed the Commissioner
and the Circuit-Court of Appeals, in turn, held with the
Commissioner. 127 F. 2d 359.
We agree with the Court of Appeals. The sum paid
these taxpayers above the award of $58,000 was paid because of the failure to put the award in the taxpayers'
hands on the day, January 3, 1933, when the property
was taken. This additional payment was necessary to
give the owner the full equivalent of the value of the
property at the time it was taken. Whether one calls it
interest on the value or payments to meet the constitutional requirement of just compensation is immaterial.
It is income under § 22, paid to the taxpayers in lieu of
what they might have earned on the sum found to e the
value of the property on the day the property was taken.
It is not a capital gain upon an asset sold under § 117.
The sale price was the $58,000.
The property was turned over in January, 1933, by the
resolution. This was the sale. Title then passed. The
subsequent earnings of the property went to the city.
The transaction was as though a purchase money lien at
legal interest was retained upon the property. Such
interest when paid would, of course, be ordinary income.
From the premises that the value at time of the taking
plus compensation for delay in payment equals just compensation, United States v. Klamath Indians, 304 U. S.
119, 123,' and that a good measure of the necessary additional amount is interest "at a proper rate," SeaboardAir

involuntary character of the transaction is not significant.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

317 U. S.

Line Ry. Co. v. UnitedStates, 261 U. S. 299, 306, petitioner
contends that as just compensation requires the payment
of these sums for delay in settlement, they are a part of
the damages awarded for the property. But these payments are indemnification for delay, not a part of the sale
price. While without their payment just compensation
would not be received by the vendor, it does not follow
that the additional payments are a part of the sale price
under § 117 (a). The just compensation constitutionally required is not the same thing as the sale price of a
capital asset.'
In Seaside Improvement Co. v. Commissioner, 105 F.
2d 990,994, an opposite conclusion apparently was reached
by treating the additional payments as part of the purchase price as well as part of "just compensation." I
Petitioners urge that the additional sum paid, should
be construed as a part of the sale price, in analogy to
decisions that such sums, when paid in condemnation
proceedings by a state, are not interest entitled to exemption under § 22 (b) (4), Internal Revenue Code, as
"interest upon the obligations of a state." 7 The cases
cited construe the quoted phrase as designed to protect
The same principle is applicable to the New York decisions, holding that interest is a part of the condemnation award. Just compensation requires satisfaction for the delay by payment 'of the additional
sums. Matter of City of New York (West 151st St.), 222 N. Y. 370,
372, 118 N. E. 807; Matter of Minzesheimer, 144 App. Div. 576, 579,

129 N. Y. S. 779, affirmed 204 N. Y. 272, 97 N. E. 717; Matter of City
of N. Y. (Bronx River Parkway), 284 N.Y. 48, 54,29 N. E. 2d 465. The
obligation to pay its value arises when the property is taken. Title
then passes. Kahlen v. State of New York, 223 N. Y. 383, 389, 119
N. E. 883.

Woodward-Brown Realty Co. v. City of New York, 235

N. Y. 278, 139 N. E. 267, is not to the contrary. It deals with the
unity of a right of action on an award with interest, holding only one
proceeding is authorized against the condemnor.

of the compensation awarded for the property taken." 105 F. 2d at 994.

Opinion of the Court.

the states' borrowing power. In any event, the question
here is not whether these sums are interest. They may
not be interest and yet be other than part of the sale
price. If not interest, they may be compensation for
the delay in payment.
Other contentions are made by the petitioners. It is
said that in other situations interest on delayed payments
has been treated as part of the principal received and not
as normal income.' By analogy it is urged that the same
principle be applied here. The first three cas~es in the
preceding note involved payments of awards iii liquidation of claims against Germany allowed by the Mixed
Claims Commission. See Settlement of War Claims Act
of 1928, 45 Stat. 254. As the aggregate/payments did not
equal the taxpayers' basis, the decisions refused to consider as income the portions designated as interest on the
ground that in liquidation the investment first must be
restored before income is realized. Koninklijke Hollandische Lloyd v. Commissionerand Consorzio Veneziano
etc. v. Commissioner applied the rule that payment for
deferred compensation was not interest under § 119 (a)1"

Statement of the Case.

of the Revenue Act of 1932 or 1928. These decisions
obviously are not in point on the question whether the
additional payments in the present case are part of the
sale price or other income under § 22. Nor do we find
persuasive the cases refusing to allow an installment purchaser an interest deduction because of his deferred payments where the purpose was an arrangement for the payment of the purchase price." In the present case, the
purchase price was settled as of January 3, 1933, when the
property was taken over.
