CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 173.

Argued December 10, 1942.-Decided January 18, 1943.

1. Section 5438 of the Revised Statutes, which subjects to the penalties therein prescribed "Every person who . . causes to be
presented, for payment . . . any claim upon or against the Government of the United States,... knowing such claim to be
• . . fraudulent . . .," held applicable to contractors who, by collusive bidding, obtained contracts with municipalities and school
districts of a State for work on federal Public Works Administration projects, and who were paid for their work under the contracts
largely with funds granted by the federal Public Works Administrator. P. 542.
Competitive bidding was a federal requirement; all bidders were
fully advised that these were P. W. A. projects; and many if not
most of the contractors certified that their bids were "genuine and
not sham or collusive." While payment itself, in the sense of the
direct transferring of checks, was done in the name of local authorities, monthly estimates for payment were submitted by the contractors to the local sponsors on P. W. A. forms which showed the
Government's participation in the work and called attention to
other federal statutes prohibiting fraudulent claims. It was a
prerequisite to the contractors' payment by the local sponsors that
these estimates be filed, transmitted to, and approved by, the
P. W. A. authorities. Payment was then made from a joint construction bank account containing both federal and local funds.
The work was done under constant federal supervision.
2. R. S. § 5438 is to be construed, not with the "utmost strictncss,"
but according to its fair intendment. P. 541.
3. The substantive language of R. S. § 5438 can not be said to have
one meaning in criminal prosecutions and another in qui tam suits.
P. 542.
4. The first, second, and third- clauses of R. S. § 5438, taken together,
indicate a purpose to reach any person who knowingly assisted in
causing the Government to pay claims which were grounded. in fraud,
without regard to whether the person had direct contractual relations with the Government. P. 544.

5. The qui tam action which R. S. §§ 3491-3493 authorizes "any person"
to bring for the recovery of the ,ums which R. S. § 3490 provides
shall be forfeited and paid to the United States by violators of R. S.
§ 5438, is not barred by the fact that the offenders have been indicted and, on pleas of nolo contendere, fined for defrauding the, Government in connection with the same transactions;, norby the fact
that the complainant may have obtained his information from the indictment and may have contributed nothing to the discovery of
Sthe crime. P. 545.
6. Considerations of policy in permitting qui tam actions in the circumstances of this case are for Congress and not the courts.
P. 546.
7. A respondent on certiorari may urge in support of the judgment
a ground which was rejected by the District Court and not considered in the Circuit Court of Appeals. P. 548.
8. Persons who have previously been indicted and convicted under 18
U. S. C. § 88 for conspiracy to defraud the Government, are not subjected to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment by a
subsequent qui tam action under R. S. §§ 3490-3493, though arising
out of the same transactions. P. 548.
9. The proceedings Under R. S., §§ 3490-3493 here involved- are
remedial and impose a civil sanction. P. 549.
10. The proceeding authorited by R. S. §§ 3490-3493 does not lose its
quality, as a civil action though more than the precise amount
of so-called actual damage be recovered. P. 550.
11. The words "forfeit and pay' in R. S. § 3490 are not inconsistent
with the conclusion that the action- authorized by §§ 3490-3493
is civil. P. 551.
12. rn the circumstances of this case, the lump sum in damages a.thorized by R. S. § 3490 ($2,000 forfeit for doing "any" of the
acts prohibited by R. S. § 5438) was properly assessed for each
Public Works Administration project involved. P. 552.

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. William H. Eckert and Eugene B. Strassburger, with whom Mr. John B. Nicklas, Jr., was on the
brief, for respondents.
At the request of the Court, Solicitor General Fahy
filed a brief (on which also were Messrs. Robert L. Stern
and Fred E. Strine) on behalf of the United States, as
amicus curiae.
MR. JusTIcE BLACK

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Respondents, electrical 'contractors, were employed to
work on P. W. A. projects in the Pittsburgh area. Their
contracts were made with local governmental units rather
than with the United States government, but a substantial portion of their pay came from the United States.
Charging the respondents with defrauding the United
States through the device of collusive bidding on these
projects,' the petitioner, in the name of the United States
and on his own behalf brought this action under § 5438
and §§ 3490-3493 (31 U. S. C. §§ 231-234) of the Revised
Statutes.
These sections, now distributed through the statutes,
are parts of what was originally the Act of March 2, 1863,,
12 Stat. 696. Section 5438 contains that portion of the
original Act which makes certain efforts to defraud the
government a crime punishable by fine and imprison'The nature of the collusive bidding scheme was described by the
court below as follows: "The appellants, the officers and members of
the Electrical Contractors Association of Pittsburgh, conspired to rig
the bidding on these projects. *The pattern of the collusion was the
informal and private averaging of the prospective bid which might
have been submitted by each appellant. An appellant chosen by the
others would then submit a bid for the averaged amount and the
others all submitted higher estimates. The government was thereby
defrauded in that it was compelled to contribute more for the electric
work on the projects than it would have been, required to pay had
there been free competition in the open market." 127 F. 2d 233, 234.

ment. Section 3490.separately provides that whoever
commits "any" of thb prohibited acts shall "forfeit and
pay to the United States the sum of two thousand dollars,
and in addition, double the amount of damages . . . sustained . . . together with the costs of suit; and such forfeiture and damages shall be sued for in the same suit."
Under §§ 3491, 3493, this latter action may be instituted
by "any" person in behalf of the government, and where
such a qui tam action is brought, half the amount of the
recovery is paid to the person instituting the suit while
the other half goes to the government.
In the instant-case, verdict and judgment for $315,000
were rendered against the defendants, of which $203,000
was for double damages and $112,000 was an aggregate
of $2,000 sums for 56 violations of § 5438. 41 F. Supp.
197. The Circuit Court of Appeals was of the opinion
that the government had been defrauded-a conclusion
not challenged here 3 -but held that the particular fraud
was not reached by § 5438. It accordingly reversed.

2 Section 5438 includes three categories of acts subject to the penalty which it prescribes. The first of these clauses, which in our
opinion governs the instant case, covers "Every person who makes or
causes to be made, or presents or causes to be presented, for payment
or approval, to or by any person or officer in the civil, military or
naval service of the United States, any claim upon or against the Government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof,
knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent . . ." The
second clause governs the use of false certificates, etc., for the purpose
of obtaining or aiding to obtain payment of such a claim, and the
third covers conspiracy to defraud the government by obtaining or
aiding to obtain the payment of a claim. This section, with amendments not relevant to actions under § 3490, now appears as 18 U. S. C.

§§ 80,.83.

actions "have always been regarded with disfavor" by the
courts, emphasized the absence of a direct contractual
relationship between the respondents and the United States, and held that "The claims of the defendants then
were simply against the local municipalities. Since the
defendants had no claim upon or against the United
States, this action was not authorized by the informer
statutes."
We cannot accept either the interpretive approach or
the actual decision of .the court below. Qui tam suits
have been frequently permitted by legislative action,'
and have not been without defense by the courts." Morqover, this interpretation of "utmost strictness" narrows
4"Statutes

providing for actions by a common informer, who him-

self has no interest whatever in the controversy other than that given
by statute, have been in existence for hundreds of years in England,
and in this country ever since the foundation of our Government,"
Marvin v. Trout, 199 U. S. 212, 225. Some such statutes are 18
U. S. C. § 23 (arming vessels against friendly powers); 31 U. S. C.
§§ 155, 163 (breaches of duty by the Treasurer or-the Register of the
United States); 25 U. S. C. §§ 193, 201 (protection of Indians); and
see footnote 9, infra. For a statute dealing with the allocation of
costs in penal actions brotgL * by an informer, see 28 U. S. C. § 823.
Statutes providing for a reward to informers which do not specifically
either authorize or forbid the informer to institute the action are
construed to authorize him to sue, Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch '336.
In support of the view of the court below, see Taft v. Stevens Lith.
and Eng. Co.,.38 F. 28; but cf. United States v. Griswold, 24 F. 361,
366, in which the Court speaking of this section says: "The statute is
a remedial one. It is intended to protect the Treasury' against the
hungry and unscrupulous host that encompasses it on every side, and
should be construed accordingly. It was passed upon the theory,
based on experience as old as modern civilization, that one of the least
expensive and most effective means of preventing frauds on the
Treasury is to make the perpetrators of them liable to actions by private persons acting, if you please, under the strong stimulus of
personal ill will or the hope of gain. Prosecutions conducted by such
means compare with the ordinary methods as the enterprising pri-.
vateer does to the slow-going public vessel."

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

not only the qui tam aspect of the Act, but also the criminal provisions. The decision below treats the language
of § 5438 in such fashion that no criminal proceedings
could be brought against the respondents, a result to
which the policy on qui tam actions is immaterial even if
it exists or could properly be applied. This "qui tam
policy" cannot be used to detract from the meaning of the
language in the criminal section; and we cannot say that
the same substantive language has one meaning if criminal prosecutions are brought by public officials and quite
a different meaning where the same language is invoked
by an informer.
Congress has power to choose this method to protect
the government from burdens fraudulently imposed upon
it; to nullify the criminal statute because of dislike of
the independent informer sections would be to exercise
a veto power which is not ours. Sound rules of statutory
interpretation exist to discover and not to direct the Congressional will. True, § 5438 is criminal and for that
reason in interpreting so much of its language as it shares
in common with § 3490 we must give it careful scrutiny
lest those be brought within its reach who are not clearly
included; but after such scrutiny we must give it the fair
meaning of its intendment. Cf. United States v. Raynor,
302 U. S.540, 552.
* We think the conduct of these respondents comes well
within the prohibition of the statute, which includes
"every person who-... causes to be presented, for payment . . . any claim upon or against the Government
of the United States . . .knowing such claim to be
• . . fraudulent." This can best be seen upon consideration of the exact nature of respondents' relation to the
government. The contracts found to have been induced
by the respondents' frauds were made between them and
local municipalities and school districts of Allegheny
'County, 'Pennsylvania. A large portion of the money

(a). The jury and both courts have found that the contracts were obtained by a successfully executed conspiracy to remove all possible competition from "competitive
bidding." The bidding'itself was a federal requirement;
all bidders were fully advised that these were P. W. A.
projects; and many if not most of the respondents certified that their bids were "genuine and not sham or
collusive." While payment itself, in the sense of the
direct transferring of checks, was done in the name of local
authorities, monthly estimates for payment were submitted by the respondents to the local sponsors on
P. W. A. forms which showed the government's participation in the work and called attention to other federal statutes prohibiting fraudulent claims. It was a prerequisite
to respondents' payment by the local sponsors that these
estimates be filed, transmitted to, and approved by, the
P. W. A. authorities. Payment' was then made from a
joint construction bank- account containing both federal
and local funds. The work was done under constant federal supervision.
The government's money would never have been placed
in the joint fund for payment to respondents had its
agents known the bids were collusive. By their condict,
the respondents thus caused the government to pay claims
of the local sponsors in order that they might in turn
pay respondents under contracts found to have been
executed as the result of the fraudulent bidding. This
fraud did not spend itself with the execution of the contract. Its taint entered into every swollen estimate which
was the basic cause for payment of every dollar paid by
the P. W. A. into thejoint fund for the benefit of respondents. The initial fraudulent action and every step thereafter taken pressed ever to the ultimate goal-payment

of government money to persons who had caused it to be
defrauded.
Government money is as truly expended whether
by
checks drawn directly against the Treasury to the ultimate
recipient or by grants in aid to states. While at the time
of the passage of the original 1863 Act, federal aid to
states consisted primarily of land grants, in subsequent
years the state aid program has grown so that in 1941
approximately 10% of all federal money was distributed
in this form.' These funds are as much in need of protection from fraudulent claims as any other federal
money,' and the statute does not make the extent of their
safeguard dependent upon the bookkeeping devices used
for their distribution. The Senatorial sponsor of this bill
broadly asserted that its object was to provide protection
against those who would "cheat the United States." ' The
fraud here could not have been any more of an effort
to cheat the United States if there had been no state
intermediary.
The conclusion that the first clause of § 5438 includes
this form of "causing to be presented" a "claim upon or
against the government" is strengthened by consideration of the other clauses of the statute. Clause 2 includes
those who do the forbidden acts foe the purpose of "aiding
to obtain" payment of fraudulent claims; Clause 3 covers
"any agreement, combination or conspiracy" to defraud
the government by "obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or allowance of any false or fraudulent claim." These
provisions, considered together, indicate a purpose to
reach any person who knowingly assisted in causing the
government to pay claims which were grounded in fraud,

without regard to whether that person had direct contractual relations with the government.
The situation here is in no sense like that discussed in
United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S. 339, 345-347, where the
government acted solely as bailee and no person had any
claim against it for a payment. The Court in the Cohn
case held that there had been no "wrongful obtaining of
money . . . of the government's," while there has-been
such a "wrongful obtaining" here on claims which were
presented either directly or indirectly to the government
with full knowledge by the claimants of their fraudulent
basis.
We conclude that these acts are covered by the statute
under consideration.
Second. Previous to the filing of this action these
respondents were indicted for defrauding the government
and on a plea of nolo con tendere were fined $54,000. They
and the government, which has filed a brief amicus curiae
at our request, assert that the petitioner received his
information not by his own investigation, but from the
previous indictment; and both argue that §§ 3490-03
should not under such circumstances be construed as permitting suit by the petitioner. The petitioner denies
that he relied upon the information contained in the
indictment, asserts that he spent money in condu.t.ling an
investigation of his own, and claims that he presented
more evidence than the government had discovered.
Even if, as the government suggests, the petitioner
has contributed nothingto 'the discovery of this crime,
he has contributed much to accomplishing one of the
purposes for which the Act was passed. The suit results
in a net recovery to the government of $150,000, three
times as much as the fines imposed in the criminal proceedings; and this recovery was obtained at the risk of
a considerable loss to the petitioner since § 3491 explicitly

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

317 U. S.

provides that the informer must bear the risk of having
to pay the full cost of the litigation.
Neither the language of the statute nor its history lends
support to the contention made by respondents and the
government.. "Suits may be brought-and carried on by
any person," says the Act, and there are no words of
exception or qualification such as we are asked to find.'
The Senate sponsor of the bill ,explicitly pointed out that
he was not offering a plan aimed solely at rewarding the
conspirator who betrays his fellows, but that even a district attorney, who would presumably gain all knowledge
of a fraud from his official position, might sue as the
informer:
"The bill offers, in short, a reward to the informer who
comes into court and betrays his co-conspirator, if he be
such; but it is not confined to that class. Even the district attorney, who is required to be vigilant in the prosecution of such cases, may be also the informer, and entitle
himself to one half the forfeiture under the qui tam
clause, and to one half of the double damages which may
be recovered against the persons committing the act." "'
The government presses upon us strong arguments of
policy against the statutory plan, but the entire force of
these considerations is directed solely at what the government thinks Congress should have done rather than at
9There is. of course no reason why Congress could not, if it had
chosen to do so, have provided specifically for the amount of new
information which the informer must produce to be entitled to reward.
Simple informers who merely give information without formally
instituting actions may collect an award for aiding in the conviction of
narcotic law violators "if so directed by the court." 21 U. S. C. § 183.

approve awards to informers in contract labor cases. 8 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court.

what it did. It is said that effective law enforcement
requires that control of litigation be left to the Attorney
General; 1 that divided control is against the public interest; that the Attorney General might believe that war
interests would be injured by filing suits such as this; that
permission to outsiders to sue might bring unseemly races
for the opportunity of profiting from the government's
investigations; and finally that conditions have changed
since the Act was passed in 1863. But the trouble with
these arguments is that they are addressed to the wrong
forum. Conditions may have changed, but the statute
has not.
Furthermore, one of the chief purposes of the Act, which
was itself first passed in war time, was to stimulate action
to protect the government against war frauds.' To that
end, prosecuting attorneys were enjoined to be diligent in
enforcement of the Act's provisions, and large rewards
were offered to stimulate actions by private parties should
the prosecuting officers be tardy in bringing the suits.
The very fact that Congress passed this statute shows
that it concluded that other considerations of policy outweighed those now emphasized by the government; for
most of the arguments made here militate against any
informer action at all. Had the government filed a suit
"This consideration is apparently directed solely at the Department
of Justice's desire to control the institution of these actions rather
than their settlement. Sec. 3491 provides that the informer suits
"shall not be withdrawn or discontinued without the consent, in writing, of the judge of the court and the district attorney, first filed in
the case, setting forth their reasons for such consent." The authority
taus given the district attorney is presumably aimed at prevention of
fraudulent settlements.

prior to that instituted by this petitioner, a different
question would be presented. Cf. Francis v. United
States, 5 Wall. 338. Under the circumstances here, we
could not, without materially detracting from its clear
scope, decline to recognize the petitioner's right to sue
under the Act.
Third. As noted above, respondents had previously
been indicted and fined for defrauding the government
in connection with the same transactions for which they
are now being sued. They contend that the present action
should be barred because of the "double jeopardy" provision of the Fifth Amendment which provides that no
person shall "be subject for the same offense to be twice
put in jeopardy of life or limb." The previous indictment
was brought under a general statute dealing with conspiracy to defraud the government, 18 U. $. C. § 88, and
is clearly criminal in nature. For violation of it respondents were liable for a fine up to $10,000 or imprisonment
for-two years, or both. For failure to pay their fines, they
could have been sentenced to prison. Ex parte Watkins,
7 Pet. 568. The punishment given inthat action was not
intended to compensate the government, in any manner,
for damages it suffered as a result of successful execution
of the conspiracy. Respondents' contention was overruled by the District Court and was not considered in the
Court of Appeals. Itis now urged upon us as an independent ground of support for the judgment reached
below. Cf. Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U. S. 238, 245.
The application of the double jeopardy clause to particular cases has not been an easy task for the courts. The
subject has recently been thoroughly explored in Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, in which the Court analyzed the cases now pressed upon us and emphasized the
line between civil, remedial actions brought primarily to
protect the government from financial loss and actions
intended to authorize criminal punishment to vindicate

U. S. EX REL. MARCUS v. HESS.
537

Opinion of the Court.

public justice. Only the latter subject the defendant to
"jeopardy" within the constitutional meaning. Ibid., 397,
398. We may start therefore with the language of the
Mitchell case: "Congress may impose both a criminal and
a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission; for
the double jeopardy clause prohibits merely punishing
twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally,
for the same offense. The question for decision is thus
whether . , . [the statute in question] . . . imposes a
criminal sanction. That question is one of statutory construction." Ibid., 399. Is the action now before us, consisting of double damages and the $2,000 forfeiture, criminal or remedial?
It is enough for present purposes if we conclude that the
instant proceedings are remedial and impose a civil sanction. The statutes on which this suit rests make elaborate provision both for a criminal punishment and a civil
remedy. Violators of § 5438 may "be imprisoned at hard
labor for not less than one nor more than five years, or
fined not less than one thousand nor more than five thousand dollars." We cannot say that the remedy now before
us requiring payment of a lump sum and double damages
will do more than afford the government complete indemnity for the injuries done it. Helvering v. Mitchell, supra,
401.
It is, of course, well accepted that for one act a person
may be liable'both to pay damages and to suffer a criminal
penalty. Long ago, this Court said, "A man may be compelled to make reparations in damages to the injured party,
and be liable also to punishment for a breach of the public.
peace, in consequence of the same act; and may be said,
in common parlance to be twice punished for the same
offense." Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13,19, 20. Congress
has "power to give an action for damages to an individual
who suffers by breach of the law." ChattanoogaFoundry
v. Atlanta, 203 U. S.390, 396, 397. And it has this same

550

317 U. S.

power when it, rather than some private individual, is
injured by a fraud. Quite aside from its interest as preserver of the peace, the government when spending its
money has the same interest in protecting itself from fraudulent practices as it has in protecting any citizen from
frauds which may be practiced upon him. "The powers
of the United States as a sovereign, dealing with offenders
against their laws, must not be confounded with their
rights as a body politic. It would present a strange anomaly, indeed, if, having the power to make contracts and
hold property as other persons, natural or artificial, they
were not entitled to the same remedies for their protec*tion." Cotton v. United States, 11 How. 229, 231.
This remedy does notlose the quality of a civil action
because more than the precise amount of so-called actual
damage is recovered. As to the double damage provision, it cannot be said that there is any recovery in excess
of actual loss for the government, since in the nature of
the qui tam action the government's half of the double
damages is the amount of actual damages proved. But
in any case, Congress might have provided here as it did
in the anti-trust laws for recovery of "threefold damages
. . . sustained and the cost of suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee." 15 U. S. C. § 15.3 Congress could remain fully in the common law tradition and still provide
punitive damages. "By the common as well as by statute law, men are often punished for aggravated misconduct or lawless acts by means of civil action and the
damages inflicted by way of penalty or punishment given
to the party injured." Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363,
371. This Court has noted. the general practice in state
statutes of allowing double or treble or even quadruple
'3This Court in Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 236 U. S. 412,

damages. MissouriPacificRy. Co. v. Humes, 115 U. S. 512,
523. Punitive or exemplary damages have been- held
recoverable under a statute like this which combines provision for criminal punishment with others which afford
a civil remedy to the individual, injured. O'Sullivan v.
Felix, 233 U. S.318, 324, 325. The law can provide the
same measure of damage for the government as it can
for an individual.
It is argued that the $2,000 "forfeit and pay" provision
is"criminal" rather than "civil," even if the double damage feature is not. The words "forfeit and pay" relate
alike to the $2,000 sum and the double damages. The
use of the word "forfeit" in conjunction with the word
"pay" does not force the conclusion that the provision is
criminal. No one doubts that Congress could have accomplished the same result by authorizing "double" or
"quadruple" or "punitive" damages or a lump sum payment for attorney's fees, or by definition of the elements
of 'actual damages." Special consequence cannot be
drawn from the use of the word "forfeit." While this
might under other circumstances be an appropriate word
to -suggest a fine upon the failure to pay which an individual might be imprisoned, no such punishment is provided here upon default in payment. The words "forfeit
and pay" are wholly consistent with a civil action for
damages. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Nichols, 264
U. S.348, 350-352; cf. Hepner v. United States, 213 U. S.
103, 104-111.
it is true that "Punishment, in a certain and very limited gense, may be the result of the statute before us so far
as the wrong-doer is concerned," but this is not enough,
to label it as a criminal statute. Brady v. Daly, 175 U. S.
148, 157. We think the chief purpose of the statutes
here was to provide for restitution to the government of
inDney taken ,from it by fraud, and that the device of
doutble damages plus a specific sum was chosen to make

sure that the government would be made completely
whole. This conclusion is consistent with a statement
made immediately before final passage of the bill. A
Senator discussing these sections said: "The government
ought to have the privilege of coming upon him [a fraudulent contractor] or his estate and his heirs and'recovering
the money of which it is defrauded." 14 The inherent difficulty of choosing a proper specific sum which would give
full restitution was a problem for Congress.
Fourth. Section 3490 requires that the $2,000 forfeit
be paid for doing "any" of the acts prohibited by § 5438.
Before the District Court, petitioner contended that this
sum should be exacted for every form submitted by respondents in the course of their enterprise, while respondents argued that there should be merely one $2,000 sum
collected for all the acts done. The District Court concluded that the lump sum in damages should be assessed
for each separate P. W. A. project. Petitioner does not
object to this decision and we conclude that under the
circumstances o. this case each project can properly be
counted separately. The incidence of the fraud on each
additional project is as. clearly individualized as is the
theft of mail from separate bags in a post office, Ebeling
v. Morgan, 237 U. S. 625; and see Blockburger v. United
States, 284 U. S. 299. Cf. Gavieres v. United States, 220
U. S. 338, 342. Under respondents' view the lump sum
to be paid would be about $30.00 a project; and we cannot suppose that Congress meant thus to reduce the damages recoverable for respondents' fraud and thereby allow
them to spread the burden progressively thinner over projects
of which individually increased their profit.

Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY took no-part in the consideration or disposition of this case.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER,

concurring:

I agree with the decision of the Court. But it seems to
ihie that the plea of double jeopardy should be rejected on
a ground other than that taken by the Court. In all other
respects I join in its opinion.
This is a qui tam action under R. S. § 3490 to recover a
"forfeiture" and "double the amount of damages which the
United States may have sustained" by reason of the same
acts of fraud for. which the respondents were previously
indicted'under§ 37 of the Criminal Code, 18 U. S. C. § 88,
and for which substantial fines were imposed upon them.
The Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person shall
"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy
of life or limb." The respondents invoke this provision
as a bar to this suit; and as I understand its holding, the
Court rejects this plea of double jeopardy by treating the
present action as one merely to make the United States
whole for actual loss, and therefore without any. punitive elements. The Court reaches this conclusion by applying the distinction taken in Helvering v. Mitchell, 303
U. S.391, 400, between "sanctions that are remedial and
those that are punitive." The argument seems to run
thus: Double jeopardy means attempting to punish criminally twice; this is not an attempt to punish criminally
because it is a civil proceeding; it is-a civil proceeding because, as a matter of "statutory construction," it is a "civil
sanction" which is being enforced here; and the sanction
is "civil" because it is "remedial" and not "punitive" in
nature.

Such dialectical subtleties may serve well enough for
purposes of explaining away uncritical language in earlier
cases. See, for instance, United States v. Chouteau, 102
U. S. 603, Coffey v. United States, 116 U. S.436, and United
States v. La Franca,282 U. S.568. But they are too subtle
when the problem is one of safeguarding the humane
interests for the protection of which the double jeopardy
clause was written into the Fifth Amendment.
Punitive ends may be pursued in civil proceedings, and,
conversely, the criminal process is frequently employed
to attain remedial rather than punitive ends. It is for
this reason that scienter has not been deemed to be a requirement in some criminal prosecutions. "Many instances of this are to be found in regulatory measures in
the exercise of what is called the police power where the
emphasis 6f the statute is evidently upon achievement
of some social betterment rather than the punishment
of the crimes . . ." United States v. Balint, 258 U. S.
250, 252.
The protection against twice being punished for the
same offense should hardly be made to depend upon the
necessarily speculative judgment of a court whether a
"forfeiture" and "double the amount of damages which
the United States may have sustained" constitutes an
extra penalty, or merely an indemnity for loss suffered.
If that is the issue on which the protection against double
jeopardy turns, those who invoke the Constitution, as do
the respondents here, ought to be allowed to prove that,
as a matter of fact, the forfeiture and the double damages
are punitive because they exceed any amount that could
reasonably be regarded as the equivalent of compensation
for the Government's loss. That in civil actions pinitive
damages are, as'a matter of due process, sometimes allowed, see Shevlin-CarpenterCo. v. Minnesota, 218 U. S.
57, 69-70, or that there may be distinct penal and remedial
provisions for the same wrong, see O'Sullivan v. Felix, 233

U. S. 318, 325, does not help solve our present problem,
which arises when a second separate proceeding against
the same persons for the same misconduct results in a plea
based upon the double jeopardy clause. We must also
put to one side the doctrine of res judicata. This is largely
a judicial doctrine, though partly reflected in the Full
Faith and Credit Clause, Article IV, § 1, and is aimed at
avoiding the waste and vexation of relitigating issues
already decided between the same parties. The doctrine
of double jeopardy has a different history. It is part of
the protection of the Constitution against pressures and
penalties that offend civilized notions of justice.
In my view the proper approach to the problem of
double jeopardy in a situation like this, where Congress
has imposed two sanctions for misconduct, however one
may label them, and has provided for their enforcement
in two separate proceedings, is that which was taken by
Judge (later Mr. Justice) Blatchford in In re Leszynsky,
16 Blatchf. 9. The short of it is that where two such
proceedings merely carry out the remedies which Congress
has prescribed in advance for a wrong, they do not twice
put a man in jeopardy for the same offense. Congress
thereby merely allows the comprehensive penalties which
it has imposed to be enforced in separate suits instead of
in a single proceeding. By doing this Congress does not
impose more than a single punishment. And the double
jeopardyclause does not prevent Congress from prescribing such a procedure for the vindication of punitive
remedies.
This view commends itself to reason. It is confirmed
by history. For legislation of this character, providing
two sanctions for the same miscbnduct, enforceable in
separate proceedings, one a conventional criminal prosecution, and the other a forfeiture proceeding or a civil
action as upon a debt, was quite common when the Fifth
Amendment was framed by Congress. See, e. g., the ma-

terials referred to in In re Leszynsky, supra, at 16-19.
Like other specific provisions of the Constitution, the
double jeopardy clause must be read in the context of its
times. It would do violence to proper regard for the
framers of the Fifth Amendment to assume that they
contemporaneously enacted and continued to enact legislation that was offensive to the guarantees of the
double jeopardy clause which they had proposed for
ratification.
If it be suggested that a succession of separate trials for
the enforcement of a great number of criminal sanctions,
even though set forth in advance in a single statute, might
be a form of cruelty or oppression, the answer is that the
Constitution itself has guarded against such an attempt
"to wear the accused out by a multitude of cases with
accumulated trials," see Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S.
319, 328, by prohibiting "cruel and unusual punishments."
Amendment VIII. But short of that which would offend
the Eighth Amendment, statutes prescribing cumulative
remedies have been commonplaces in the history of federal
legislation. The Sherman Law, for example, allows four
means of redressing a single offense-criminal prosecution,
injunction, seizure of goods, and treble damages. if a
qui tam action like the one now before us were to be provided by Congress as a further deterrent against violation
of the Sherman Law, it would certainly be commonly regarded as an additional punishment. But the double
jeopardy clause would nevertheless not come into play.
It is for these reasons that I think the plea of double
jeopardy in this case cannot be sustained.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON,

dissenting:

I am constrained to dissent from the second division of
the opinion and from the conclusion it supports.
I cannot deny that on a literal reading the statute says
what the Court's opinion renders it to say. That being

-the case, one cannot be critical of those who stay close to
the words of 'the. statute because guiding principles as to.
where to depart and in what direction to depart and how
far to depart from the literal words of a statute are so
conflicting.
But that we have. in these matters considerable, although ill-defined, freedom is certain. I could not better
state my attitude toward the present statute as applied
to this case than in the language of the present Chief
Justice in United States v. Katz, 271 U. S. 354, 357:
"All laws are to be given a sensible construction; and
a literal application of a statute, which would lead to
absurd consequences, should be avoided whenever a reasonable application can be given to it, consistent with the
legislative purpose."
. Nor was he announcing unorthodox or unconventional
doctrine. In American Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister, 207
U. S. 284, 293, Mr. Justice Day said:
"But in construing a statute we are not always confined
to a literal reading, and may consider its object and purpose, the things with which it is dealing, and the condition of affairs which led to its enactment so as to effectuate
rather than destroy the spirit and force of the law which
the legislature intended to enact.
"It is true, and the plaintiff in error cites authorities
to the proposition, that where the words of an act are
clear and unambiguous they will control. But while seeking to gain the legislative intent primarily from the language used we must remember the objects and purposes
sought to be attained." 1
If ever we are justified in reading a statute, not narrowly as through a keyhole, but in the broad light of the
evils it aimed at and the good it hoped for, it is here. The

only disadvantage therefrom falls on one who sues, not
to be made whole for injuries he has sustained, or to
recover for goods he has delivered, or services he has performed, but solely to make profitable to himself the wrong
done by others. We should, of course, fully sustain informers in proceedings where Congress has utilized their
self-interest as an aid to law enforcement Informers
who disclose law violations even for the worst of motives
play an important part in making many laws effective.
But there is nothing in the text or history of this statute
which indicates to me that Congress intended to enrich a
mere busybody who copies a Government's indictment as
his own complaint and who brings to light no frauds not
already disclosed and no injury to the Treasury not
already in process of vindication.
In this case the Government investigated respondents
and on November 3, 1939, indicted them for conspiracy to
defraud. On January 5 and February 6, 1940, the de[post, p. 562] the Government indicted and pleas of nolo
contendere, and fines were imposed. While the criminal
case was still pending, and on January 25, 1940, petitioner
commenced his informer proceeding, the averments in
his complaint being substantially a copy of the indictment. It is not shown that he had any original information, that he had added anything by investigations of his
own, or that his recovery is based on any fact not disclosed by the Government itself. In the companion case
[post, p. 562] the Government indicted and pleas of nolo
contendere were entered on January 15, 1940, and two
weeks thereafter Ostrager filed his complaint alleging facts
substantially identical with those in the indictment, some
of the paragraphs being almost verbatim copies. We are
informed that these cases have already stimulated a number of other private individuals to intervene with similar
action after Government criminal proceedings had disclosed frauds.

JACKsON,

I am sure it was never in the mind of Congress to authorize this misuse of the statute. If ever there was a
case where the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life, it
is this. Construed to the letter as the Court does, it becomes an instrument of abuse and corruption which can
only be stopped by the timely intervention of Congress.
If it were construed according to its spirit to reward those
who disclose frauds otherwise concealed or who prosecute
frauds otherwise unpunished, it would serve a useful purpose in the enforcement of the law and protection of the
Treasury.
Since 1863 this law has been upon the statute books.
Never until now has the bar dreamed that it permitted
such use. When once it was-attempted to commence an
informer action under a similar statute after the Government had brought a civil action, this Court promptly limited the 'statute to preclude that sort of abuse. Francis.
v. United States, 5 Wall. 338: There was no specific language in the statute to support that court-made 'limitation, and although I find no specific language in this
statute to support another, I should now say that the
same limitation exists where the Government has already
possessed itself of the facts and disclosed them in criminal proceedings. This is what I think the profession has
generally assumed this statute to mean. If the statute
has all these eighty, years authorized this sort of proceeding, the legal profession of the United States has been
strangely unresponsive to a Congressional proffer of
windfall income.
We are justified in determining whether we will accept
a new interpretation not before sustained in the history of
this statute by reference to the condition of our own times
rather than to those of former ones. Nothing better
illustrates the difference between the conditions of 1863
and the present than the statement quoted by the Court,
made by the Senate sponsor of the Informer Act, "Even

the district attorney, who is required to be vigilant in the
prosecution of such cases, may be also the informer, and
entitle himself to one half the forfeiture under the qui
tam clause, and to one half of the double damages which
may be recovered against the persons committing the
*act." I do not understand the Court to hold that a
prosecuting attorney may now sue, but in construing the
statute as applied to the plaintiff now before us we must
not forget that the Senator was then speaking of lawenforcement in a nation which had not yet established a
Federal Department of Justice, which did nqt then have
a Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a Treasury investigating force, and in which the activities of the Federal
Government were so circumscribed that they had not
been found necessary. To accept the view of 1863 to
mean, that today law-enforcement officials could use
information gleaned in their investigations to sue as informers for their own profit, would make the law a downright vicious and corrupting one. Fortunately no one in
the executive department has ever suspected that such an
interpretation as the Court now indulges could be placed
upon this statute. If we were to add motives of personal
avarice to other prompters of qfficial zeal the time might
come when the scandals of law-enforcement would exceed the scandals of its violation.
But even as to non-officials, to permit the informer to
recover when he has not actually informed seems to me
an evil result unintended by the Act. The Court's interpretation means that the Government cannot institute a
criminal action that is not subject to seizure of some interloper who thereby wrests control of its course from the
Government itself. As lawyers not without experience
in the practicalities of law-enforcement, we know that the
trial of a criminal case can be wrecked by pre-trial of the
issues on the civil side of the court, particularly if the civil
trial is conducted by those not interested in the criminal

prosecution. By trial, by taking of depositions, by other
devices, the informer may force the premature disclosure
of the Government's case, and it is certain that by collusion between one who acts as an informer and the party
guilty of fraud the latter could obtain a disclosure of the
case against him. We know, too, that the chance of conviction may well be prejudiced if the defendant may go
before the jury and point to pending proceedings in which
adequate reparations will be made. Every person prosecuted for crime, as a part of the strategy of defeating conviction, wants civil actions brought against him, and
oftentimes wants to confess them or settle them in order
to plead that he has squared his accounts with the law.
Moreover, we know that the assets of men engaged in
criminal activities are rarely equal to the discharge of their
obligations and in that event by sharing the available
assets with an informer, the Government's financial recovery is diminished.
Also it has been found necessary to vest in someone the
power to compromise claims of the. Government, either
where they are of doubtful collectibility or where the claim
itself is of questionable validity. What becomes of the
Attorney General's control over litigation in this respect
if an informer may be admitted to share in the control of
the case and may act in collusion with the guilty party?
May he no longer make a compromise of a case that will
withstand subsequent attack by an informer?
It must be borne in mind that this is not a case where
we are adhering to a construction of a statute which has
been continuously applied over its long life. In such event
I should not unlikely join with my colleagues. This, however, is the case of a new construction upon an eighty-yearold statute, one so farfetched that no member of the bar
has ever before ventured to offer it in any reported case.'
