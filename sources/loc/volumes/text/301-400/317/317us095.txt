I think Congress could not and did not intend to exert
its granted power over interstate commerce upon what in
practice and common understanding is purely local activity, on the pretext that everything everybody does is a
contributing cause to the existence of commerce between
the States, and in that sense necessary to its existence.

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE SURROGATE'S COURT OF NEW YORK
COUNTY, NEW YORK.

No. 30.

Argued October 20, 1942.-Decided November 9, 1942.

1. Section 124 of the New York Decedent Estate Law, requiring that,
unless otherwise directed by the decedent's will, the burden of any
federal estate tax paid by the executor or administrator be apportioned among the beneficiaries of the estate, is not in conflict with
the federal estate tax law (Internal Revenue Code, § 800 et seq.),
and does not contravene the supremacy clause of the Federal Constitution. Pp. 97, 102.
The intent of Congress was that the federal estate tax should be
paid out of ihe estate as a whole, and that the distribution of the
remaining estate and the ultimate impact of the federal tax should
be determined under the state law. The provisions of the Revenue
Act of 1916 and subsequent Acts, their legislative history and administrative interpretation support this conclusion; and §§ 826
(b), 826 (c), and 826 (d) of the Internal Revenue Code do not
require a different result.
2. Nor does the fact that the ultimate incidence of the federal estate
tax is thus governed by state law violate the constitutional requirement of geographical uniformity in federal taxation. P. 102.

Opinion of the Court.

Testatrix, a resident of New York, died on October 8,
1937, leaving a will dated March 27, 1934, which, after
certain gifts of personal effects and small sums of cash,
bequeathed $300,000 outright to respondent Giovanni del
Drago, and created a trust of $200,000 for the benefit of
respondent Marcel del Drago during his life, with remainder over upon his death. The residue of testatrix's estate
was left in trust for the benefit of Giovanni during his life,
with remainder over upon his death. The will contained
no reference to the payment of estate or inheritance
taxes.
The executors paid approximately $230,000 on account
of the federal estate tax, and then asked the Surrogate, in
a petition for the settlement of their account, to determine whether that payment should be equitably apportioned among all the persons beneficially interested in the
estate3 pursuant to § 124 of the Decedent Estate Law.
Giovanni and Marcel del Drago answered, raising objections to the constitutionality of § 124. Petitioner, who
was appointed special guardiani to represenlt the interests
of the infant remaindermen under the residuary trust,
urged that the tax be apportioned. The Surrogate overruled the constitutional objections, and directed apportionment.2 The New York Court of Appeals, by a divided
court, I-eversed, holding § 124 repugnant to the federal
estate tax law-particularly to § 826 (b) of the Internal
Revenue Code-and in violation of the supremacy (Art.
VI, cl. 2) and the uniformity (Art. I, § 8, cl. 1) clauses of
the Constitution.' The importance of the question moved
us to grant certiorari.
We are of opinion that Congress intended that the federal estate tax should be paid out of the estate as a whole,

and that the applicable state law as to the devolution of
property at death should govern the distribution of the
remainder and the ultimate impact of the federal tax; accordingly, § 124 is not in conflict with the federal estate
tax law. This conclusion is based upon the provisions of
the Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, and subsequent
acts, their legislative history and their administrative
interpretation.
In the Act of 1916 Congress turned from the previous
century's inheritance tax upon the receipt of property by
survivors (see Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41; Scholey v.
Rew, 23 Wall. 331) to an estate tax upon the transmission
of a statutory "net estate" by a decedent. That act directed payment by the executor in the first instance, § 207,
but provided also for payment in the event that he failed
to pay, § 208. It did not undertake in any manner to
specify who was to bear the burden-of the tax. Its legislative history indicates clearly' that Congress did not
contemplate that the Government would be interested in
the distribution of the estate after the tax was paid, and
that Congress intended that state law should determine
the ultimate thrust of the tax.4 That Congress, from
Congressman Cordell Hull, one of the supporters of the 1916 Act
and its reputed draftsman, declared: "Under the general laws of descent the proposed estate tax would be first taken out of the net estate
before distribution, and distribution made under the same rule that
would otherwise govern it. Where the decedent makes a will he can
allow the estate tax to fasten on his net estate in the same manner, or
if he objects to this equitable method of imposing it upon the entire net
estate before distribution he can insert a residuary clause or other
provision in his will, the effect of which would more or less change the
incidence of the tax." 53 Cong. Rec. 10657.
Congressman Kitchin, Chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, stated: "We levy an entirely different system of inheritance taxes. We levy the tax on the transfer of the flat or whole
net estate. We do not follow the beneficiaries and see how much this
one gets and that one gets, and what rate should be levied on lineal

1916 onward, has understood local law as governing the
distribution of the estate after payment of the tax (with
the limited exceptions created by § 826 (c) and (d) of the
Internal Revenue Code, to be discussed presently) is confirmed by § 812 (d) of the Code, dealing with charitable
deductions, which recognizes that estate taxes may be payable in whole or in part out of certain bequests, etc., "by
the law of the jurisdiction under which the estate is administered." " The administrative interpretation has been
in accord,6 and that hag been the understanding of the
federal courts,7 and of some state courts.8
and what on collateral relations, but we simply levy on the net estate.
This also prevents the Federal Government, through the Treasury Department, going into the courts contesting and construing wills and
statutes of distribution." 53 Cong. Rec. app. p. 1942.
5Section 812 (d) was first enacted as § 303 (a) of the 1924 Act, 43
Stat. 253. It was repealed by § 323 (a) of the 1926 Act, 44 Stat. 9,
and ree'nacted by § 807 of the 1932 Act, 47 Stat. 169. The committee
reports accompanying the 1932 Act recognize that local law determines
the ultimate incidence of the federal estate tax. H. Rep. No. 708, 72d

Opinion of the Court.

In reaching a contrary result,, the court below relied primarily upon § 826 (b).' But that section does not direct
how the estate is to be distributed, nor does it determine
who shall bear the ultimate burden of the tax. As pointed
out before, while the federal statute normally contemplates payment of the tax before the estate is distributed,
§ 822 (b) of the Code, provision is made for collection of
the tax if distribution should precede payment, § 826 (a).
If any distributee is thus called upon to pay the tax,
§ 826 (b) provides that such person "shall be entitled to
reimbursement out of any part of the estate still undistributed or by a just and equitable contribution by the
persons whose interest in the estate of the decedent would
have been reduced if the tax had been paid before the
distribution of the estate." By' that section Congress
intended to protect a distributee against bearing a greater
burden of the tax than he would have sustained had the

(b) Reimbursement out of estate. If the tax or any part thereof
is paid by, or collected out of that part of the estate passing to or in
the possession of, any person other than the executor in his capacity
as such, such person shall be entitled to reimbursement out of any part
of the estate still undistributed or by a just and equitable contribution
by the persons whose interest in the estate of the decedent would have
been reduced if the tax had been paid before the distribution of the
estate or whose interest is subject to equal or prior liability for the payment of taxes, debts, or other charges against the estate, it being the
purpose and intent of this subchapter that so far as is practicable and
unless otherwise directed by the will of the decedent the tax shall be
paid out of the estate before its distribution.

Opinion of the Court.

tax been carved out of the estate prior to distribution;
any doubt that this is the proper construction is removed
by the concluding clause of the section, specifically stating
that it is "the purpose and intent of this subchapter that
so far as is practicable and unless otherwise directed by
the will of the decedent the tax shall be paid out of the
estate before its distribution." Section 826 (b) does not
command that the tax is a non-transferable charge on the
residuary estate; to read the phrase "the taxshall be paid
out of the estate" as meaning "the tax shall be paid out
of the residuary estate" is to distort the plain language of
the section. and to create an obvious fallacy. For in some
estates there may be no residue, or else one too small to
satisfy the tax; resort must then be had to state law to
determine whether personalty or realty, or general, demonstrative or special legacies abate first. In short. § 826 (b),
especially when cast in the background of Congressional
intent, discussed before, simply provides that. if the tax
mast be collected after distribution, the final impact of
the tax shall be the same as though it had first been taken
out of the estate before distribution, thus leaving to
state law the determination of where that final impact
shall be.
Respondents also rely on § 826 (c)," ° authorizing the
executor to collect the proportionate share of the tax from
the beneficiary of life insurance includable in the gross
estate by reason of § 811 (g), and § 826 (d)," authorizing
similar action against a person receiving property subject
to a power which is taxable under § 811 (f), as forbidding
further apportionment by force of state law against other

distributees. 1' But these sections deal with property
which does not pass through the executor's hands, and the
Congressional direction with regard to such property is

wholly compatible with the intent to leave the determination of the burden of the estate tax to state law as to
properties actually handlkd as part of the estate by the
executor.
Since § 124 of the New York Decedent Estate Law is
not n conflict with the federal estate tax statute, it does
not contravene the supremacy clause of the Constitution.
Nor does the fact that the ultimate incidence of the federal
estate tax is governed by state law violate the requirement
of geographical uniformity. Cf. Phillips v. Commissioner,
