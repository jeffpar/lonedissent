over the debtor's "right or the equity of redemption where
the period of redemption has not or had not expired."
Wright v. Logan, 315 U. S. 139, 142; and see State Bank
of Hardinsburgv. Brown, ante, pp. 138-140. Looking at
the scope and purpose of § 75, we think petitioner's interest in the mortgaged property, whether it be denominated
a property right or a privilege of redemption, is an interest
intended to be subject to the court's jurisdiction and is
capable of administration in a farmer-debtor proceeding.
See Mangus v. Miller, ante, p. 178.
It follows that petitioner's right of redemption was within the jurisdiction of the court; that she was entitled to
initiate a new proceeding for the administration of the
property in farmer-debtor proceedings, and to ask that her
petition and schedules be allowed to stand as the petition
and schedules in such a proceeding.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The questions for decision are:
(1) Whether the lien for federal estate taxes authorized
by § 315 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 80,
attaches to the interest of the decedent in an estate by the
entirety.
(2) Whether the lien is required to be recorded under the
provisions of R. S. § 3186, as amended, in order to give it
superiority to the lien of a mortgagee who acquired his
mortgage for value in good faith without knowledge of
the tax lien.

331

Opinion of the Court.

(3) Whether § 315 (a), so applied as to give the lien
superiority over such subsequent mortgages, offends the
Fifth Amendment.
The Government brought the present.suit in the district
court pursuant to R. S. § 3207, to foreclose an asserted
lien for estate taxes assessed under § 302 (e) upon certain
parcels of real estate. The real estate had been owned at
the time of his death by decedent and his wife as tenants
by the entirety. Following his death the real estate was
not included as a part of his estate in computing the
federal estate tax. Prior to assessment or payment of the
tax, the parcels of real estate in question were mortgaged,
some by decedent's widow and others by his children, to
petitioner who acted without knowledge of the Government's asserted lien or claim for taxes. Default in payment of the mortgage indebtedness having occurred, petitioner bought in the mortgaged property on foreclosure
sale. The trial court found that petitioner acquired the
mortgages in good faith and for value.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed an
estate. tax deficiency against decedent's estate by reason
of the failure to include the value of the estate by the
entiret-_ in the computation of the tax, which the
Board 6i Tax Appeals sustained. The Government then
brought the present proceeding to enforce the lien. The
district court held that the tax lien, although unrecorded,
was superior to the mortgage lien and to local, state and
county liens for taxes, which had accrued after the death
of decedent. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 127
F. 2d 64. We were moved to grant certiorari, post, p. 607,
by the importance of the questions presented to the adntinistration of the revenue laws.
Section 315 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 provides in
part that:
"Unless the tax is sooner paid in full, it shall be a lien
for ten years upon the gross estate of the decedent, exctpt

332

3OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

317 U. S.

that such part of the gross estate as is used for the payment of charges against the estate and expenses of its
administration, allowed by any court having jurisdiction
thereof, shall be divested of such lien. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax liability' of an estate has
been fully discharged or provided for, he may, under regulations prescribed by him with the approval of the Secretary, issue his certificate, releasing any or all property of
such estate from the lien herein imposed."
The lien attaches at the date of the decedent's death, since
the gross estate is determined as of that date and the
estate tax itself becomes an obligation of the estate at that
time without assessment. See Hertz v. Woodman, 218
U. S. 205,. 220; Ithaca Trust Co. v. UnitedStates, 279 U. S.
151, 155; United States v. Ayer, 12 F. 2d 194; Rosenberg
v. McLaughlin, 66 F. 2d 271. That the lien attaches at
the decedent's death Without necessity for assessment or
demand is implicit in the proviso that such part of the
estate as is used for payment of charges against the estate
and expenses of administration shall be "divested of the
lien."
Petitioner urges that since the lien here asserted is "upon
the gross estate of decedent" it does not attach to the land
held by the entirety which passed to the decedent's widow,
not as a part of his estate but by her right to survivorship.
But this argument disregards the fact that the lien is for
the particular tax imposed by § 302 of the Revenue Act
of 1926 upon "the value of the gross estate of decedent"
at the time of his death, including "the value at the time
of his death of all property, real or personal,. . . (e) to
the extent of the interest therein held . . . as tenants by
the entirety by the decedent and spouse .
Since the lien authorized by § 315 (a) is for the tax which
in its computation includes as a part of the taxable estate
the value of the estate by the entirety, see Tyler V. United
States. 281 U.. S.497, we think it too plain for argument

DETROIT BANK v. UNITED STATES.
329

333

Opinion of the Court.

that the lien extends to the estate as thus defined and
made the base on which the tax is computed. The gross
estate of decedent within the meaning of §315 (a) is the
estate or property on which the tax chargeable to decedent's estate is computed. Congress, in §314 (b), similarly denominated the proceeds of insurance on the life
of decedent payable to beneficiaries as "a part of the gross
estate" in providing for recovery from the beneficiaries of
their pro rata shares of the estate tax. We cannot impute
to Congress an intention not disclosed by the statute or its
legislative history to exclude from the tax lien property
which it, directs to be included in the decedent's gross
estate for the purpose of computing the tax.
Nor can we conclude, as petitioner argues, that the lien
for estate tax authorized by § 315 (a) is subject to the
earlier provision for recording tax liens in R. S. § 3186.
This section, so far as now relevant, provides,
-"That if any person liable to pay any tax neglects or
refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount shall
be a lien in favor of the United States from the time when
the assessment list was received by the Collector, except
when otherwise provided, until paid . . . upon all prop-

erty and rights to property belonging to such person:
Provided, however, that such lien shall not be valid as,
against any mortgagee, purchaser, or judgment creditor
until notice of such lien shall be filed by the Collector in
the office of the clerk of the district court of the
district within which the property subject to such lien is
situated

. .

The section contains a further proviso that whenever any
state, by appropriate legislation, makes provision for the
filing of such notice in the office of a registrar or recorder
of deeds, "then such liens shall not be valid in that state
against any mortgagee, purchaser or judgment creditor
until such notice shall be filed" in the appropriate office.

334

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

317 U. S.

Michigan has made provision for filing notices of such tax
liens in the offices of the registers of deeds iuD,
the counties
of the state. § 3746, Compiled Laws of Michigan, 1929.
The part of R. S. § 3186 imposing the lien was enacted
in 1866, 14 Stat. 107. The provision for filing notice of
government tax liens was added by amendment of March
4, 1913, 37 Stat. 1016. Before the amendment this Court
had held in United States v. Snyder, 149 U. S. 210; cf.
United States v. Curry, 201 F. 371, 374, that in the absence
of a federal statute requiring government tax liens to be
recorded they are superior to subsequent mortgages.
Petitioner contends that Congress, in enacting § 209
of the Revenue Act of 1916, which, with amendments,
became § 315 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, did not impose an independent lien but merely made expressly applicable to the federal estate tax the lien created by R. S.
§ 3186, modifying that lien in some respects as will be
further noted. It urges that save where inconsistent with
the express terms of § 315 (a), all provisions of R. S.
§ 3186 are made applicable to the estate tax lien by reason
*of § 211 of the Revenue Act of 1916, which provides:
"That all administrative, special, and general provisions
of law, including the laws in relation to the assessment and
collection of taxes not heretofore specifically repealed are
hereby made to apply to this title so far as applicable and
not inconsistent with its provisions."
.But we think that the differences between R. S. § 3186
and § 315 (a), and their legislative history as separate enactments, indicate, that each was intended to operate
independently of the other.
Section 3186 refers only to liens which are made sudh by
that section. Section 315 (a) authorizes the lien for estate
-taxes and makes no reference to R. S. § 3186 or to any
requirement for recurding notice of the lien. The lien of
R. S. § 3186 is upon all the property of the person liable

DETROIT BANK v. 'UNITED STATES.
329

Opinion of the Court.

for the tax, while the lien of § 315 (a) attaches only to the
property included in and taxed as the gross estate not used
to pay administration expenses. The lien of R. S. § 3186
continues until the tax liability is paid while the lien of
§ 315 (a) continues for ten years from the death of the
decedent. Of particular significance is the difference in
time when the liens attach under the two sections. Under
R. S. § 3186 there is no lien and no notice can be recorded
until there has been a demand by the collector and a refusal
to pay it by the taxpayer. Under § 315 (a), as has been
stated, the lien arises on the death of the deedent and
becomes effective against purchasers and mortgagees without assessment or demand and obviously before it would
be possible to record a notice of lien under the provisions
of R. S. § 3186.
Since the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1916, R. S.
§ 3186 has been amended four times,1 and § 209 of the
Revenue Act of 1916 (which became § 315 (a) of the 1926
Act) has been amended twice and twice reenacted without
amendment.2 With one exception, in none of the amendments or reenactments of the one section was any reference
made to the other. Section 409 of the Revenue Act of
1921 added a provision to the estate tax lien section authorizing the Commissioner under certain circumstances to
release the lien. A similar provision was not added to
R. S. § 3186 until the Revenue Act of 1928. By § 613 of
that Act, § 3186 was amended to provide for such release,
the amendment, by subsection (f), being made applicable
Act of Feb. 26, 1925, 43 Stat. 994; Revenue Act of 1928, § 613, 45
Stat. 875; Revenue Act of 1934, § 509, 48 Stat. 757; Revenue Act of
1939, § 401, 53 Stat. 882. The section is now §§ 3670-77 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

to "a lien in respect of any internal revenue tax, whether
or not the lien was imposed by this section."
At the same time, the release provision of § 315 (a) was
repealed. By § 809 of the Revenue Act of 1932, however,
the latter was reenacted, it having been discovered that
there was need for a provision authorizing release of
the estate tax lien prior to assessment. H. Rep. No. 708,
72d Cong. 1st Sess. 50. Moreover it is not without significance that Congress, in enacting a gift tax in the Revenue Act of 1932, provided in § 510 of that Act that the
gift tax should be a lien on the property passing to the
donee, using words almost identical to these 4f § 315 (a).
The Committee Reports state that "by this provision there
is imposed a lien additional to that imposed by section
3186 of the Revised Statutes." H. Rep. No. 708, 72d
Cong. 1st Sess. 30; Sen. Rep. No. 665, 72d Cong. 1st Sess.
42. This history and the differences between the provisions already noted, would seem to compel the conclusion that § 315 (a) was intended to operate independently of R. S. § 3186, and that the estate tax lien created
by the former is not subject to the latter's requirement of
recordation.
Sections 313 (b) and (c) lend support to this conclusion.
Subsection (b) sets up a procedure whereby the Commissioner may be required to certify the amount of the tax
due and in that event subsection (c) releases any part of
the gross estate subsequently acquired by a bona fide purchaser, from any lien for a deficiency in the tax which may
be thereafter assessed-a procedure which would have
afforded adequate protection to petitioner from any deficiency lien in this case. These provisions not only recognize that the lien comes into existence before the tax is
assessed or demanded, but they are unnecessary and inoperative if notice of the lien is required by R. S. § 3186 to
be recorded.

DETROIT BANK v. UNITED STATES.
329

337

Opinion of the Court.

It is evident from a comparison of the two sections that
Congress, in providing for the-estate tax lien, has proceeded on the assumption that in the case of the tax on
property passing at death and which is distributed in
consequence of the death, there is greater need of a lien
in advance of assessment and demand for payment of the
tax than in the case of other types of taxes; and that there
is less need for protection of third persons by a recorded
notice of the lien when the property passing at death is
normally dealt with by probate and estate tax proceedings
of public notoriety.
This is emphasized by the provisions of § 315 (b) which
relieve bona fide purchasers of property transferred inter
vivos by the decedent in contemplation of death, from
the lien which in the case of property transferred at death
is enforcible against such purchasers. This provision,
like § 313 (c) would be unnecessary if R. S. § 3186 required
notice of the lien to be recorded. The conclusion seems
inescapable that the two sections apply independently,
each of the other, at least to the extent that notice of the
lien authorized by § 315 (a) is not required to be recorded
under R. S. § 3186. Whether the lien created by § 315 (a)
could be recorded by the procedures established by § 3186
and state statutes enacted in accordance with that section
need not now be decided.
Petitioner also insists that the statute violates the Fifth
Amendment by authorizing an unrecorded tax lien against
the property mortgaged to it and withholding such a lien
against innocent purchasers of property which a decedent
had trhnsferred inter vivos in contemplation of death.
Unlike the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifth contains no
equal protection clause and it provides no guaranty
against discriminatory legislation by Congress. LaBelle

Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S.548, 584-585; Sunshine

Statement of the Case.

317 U.S.

Lerner Stores Co., 314 U. S. 463, 468. Even if discriminatory legislation may be so arbitrary and injurious in
character as to violate the due process -clause of the Fifth
Amendment, see Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra,
585; Currin v. Wallace, 306 U. S. 1, 13, no such case is
presented here.
For reasons already indicated we think there is adequate
basis for the distinction made by the Statute between
innocent purchasers of property which passes at the decedent's death'and those of property which he conveyed in
his lifetime in anticipation of death. As we have pointed
out, the estate tax status of property passing at decedent's
death is more readily ascertained than that bf property
which he has conveyed away in his lifetime and which so
far as normal probate and tax proceedings are concerned
would not appear to be related to his estate or taxable as
a part of it. We do not find in such a classification any
basis for saying that the discrimination in the statute is
so arbitrary as to violate due process.
