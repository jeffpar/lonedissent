FISHER v. WHITON.

Statement of the Case.
FISHER, RECEIVER, v. WHITON, EXECUTRIX,
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE.

No. 85. Argued November 16, 1942.-Decided December 7, i942.
1. The question as to when the period of limitations begins to run
against a receiver's claim upon an assessment levied by the Comptroller of the Currency on stockholders of an insolvent national bank
is a federal question; and, in the present case, the question was duly
raised and preserved by appropriate exceptions and assignments of
error. P. 220.
2. It is within the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency to
extend from time to time the date fixed for payment of assessments
against stockholders of insolvent national banks. Nothing in the
pertinent legislation, 12 U. S. C. §§ 63, 64, 66, 191, 192, prevents
such extension. P. 220.
3. The receiver of an insolvent national bank did not have a complete
and present cause of action to enforce the liability of a deceased
stockholder until the date finally fixed by the Comptroller of the
Currency, after extensions of dates previously fixed, for payment;
and, in this view, the receiver's claim against the stockholder's
estate was not barred by §§ 8225 and 8604 of the Tennessee Code.
Pufahl v. Estate of Parks, 299 U. S. 217, distinguished. P. 220.
4. The desirability of closing decedents' estates speedily does not warrant limiting the power of the Comptroller of the Currency to extend
the time for payment of an assessment against stockholders of insolvent national banks. P. 221.
25 Tenn. App. 230, 155 S. W. 2d 882, reversed.

UPON a petition for rehearing, an earlier order of this
Court denying certiorari, 316 U. S. 691, was vacated and
certiorari was granted, 316 U. S.707, to review a decree of
an intermediate state court which affirmed a decree of the
state Chancery Court barring on the ground of limitations
a claim by the receiver of an insolvent national bank upon
a stockholder's assessment. The highest court of the
State denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

Messrs. John F. Anderson and S. Bartow Strang, with

MR. JUSTICE M

RPIiy

delivered the opinion of thp

Court.
In Rawlings v. Ray, 312 U. S. 96, we decided that state
statutes of limitations govern the time within which to
enforce the liability imposed upon stockholders of insolvent national banks by assessments levied by the Comptroller of the Currency; that the question as to the time
when a complete and present cause of action arises in the
receiver to enforce that liability by suit is a federal question; that nothiig in the applicable statutes, 12 U. S. C.
§§ 63, 64, 191, 192, prevents the Comptroller in making an
assessment from fixing a later date for payment; and,
that suit cannot be instituted prior to the date fixed for
payment and a state statute of limitations does not begin
to run until that date. In this case the Comptroller extended the time for payment beyond the date 'originally
set, and .we must decide whether time runs from .the first
or the final date fixed for payment.
Petitioner is the successor to the original receiver for the
insolvent First National Bank of Chattanooga. On April
19, 1934, the Comptroller of the Currency levied an assessment against the Bank's stockholders for 100% of the
par value of their shares, payable on May 26, 1934.1 By
successive orders entered on May 17, 1934, June 19, 1934,
June 22, 1934, and March 11, 1935, the original maturity
date of May 26, 1934, was extended to make the assess1 Thbis is the aate given in the pleadings. However, the opinions of
the courts below refer to May 23, 1934, as the first date fixed for
payment.

ment payable on April 15, 1935. Notice of the assessment
was given to all stockholders on March 13. 1935.
Respond.nt as successor to the original executrix, represents the estate of C. C. Nottingham, which held stock
of the Bank, to the extent of $138,000 par Value, at the
time of the assessment. No steps were taken to enforce
against the estate the liability imposed by the assessment
until August 2, 1935, when petitionei' predecessor filed
an answer and a cross-bill in an action commenced on
July 24,1935, in the Chancery Court for Hamilton County,
Tennessee, by the original executrix to require all creditors to appear and establish their claims.
The Chancery Court held that petitioner's assessment
claim accrued on the date first fixed for payment, May 23,
1934,2 and that the claim was barred by § 8225 of the
Tennessee Code,' fixing a period of "six months from the
date the cause of action thereon accrued" within which to
enforce previously unmatured claims against decedents.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying upon § 8604 of the
Code' as well as § 8225. 25 Tenn. App. 230, 155 S. W. 2d
882. The Supreme Court of the State denied a petition for
writ of certiorari. The importance of the question in the
administration of insolvent national banks 'and a conflict
with the decision in Strasburgerv. Schram, 68 App. D. C.
87, 93 F. 2d 246, caused us to grant certiorari.

Note 1, supra.
Michie's Tennessee Code of 1938, Annotated.
' "Sec. 8604.
Time runs from accrtal of right, not demand. When
a right exists, but a demand is necessary to entitle the party, to an
action, the limitation commences from the time the plaintiff's right to
make the demand was completed, and not from the date of the
demand."
5The double liability feature of national bank stock has been eliminated where there has been compliance with the provisions of the
statute, but this does not apply to banks in difficuty prior to July 1,
1937, except as to stock issued after June 16. 1933. 12 U. S. C. § 64 (a).

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

317 U. S.

Our starting point, of course, is Rawlings v. Ray, supra.
That case adequately disposes of respondent's contention
that no federal question is presented by this case; whether
petitioner's cause of action was complete on May 26, 1934,
or April 15, 1935, is a federal question, 312 U. S. at p. 98,
which was duly raised and preserved by appropriate exceptions and assignments of error. And, even as we found
nothing in the applicable statutes to question "the. authority of the Comptroller in making an assessment to fix
a later date for its payment," id. at p. 99, we see nothing.
in the pertinent legislation, 12 U. S. C. §§ .63, 64, 66, 191,
192, forbidding the Comptroller to extend the date fixed
for payment within reasonable limits from time to time.
Such extensions seem to be in accord with a long established practice designed to achieve the desirable result of
avoiding excessive and unnecessary assessments.' See
Strasburgerv. Schram, 68 App. D. C. 87, 89; 93 F. 2d 246,
248. Compare Korbly v. Springfield Institution for Savings, 245 U. S. 330, where, in upholding the power of the
Comptroller to withdraw one assessment and levy a later
one, we emphasized the desirability of a large measure of
administrative discretion and flexibility in the adjustment
of assessments to the "exigencies of each case." p. 333.
Since the Comptroller has power to extend the time for
payment, respondent was not required to pay until April
15, 1935, and prior to that time suit could not be instituted against her. Rawlings v. Ray, supra, p. 98. While
the receiver enforces the liability created by the assessment, 12 U. S. C. §§ 191, 192, he does so subject to the direction of the Comptroller, Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall.
The record does not disclose the reason for the extensions of time
here, but it appears that they were made at the request of a stock*holders' committee which protested the necessity of a 100% assessment
and asked for a reappraisal of the Bank's assets. See Coffey v. Fisher,
100 F. 2d 51, 52, involving the same assessment here considered.

FISHER v. 'WHITON.

Opiniofn of the Court.

498, 505. So petitioner did not have a complete and
present cause of action until April 15, 1935. Since the
words "from the date the cause of action accrued thereon,"
as used in § 8225 of the Tennessee Code, seem to have their
usual meaning and refer to the time when suit may be
instituted,' it follows that petitioner's claim, filed on
August 2, 1935, was in time.
Respondent stresses § 8604 of the Code.' But, as
pointed out above, petitioner had no right to demand payment before April 15, 1935, so, even if § 8604 applies, it
does not bar petitioner's claim.
Respondent mistakenly relies upon Pufahl v. Estate of
Parks, 299. U. S. 217, which has no application, because
in that case "we were not considering or deciding the
question of the application of a statute of limitations to
a suit against a stockholder upon an assessment made by
the Comptroller where payment was not required before
a specified date, prior to which no suit could be maintained." Rawlings v. Ray, supra, p. 99.
We are not unmindful that it is desirable to close
decedents' estate speedily, but there is no warrant in the
federal legislation for allowing that consideration to limit
the power of the Comptroller to extend the time for payment of an assessment.
The judgment below is reversed and the cause remanded
for further proceedings not. inconsistent with this
opinion.
