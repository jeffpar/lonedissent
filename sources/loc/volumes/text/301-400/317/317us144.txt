PFISTER v. NORTHERN ILLINOIS FINANCE

CORP. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
Nos. 26 and 27. Argued October 19, 1942.-Decided
November 16, 1942.
1. The time within which a petition may be filed to review an order
of a conciliation commissioner, fixing rental or granting stay or directing sale, is governed by § 39 (c) of the Bankruptcy Act and is
fixed at ten days after the entry of the order "or within such extended
time as the court may for cause shown allow." P. 147.
2. The ten-day period for filing a petition to review a commissioner's
order under § 39 (c) is not extended by a petition for rehearing which
is denied by the commissioner without re~xamination of the basis of
the original order. P. 150.
3. The ten-day period prescribed by § 39 (c) is a limitation on the
right of the aggrieved party to appeal, but not a limitation on the
jurisdiction of the reviewing court to act. The District Court in the
exercise of sound discretion can review orders on petitions to review
filed after the ten-day period has run. P. 152.
4. In this case, the commissioner entertained out-of-time petitions to
rehear orders fixing rental, granting stay and directing sale and denied
the petitions upon the ground that they were inadequate to induce
a reexamination of the merits of the orders they sought to re-open.
Held, on the facts of this case, that the District Court did not err in
refusing an out-of-time review of the merits of the original orders.

Opinion of the Court.

MR.JUSTICE

REED delivered the opinion of the Court.

This certiorari, 315 U. S. 795, brings here certain rulings
on the right of petitioner, a farmer-debtor, to have reviewed
the orders of a conciliation commissioner ' under § 75 of
the Bankruptcy Act. This section deals with Agricultural
Compositions and Extensions. A conflict of circuits as to
whether the ten-day period for filing a petition.for review
of a commissioner's order was a limitation on the power
of the reviewing court to act or on the right of an
aggrieved party to appeal,' impelled us to grant our writ.

In addition to this point, numerous other questions as
to the right to review are presented which ma be fairly
subsumed under petitioner's allegations of error below:
(1) because the courts did not apply the limitation in the
proviso of 75 (s) ' instead of that in 39 (c); (2) because
1 The referee appointed by the District Court for handling agricultural compositions is known as a conciliation commissioner. § 75 (a)(r). When the farmer seeks bankruptcy under (s) the conciliation
commissioner acts as referee. § 75 (s) (4). 49 Stat. 942.
2 52 Stat. 840, 858.
Section 39 (c). "A person aggrieved by an order of a referee may,
within ten days after the entry thereof or within such extended time
as the court may for cause shown allow, file with the referee a petition
for review of such order by a judge and serve a copy of such petition
upon the adverse parties who were represented at the hearing ..
'49 Stat. 942, 943.
Section 75 (s). "Any farmer failing to obtain the acceptance of
a majority in number and amount of all creditors whose claims are
affected by a composition and/or extension proposal, or if he feels
aggrieved by the composition and/or extension, may amend his petition or answer, asking to be adjudged a bankrupt. Such farmer may,
at the same time, or at the time of the first hearing, petition the
court that all of his property, wherever located, whether pledged,
encumbered, or unencumbered, be appraised, and that his unencumbered exemptions, and unencumbered interest or equity in his exemptions, as prescribed by State law, be set aside to him, and that he be

petitions for rehearing of a. conciliation commissioner's
orders, which petitions were entertained and denied, were
not held to extend the period for review; and (3) because
the order of stay approved by the Commissioner under
75 (s) (2) was for less than the statutory period of three
years from the entry of the stay order.
After failing to obtain a composition or extension under
§ 75 (a) to (r) of the Bankruptcy Act, the petitioner, a
farmer, sought relief under § 75 (s). In due course on
August 10, 1940, he petitioned the Commissioner to fix
his rent, permit him to retain'his property and establish
a stay or moratorium. In the petition he stated that his
,moratorium began to run on April 26, 1940. On August
13, 1940, the Commissioner, after hearing evidence upon
its amount, ordered that the rental be fixed at a sum
named, and directed a stay from April 26, 1940, as the petitioner suggested. An appraisal was approved by a separate order on the same day, August 13. On September 7,
1940, orders were entered for the sale of certain. property,
chiefly livestock, stipulated by the debtor to be perishable
under § 75 (s) (2). After the ten days fixed for review
under 39 (c), petitions for rehearing on the orders fixing
allowed to retain possession, under the supervision and control of the
court', of any part or parcel or all of the remainder of his property,
including his encumbered exemptions, under the terms and conditions

set forth in this section. Upon such a request being made, the referee,
under the jurisdiction

of the court, shall designate and appoint ap-

praisers, as provided for in this Act. Such appraisers shall appraise
all of the property of the debtor, wherever located, at its then fair
and reasonable market value.- The appraisals shall be made in all
other respects with rights of objections, exceptions, and appeals, in
accordance with this Act: Provided, That in proceedings under this
section, either party may file objections, exceptions, and take appeals

within four months from the daie that the referee approves the
appraisal."

Six other subdivisions of subsection (s) follow, numbered (1) to (6)
inclusive, and relate chiefly to proceedings after appraisal.

Opinion of the Court.

rental, granting stay and directing sale were filed with
the Commissioner. The basis of these petitions and the
reasons for their denial by the Commissioner are detailed
in division II of this opinion.
Petitions for review were filed which were timely if
petitioner was right in his contention that the Commissioner's action on the petitions for rehearing extended the
time for appeal for ten days from the entry of the Commissioner's order denying rehearing. The two numbers,
26 and 27, of our docket, refer to these two petitions for
review consolidated for hearing. The District Court
denied each of the petitions for review on the ground that
there was no jurisdiction in it to review, since the petitions
for review were filed after the ten days provided by 39 (c)
and the rules of the District Court, and since the denial
of the petitions for rehearing did not extend the time.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on the
grounds that 39 (c) governed, that the time for review was
not extended by the petitions for rehearing, that there was
no basis for reversing the .Commissioner's action on the
petitions for review, and that the "petitions for review
were not filed in time." We disagree with the Court of
Appeals upon the last ground on the assumption that the
language meant that the District Court was without
•"power" to review the orders. We agree with the Court
of Appeals upon the first three grounds and therefore
affirm the judgment.
I. The proviso of subsection 75 (s), note 3 supra, is, we
think, limited in its effect to steps before commissioners
authorized by the provisions of § 75 (s) which precede the
proviso. Congress evidently intended to allow adequate
time for reflection and preparation before appeal by
parties aggrieved by the basic and difficult finding of
value. The provisions of § 75 (s) following the proviso
authorize orders setting aside exemptions, leaving the ap-

praised property in the hands of the debtor and fixing
rentals therefor, staying judicial proceedings, selling
perishable property, directing reappraisals and final sale
of the estate. It is obvious that this proviso, couched in
terms of appeal, could not have been intended to control
the review of the manifold activities of a commissioner
engaged in handling an estate through three or more years
of bankruptcy. To.hold the proviso generally applicable
would leave unregulated reviews of orders entered more
than four months after the commissioner approves the
appraisal. The section applicable to these reviews is
§39 (c).'
II. The petitions for review of the Commissioner's
orders of August 13, 1940, and September 7, 1940, which
were filed November 28, 1940, and October 9, 1940, no extension having been granted, were out of time under
§ 39 (c) ' unless, in accordance with the petitioner's con4 The legislative history of the proviso indicates the soundness of this
conclusion. It appears first in the earlier subsection (s), 48 Stat. 1289,
which was held unconstitutional in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank
v. Radford, 295 U. S. 555. The preceding provisions were substantially
the same as the present ones but the proviso read "Thlit in case of
real estate either party may file objections, exceptions, and appeals
within one year from date of order approving appraisal." The specification of real estate, of course, excluded the proviso from any generality of scope. When the section was amended after the Radford
case, the committee reports treated the paragraph of (s), as quoted
in note 3, separately from the succeeding numbered paragraphs and
the language connotes the idea that the proviso relates only to appeals
from the appraisal. The comment is as follows: "It provides that the
referee, under the jurisdiction of the court, shall designate and appoint
apliraisers, to appraise all of the property of the debtor, at its then
fair and reasonable market value. The appraisal is made in all other
respects, with rights of objections, exceptions, and appeals, in accordance with the Bankruptcy Act; and either party may file objections,
exceptions, or take such appeals within 4 months. Surely there is no
question of constitutionality up to this point." S. Rep. No. 985, 74th

tentions, the time for review was to run from the entry
of the orders of the Commissioner denying the petitions
for rehearing of the order of August 13, which petition was
filed September 16, 1940, and of the orders of September 7,
which petition was filed September 20, 1940. These orders
of the Commissioner denying the petitions for rehearing
were entered November 28, 1940, and September 30,
1940.
Where a petition for rehearing of a referee's order is
permitted to be filed, after the expiration of the time for
a petition for review, and during the pendency of the
bankruptcy proceedings, as here, they may be acted on,'
that is, they may be granted "before rights have vested
on the faith of the action," and the foundations of the
original order may be reexamined. Wayne Gas Co. v.
Owens-Illinois Co., 300 U. S. 131, 137.1 When such a
petition for rehearing is granted and the issues of the
original order are reexamined and an order is entered,
either denying or allowing A change in the original order,
the time for review under 39 (c) begins to run from that
entry. Bowman v. Loperena, 311 U. S. 262, 266; Wayne
Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Co., 300 U. S. 131, 137-8. The
reason for taking the later date for beginning the running
of the time for review is that the opening of the earlier
order by the court puts the basis of that earlier order
again in issue. A refusal to modify the original order,
however, requires the appeal to be from the original order,
even though the time is counted from the later order refusing to modify the original. An appeal does not lie from
6 See

the discussion in division III of this opinion.
7Where a petition for rehearing is filed before the time for a petition
for review has expired, it tolls the running of the time, and limitation
upon proceedings for review begins from the date of denial of the
petition for rehearing. Morse v. United States, 270 U. S. 151, 153-4;
United Siates v. Seminole Nation, 299 U. 8: 417, 421; Gypsy Oil Co.

the denial of a petition for rehearing. Conboy v. Firpt
NationalBank, 203 U. S. 141, 145; Bowman v. Loperena,
311 U. S. 262, 266;oBrockett v. Brockett, 2 How. 238; Roemer v. Bernheim, 132 U. S. 103; Jones v. Thompson, 128
F. 2d 888; Missouriv. Todd, 122 F. 2d 804.
On the other hand, where out of time petitions for rehearing are filed and the referee or court merely considers
whether the petition sets out, and the facts-if any are
offered-support, grounds for opening the original order
and determines that no grounds for a reexamination of the
original order are shown, the hearing upon or examination
3f the grounds for allowing'a rehearing does not enlarge
the time for review of the original order. This result follows from the well-established rule that where an untimely,
petition for rehearing is filed which is not entertained or
considered on its merits the time to appeal from the
original order is not extended. '
If a consideration of the reasons for allowing a rehearing
out of time which are brought forward by the petition for
rehearing were sufficient to resurrect the original order,
the mere filing of an out of time petition would be enough.
Of course, the court must examine the petition to see
whether it should be granted. Indeed the examination
given a motion to file such a petition might just as well be
said to justify the advancement of the time for review.
It is quite true that in a petition for review upon the
ground of error in law in the original order, the examination of the grounds of the petition for rehearing is equivalent to a reexamination of this basis of the original decree.
But in such a case the order on the petition for review
would control. It would show either a refusal to allow
the petition for rehearing or a refusal to modify the

original order. Cf. Wayne Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Co.,
300 U. S. 131, 137-38. Whether time for appeal would
be enlarged or not would depend upon what the order
showed the court did.
In the present case it is quite plain the denial was
grounded upon a failure of the petitions for rehearing to
establish adequate grounds for the rexamination of the
original orders. The petition for rehearing of the order of
August 13, relating to rent, sought to produce evidence
that the rental fixed was too high, raised a question of
law that a full three years stay was not allowed and
alleged a lack of representation by counsel. A motion to
dismiss the petitionfor rehearing as out of time was denied.
The Commissioner examined the petition for rehearing
and determined that the debtor had had full opportunity
to present his evidence at the hearing and that the stay
was in accordance with the debtor's motion and that
counsel for the debtor appeared at each hearing and knew
of each order. He 'therefore concluded "that there is no
equity or merit in the petition for rehearing" and denied
the petition. The petition for rehearing of the orders of
September 7 was similarly handled. They were orders
for sales of perishable property, § 75 (s) (2), stipulated
to be perishable by counsel for the debtor. Rehearing
was sought because of lack of representation by counsel
and lack of notice of the orders. The Commissioner's
decision on the petition for rehearing sets out the record
facts showing representation and notice. We therefore
conclude that the Commissioner did not reexamine the
basis of any of the original orders and that time for filing
the petitions forreview was not extended.
III. Since the petitions for rehearing, in our opinion,
did not extend the time for review, we are brought to
examine the question as to whether § 39 (c) .supra note 2,
is a limitation on the power of the District Court to act

or on the right of a party to seek review. Courts of
bankruptcy are courts of equity without terms. Commissioners, liYe referees, masters and receivers, supervise
estates under-the eyes of the court with their orders subject to its review. The entire process of rehabilitation,
reorganization or liquidation is open to reexamination out
of time by the District Court, in its discretion, and subject
to intervening rights. Cf. Wayne Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Co., 300 U. S. 1.31, 137; Bowman v. Loperena, 311
U. S. 262, 266.
Prior to the adoption of 39 (c), General Order in Bankruptcy No. XXVII, now abrogatl,1O governed review of
referees' orders but it prescribed no time limitations. It
was held that petitions should be filed within a reasonable
time. ' Some local court rules therefore specified time
limitations. . Where such rules imposed definite limits on
the time within which a petition for review could be filed,
with extensions to be granted on cause shown, out of time
petitions'nevertheless were entertained and considered if

Opinion of the Court.

ment to § 2 (10) 14 sought to conform the act to the prevailing practice as to the bankruptcy court's exercise of
its appellate jurisdiction over referees' orders.15 We do
not think § 39 (c) was intended to be a limitation on the
sound discretion of the bankruptcy court to permit the
filing of petitions for review after the expiration of the
period. The power in the bankruptcy court to review
orders of the referee is unqualifiedly given in § 2 (10).
The language quoted from § 39 (c) is rather a limitation
on the "person aggrieved" to file such a petition as a matter of right."6
The review out of time of the Commissioner's orders is
then a matter for the discretion of the District Court. As
that court was of the opinion it was "without jurisdiction" by'virtue of §39 (c),'its'discretion was not exercised.
However, as we are of the view that the petitions for rehearing were not supported.by adequate facts justifying
a reexamination of the bases for the orders of August 13
and September 7, 1940, and no others are alleged, and that
therefore the District Court should not have entered into
an out of time review of these original orders, there is no
reason for a reversal of the judgments. The Commissioner upheld the petitions for rehearing against a motion
14Section 2 (10) gives the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to "consider
records, findings, and orders certified to the judges by referees, and
confirm, modify, or reverse such findings and orders, or return such
records with instructions for further proceedings. 52 Stat. 842.

to dismiss because they were out of time. He thereupon
heard and passed upon the petition's merits as bases for
rehearings. His reasons for refusing to open the original
orders complained of are adequate and amply supported
by the record. The appraisal was made and the time of
stay fixed pursuant to the debtors motion, he was represented by one or more coinsel at each meeting, had opportunity to present evidence, and siipulated to the perishable
character of the property ordered sold. See the last

IV. On account of debtor's motion, requesting the running of the moratorium of three years from April 26, 1940,
the day of his adjudication in bankruptcy under 75 (s),
we do not consider the correctness of a stay of less than
three years under other circumstances. In this instance
it was correct.
