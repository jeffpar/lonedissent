IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
BRAVERMAN v. UNITED STATES.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 43.

Argued October 21, 1942.-Decided November 9, 1942.

1. A conviction upon several counts of an indictment, each charging
conspiracy to violate a different penal provision of the Internal
Revenue laws, where the jury's verdict is supported by evidence of
but a single conspiracy to commit those offenses, will not sustain
a sentence of more than two years' imprisonment, the maximum
penalty for a single violation of the conspiracy statute. P. 52.
2. The limitation applicable to a prosecution for violation of § 37 of
the Criminal Code, where the object of the conspiracy is to evade
or defeat the payment of a federal tax, is not the three-year period
applicable generally to criminal offenses, but the six-year period
specifically prescribed by § 3748 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code.,
P. 54.
3. A contention of the petitioner that his plea of former jeopardy
should have been sustained is not passed upon here, since the
earlier indictment to which he pleaded guilty, and which he argues
charged the same offense as that of which he was convicted in this
case, is not a part of the record. P. 55.
125 F. 2d 283, reversed.
Together with No. 44, Wainer v. United States, also on writ of
certiorari, 316 U. S. 653, to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The questions for decision are: (1) Whether a conviction upon the several counts of an indictment, each charging conspiracy to violate a different provision of the
Internal Revenue laws, where the jury's verdict is supported by evidence of but a single conspiracy, will sustain
a sentence of more than two years' imprisonment, the
maximum penalty for a single violation of the conspiracy
statute, and (2) whether the six-year period of limitation
prescribed by § 3748 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code is
applicable to offenses arising under § .37 of the Criminal
Code, 18 U. S. C. 88 (the conspiracy statute), where the
object of the conspiracy is to evade or defeat the payment
of a federal tax.
Petitioners were indicted, with others, on seven counts,
each charging a conspiracy to violate a separate and distinct internal revenue law of the United States." On the
trial there was evidence from which the jury could have
found that, for a considerable period of time, petitioners,
with others, collaborated in the illicit manufacture, transThe seven counts respectively charged them with conspiracy, in
violation of § 37 of the Criminal Code, unlawfully (1) to carry on the
business of wholesale and retail liquor dealers without having the

special occupational tax stamps required by statute, 26 U. S. C. § 3253;
(2) to possess distilled spirits, the immediate containers of which did
not have stamps affixed denoting the quantity of the distilled spirits

which they contained and evidencing payment of all Internal Revenue

portation, and distribution of distilled spirits, involving
the violations of statute mentioned in the several counts
of the indictment. At the close of the trial, petitioners
renewed a motion which they had made at 'its beginning
to require the Government to elect one of the seven counts
of the indictment upon which to proceed, contending that
the proof could not and did not establish more than one
agreement. In response the Government's'attorney took
the position that the seven counts of the indictment
charged as distinct offenses the several illegal objects of
one continuing conspiracy, that if the jury found such a
.conspiracy it might find the defendants guilty of as many
offenses as it. had illegal objects, aid that for each such
offense the two-year statutory penalty could be imposed.'
The trial judge submitted the case to the jury on that
theory. The jury returned a general verdict finding petitioners "guilty as charged," and the court sentenced each
to eight years' imprisonment. On appeal the Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, 125 F. 2d 283, on
the authority of its earlier decisions in Fleisher v. United
States, 91 F. 2d 404 and Meyers v. United States, 94 F. 2d
433. It found that "From the evidence may be readily
deduced a common design of appellants and others, followed by concerted action," to commit the several unlawful acts specified in the several counts of the indictment.
It concluded that the fact that the conspiracy was "a
general one to violate all laws repressive of its consummataxes imposed on such spirits, 26 U. S. C. § 2803; (3) to transport
quantities of distilled spirits, the immediate containers of which did
not have affixed the required stamps, 26 U. S. C. § 2803; (4) to carry
on ihe business of distillers without having given bond as required by
law, 26 U. S. C. § 2833; (5) to remove, deposit and conceal distilled
spirits inrespect whereof a tax is imposed by law, with intent to defraud
the United States of such tax, 26 U. S. C. § 3321; (6) to possess unregistered stills and distilling apparatus, 26 U. S. C. § 2810; and (7)
to make and ferment mash, fit for distillation, on unauthorized premises,

tion does not gainsay the separate identity of each of the
several conspiracies." "We granted certiorari, 316 U. S.
653, to resolve an asserted conflict of decisions.2 The
Government, in its argument here, submitted the case for
our decision with the suggestion that the decision below
is erroneous.
Both courts below recognized that a single agreement to
commit an offense does not become several conspiracies
because it continues over a period of time, see United
States v. Kissel, 218 U. S. 601, 607; cf. In re Snow, 120 U. S.
274, 281-3, and that there may be such a single continuing
agreement to commit several offenses. But they thought
that, in the latter case, each contemplated offense renders
the agreement punishable as a separate conspiracy.
"-\The question whether a single agreement to commit acts
in violation of several penal statutes is to be punished as
one or several conspiracies is raised on the present record,
* not by the construction of the indictment, but by the
Government's concession at the trial and here, reflected in
the, charge to the jury, that only a single agreement to
commit the offenses alleged was proven. Where each of
the -counts of an indictment alleges a conspiracy to violate a different penal statute, it may be proper to conclude,
in the absence of a bill of exceptions bringing up the evidence, that several conspiracies are charged rather than
one, and that the conviction is for each. See Fleisher v.
United States, supra; Shultz v. Hudspeth, 123 F. 2d 729,
730. But it is a different matter to hold, as the court
below appears to have done in this case and in Meyers v.
2 Compare the decision below and those in Beddow v. United States,
70 F. 2d 674, 676 (C. C.A. 8th); Yenkichi Ito v. United States, 64 F.
2d 73, 77 (C. C.A.9th); and Olmstead v. United States, 19 F. 2d 842,
847 (C. C.A. 9th), with those in United States v. Mazzochi, 75 F. 2d

BRAVERMAN v. UNITED STATES.
49

Opinion of the Court.

United States, supra, that even though a single agreement
is entered into, the conspirators are guilty of as many offenses as the agreement has criminal objects.
The gist of the crime of conspiracy as defined by the
statute is the agreement or confederation of the conspirators to commit one or more unlawful acts "where one or
more of such parties do any act to effect the object of the
conspiracy." The overt act, without proof of which a
charge of conspiracy cannot be submitted to the jury, may
be that of only a single one of the conspirators and need
not be itself a crime. Bannon v. United States, 156
U. S. 464, 468-9; Joplin Mercantile Co. v. United States,
236 U. S. 531, 535, 536; United States v. Rabinowich,
238 U. S. 78, 86; Pierce v. United States, 252 U. S.
239, 244. But it is unimportant, for present purposes,
whether we regard the overt act as a part of the crime
which the statute defines and makes punishable, see
Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S.347, 357-9, or as something apart from it, either an indispensable mode of corroborating the existence of the conspiracy or a device for
affording a locus poenitentiae,see UnitedStates v. Britton,
108 U. S.193, 204, 205; Dealy v. United States, 152 U. S.
539, 543, 547; Bannon v. United States, supra, 469; Hyde
v. Shine, 199 U. S.62, 76; Hyde v. United States, supra,
388; Joplin Mercantile Co. v. United States, supra.
zFor when a single agreement to commit one or more
substantive crimes is evidenced by an overt act, as the
statute requires, the precise nature and extent of the conspiracy must be determined by reference to the agreement
which embraces and defines its objects. Whether the
object of a single agreement is to commit one or many
crimes, it is in either case that agreement which constitutes
the conspiracy which the statute punishes. The one
agreement cannot be taken to be several agreements and
hence several conspiracies because it envisages the violation of several statutes rather than one.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

317 U. S.

The allegation in a single count of a conspiracy to com.mit several crimes is not duplicitous, for "The conspiracy
is the crime, and that is one, however diverse its objects."
Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U. S. 204, 210; Ford v.
UnitedStates, 273 U. S. 593, 602; United States v. Manton,
107 F. 2d 834, 838. A conspiracy is not the commission
of the crime which it contemplates, and neither violates
nor "arises under" the statute whose violation is its object.
United States v. Rabinowich, supra, 87-9; United States
v. McElvain, 272 U. S. 633, 638; see United States v.
Hirsch, 100 U: S. 33, 34, 35. Since the single continuing
agreement, which is the conspiracy here, thus embraces
its criminal objects, it differs from successive acts which
violate a single penal statute and from a single act which
violates two statutes. See Blockburger v. United States,
284 U. S. 299, 301-4; Albrecht v. United States, 273 U. S.
1, 11-12. The single agreement is the prohibited conspiracy, and however diverse its objects it violates but a
single statute, § 37 of the Criminal Code. For such a
violation, only the single penalty prescribed by the statute
can be imposed.
Petitioner Wainer contends, that his prosecution was
barred by the three-year statute of limitations, 18 U. S. C.
§ 582, since he withdrew from the conspiracy more than
three, although not more than six, years before his indictment. This Court, in United States v. McElvain, 272
U. S. 633, 638, and United States v. Scharton, 285 U. S.
518, held that the three-year statute of limitations applicable generally to criminal offenses barred prosecution for
a conspiracy to violate the Revenue Acts, since it was not
within the exception created by the Act of November 17,
1921, 42 Stat. 220, now § 3748 (a) (1) of the Internal
Revenue Code, which provided a sixi-year statute of limitations "for offenses involving the defrauding or attempting to defraud the United States or any agency thereof,

BRAVERMAN v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

.whether by conspiracy or not." To overcome the effect
of these decisions, that Act was amended, Revenue Act of
1932, 47 Stat. 169, 288, by the addition of a second exception, which provided a six-year statute of limitations "for
the offense of willfully attempting in any manner to evade
or defeat any tax or the payment thereof," and by the
addition of a new paragraph, reading as follows:
"For offenses arising under section 37 of the Criminal
Code, where the object of the conspiracy is to attempt in
any manner to evade or defeat any tax or the payment
thereof, the period of limitation shall also be six years."
To be within -thislast paragraph it is not necessary that the
conspiracy. hve as its object the commission of an offense
in which defrauding or attempting to defraud the United
States is an element. It is enough that the conspiracy
involves an attempt to evade or defeat the payment of
federal taxes, which was among the objects of-the conspiracy of which petitioner was convicted. Enlargement,
to six years, of the time for prosecution of such conspiracies was the expressed purpose of the amendment. See.
H. R. Rep. No. 1492, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 29.
We do not pass upon petitioner Wainer's argument that
his plea of former jeopardy should have been sustained,
since the earlier indictment to which he pleaded guilty
and which he insists charge the same offense as that of
which he has now been convicted, is not a part of the
record.
The judgment of conviction will be reversed and the
cause remanded to the District Court, where the petitioners will be resentenced in conformity to this opinion.

Reversed.
