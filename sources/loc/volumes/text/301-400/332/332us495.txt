AERO MAYFLOWER TRANSIT CO. v. BOARD OF
RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS OF MONTANA
ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA.

No. 39.

Argued October 15, 1947.-Decided December 8, 1947.

Appellant, a foreign corporation engaged exclusively in interstate
transportation of freight by motor trucks and doing a continuous
and substantial amount of such business in Montana, challenged
the validity under the Commerce Clause of two Montana taxes
on all interstate, and intrastate motor carriers operating there:
(1) a flat tax of $10 for each vehicle operated over the State's
highways; and (2) a "gross revenue" tax which, as applied to the
appellant, amounted to an additional flat fee of $15 per vehicle.
The taxes are imposed expressly "in consideration of the use of the
highways of this state" and "in addition to all other licenses, fees
and taxes imposed upon motor vehicles in this state." Held:
1. As applied to appellant, the taxes do not violate the Federal
Constitution. Pp. 501-507.
2. This Court is bound by the state court's construction of the
tax statute as applying alike to interstate and intrastate commerce,
and of "gross operating revenue" as comprehending only such
revenue as is derived from appellant's operations within Montana. Pp. 499-500.
3. The fact that the proceeds of the taxes go into the State's
general fund, subject to appropriation for general state purposes,
does not render them invalid. Pp. 502-505.
4. The taxes are levied as compensation for the use of the highways, and not on the privilege of doing interstate business. P. 505.
5. It is immaterial that the State imposes two taxes 'ather than
one, or that appellant pays other taxes which in fact are devoted
to highway maintenance. Pp. 506-507.
119 Mont. 118, 172 P. 2d 452, affirmed.

A state court of Montana sustained one of two state
taxes as applied to appellant, and enjoined appellant
from operating within the State until the tax was paid.

JUSTICE RUTLEDGE

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Again we are asked to decide whether state taxes as
applied to an interstate motor carrier run afoul of the
commerce clause, Art. I, § 8, of the Federal Constitution.
Two distinct Montana levies are questioned. Both are
imposed by that state's Motor Carriers Act, Rev. Codes
Mont. (1935) §§ 3847.1-3847.28. One is a flat tax of $10
for each vehicle operated by a motor carrier over the
state's highways, payable on issuance of a certificate or
permit, which must be secured before operations begin,
and annually thereafter. § 3847.16 (a).' The other is a
quarterly fee of one-half of one per cent of the motor ca'r1The section was enacted originally as Mont. Laws, 1931, c. 184,
§ 16. Textually it is as' follows: "(a) In addition to all of the
licenses, fees or taxes imposed upon motor vehicles in this state, and
in consideration of the use of the public highways of this state,
every motor carrier, .as defined in this act, shall, at the time of the
issuance of a certificate and annually thereafter, on or between the
first day of July and the fifteenth day of July, of each calendar year,
pay to the board of railroad commissioners of the state of Montana
the sum of ten dollars ($10.00),for every motor vehicle operated

rier's "gross operating revenue," but with a minimum annual fee of $15 per vehicle for class C carriers, in which
group appellant falls. § 3847.27.2 Each tax is declared
expressly to be laid "in consideration of the use of the
highways of this'state" and to be "in addition to all other
licenses, fees and taxes imposed upon motor vehicles in
this state .... "
Prior to July 1, 1941, the fees collected pursuant to
§§ 3847.16 (a) and 3847.27 were paid into the state treasury and credited to "the motor carrier fund."
After
that date, by virtue of Mont. Laws, 1941, c. 14, § 2, they
were allocated to the state's general fund.
Appellant is a Kentucky corporation, with its principal
offices in Indianapolis, Indiana. Its business is exclusively interstate. It consists in transporting household

-reads as follows: "In addition to all other licenses, fees and taxes imposed upon motor vehicles in this state and in consideration of the
use of the highways of this state, every motor carrier holding a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the public
service commission, shall between the first and fifteenth days of January, April, July and October of each year, file with the public service
commission a statement showing the gross operating revenue of such
carrier for the preceding three months of operation, or portion
thereof, and shall pay to the board a fee of one-half of one per cent of
the amount of such gross operating revenue; provided, however, that
the minimum annual fee which shall be paid by each class A and class
B carrier for each vehicle 'registered and/or operated under the provisions of the motor carrier act shall be thirty dollars ($30.00) and the
minimum annual fee which shall be paid by each class C carrier for
each vehicle registered and/or operated under the motor carrier act
shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00)."
Section 3847.2, Rev. Codes Mont. (1935)., contains the definitions
*of the three classes of carriers.
8 The moneys in the motor carrier fund were subject to appropriation for use in supervision and regulation of many activities other
than those connected with the public highways. See Rev. Codes
Mont. (1935), §§ 3847.17, 3847.28; and cf. note 13.

goods and office furniture from points in one state to
destinations in another. Appellant does no intrastate
business in Montana. The volume of its interstate business there is continuous and substantial, not merely
casual or occasional." It holds a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, pursuant to which its business in Montana
and elsewhere is conducted.
In 1935 appellant received a class C permit to operate
over Montana highways, as required by state law.' Until
1937, apparently, it complied with Montana requirements, including the payment of registration and license
plate fees for its vehicles operating in Montana and Qf
the 50 per gallon tax on gasoline purchased there.6 ,However, in 1937 and thereafter appellant refused to pay the

flat $10 fee imposed by § 3847.16 (a) and the $15 minimum "gross revenue,' tax laid by § 3847.27. In consequence, after hearing on order to show cause, the appellee
Appellant's answer and cross-complaint set forth statistics concerning its use of Montana highways during. the years 1937, 1938
and 1939. The figures show appellant's equipment operating on
Montana highways during 227 days in 1937; 385 trucking days
in 1938; and 405 trucking days in 1939. See also note 6.
5The statute was Mont. Laws, 1931, c. 184, § 23, now R(ev. Codes
Mont. (1935), § 3847.23. The section applied the act of which it
was a part to interstate and foreign commerce "insofar as such
application may be permitted under the provisions of" the Federal
Constitution, treaties and acts of Congress, but expressly exemnpted
interstate carriers from making "any showing of public convenienceand necessity" in order to secure the certificate or permit.
6 These taxes were imposed separately from the two involved in this
case. Appellant's brief states the registrat:,n and license plate fees
increased from $660.50 in 1937 to $1,212.50 in 1938 and to $1,630.50
in 1939. The gasoline tax increased from $745.30 in 1937 to $1,257.90
in 1938 and $1,649.98 in 1939. The gallonage tax, though ultimately
borne by the consumer, was laid on the sale and collected .from the
dealer.

Opinion of the Court.

board 7 in 1939 revoked the 1935 permit and brought
this suit in a state cburt to enjoin appellant from further
operations in Montana.
Upon appellant's cross-complaint, the trial court issued
an order restraining the board from enforcing the "gross
revenue" tax laid by § 3847.27. But at the same time
it enjoined appellant from operating in Montana until
it paid the fees imposed by § 3847.16 (a). On appeal
the state supreme court held both taxes applicable to
interstate as well as intrastate motor carriers and construed the term "gross operating revenue" in § 3847.27
to mean "gross revenue derived from operations in Montana." 8 It then sustained both taxes as against appellant's constitutional objections, state and federal. Accordingly, it reversed the trial court's judgment insofar
as the "gross revenue" tax had been held invalid, but
affirmed the decision relating to the flat $10 tax. 119
Mont. 118,172 P. 2d 452.
We put aside at the start appellant's suggestion that
the Supreme Court of Montana has misconstrued the
state statutes and therefore that we should consider them,
for purposes of our limited function, according to appellant's view of their literal import. The rule is too
well settled to permit of question that this Court not
only accepts but is bound by the construction given to
It should be noted that "the board of railroad commissioners,"
as used in § 3847.16 (a), and "the public service commission," as used
in § p847.27, designate a single body, invested with regulatory power
over various public utilities in addition to motor carriers, e. g., railroads, common carriers of oil, etc. By Rev. Codes Mont. (1935),
§ 3880, "The board of railroad commissioners . . . shall be ex-officio
the public service commission hereby created ....
*" The two terms
were said by the Montana Supreme Court in this case to be "used
interchangeably." 119 Mont. 118, 136, 172 P. 2d 452,461.

the section made by Mont. Laws, 1947, c. 73, § 2.

state statutes by the state courts." Accordingly, we accept the state court's rulings, insofar as they are material,
that the two sections apply alike to interstate and intrastate commerce and that "gross operating revenue" as
employed in § 3847.27 comprehends only such revenue
derived from appellant's operations within Montana, not
outside that state."
Moreover, since Montana has not demanded or sought
to enforce payment by appellant of more than the flat
$15 minimum fee for class C carriers under § 3847.27,11
we limit our consideration of the so-called "gross revenue"
tax to that'fee. This too is in accordance with the state
supreme court's declaration: "Even if it be admitted

Dwyer, 322 U. S. 232; Minnesota v. Probate Court, 309 U. S. 270;
Morehead v. N. Y. ex rel. Tipaldo, 298 U. S. 587; cf. Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S:64.
10 Acting not only in the view that statutes are presumptively
constitutional and, if necessary, are to be so construed as to make
them so, the court noted that § 3847.16 (b) expressly provides that,
when service "is rendered partly in this state and partly in an adjoining state or foreign country," carriers "shall comply with the provisions of this act" concerning "payment of compensation" and making
reports by showing "the total business performed within the limits of
this state." (Emphasis added.) Accordingly it held that §§ 3847.27
and 3847.16 should be read together and the limitation of § 3847.16
(b) "within the limits of this state" thus became a part of § 3847.27
as well as § 3847.16 (a). 119 Mont. 118,134,172 P. 2d 452,460.
11 Appellant's vice president and general manager, Wheating, testified that, for purposes of applying § 3847.27 he had calculated, for
each of the years 1939 through 1942, "the [gross] income for that
operation of the load miles operated in Montana by using an average
income per mile figure based upon the probable load factor we would
have had in Montana." (Emphasis added.) On this basis the
amount of the tax as calculated at one-half of one per cent quarterly
was substantially below the statutory minimum for each of the four
years. See note 19. These.figures apparently were reported to and
accepted by the board as the basis for its demands upon the taxpayer
for the flat $15 minimum annual tax.

Opinion of the Court.

that the manner of arriving at a sound basis upon which
the tax on gross revenue [should be calculated] is not
provided by the statute, a contention to which we do
not agree, no difficulty would arise in putting into effect
the minimum fee of $15.00 required for each company
vehicle operated within the state." 12 Although the state
court did.not concede that the statute comprehended no
workable or sound basis for calculating the tax above the
minimum, we take this statement as a clear declaration
that it would sustain the minimum charge even if for
some reason the amount of the tax above the minimum
would have to fall.
With the issues thus narrowed, we have, in effect, two
flat taxes, one for $10, the other for $15, payable annually
upon each vehicle operated on .Montana highways in the
course of appellant's business, with each tax expressly
declared to be in addition to all others and to be imposed
"in consideration of- the use of the highways of this
state."
Neither exaction discriminates against interstate commerce. Each applies alike to local and interstate operations. Neither undertakes to tax traffic or movements
12

119 Mont. 118, 134,172 P. 2d 452, 460.

Appellant had argued, as

it does here, that even if the "gross revenue" tax is limited to revenue
derived from operations in Montana, it is nevertheless invalid for
want of any prescribed method on the face of the statute for ascertaining or calculating the tax. The state court held that the statute
by necessary implication authorized the board to "adopt any fair and
reasonable mode of enforcement designed to effectuate the purposes
of the Act." 119 Mont. 118, 135, 172 P. 2d 452, 461. In view of our
limitation of the question before us, as- stated in the text, we need
not express opinion concerning this ruling or any tax above the minimum calculated in accordance with it. - Cf. note 11.
In another connection the state supreme court adverted to the
separability clause contained in § 3847.24 of the statute, though not
referring to it expressly in' relation to the statement quoted in the
text.,

taking place outside Montana or the gross returns from
such movements or to use such returns as a measure of
the amount of the tax. Both levies apply exclusively to
operations wholly within the state or the proceeds of such
operations, although those operations are interstate in
character.
Moreover, it is not material to the validity of either
tax that the state also imposes and collects the vehicle
registration and license fee and the gallonage tax on gasoline purchased in Montana. The validity of those taxes
neither is questioned nor well could be. Hendrick v.
Maryland, 235 U. S. 610; Aero Transit Co. v. Georgia
Comm'n, 295 U. S. 285; Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, 262
U. S. 506; Edelman v. Boeing Air Transp., 289 U. S. 249.
Nor does their exaction have any significant relationship
to the imposition of' the taxes now in question. Dixie
Ohio Co. v. Comm'n, 306 U. S. 72, 78; Interstate Busses
Corp. v. Blodgett, 276 U. S. 245, 251. They are imposed
for distinct purposes and the proceeds, as appellant concedes, are devoted to different uses, namely, the policing
of motor traffic and the maintenance of the state's
highways.13
Concededly the proceeds of the two taxes presently involved are not allocated to those objects." Rather they
now go into the state's general fund, subject to appropriation for general state purposes." Indeed this fact, in
appellant's view, is the vice of the statute. But in tha

view appellant misconceives the nature and legal effect of
the exactions. It is far too late to question that a state,
consistently with the commerce clause, may lay upon
motor vehicles engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, or upoi those who own and so operate them, a fair
and reasonable nondiscriminatory tax as compensation
for the use of its highways. Hendrick v. Maryland,
supra; Clark v. Poor, 274 U. S. 554; Aero Transit Co. v.
Georgia Comm'n, supra; Morf v. Bingaman, 298 U. S.
407; Dixie Ohio Co. v. Comm'n, supra; Clark v. Paul
Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583; cf. S. C. Hwy. Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., 303 U. S. 177. Moreover "common carriers for
hire, who make the highways their place of business, may
properly be charged an extra tax for such use." Clark
v. Poor,supra at 557.
The present taxes on their face are exacted "in consideration of the use of the highways of this state," that is,
they are laid for the privilege of using those highways.
And the aggregate amount of the two taxes taken together is less than the amount of similar taxes this Court
has heretofore'sustained. Cf. Dixie Ohio Co. v. Comm'n,
Supra; Aero Transit Co. v. Georgia Comm'n, supra. The
state builds the highways and owns them.16 Motor carriers for hire, and particularly truckers of heavy goods,
like appellant, make especially arduous use of roadways,
entailing wear and tear much beyond that resulting from
general indiscriminate public use. Morf v. Bingaman,
supra at 411, Although the state may not discriminate
against or exclude such interstate traffic generally in the
use of its highways, this does not mean that the state is
required to furnish those facilities to it free of charge or
indeed orl equal terms with other traffic not inflicting
similar destructive effects: Cf. Clark v. Poor,supra;Morf
v. Bingaman, supra at 411. Interstate traffic equally with

332 U. S.

intrastate may be required to pay a fair share of the cost
and maintenance reasonably related to the use made of
the highways.
This does not mean, as appellant seems to assume, that
the proceeds of all taxes levied for the privilege of using
the highways must be allocated directly and exclusively
to maintaining them. Clark v. Poor, supra at 557; Morf
v. Bingaman, supra at 412. That is true, although this
Court has held invalid, as forbidden by the commerce
clause, certain state taxes on interstate motor carriers
because laid "not as compensation for the use of the highways but for the privilege of doing the interstate bus
business." Interstate Transit, Inc. v. Lindsey, 283 U. S.
183, 186; cf. McCarrollv. Dixie Lines, 309 U: S. 176, 179.
Those cases did not hold that all state exactions for the
privilege of using the state's highways are valid only if
their proceeds are required to go directly and exclusively
for highway maintenance, policing and administration.
Both before and after the Interstate Transit decision
this Court has sustained state taxes expressly laid on
the privilege of using the highways, as applied to interstate motor carriers, declaring in each instance that it
is immaterial whether the proceeds are allocated to highway uses or others. Clark v. Poor, supra at 557; Morf
v. Bingaman, supra at 412.17
Appellant therefore confuses a tax "assessed for a
proper purpose and . . . not objectionable in amount,"
Clark v. Poor,supra at 557, that is, a tax affirmatively laid
for the privilege of using the state's highways, with a tax
not imposed on that privilege but upon some other such as
the privilege of doing the interstate business. Though
necessarily related, in view of the nature of interstate motor traffic, the two privileges are not identical, and it is
useless to confuse them or to confound a tax for the priv17See note 18 infra and text.

AERO TRANSIT CO. v. COMM'RS.

Opinion of the Court.

ilege of using the highways with one the proceeds of which
are necessarily devoted to maintaining them. Whether
the proceeds of a tax are used or required to be used for
highway maintenance "may be of significance," as the
Court has said, "when the point is otherwise in doubt, to
show that the fee is in fact laid for that purpose and is
thus a charge for the privilege of using the highways.
Interstate Transit, Inc. v. Lindsey, supra. But where the
manner of the levy, like that prescribed by the present
statute, definitely identifies it as a fee charged for the
grant of the privilege, it is immaterial whether the state
places the fees collected in the pocket out of which it pays
highway maintenance charges or in some other." Morf
,y. Bingaman,supra at 412.18
The exactions in the present case fall clearly within the
rule of Morf v. Bingaman and its predecessors in authority, and therefore, like that case, outside the decisions in
the Interstate Transit and like cases. Both taxes are
levied "in consideration of the use of the highways of this
state," that is, as compensation for their use, and bear only
on the privilege of using them, not on the privilege of doing
the interstate business. Moreover, the flat $10 fee laid
by § 3847.16 (a) is further identified as one on the privilege of use by the fact that "unlike the general tax in
Interstate Transit, Inc. v. Lindsey, 283 U. S. 183, the
levy of which was unrelated to the use of the highways,
grant of the privilege of their use is by the present statute
made conditional upon payment of the fee." Morf v.
Bingaman, supra at 410.
The minimum so-called "gross revenue" fee, on the
other hand, is technically conditioned on the receipt of
18 In Clark v. Poor, the Court stated: "Since the tax is assessed
for a proper purpose and is not objectionable in amount, the use to
which the proceeds are put is not a matter which concerns the plaintiffs." 274 U. S. 554,557.

such revenue from the operations within Montana. But
the flat minimum of 415 annually, which is all we have
before us in the shape the case has taken for the purposes of decision here, has none of the alleged vices characteristic of gross income taxes heretofore held to vitiate
such taxes laid by the states on interstate commerce.
And appellant has advanced no tenable basis in rebuttal
of the legislative declaration that this tax too is exacted
in consideration of the use of the state's highways, i.e.,
for the privilege of using them, not for that of doing the
interstate business. Here, as in Morf v. Bingaman, "there
is ample support for a legislative determination that the
peculiar character of this traffic involves a special type
of use of .the highways," with enhanced wear, tear and
hazards laying heavier burdens on the state for maintenance and policing than other types of traffic create.
298 U. S. 407, 411. It is to compensate for these burdens
that the taxes are imposed, and appellant has not sustained its burden, Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., supra at 599,
and authorities cited, of showing that the levies have no
reasonable relation to that end."
It is of no consequence that the state has seen fit to
lay two exactions, substantially identical, rather than
combine them into one, or that appellant pays other taxes
19 Appellant claims that the $15 minimum fee is unreasonable since
it is roughly ten times greater than the tax that would be required
if the percentage standard provided in the statute were applied.
To accept appellant's position would mean that a state could never
impose a minimum fee, but would have to adjust its taxes to the
inevitable variations in the use of the highways made by various
carriers. The Federal Constitution does not require the state to
elaborate a system of motor vehicle taxation which will reflect with
exact precision every gradation in use. In return for the $15 fee
appellant can do business grossing $3,000 per vehicle annually for
operations on Montana roads. Appellant was not wronged by its
failure to make the full use of the highways permitted. Aero Transit
Co. v. Georgia Comm'n 295 U. S. 285; Morf v. Bingaman, 298.U. S.

which in fact are devoted to highway maintenance. For
the state does not exceed its constitutional powers by imposing more than one form of tax. Interstate Busses
Corp. v. Blodgett, supra; Dixie Ohio Co. v. Comm'n,
supra. And, as we have said, the aggregate amount of
both taxes combined is-less than that of taxes heretofore
sustained. In view of these facts there is not even semblance of substance to appellant's contention that the
taxes are excessive.
Neither is there merit in its other arguments, which

1. Sales of imported natural gas by an interstate pipeline carrier
direct to industrial consumers are sales in interstate commerce, even
though the gas leaves the main transmission line within the state
and is piped to the consumers through branch lines or laterals at
reduced pressure. Pp. 512-513.
2. In view of the position of the state commission as construed by
the state supreme court, the orders of the commission, directing
immediately only the filing of information, constituted an assertion
of power to regulate appellant's rates and service under the state's
comprehensive scheme of regulation; and appellant was not required to await a further -regulatory order before contesting the
commission's jurisdiction. P. 511.
3. In the light of the legislative history, provisions, and policy of
the Natural Gas Act, and of the judicial history leading to its
enactment, sales of natural gas by an interstate pipeline carrier
direct to industrial consumers, although in interstate commerce,
are subject to regulation by the states. Pp. 513-524.
