Syllabus.

And the mere fact that they spent less than full time in
ministerial activities affords no reasonable basis for implying a non-ministerial status. Congress must have
intended to exempt from statutory duties those ministers
who are forced to labor at secular jobs to earn a living
as well as those who preach to more opulent congregations. Any other view would ascribe to Congress an intention to discriminate among religious denominations
and ministers on the basis of wealth and necessity for
secular work, an intention that I am unwilling to impute.
Accordingly, in the absence of more convincing evidence,
I cannot agree that the draft board classifications underlying petitioners' convictions are valid.

LILLIE v. THOMPSON, TRUSTEE.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 206.

Decided November 24, 1947.

A complaint under the Federal Employers' Liability Act alleged that
the hours, location and circumstances of the complainant's work
created a likelihood that she would suffer injuries through the
criminal acts of a person not an employee; that the railroad failed
to exercise its duty of taking reasonable measures to protect her
against the foreseeable danger, and that she suffered injuries as a
result of the railroad's failure to take such measures. Held:
1. The complaint stated a cause of action under the Act. Pp.
-460-461.
2. That the danger was from criminal misconduct by an outsider
is irrelevant. If that danger was foreseeable, the railroad had a
duty to make reasonable provision against it. Pp. 461-462.
162 F. 2d 716, reversed.

Petitioner's suit against a railroad for damages under
the Federal Employ.rs' Liability Act was dismissed by the
District Court for failure to state a cause of action. The
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 162 F. 2d 716. This

PER CURIAM.

Petitioner sued for damages under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.' The essence of her claim was that
she was injured as a result of the respondent's negligence
in sending her to work in a place he knew to be unsafe
without taking reasonable measures to protect her.
The district court dismissed the complaint for failure
to state a cause of action and entered summary judgment
for the respondent. The' Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed without opinion. 162 F. 2d 716.
There is thus a single issue in the case: Could it be
found from the facts alleged in the complaint, as supplemented by any uncontroverted allegations by the respondent, that petitioner's injuries resulted at least in part from
respondent's negligence? 2
Petitioner's allegations may be summarized as follows:
Respondent required her, a 22-year-old telegraph operator, to work alone between 11:30 p. m. and 7:30 a. m. in a
one-room frame building situated in an isolated part of respondent's railroad yards in Memphis. Though respondent had reason to know the yards were frequented by
dangerous characters, he failed to exercise reasonable care

lt is not questioned that respondent was engaged in interstate

commerce and that petitioner was injured while employed in such
commerce.

to light the building and its surroundings or to guard or
patrol it in any way. Petitioner's duties were to receive
and deliver messages to men operating trains in the yard.
In order for the trainmen to get the messages it was necessary for them to come to the building, at irregular intervals throughout the night, and it was petitioner's duty to
admit them when they knocked. Because there were no
windows in the building's single door or on the side of the
building in which the door was located, petitioner could
identify. persons seeking entrance only by unlocking and
opening the door. About 1:30 a. m. on the night of her
injury petitioner responded to a knock, thinking that
some of respondent's trainmen were seeking admission.
She opened the door, and before she could close it a man
entered and beat her with a large piece of iron, seriously
and permanently injuring her.
In support of his motion for summary judgment respondent -alleged, and petitioner did not deny, that the'
assailant was not an employee of the respondent and that
the attack was criminal.
The district court stated, in explanation of its action,
that there would be no causal connection between the
injury and respondent's failure to light or guard the
premises, and that the law does not permit recovery "for
the intentional or criminal acts" of either a fellow-employee or an outsider.3
We are of the opinion that the allegations in the complaint, if supported by evidence, will warrant submission
to a jury. Petitioner alleged in effect that respondent
was aware of conditions which created a likelihood that
a young woman performing the duties required of peti3 The court cited Davis v. Green, 260 U. S. 349 (1922) ; St. LouisSan Francisco R. Co. v. Mills, 271 U. S. 344 (1926); Atlantic Coast

tioner would suffer just such an injury as was in fact
inflicted upon her. That the foreseeable danger was from
intentional or criminal misconduct is irrelevant; respondent nonetheless had a duty to make reasonable provision
against it.! Breach of that duty would be negligence,
and we cannot say as a matter of law that petitioner's
injury did not result at least in part from such negligence.
The cases cited by the district court,' we believe, do not
support the broad proposition enunciated by it, and do
not cover the fact situation set forth by the pleadings in
this case.
Certiorari is granted, and the judgment is reversed and
the case remanded to the district court.
