No. 5. Argued October 16, 17, 1940.-Decided November 12,
Y940.
1. *Under § 23 (r) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1932, a taxpayer's distributive share of partnership profits derived from sales or exclanges of stocks and bonds that were not capital assets (as
defined in § 101), is a "gain" to the extent of which he is entitled
to a deduction of a loss sustained by him in similar transactions
for his individual account. P. 88.
2. That §§ 184-188 of the Revenue Act of 1932 advert to instances
in which partnership income retains its identity in the individual
maxim expressio
partner's return, does not by application of the
unius est. exclusio alterius require disallowance of the deduction
here claimed. The maxim is not a rule of law but an aid to construction, and -may not override the clear intent of Congress.
P. 88.
3. Where the intent of Congress is plain, the scope of an Act may
not be narrowed by administrative interpretation. P. 89.
4. Cases variously 'emphasizing the character of partnerships as
business units, or as associations of individuals, but not involving
§ 23 (r) (1), are of little aid in ascertaining its meaning. P. 89.
5. The findings of the Board of Tax Appeals in this case show that
the allowance of a deduction of the amount claimed would not
exceed the limit prescribed by § 23 (r) (1). P. 89.
6. The construction here given § 23 (r) (1) is consistent with the
legislative history of amendatory legislation as well as that of the
section itself. T. 89.

CERTIORARi, 310 U. S. 655, to review the affirmance of
a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 37 B. T. A. 223,
sustaining the determination of a deficiency in income
tax.
Mr. Wilbur H. Friedman, with whom Mr. Jacob P.

Biddle, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Mr.
Maurice J. Mahoney were on the brief, for respondent.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Petitioner, a resident of New York, was a member of
the New York Stock Exchange. He was engaged in the
business of trading in securities on the floor of the Exchange for the partnership of Hilson & Neuberger, of
which he was a member, executing orders on behalf of
customers of the partnership. In addition he made
numerous purchases and sales of securities for his own
account.
During the year 1932, the one here in question, Hilson
& Neuberger derived a profit of $142,802.29 from the sale
of securities which were not capital assets as defined in
§ 101 of the Revenue Act of 1932. 47 Stat. 169, 191. The
firm had other income of $170,830.65 and deductions of
$203,981.78, or net income of $109,651.16. Petitioner's
distributive share was $44,158.55. During the same year
petitioner sustained a net loss of $25,588.93 on his private
transactions in stocks and bonds which were not capital
assets as defined in § 101.
In his income tax return for the year 1932 petitioner
deducted from gross income the loss of $25,588.93. The
Commissioner disallowed the deduction and assessed a deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the action of
the Commissioner. 37 B. T. A. 223. On appeal the

Opinion of the Court.

Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 104 F. 2d 649.
Because of substantial conflict with Jennings v. Commissioner, 110 F. 2d 945, and Craik v. United States, 31 F.
Supp. 132, we granted certiorari limited to the questions whether § 23 (r)' (1) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47
Stat. 169, 183, authorized the. claimed deduction, and
whether, in the event that it did not, the statute as so
construed was constitutional. 310 U. S. 655.
Section 23 of the Revenue Act of 1932 sets out the
allowable deductions from gross income. Section 23 (r)
(1)provides:
"Losses from sales or exchanges of stocks and bonds (as
defined in subsection (t) of this section) which are not
capital assets (as defined in section 101) shall be allowed
[as deductions from gross income] only to the extent of
the gains from such sales or exchanges .
The basic and narrow question is whether, in computing
the income of an individual partner, the word "gains" in
§ 23 (r) (1) includes gains from sales or exchanges of
partnership stocks and bonds which are not capital assets
as defined in § 101. We are of opinion that it does.
In computing gross income prior to the Revenue Act of
1932, subject to certain limitations a 'taxpayer was entitled to deduct the full amount of his losses from transactions in securities. Revenue Act of 1928, §§ 23 (e),
23 (g), 101 (b), 113. But the growing custom of diminishing ordinary income by deducting losses realized on
the sale of securities which had shrunk in value, due no
doubt to the fall in prices after 1929, led Congress to provide in § 23 (r) (1) that deductions for such losses should
be limited to gains from similar transactions.
That this was the purpose and the only purpose of § 23
(r) (1) abundantly appears from the Report of the Senate Finance Committee accompanying the bill.' Nowhere

does there appear any intention to. deny to a taxpayer
who chooses to execute part of his security transactions in
partnership with another the right to deductions which
plainly would be available to him if he had executed all
of them singly. Nowhere is there any suggestion that
Congress intended to tax noncapital security gains until
they exceeded similar losses. The language of § 23 (r) (1)
does not require such a construction. Nor do the available evidences of Congressional intent indicate such a
purpose.
Respondent points out, however, that under §§ 181-189
of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 222-223,2 partsecurity gains; but that security gains should not be taxed until they
actually exceed security losses."
See also Report of House Ways and Means Committee (72d Congress, 1st Sess.), Number 708, pp. 12-13:
"There are no provisions in existing law corresponding to section
23 (r), . . . Many taxpayers have been completely or partially
eliminating from tax their income from salaries, dividends, rents, etc.,

opinion that some limitation ought to be placed on the allowance of
such losses."

nership income is computed on an entity basis, that items
of partnership gross income do not appear on a partner's
return, that only partnership net income is reflected in
the individual partner's income and is reported only in
the form of a distributable or distributed share. He contends that since partnership income is computed in the
same way as an individual's the deduction afforded by
§ 23 (r) (1) to the partnership is a distinct privilege not
to be confused or combined with that afforded to the individual. Thus, he argues, the deduction claimed here
is inconsistent with the general scheme created for reporting partnership income as well as, in effect, a second

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

311 U.S.

It is not to be doubted that in the enactment of § 23
(r) (1) Congress intended not only to deal with individual security gains and losses, but also to permit losses
suffered in partnership security transactions to be applied
against partnership gains in like transactions. It does
not follow, however, and the language of the statute
does not provide, either expressly or by necessary implication, that losses sustained in an individual capacity
may not be set off against gains from identical though
distinct partnership dealings. If the individual losses
are actually incurred in .,similar transactions it cannot
justly be said that the same deduction is taken a second
tine, or that the real purpose of the statute, which is
ultimately to tax the net income of the individual partner, would thereby be impaired.
Sections 181-189 of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat.
169, 222-223, provide generally for computation and reporting of partnership income. In requiring a partnership informational return although only iYdividual
partners pay any tax, Congress recognized the partnership
both as a business unit and as an association of individuals. This weakens rather than strengthens respondent's
argument that the privileges are distinct or that the unit
characteristics of the partnership must be emphasized.
Compare Jennings v. Commissioner, 110 F. 2d 945; Craik
v. United States, 31 F. Supp. 132; United States v.
Coulby, 251 F. 982 (affirmed, 258 F. 27). Nor is the
deduction claimed here precluded because Congress, in
§§ 184-188, has particularized instances where partnership income retains its identity in the individual partner's
return. The maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius is an aid to construction, not a rule of law. It can
never override clear and contrary evidences of Congressional intent. United States v. Barnes, 222 U. S. 513.
It is true that the Treasury Department adopted a
contrary position and denied the claimed deduction. G.

Opinion of the Court.

C. M. 14012, XIV-1 Cum.Bull. 145; I. T. 2892, XIV-1
Cum. Bull. 148. Under different circumstances great
weight has been attached to administrative practice and
Treasury rulings, but beyond question they cannot narrow
the scope of a statute when Congress plainly has intended
otherwise. Rasquin v. Humphreys, 308 U. S. 54; Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co.v. United States, 288 U. S.
294.
It is true, too, that in some cases the characteristics of
partnerships as business units have been emphasized,
Forres v. Commissioner, 25 B. T. A. 154; Wilson v. Commissioner, 17 B. T. A. 976 (appeal dismissed, 55 F. 2d
1086); Burns v. Commissioner, 12 B. T. A. 1209; Appeal
of Menken, 8 B. T. A. 1062, while in others the characteristics of partnerships as associations of individuals have
been stressed. United States v. Coulby, supra. Compare
Bence v. United States, 18 F. Supp. 848. These cases,
not decided under' the Revenue Act. of 1932, and turning,
as they must, on their own peculiar facts, are little aid
in ascertaining the effect to be given to § 23 (r) (1).
It is not true, however, as respondent argues, that the
asserted deduction cannot be allowed because petitioner
has suggested no way to calculate it properly or to import
items of gross income from the partnership informational
return. The Board of Tax Appeals expressly found the
amount of partnership gains from security transactions
and the proportion in which petitioner was to share in
the profits of the partnership. 37 B. T. A. 223, 224.
Since petitioner's share of these noncapital security gains
is greater than his loss of $25,588.93, the limit on deductions set by § 23 (r) (1) is not exceeded.
Our conclusion that this is the proper construction of
§ 23 (r) (1) is confirmed by the action of Congress since
1932. In 1933 Congress amended § 182 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1932 to deny to individual partners deductions
'for partnership losses which had been disallowed in the

partnership return, the converse of the instant case. 48
Stat. 195, 209.1 More significantly, in 1938, after the
Treasury Department had ruled to the contrary, G. C. M.
14012, XIV-1 Cum. Bull. 145; I. T. 2892, XIV-1 Cum.
Bull. 148, Congress expressly provided for the deduction
of individual security losses from similar partnership
gains. Revenue Act of 1938, §§ 182-183; 52 Stat. 447,
521." That the amendment of 1933 changed and the
Revenue Act of 1938 restored the law of 1932 as we have
explained it is plain from the legislative history of the
two Acts and of § 23 (r) (1).
Shearer v. Burnet, 285 U. S. 228, is not contrary to the
conclusidn we reach here. There the decision turned on
the proper construction to be given to § 218 (a) of the
Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 275, and the court

correctly concluded that Congress had not intended to
allow the asserted credit.
We conclude that petitioner is entitled to the deduction. The decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded with directions
'In Senate Finance Committee Report Number 114 (73rd Congress,
1st Sess.) accompanying the bill, it is stated at page 7:
"Subsection (d) amends the partnership provisions of existing law.
Under existing law the individual members of a partnership are entitled to reduce their individual net incomes by their distributive
shares of a net loss incurred by the partnership!'
'In House Ways and Means Committee Report Number 1860
(75th Congress, 3rd Sess.) accompanying the bill, it is stated at pages
42-43:
"The method of treatment provided in these sections of the bill
is a logical corollary of the principle that only the partners as individuals, not the partnership as an entity, are taxable persons and is
necessary to give the partners as individuals the benefit of the alternative tax in the case of net long-term capital gains, provided in
section 117 (c), with respect to such gains realized upon the sale
or exchange of partnership capital assets. It /should be noted that
this method involves a departure from the principle adopted in the
Revenue Acts of 1934 and 1936

MILK WAGON DRIVERS' UNION, LOCAL NO. 753
ET AL. v. LAKE VALLEY FARM PRODUCTS, INC.
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

SBVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 20. Argued October 21, 22, 1940,-Decided November 18, 1940.
A union of milk-wagon drivers, employed by local dairies in delivering milk, mainly from door to door to retail customers, picketed
a large number of retail stores which sold, at cut prices on the
cash-and-carry plan, milk bought at wholesale from individuals,
called "vendors," who delivered it by their own trucks from supplies bought from other dairies under an arrangement whereby the
milk that they did not sell was taken back at full purchase price
by the dairies that supplied it. This "vendor system" had made
inroads on the business of union dairies and affected unfavorably
the wages and employment of members of the drivers' union.
The union claimed that it constituted unfair competition-a device
to escape union wages and union working conditions-and through
the picketing it sought to compel the "vendors" to join it for the
purpose of improving their wages and working conditions. Two of
the "cut-price" dairies joined with an industrial union (organized
by their employees, including "vendors") and r co~perative association of another State from which they obtained' their supplies of
milk, in a suit charging the drivers' union and its officers with a
conspiracy to restrain interstate commerce inmilk in violation of
the Sherman Act, and seeking an injunction against the picketing
and attendant trespasses. Held:
1. That there existed a "labor dispute" within the meaning of
the Nord-LaGuardia Act. P. 96.
