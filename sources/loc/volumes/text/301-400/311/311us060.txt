UNITED STATES v. STEWART.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 13.

Argued October 17, 1940.-Decided November 12, 1940.

1. The exemption from taxation granted by § 26 of the Farm Loan
Act of 1916 to farm loan bonds and the "income derived therefrom," does not apply to income derived from dealings or transactions in such bonds, and such income is taxable under § 22 (a)
of the Revenue Act of 1928. Applying Willcuts v. Bunn, 282
U. S. 216. Pp. 61, 63.
2. Acts of Congress which are in part materia are to be taken together, as if they were one law. P. 64.
3. The later of Acts which are in pari materia may be regarded as a
legislative interpretation of the earlier, and is entitled to great
weight in resolving doubts and ambiguities. P. 64.
4. The Farm Loan Act of 1916 and the Revenue Act of 1916 (enacted
shortly afterward at the same session of Congress) are in pari
materia. That in the case of farm loan bonds the latter Act,
like the Revenue Act of 1928, expressly exempts income from
"interest" alone is persuasive that the former does not exempt capital
gains. P. 64.
5. The conclusion that § 26 of the Farm Loan Act 'does not exempt
income derived from dealings or transactions in farm loan bonds
is not inconsistent with its legislative history or administrative
interpretation. P. 65.
6. The provision of § 817 of the Revenue Act of 1938, that "all income, except interest, derived" from farm loan bonds shall be
included in gross income, can not be regarded as having been intended to change the previously existing law, so far as the question
involved in this case is concerned. P. 66.
7. An analysis of numerous other exemption statutes is of little
weight under the circumstances in determining the meaning of
"income derived therefrom" in § 26. P. 69.
8. The Farm Loan Board was without authority to make representations that capital gains from dealings in farm loan bonds were
not taxable, and statements by the Board, which a purchaser so
interpreted and on which he relied, can not be accorded the weight
of uniform and long established administrative treatment. P. 70.

10. Exemptions from taxation may not rest upon mere implication;
and statutory provisions granting exemptions are to be strictly construed. P. 71.

CERTIORARI, 309 U. S. 647, to review the reversal of a
judgment against the taxpayer, 24 F. Supp. 145, in a suit,
to recover a refund of income taxes.

Assistant Attorney General Clark,with whom Solicitor
GeneralBiddle and Messrs. Sewall Key and Arnold Raum
were on the brief, for the United States.
Messrs. W. Glenn Harmon and Ernest L. Wilkinson,
with whom Mr. John W. Cragun was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTIcE DouGIs delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case is here on certiorari to resolve a conflict of
the decision below (106 F. 2d 405) with Stern Brothers
& Co. v. Commissioner, 108 F. 2d 309.
During the year 1930 respondent purchased farm loan
bonds issued by joint-stock land banks under the Federal
Farm Loan Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 360). The purchases
were made for the prospective increment to the bonds
and not for their interest. At the time the purchases
were made the banks were in receivership. The bonds
were acquired at prices substantially below par. In making these purchases respondent relied upon statements
contained in circulars and bulletins issued by the Farm
Loan Board, reasonably believing that he was purchasing
securities the profit upon which in case of sale would be
exempt income. A part of the bonds so purchased, with
their appurtenant coupons, was sold in 1931; and a part
was surrendered in that year to the receiver of the issuing

bank in exchange for cash paid to respondent "under and
pursuant to the covenants contained" in the bonds.
Each of these transactions resulted in a profit to respondent.' The Commissioner held that those gains were
taxable income. Consequently, respondent included
them in his income tax return for the year 1931 and
claimed a refund. On disallowance of that claim, this
suit for refund was instituted. The District Court determined that the gains so realzed were income and taxable. 24 F. Supp. 145. The Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed.
Sec. 22 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 791)
includes in gross income "gains, profits, and income derived from . . . sales, or dealings in property, whether

real or personal."

Sec. 22 (b) (4) exempts from tax-

ation "Interest upon . . . securities issued under the pro-

visions of the Federal Farm Loan Act, or under the
provisions of such Act as amended."
. If those two sections are controlling, it is clear that
respondent is taxable on these gains, for they fall squarely
within the definition of gross income contained in § 22 (a)
and they are not "interest" I within the meaning of
§ 22 4b) (4). But respondent places his main reliance
on § 26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act which provides
that "farm loan bonds issued under the provisio. .s of this
Act, shall be deemed and held to be instrumentalities of
the Government of the United States, and as such they
and the income derived therefrom shall be exempt from

2The record does not show what portion, if any, of the sums received on the sale or on the exchange of the bonds and appurtenant
coupons was received as payment on accrued interest. Nor did the
complaint allege that any portion of the sums received was exempt
because it was "interest" on the bonds. Hence that point was not
raised below or here.

Opinion of the Court.

Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation." It is
urged that the gains here involved were "income derived"
from the bonds within the meaning of that section.
We disagree with that conclusion. It is our view that
under § 26 respondent is entitled to an exemption only
for interest on the bonds.
To be sure, "income" is a generic term amply broad to
include capital gains for purposes of the income tax.
Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. S.mietanka, 255 U. S.
509. It is likewise true that Congress will be presumed
to have used a word in its usual and well-settled sense.
Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, 284 U. S. 552; Deputy v. du Pont, 308 U. S. 488. But § 26 does not exempt
simply "income"; it exempts the bonds and the "income
derived therefrom." Analytically, income derived from
mere ownership of the bonds is clearly different from income derived from dealings or transactions in the bonds.
As stated in Willcuts v. ,Bunn, 282 U. S. 216, 227-228:
"The tax upon interest is levied upon the return which
comes to the owner of the security according to the provisions of the obligation and without any further transaction on his part. The tax falls upon the owner by
virtue of the mere fact of ownership, regardless of use or
disposition of the security. The tax upon profits made
upon purchases and sales is an excise upon the result of
the combination of several factors, including capital
investment -and, quite generally, some measure of sagacity; the gain may be regarded as 'the creation of
capital, industry and skill.' Tax Commissioner v. Putnam, 227 Mass. 522, 531."
True, the Bunn case dealt only with the alleged constitutional inhibition against taxation of capital gains on
municipal bonds and not with a specific statutory exemption. But its analysis is cognate here as indicating that,
in absence of clear countervailing evidence, an exemption
of "income derived" from a security does not embrace
"income derived" from transactiong in that security.

Opinion of the Court.

311 U. S.

There are no circumstances here which should make
the reasoning of the Bunn case inapplicable.
The Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 756) was enacted
shortly after the Farm Loan Act by the same Congress
and at the same session.' Sec. 2 of that Act, like § 22 (a)
of the 1928 Act, included in taxable income "gains, profits, and income derived from . . . sales, or dealings in
property." And § 4 of that Act, like § 22 (b)*(4),of the
1928 Act, exempted. from taxation "interest upon . . .
securities issued tinder the provisions of the Federal farm
loan Act." It is clear that "all acts in pan materia are
to be taken together, as if they were one law." United
States v. Freeman,3 How. 556, 564. That these two acts
are in pan materia is plain. Both deal with precisely the
same subject matter, viz., the scope of the tax exemption
afforded farm loan bonds. The later act can therefore
be regarded as a legislative interpretation of the earlier
act (Cope v. Cope, 137 U. S. 682, 688; cf. Stockdale v.
Insurance Companies, 20 Wall. 323, 331-332) in the sense
that it aids in ascertaining the meaning of the words as
used in their contemporary setting.' It is therefore en'The Farm Loan Act became law on July 17, 1916, the Revenue
Act of 1916 on September 8, 1916.
4
It should be noted in this connection that the exemption of
"interest" contained in § 4 of the 1916 Act was continued in each
subsequent Revenue Act until 1934. Sec. 213 (b) (4), Revenue Act of
1918 (40 Stat. 1057, 1065); § 213 (b) (4),, Revenue Act of 1921 (42
Stat. 227, 238); § 213 (b) (4), Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 253,
268); § 213 (b) (4), Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 9, 24); § 22 (b)
(4), Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 791, 798; § 22 (b) (4), Revenue
Act of 1932 (47 Stat. 169, 178). By § 22 (b) (4) of the Revenue
Act of 1934 (48 Stat. 680, 687) the exemption was generalized so as
to include interest on obligations of any federal corporation which is
an instrumentality of the United States, subject to the limitation that
interest is exempt only if and to the extent provided for in the acts
of Congress authorizing the issuance of such obligations. The Senate
Committee (S. Rep. No. 558, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 23-24; Internal
Rev. Bull., Cum. Bull. 1939-1, Part 2, p. 604) made the following
comment on that change:

titlea1 to great weight in resolving any ambiguities and
doubts. Cf. United States v. Stafoff, 260 U. S.477, 480.
In that view the express' exemption of interest alone
makes tolerably clear that capital gains are not exempt.
In support of the contrary view great stress is placed on
the legislative history of § 26. Extensive references are
made to the hearings on this bill and to the debates in
Congress. Typical are the statements or criticisms that
the bill gave "these investments a distinct advantage over
other investments,"' that the exemption provision was
important," that maintenance of a market for the bonds
was desirable,' that the exemption was too broad.' These
comments, however, are inconclusive. They are not suf"This is merely a clarifying change made by the House. Under
the language of this section, as contained in existing law, interest on
securities issued under the Federal Farm Loan Act, or such Act as
amended, is expressly excluded from gross income and thereby made
exempt from the income tax. Other Acts have been enacted which
also exempt the interest on obligations issued thereunder from tax.
In order to bring the section into accord with the Acts authorizing
such exemptions and to avoid the necessity of referring to all such
Acts, a general provision has been inserted by the House excluding
from gross income the interest upon the obligations of a corporation organized under Act of Congress if such corporation is an instrumentality of the United States; subject to the limitation, however,
that the interest is exempt only to the extent provided for in the
Acts of Congress authorizing the issuance of such obligations."

of their adoption was due to the desire of Congress to grant a broader

exemption than "interest."

ficiently discriminating in their analysis or criticism to
throw light on the narrow issue involved here.
Respondent's resort to administrative interpretation of
§ 26 is equally unproductive. No established administrative l ractice is shown. The holding of the unpublished
memorandum 9 of the General Counsel of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue relied upon is not precisely in point,
evefi were we to assume that it is entitled to adthoritative weight.1" It merely ruled that a joint;-stock land
bank was not taxable on gains from purchases of its' own
bonds. And when the question of the taxability of an
indiviaual..on his capital gains from sales of these bonds
was raised less than two years later, another such ruling
was issued to the effect that he did not have the benefit of
any exemption. 1
Nbr is respondent materially aided by the change in
§ 26 made by § 817 of the Revenue Act of 1938 (52 Stat.
447, 578).' That amendment provides that "all income,
except interest, derived" from such bonds, shall be included in gross income. 1 2 It is urged that this amendment is affirmative recognition by the Congress that § 26
exempts these capital gains. But here again the legislative record is ambiguous and hence inconclusive. The
purpose of §817, as originally introduced, clearly was to

of the Senate to its present form on the suggestion that
"perhaps the language is not as broad as it should be." 14
S. Rep. No. 1567, 75th Cong., 3d Seas., p. 47. This report clearly
indicates that the Committee was of the view that under § 26 jointstock land banks were exempt from capital gains resulting from purchases of their own obligations. A change in that regard was clearly
intended, for the Committee said, p. -47:
"This section subjects to Federal income taxation the capital gain
reglized by a joint-stock land bank on the purchase of its own obligations or of mortgages made by it. It has been brought to the
attention of the committee that these banks have been purchasing
their own bonds at below par and issuing new bonds at or above par.
Gain realized on such a purchase is, under the law, taxable income and
in the case of an ordinary corporation, is taxed. Under the Federal
Farm Loan Act, however, which governs the taxability of. obligations.
of joint-stock land banks, such income is exempt. The committee is
of the opinion that such income ought to be taxed."
The Committee draft of § 817 (then § 816) provided for that
change as follows (H. R. 9682, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.):
"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 26 of the Federal Farm
Loan Act, as amended, gain realized on the acquisition by a jointstock land bank of obligations issued by it or mortgages made by it,
if such obligations or mortgages are made or issued after the date of
the enactment of this Act, shall not be exempt from Federal income
taxation."
As indicated, supra, note 9, the unpublished memorandum of the
General Counsel of the Bureau of Internal Revenue ruling that a
joint-stock land bank was not taxable on gains from purchases of
its own bonds was before the Senate Committee. Cf. the recommendation made to the Committee, S. Hearings, op. cit., supra, note
9, pp. 614, 615.

The purpose of the amendment may well have been to
clarify the doubtful and uncertain status of capital gains
which were not covered by the Committee's recommendation. There is no clear and convincing evidence that it
was designed to change existing law, so far as these other
categories of capital gains were concerned. ' But even if a
contrary implication were to be assumed, it would not
override so belatedly the clear inference, based on a long
series of revenue acts exempting only interest, that capital gains were taxable.
Respondent further argues that comparison of other
exemption statutes with the language of § 26 reinforces
the view that these capital gains are exempt. In that
connection our attention is called to numerous statutessome exempting only bonds' and others exempting
principal and interest; "6some exempting a corporation,
"including the capital stock and surplus therein, and the
income derived therefrom," " and others 18 containing
effect of the amendment is not only to tax that gain but also to tax
gain realized by another joint-stock land bank or by an individual or
corppration which itself is not exempt from Federal taxation. Thus,
gain on a sale of such a joint-stock land bank bond by an investor

is subject to tax. The amendment continues the present provision of
law under which 'interest on such bonds and mortgages is exempt
from Federal taxation."

somewhat similar exemptions for the corporation but
only an exemption as to principal and interest for its
bonds; and still, others' containing the same kind of
exemption as § 26 of the Farm Loan Act. From this
painstaking review respondent argues that where Congress has desired to exempt only "interest" it has said so
and where it has intended to grant a broader exemption
it has used the word "income"; that statutes exempting
only "interest" have a narrower meaning than those
exempting "income"; and that this long and recurrent
legislative practice discloses a clear design on the part
of Congress to draw distinctions and to shape the various
exemptions to suit its. differing policy in divers situations.
Suggestive as this analysis is, it is entitled to little
weight. No mere collation of other statutes can be decisive in determining what the instant statute means.
The meaning of each phrase must be closely related to
the time and circumstance of its use. The phrase "income derived therefrom" as used in § 26 clearly has taken
on coloration from the express exemption for nearly a
quarter century of only interest on these bonds. We
have no occasion to intimate an opinion as-to the meaning
of other similar statutes. It is sufficient here to note
that in another legislative setting "income derived" from
bonds may or may not be synonymous with "interest"
on bonds. That must necessarily be dependent on a host
of factors which only a minute scrutiny of the particular
legislative ccheme would reveal. For this reason the fact
that the same Congress which in 1938 amended § 26
granted an exemption to another federal instrumentality' ° couched in the identical language of the original
§ 26 is merely a straw in the wind. So far as the instant

bonds are concerned, that in itself is entitled to little
weight as against the long standing express exemption in
successive revenue acts of interest alone.
Respondent also stresses the fact that circulars, prepared and distributed by the Farm Loan Board "advising investors of the merits and advantages of farm
loan bonds," " stated that these bonds and their income
were "free from all forms of taxation" including the income tax, that "this exemption is complete," etc. As
we have said, it was found that respondent relied upon
such statements reasonably believing that capital gains
would not be taxable. But aside from the fact that
those statements are hardly more specific than the statute
itself, they cannot be accorded the weight of uniform
and long standing administrative treatment.2 There
was no authority for the board to make representations
that capital gains were or were not tax exempt. That
administrative function resided only in the Treasury.

of Congressional purpose as to make inapposite the application of the reasoning of Willcuts v. Bunn, supra, to
this situation. In that posture of the case, respondent
has succeeded only in casting some doubt on the proper
construction of the statute. Yet those who seek an exemption from a tax must rest it on more than a doubt or
ambiguity. Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, 161 U. S.
134, 146; 163 U. S. 416, 423. Exemptions from taxation
cannot rest upon mere implications. United States Trust

Justice Cardozo in Trotter v Tennessee, 290 U. S. 354,

by implication if doubts ae nicely balanced," And see
Pacific Co., Ltd., v. Johnson, 285 U. S. 480, 491. Hence
broad, generalized statutory exemptions have frequently
been construed narrowly and confined to those situations where the subject matter of the exemption was
