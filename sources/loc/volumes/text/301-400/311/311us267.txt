Argued November 19, 1940.-Decided December 9, 1940.

1. Section 203 (a) (2) of the Revenue Acts of 1932 and 1934, which
permits a life insurance company-defined by the Acts as "an
insurance company engaged in the business of issuing life insurance
and annuity contracts (including contracts of combined life, health,
and accident insurance)"--in computing income tax to deduct from

gross income an amount equal to a prescribed percentage of its
"reserve funds required by law," authorizes such deduction in
respect of reserves (required by law) based upon disability provisions of policies of combined life and disability insurance. P. 270.
2. The deduction may be taken in respect of such reserves whether
the policyholders have then incurred disability or not. P. 271.

311 U. S.

of the 1932 and 1934 Revenue Acts permits a life insurance company to deduct from its gross income "An
amount equal to [33/%] of the mean of the reserve
funds required by law ... " 1 That respondent was a
life insurance company as defined by the Revenue Acts
and that it was required by law to maintain reserves to
protect both death and disability benefits were conceded.
The Commissioner allowed a deduction for death reserves,
but disallowed as to disability reserves, on the hypothesis
that the words "reserve funds required by law" should be
construed to apply only to reserves for death losses-thereby excluding disability reserves. The Board of Tax
Appeals held the deductions allowable in both respects
and reversed the Commissioner.2 The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit affirmed; 8 certiorari was granted
because the Court of Claims had reached an opposite result on the same question.'
Legislative history discloses that a deduction similar
to that allowed by § 203 (a) (2) first appeared in the
Revenue Act of 1921,' and has reappeared in every revenue measure since, including that of 1939.6 Prior to 1921,
insurance companies had not been allowed such a deduction, but had been subject to the same tax plan as corpprations generally; the 1921 Act, however, wholly
exempted insurance companies from the general scheme

of corpbrate taxation and set up special systems applicable to them alone.7 The new plan, as it related to life
insurance companies, had as a major objective the elimination of premium receipts from the field of taxable
income. It had long been pointed out to. Congress that
these receipts, except as to a very minor -proportion of
each premium, were not true income but were analogous
to permanent capital investment.' In all the Revenue
Acts from 1921 through 1939, the gross income of life
insurance companies no longer included premium receipts,
but was limited to income "from interest, dividends, and
rents." ' And, pursuant to the conceived analogy of reserves to capital investment, net income was to be determined by permitting, among other deductions from gross
income, that same deduction here in dispute-a percentagQ
of the "reserve funds required by law."
As entirely new and separate tax provisions relating
only to life insurance companies were thus enacted, it
became necessary specifically to define what constituted
a "life insurance company" within the meaning of the
Act. Therefore, it was declared in the 1921 Act and all
its successors that "when used in this title the term 'life
insurance company' means aninsurance company engaged
in the business of issuing life insurance and annuity contracts (including contracts of combined life, health, andt
accident. insurance), the reserve funds of which held for
the fulfillment of such contracts comprise more than 50
per centum of its total reserve funds." 10

Opinion of the Court.

311 U. S.

Under the Congressional plan, there is granted a deduction based on those "reserve funds required by law."
Section 203 (a) (2) grants this deduction; § 201 defines
life insurance companies. It seems clear that Congress
intended to permit the deduction of reserves based on
those policies that make a company a "life insurance
company" under the Act, which, by definition, includes
policies of "combined life, health, and accident insurance."
The reserves here related to the disability provisions of
such combined policies. The same underlying considerations that prompted the deduction for death reserves
are applicable to the reserves for disability in these combined policies. And disability as well as odeath reserves
fall literally within the language of the deduction provision. It is not disputed that administrative regulations
promulgated under every Revenue Act from 1921 through
1932 recognized the right of life insurance companies to
take deductions both for death and for disability reserves
on policies such as those here involved.1' Nor is it denied
that the 1934 reenactment of § 203 (a) (2) followed
thirteen years of administrative regulation and practice
under which substantially identical provisions had been so
construed and applied that life insurance companies could
and did obtain these deductions. During that entire
P0riod, the Treasury found no ambiguity in § 203 (a) (2),
i4d expressed no doubt as to a life insurance company's
right to make such deductions. But on February 11,
1935, regulations were promulgated asserting disability
reserves to be non-deductible under the 1934 Act; 12 and
types of policies to total reserves. Since Oregon Mutual is admittedly a "life insurgnce company" regardless of which of these
contentions is correct, this question is not before us.

Opinion of the Court.

on December 18, 1935, a Treasury Decision declared that
this regulation applied retroactively to the 1932 and
earlier Acts.' Petitioner now says that the former practice in permitting disability reserve deductions was erroneous," and that the new regulation should be given
full retroactive effect.
It is the Government's contention that the change in
the regulations was particularly appropriate because in:
duced by judicial decision.15 And it is true that this
Court has held that reserves set aside by life insurance
companies to protect 'payment of policy investment purchases cannot be used as the basis for deductions. 6 But
those decisions rested upon the conclusion that the investment fund features had no relation to the insurance
risks. Here, in the combined life and health and accident
policies, the health and accident reserves are based upon
contingencies of the commencement and continuance of
disability. They have a direct and inseparable relationship to the very insurance contracts which bring respondent under a special tax scheme. 7 Nor is there a distinction, as petitioner urges, between that part of the reserve
set aside to protect policy holders not yet disabled and
that part set aside to protect those already disabled. The
liability to those who have incurred disability is not a
fixed sum, but remains a contingency, still uncertain in
'T. D. 4615, XIV-2 Cum. Bull. 310.
"In support of the Commissioner's right to change the regulations
under this supposed state of facts, the government cites Manhattan
General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, 297 U. S. 129, 134-135,
and Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, 287 U. S. 299.

-duration and amount. Reserves held for such a contingent liability are true reserves in the insurance sense.
We find it unnecessary to discuss the extent to which'
such a regulation might, under different circumstances,
be given retroactive effect by virtue of the statutory
power of the Commissioner." Nor do we find it necessary to discuss the argument that the policy behind
the special treatment afforded life insurance companies
does not warrant allowing this deduction. For it is our
conclusion that by § 203 (a) (2) of the 1932 and 1934
Acts, Congress has granted life insurance companies a
deduction for disability reserves which only Congress can
take away."9
