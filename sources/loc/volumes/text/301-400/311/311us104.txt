*Together with No. 24, Wilson & Co., Inc., 'of Kansas v. United

WILSON & CO. v.' UNITED STATES.
104

Opinion of the Court.

January 6, 1936 they exported to foreign countries large
quantities of hog products with respect to which they
paid processing taxes under § 9 (a) and floor stock taxes
under § 16 (a) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. 48
Stat. 31, 35, 40. Subsequent to exportation petitioners,
filed claims for refunds under § 17 (a). 48 Stat.
31, 40.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied all of the
claims and suit in the Court of Claims followed. The
United States thereupon moved to dismiss the petitions
on the ground that the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction because of certain provisions of Title VII of the
Revenue Act of 1936. 49 Stat. 1648, 1747-1755. The
Court of Claims dismissed the actions for want of jurisdiction, on the ground, however, that § 601 (e) of Title IV
of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1740, prevented judicial review of the Commissioner's action. 30
F. Supp. 672. To resolve the conflict with Cudahy Bros.
Co. v. La Budde, 92 F. 2d 937, and Neuss, Hesslein & Co.
v. United States, 30 F. Supp. 595, we granted certiorari.
309 U. S. 651.
The single question presented is whether the Court of
Claims was without jurisdiction of petitioners' suits.
We hold that it was.
. Title VII conditions payment of refunds upon proof
that the claimant actually bore the burden of the tax
sought to be refunded or that he unconditionally repaid
it to his vendee who bore the burden. Since petitioners
do not allege satisfaction of these conditions it is plain
that they do ,not claim under Title VII. Indeed, they
disown any attempt to bring their claims within its
provisions.
Title IV provides for, refunds to exporters of products
upon which processing or floor stock taxes have been paid.
It is true that § 17 (a) of the Agricultural Adjustment
Act provided for these refunds before the Act wam held
unconstitutional in United States v. Butler, 297'-U. S. 1.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

311 U. S.

Whether petitioners could still establish refund claims
under that section if the act had never been invalidated
is a question we need not consider. For whatever .the
effect of that decision on § 17 (a), Congress expressly
made it a part of Title IV by reenacting it in § 601 (a).
49 Stat. 1648, 1739.1

It follows that petitioners' claims,

purportedly based on § 17 (a), must be governed by Title
IV and the limitations it imposes.
Section 601 (e) of Title IV provides:
"The determination of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue with respect to any refund under this section
shall be final and no: court shall have jurisdiction to review such determination."
Petitioners contend that Congress intended to commit
to the final determination of the Commissioner only
"such matters as findings of fact, computations, and the
like." Quite apart from the fact that in §601 (d)l
Congress uses virtually the quoted words in limiting
review by administrative officers, we fail to see how the
argument can aid petitioners here because the record does
not show why. their claims were denied. Since the record
issilent on this point, such decisions as United States v.
Williams, 278 U. S. 255, and Silberschein v. United States,
266 U. S. 221, are plainly distinguishable.
We hold that upon this record the determination of the
Commissioner is final. Thus we see no occasion to narrow the effect of § 601 (e). The decision of the Court
of Claims was correct and must be
Affirmed.
1 Sec.

601. (a) The provisions of sections . .. 17 (a) of the Agricultural A.ijustment Act, as amended, are hereby reenacted but only
for the purpose of allowing refunds in accordance therewith in cases
where . . . the exportation . . . took place prior to January 6, 1936.

'Sec. 601. (d) In the absence of fraud, the findings of fact and
the decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue upon the merits
of any claim adjusted pursuant to this section and the mathematical
calculation therein shall not be subject to review by any administrative or accounting officer, employee, or agent of the United States.
