1. In the computation of net income in the case of mines, ยง 114 (b)
(4) of the Revenue Act of 1934 permits deductions, for depletion
on a percentage basis provided that the taxpayer in making his
"first return" under the Act elects to avail of that basis. Held
that an amended return, filed after the expiration of the statutory
period for filing the original return, including such extension of the
period as the Commissioner was empowered to grant, was not a
"first return" within the meaning of the section. P. 57.
2. That in the circumstances of this case the construction thus given
the statute works a hardship on the taxpayer, may be the basis
of an appeal to Congress for relief but not to the courts. P. 59.
3. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals in this case was correct and
must be sustained whether or not the court gave a wrong reason
for its action. P. 59.
