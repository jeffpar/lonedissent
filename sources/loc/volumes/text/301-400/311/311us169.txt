Statement of the Case.

v. FIELD.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. .32.

Argued November 12, 13, 1940.-Decided December 9'
1940.

1. Where the applicable rule of decision is the state law, the duty.
of the federal court is to ascertain and apply that law even
though it has not been expounded by the ,highest court of the
State. P. 177.
2. An intermediate 'state court in declaring and applying the 'state
law is acting 'as an organ of the State, and its determination, in
the absence of more convincing evidence of what the state law
is, should be followed by a federal court in deciding a- state
question. - P. 177.
.3. Certain statutes of New Jersey had been held by the state Court
of Chancery, in two cases decided independently by two ViceChancellors, not to have changed the preexisting law of the State
with respect to.the insufficiency of a mere savings bank deposit
made by a decedent in his own name as "trustee" for another,
but over .which he exercised complete control during his life,
to establish a gift inter vivos or to. create a trust as against the
decedent's legal representatives. So far as appeared, the Court
of Appeals of New Jersey had not expressed any opinion on the
construction or effect of these statutes, and the decisions of the
Chancery court stood as* the only -exposition of the relevant state
law. Held, in a case presenting the same question, that a federal
court was bound to follow the decisions of the Chancery court,
and was not at liberty to reject them merely because it did not
agree with their reasoning.

4. It is inadmissible that there should be one rule of state law for
litigants in the state courts and another rule, simply because of
diverse citizenship, for litigants in the federal courts. P. 180.

the Court of Errors and Appeals. Ramsey v. Hutchinson, 117 N. J. L. 222.
Since it has been uniformly held that the courts of the
United States are compelled to observe the decisions of
the Supreme Court of New Jersey construing the statutes of that State, as beingdeclaratory of the law of that
State (Erie R. Co. v. Hilt, 247 U. S. 97, 100; Erie'R. Co.
v. Duplak, 286 U. S. 440, 443; and North Philadelphia
Trust Co. v. Smith, 13 F. 2d 585, 586), it follows that
the decision in the- case under review, which, in effect,
ignored the decisions of the Court of Chancery likewise
construing a statute of that State, must be -based on he
view that the Court of Chancery is not of equal rank or
importance with the State Supreme Court. Such reason.ing is patently erroneous. Pennsylvania R. Co. V. Nat.
Docks Ry. Co., 54 N. J. Eq. 652; In re appointment of
-Vice-Chancellors, 105 N. J. Eq. 759; Gregory v. Gregory,

v. Johnson, 97 N. J. Eq. 296, 297; Ramsey v. Hutchinson, 117 N. J. L. 222; Cassatt v. First National Bank of
West New York, 9 N. J. Misc. 222.
The Justices of the Supreme Court and the Chancellor
both sit on the Court of Errors and Appeals, but the
Chancellor is the president of the Court of Errors and
Appeals.
Although, as stated in Ludlow v. Executors of Ludlow, 4 N. J. L. 451, and in Whitehead v. Gray, 12 N. J. L.
36, the Supreme Court has the superintendence of all
inferior courts both civil and criminal, nowhere is it given
superintendence over the Court of Chancery, nor has it
ever attempted to assert such superintendence.'
Federal courts, charged with a duty to ascertain a
state law, need not give greater weight to decisions of a
local court than other courts in the same State but outside of its territorial jurisdiction would accord, and are
free to make an independent determination of state law

in the same manner and subject to the same limitations
as such other state courts. Cf. 53 Harv. Law Rev., No.
5, p. 880. But where the jurisdiction of an important
state court, such as the Court of Chancery of New Jersey, is state-wide, its determination as to the prevailing,
state law should be followed by federal courts, particularly where its decisions have not been challenged for
years by any other court in the State, and where the
legislature has made no attempt to modify or amend the
statute construed but has re-enacted it. See Baltimore
& Ohio R. Co. V.Baugh, 149 U. S. 368.
Mr. Russell C. MacFall for respondent.
'The New Jersey statute of 1932 validated tentative
trusts with respect to savings bank deposits.
The Court of Chancery in Thatcher v. Trenton'Trust
Co., 119 N. J. Eq. 408, and Travers v. Reid, 119 N. J. Eq.
416, and the trial court below, in refusing to apply the
1932 statute, disregarded fundamental rules of construction. No consideration was given to the presumption of
the constitutionality of the Act; nor to the presumption
that the legislature did not intend to adopt a superfluous, law; nor to the rule that where an Act is unambiguous in its terms there is no room for judicial construction
because the language is presumed to evince the legislative intent; nor to the rule that where an Act.is susceptible of two constructions, that which will validate it
must be adopted.
If such decisions carried the weight and authority
claimed for them, it would be necessary to rec6gnize that
a situation exists whereby the will of the people of the
State of New Jersey, as expressed through its legislature,
may be set aside solely by the decision of a trial judge.
But that is not the fact. The effect and validity of
',e statute will, ltimately be determined by the Court
of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey. The decisions of
the Court of Chancery do not settle the.' aw of the State.

Until the effect of the statute is finally determined by
New Jersey's court of last resort, or at least by an authoritative appellate court of that State, the federal
courts are free to determine whether or not the decisions
of the Court of Chancery truly'express the local law.
No advantage exists to the litigants because the federal jurisdiction has been invoked, nor should any disadvantage result, and if in an identical action in the
state courts those courts are free to disagree with the
decision of the Court of Chancery, the federal courts
likewise are free, and are charged with the duty of determining and applying the applicable local law.

left untouched the well established rule, reiterated by
this Court in Minnesota ex rel. Pearsonv. ProbateCourt
of Ramsey County, 309 U. S.270, that the federal courts
are bound by the decisions of the highest court of the
State in matters depending upon the construction of
state statutes or constitution.
In Blair v. Commissioner of internal R Tvenue, 300
U. S.5, this Court found that the decision of the state
appellate court was res judicata.
In Russell v. Todd, 309 U. S.280, this Court followed
the decision of the Appellate Division, an intermediate
appellate court, not because it felt bound by that decision in the absence of a ruling upon the precise question
by the court of last resort, but because the reasoning of
the decision was persuasive.
The Circuit Court of Appeals correctly stated the
rule: The federal courts should in all instances follow

the law of the State with respect to the construction of
state statutes. Where that law has been determined by
the courts of last resort their decisions are stare decisis,
and must be followed irrespective of the federal courts'
opinion as to what the law ought to be. As to pronouncements of other state courts, however, the federal
courts are not .so bound, but may conclude that the decision does not truly express the state law.

'MR. CHIEF JusTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

.the Court.
In 1935, Edith M. Peck causea the title of a savings
bankaccount standing in her name to be transferred on
the records of the ban to "Edith M., Peck,in trust for
Ethel Adelaide Field." Miss Peck retained exclusive
control over the account, with sol6 right of withdrawal
and right of revocation, and gave no further notice of the
existence of a trust.
This suit was brough by Ethel Adelaide Field against
the bank and the executors of Miss Peck 't obtain a
decree that the credit balance of the account belonged to
thecomplainant. The executors- denied the validity, of
the trust and claimed title. The District Court found
in favor of the executors upon the ground that under
the law of New Jersey there was no trust and no talid
gift. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, holding that under a state statute the complainant
was, entitled to recover. In so ruling, the court declined

to follow contrary decisions of the Chancery Court of

New Jersey. 108 F. 2d 521. In view of the importance
of the question thus presented, we granted certiorari.
309 U. S. 652.
In 1932, the legislature of New Jersey passed four
statutes, in similar terms and approved on the same date,
dealing with trust deposits in banks. The text of one of
these provisions is set forth in the margin.1 Prior to
these statutes, it had been the law of New Jersey that a
mere savings bank deposit made by a decedent in his own
name as trustee for another, over which the decedent
exercised Complete control during his life, was insufficient
to establish a gift inter vivos or to create a trust as
against the decedent's legal representatives. Nicklas v.
Parker, 69 N. J. Eq. 743, affirmed, 71 N. J. Eq. 777;
61 A. 267; Johnson v. Savings Investment & Trust Co.,
107 N. J. Eq. 547; 153 A. 382, affirmed, 110 N. J. Eq.
466; 160 A. 371.
The statutes of 1932 came before the Chancery Court
of New Jersey in 1936, in two cases decided independently
by two Vice-Chancellors, Thatcherv. Trenton Trust Co.,
'Chapter 40, New Jersey Session Laws of 1932, § 1, is as follows:
"1. Whenever any deposit shall be made with any savings bank,
trust company or bank by any person in trust for another, and no
other or further notice- of the existence and terms of a legal and
valid trust shall have been given in writing to the savings bank,'
trust company or bank, in the event of the death of the trustee,
the same or any part thereof, together with the dividends or nteteA
thereon, shall be paid to the person in trust for whom the said
deposit was made, or to his or her legal representatives and the
legal representatives of the deceased trustee shall not be- entitled
to. the funds so deposited not to the dividends or interest thereon
notwithstanding that the .funds so deposited may have been the
property of the trustee; provided, that the person for whom the
deposit was made, if a minor, shall not draw the same during his
-or her minority without the written consent of the legal representatives of said trustee." See Revised Statutes of New Jersey, 1937,
17: 9-4.

119 N. J. Eq. 408; 182 A. 912, and Travers v. Reid, 119
N. J. Eq. 416; 182 A. 908. In the Thatcher case it appeared that the decedent, at the time of her death in
1934; had two bank balances standing to her credit "in
trust for Clifford Thatcher," the complainant. The bill
was dismissed. - The court found that there were no facts,
beypnd the mere opening of the account in that manner,
"in any Way tending to prove the declaration of a trust.'
The court examined the legislation of 1932, which it was
argued had changed the -law of the State, and after considefimg possible purposes of the legislature and analyzing
the language employed, which was deemed to be "confused" and "difficult to comprehend," the court depided
that the legislation was inoperative to change the law
'applicable to the facts before. the court._In the Travers
case, the decedent had changed his bank account to his
name "in trust.for Joseph Jennings," a minor. In a suit
by the decedent's executrix to recover the money, a motion by the minor's guardian to strike the bill for want
of equity and upon the ground that the fund was the
property of the ward or held in trust for him, was denied.
After stating the law as it stood before the statutes of
1932, the court concluded that they had not been effective
to alter the previous legal requirements of a gift inter
vivos or a valid trust. These cases were not reviewed
by the Court of Errors and'Appeals of New Jerisey and,
.so far as -appears, that court has not expressed an opinion
upon the construction and effect of the statutory
provisions.2
'In Cutts v. Najdrowski, 123 N. J. Eq. 481; 198 A. 885 (1938),
the Court of Errors and Appeals held that the validity of a trust
of choses in action created by a transaction inter vivos was determined by the law of the place where the transaction occurred; in
that case New York. In Trust Company of New Jersey v. Farawell,'127 N. J. Eq. 45; 11 A. 2d 98 (1940), the Court of Errors and
Appeals held that, where the decedent had made a deposit in her
name in trust for her daughters, and the savings bank book was

The Circuit Court of Appeals found it impossible to
distinguish the facts in the two Chancery cases from those
shown here. The court recognized its duty to follow the
law of the State and said that where that law had been
determined by the state court of last resort its decision
must be followed irrespective of the federal court's opinion of what the law ought to be. But the majority of
the Circuit Court of Appeals took the. view that it was
not so bound "by the pronouncements of. other state
courts" but might conclude that "the decision does not
truly express the state law." The court held that the
statute of 1932 was "clearly constitutional and unambiguous" and that "contrary decisions" of -the Chancery
Court of New Jersey were not binding. Accordingly, the
judgment of the District Court was reversed.
We think that this ruling was erroneous. The highest
state -court is the final authority on state law (Beals v.
Hale, 4 How. 37, 54; Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304
U. S.64, 78), but it is still the duty of the federal courts,
where the state law supplies the rule of decision," to
ascertain and apply that law even though it has not been
expounded by the highest court of the State. See Ruhlin
v. New York Life Insurance Co., 304 U. S.202, 209. An
intermediate state court in declaring and applying the
state law is acting as an organ of the State and its deter,thereafter in the possession of the daughters and withdrawals were
made upon the signatures of the mother and the daughters and
were used for maintaining properties devised to the daughters by
the mother shortly after the account was opened, there was sufficient evidence to show a presently, effective trust. The court said
that such a trust depends essentially upon the same principles. "that
activate a gift inter vivos,. comprising donative'.intent, delivery of
the subject-matter to the extent that delivery is possible or can be

indicated, and the abdication by the donor of dominion over the
subject-matter."

to the statutes of 1932 or to the Chancery decisions cited in the
above text.

mination, in the absence of more convincing evidence of
what the state law is, should be followed by a federal
court in deciding a state question. We have declared that
principle in West v. American Telephone & Telegraph
Co., post, p. 223. It is true that in that case an intermediate appellate court of the State had determined the
immediate question as between the same parties in a
prior suit, and the highest state court had refused to review the lower court's decision, but we set forth the
broader principle as applicable to the decision of an intermediate court, in the absence of a decision by the highest
court, whether the question is one of statute or common
law.
Here, the question was as to the construction and effect
of a state statute. The federal court was not at liberty
to undertake the determination of that question on its
own reasoning independent of the construction and effect
which the State itself accorded to its statute. That construction and effect are shown by the judicial action
through which the State interprets and applies its legislation. That judicial action in this instance has been
taken by the Chancery Court of New Jersey and we have
no other evidence of the state law in this relation.
Equity decrees in New Jersey are entered by the Chancellor, who constitutes the Court of Chancery,' upon the
advice of the Vice-Chancellors, and these decrees, like the
judgments of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, are subject to review only by the Court of Errors and Appeals.'
We have held that the decision of the Supreme Court
upon the construction of a state statute should be followed in the absence of an expression of a countervailing
view by the State's highest court (Erie Railroad Co. v.
'N. J. Constitution, Art. VI, § 4.

Opinion of the Court.

Hilt, 247 U. S. 97, 100, 101; Erie Railroad Co. v. Duplak,
286 U. S. 440, 444), and we think that the decisions of
the Court of Chancery are entitled to like respect as announcing.the law of the State.
While, of course, the decisions of the Court of Chancery
are not binding on the' Court of Errors and Appeals, a
uniform ruling either by the 'Court of Chancery or by
the Supreme Court over a course of years will not be set
aside by the highest court "except for cogent and important 'reasons." Ramsey v. Hutchinson, 117. N. J. L.
222, 223; 187 A. 650. It appears that ordinarily the decisions of the Court of Chancery,' if they have not been
disapproved, are treated as binding in later cases in chancery' (Philadelphia& Camden Ferry Co.. v. Johnson, 94
N. J. Eq., 296, 297; 121 A. 900), but there is always, as
respondent urges, the possibility that a particular decision of the Court of Chancery will not be followed by the
Supreme Court (see Flagg v. Johansen, 124 N. J. L. 456,
461; 12 A. 2d 374) or even by the Court of Chancery
itself. See Kicey v. Kicey, 112N. J. Eq. 459, 461; 164
A. 684. It is the function of the court of last resort to
resolve such conflicts as may be created by decisions of
the lower courts, and except in rare instances that function is performed and the law is settled accordingly.
Here, however, there is no conflict of decision. Whether
there ever will be, or the Court of Errors and Appeals
will disapprove the rulings in the Thatcher and Travers
cases, is merely a matter of conjecture. See West v.,
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., s-pra. At the,
present time the Thatcher and Travers cases stand as
the only exposition of the law of the State with respect
to the construction and effect of the statutes of 1932,
and the Circuit Court of Appeals was not at liberty to
reject these decisions merely because it did no- agree
with their reasoning.
The question has practical aspects of great importance
in the proper administration of justice in the federal

courts. It is inadmissible that there should be one rule
of state law for litigants in the state courts and another
rule for litigants who bring the same question before the
federal courts owing to the circumstance of diversity of
citizenship. In the absence of any contrary showing, the
rule of the Thatcher and Travers cases appears to be the
one which would be applied in litigation in the state
court, and whether believed to be sound or unsound, it
should have been followed by the Circuit 'Court of
Appeals.
