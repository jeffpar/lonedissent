TRUSTEE,

v.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 55.

Argued October 20, 1949.-Decided November 21, 1949.

In an arrangement proceeding instituted by a corporate debtor under
Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, an indenture trustee objected
to the allowance of claims equal to the principal amount of debentures acquired at a discount, while the debtor was insolvent, by respondents, who were close relatives and an office associate of the
debtor's directors. The referee found, in effect, that there was no
bad faith or unfair dealing, and that, during the period of the purchases, respondents' conduct with reference to the affairs of the
debtor was to its material benefit. The referee dismissed the
objections, and both the District Court and the Court of Appeals
affirmed. Held: On the record in this case, equitable considerations do not require that respondents' claims be limited to the
cost of the debentures plus interest. Pp. 305-315.
(a) The two respondents who were close relatives of the directors
purchased all their debentures while the debtor was a going concern
(though technically insolvent); and, even if their claims be viewed
as claims of directors, the probability that an actual conflict of
interests arose from their purchases is not great enough to justify
the exercise of equity jurisdiction to limit their claims to the cost
of the debentures plus interest. Pp. 309-313.
(b) The third respondent did purchase a small portion of his
debentures after the debtor ceased to be a going concern; but he
was merely an office associate and friend of the directors, he had
begun to buy debentures some months before their election, there
was nothing to indicate that his purchases after they became directors were influenced by advice from them, they had no interest
in his holdings, and consideration of his claim as that of a director
is precluded. Pp. 314-315.
173 F. 2d 944, affirmed.

In a proceeding under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy
Act, the referee's dismissal of objections to the allowance
of certain claims was affirmed by the District Court (80

MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.
This proceeding in bankruptcy is on objections to the
allowance of claims equal to the principal amount of
bonds of the debtor acquired at a discount during its
insolvency by close relatives and an office associate of
directors of debtor. Petitioner's objection that equitable considerations require limitation of the claims was
dismissed by the referee, and the District Court affirmed.
80 F. Supp. 822. Following affirmance by a divided Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 173 F. 2d 944, we
granted certiorari because the issue presented has importance in the administration of the arrangement and
corporate reorganization provisions of the Bankruptcy
Act. 337 U. S. 923.
On January 8, 1946, Calton Crescent, Inc., sold its only
property, an apartment house located in New Rochelle,
New York, for $300,000 pursuant to a contract entered
into in October 1945. Being unable to discharge in full
its obligations under debenture bonds maturing in 1953,
outstanding in principal amount of $254,450, debtor filed
in May 1946, a petition under Ch. XI of the Bankruptcy
Act, 11 U. S. C. § 701 et seq. Under the plan of arrangement, authorizing a dividend of 43.61% of the principal

amount of the bonds, respondents Regine Becker, Emily
K. Becker, and Walter A. Fribourg were to receive an aggregate dividend of $64,237.53 on allowance of claims
based on respective individual holdings of debentures
which total $147,300 in principal sum but were acquired
at a total cost of $10,195.43.1 Petitioner, Manufacturers
Trust Company, appearing individually as creditor for
fees and disbursements due it as indenture trustee and
also as original trustee under said indenture, objected to
allowance of respondents' claims as filed, on the ground
that the circumstances of respondents' acquisitions require limitation of their claims to the cost of the debentures plus interest.
The circumstances pertinent to our consideration of
petitioner's objections are as follows: The debtor was
organized in 1933 to take title to the apartment property
pursuant to a plan of reorganization. By January 1942
debtor had defaulted under the terms of the first mortgage and was operating with a deficit; at no time in the
previous several years had its debentures been selling
on the market at more than 8% of face value.
While debtor was then considering a sale of the property for $220,000, a suit to enjoin the sale was brought by
Sanford Becker, son of respondent Regine Becker and
husband of respondent Emily Becker.2 Thereafter he
proposed to arrange a loan on second mortgage to debtor
of $15,000 to pay off the arrearages on the first mortgage,
1 The

amount and cost of the respective holdings of the respondents,

insofar as objected to, are as follows:

all share and debenture holders being invited to participate. In April 1942 debtor accepted the offer, but none
of its share or debenture holders elected to participate
other than respondent Fribourg, who had desk room in
the offices of Sanford Becker and his brother Norman
Becker and was a long-time friend of the former. The
loan was made by respondents Regine Becker, Emily
Becker, and Fribourg. The second mortgage thus created
was in default by the end of 1942, and in 1943 respondents took an assignment of rents but did not foreclose;
nor was there change in management of the property.
The second mortgage and interest were paid upon sale
of the property in 1946. In addition to the second mortgage, sums aggregating $7,921.63 were advanced by respondents to pay taxes; this amount was repaid without
interest in 1944 and 1945. Pursuant to provisions of the
loan agreement in 1942, Sanford and Norman Becker were
made directors of debtor, and when the remaining three
directors resigned in 1944, the vacancies were filled by
nominees of the Becker brothers.
The referee found that from early 1942 the market
value of the property of debtor was insufficient to pay its
debts. However, the record shows a tax valuation during
the period of only slightly less than the outstanding indebtedness.3 And although the debtor's operating account frequently ran in arrears, it revealed a surplus in
purchased, independently, debentures of debtor of the face value of
$5,000. No contest is made of these purchases.
It appears that transactions in the debentures included the transfer
of capital shares of the debtor which had no market apart from the
debentures.
3 The major items of indebtedness consisted of (1) the first mortgage on the apartment building in original principal amount of
$175,000, which had been reduced by 1946 to $154,000, of which
reduction $7,875 had been paid since 1943; (2) the second mortgage

1945. Prior to disposing of its property debtor was at all
times a going concern.4
The debentures on which respondents claim were acquired, at prices varying from 3% to 14% of face value,
after the Becker brothers became directors in 1942.'
Sanford Becker did not buy additional debentures after
becoming a director. Norman Becker never owned any
interest whatever in the debtor. Although neither of the
Becker directors was interested in any purchase of the
respondents, the debentures of Regine and Emily Becker
were purchased through the agency of the Becker brothers
and in the latter's judgment. The debentures of Regine Becker were purchased from an over-the-counter
securities broker. Those of Emily Becker were acquired
in part from the same dealer, in part from an estate whose
attorneys were fully informed as to debtor's financial affairs, and in part from a Christian Association represented
by a member of its investment committee who was fully
advised as to the condition of debtor.
Some of Fribourg's debentures were bought from
dealers in the over-the-counter market; others were acquired through an agent from the president and vice
president of debtor when they withdrew from its management in 1944, and from other holders after the retiring
president insisted that the offer made to him by Fribourg's
agent be extended to all holders and be accompanied by
and tax advances of the respondents totalling some $22,000, and (3)
the debentures of $254,450, on which, however, interest was payable
only if earned. The tax valuation was $421,630.
4 The District Court's characterization of debtor as a going concern
was not upset by the Court of Appeals and is accepted here.
5 Regine Becker began purchases on February 10, 1944, and continued through August 30, 1945. The purchases of Emily Becker
were made between May 24, 1944, and February 5, 1945. In addition to the purchases referred to in note 2, supra, Fribourg made purchases through June 4, 1946.

a statement of the president's intention to accept. Fribourg was in the market for speculative securities and
purchased the debentures as a "gamble," being influenced
by the tax valuation of the apartment building.
All of respondents' debentures, with the exception of
$2,000 in face value purchased by Fribourg from a dealer,
were acquired in advance of the contract for sale of the
apartment property and the filing of debtor's petition
for arrangement.'
It was the referee's finding, left undisturbed by both
courts below, that respondents' purchases were without
overreaching or failure to disclose any material fact to
the selling bondholders. Petitioner does not here contend that respondents' claims should be limited because
of conduct by the Becker directors or by respondents
amounting to bad faith or abuse of fiduciary advantage.
Nor does petitioner contend that respondents' bondholdings influenced the conduct of corporate affairs to the
injury of the corporation or other creditors. Indeed, the
referee found that the purchases were not unfair to debtor,
that at the time of respondents' purchases debtor was not
in the field to settle its indebtedness on the debentures,
and that the assistance rendered to debtor by respondents materially aided in its grave financial situation.
Moreover, the findings indicate that the most generous
suggestion of an offer for the apartment building after
the Beckers became directors and prior to the sale was
at a figure substantially less than the sale price.
Petitioner urges broadly that directors are precluded
from profiting by the purchase of claims against an in6

The latest purchase by a respondent clearly prior to the contract

for sale was by Regine Becker on August 30 preceding the contract
in October 1945. Fribourg apparently acquired $1,500 of debentures
after the contract of sale and an additional $500 after the filing of
debtor's petition.

solvent corporation. And, it contends, if directors may
claim only the cost of debt securities acquired at a discount during a debtor's insolvency, those related as respondents are to the Becker directors should not be
permitted to do more. Thus we view respondents' claims
initially as if they were claims of directors.
This Court has repeatedly insisted on good faith and
fair dealing on the part of corporate fiduciaries. It is
especially clear, when claims in bankruptcy accrue to the
benefit of a corporate officer or director, that the court
must reject any claim that would not be fair and equitable
to other creditors. Pepper v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295, 308309 (1939).'
Claims of a corporate officer or director arising out
of transactions with the corporation have been enforced
when good faith and fairness were found. Sanford Fork
& Tool Co. v. Howe, Brown & Co., 157 U. S. 312 (1895);
cf. Manufacturing Co. v. Bradley, 105 U. S. 175 (1882);
see Richardson's Ex'r v. Green, 133 U. S. 30, 43 (1890);
Twin-Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, 91 U. S. 587, 589-591
(1876). Likewise a standard of good faith and fair dealing has been found applicable, where not superseded by a
differing legislative or administrative rule, to purchases
by directors of corporate shares, in the over-the-counter
market, at less than book value on conversion under a
plan of public utility reorganization. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corporation,318 U. S. 80
(1943); cf. id., 332 U. S. 194 (1947). In the first ChenSince the power of disallowance of claims, conferred on the bankruptcy court by § 2 of the Act, 30 Stat. 545, 11 U. S. C. § 11, embraces the rejection of claims "in whole or in part, according
to the equities of the case," Pepper v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295, 304-305
(1939), the court may undoubtedly require limitation of the amount
of claims in view of equitable considerations. Cf. Bankruptcy Act,
§ 212, 52 Stat. 895, 11 U. S. C. § 612.

cry decision it was declared that equity has not imposed
"upon officers and directors of a corporation any fiduciary
duty to its stockholders which precludes them, merely
because they are officers and directors, from buying and
selling the corporation's stock." 318 U. S. at 88.
When the transactions underlying respondents' claims
here are drawn alongside a good faith standard of fiduciary
obligation, they appear unobjectionable. There is no
component of unfair dealing or bad faith.8 The findings
negative any misrepresentation or deception, any utilization of inside knowledge or strategic position, or any
rivalry with the corporation.' During the period of the
purchases the conduct of the Becker directors and of
respondents with reference to the affairs of the debtor
was to its substantial benefit and to the advantage of the
other debenture holders. And there is nothing to suggest
that had the debentures been acquired by the Becker
directors, they would have been unjustly enriched. Cf.
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corporation, supra, 318 U. S. at 86.
However, it is the contention of petitioner, and of the
Securities and Exchange Commission as amicus curiae,
that a standard of good faith and fair dealing is inadequate here. Relying particularly upon Magruder v.
Drury, 235 U. S. 106 (1914), they invoke the principle
that a trustee can make no profit from his trust. But
Magruder v. Drury involved an express trust, and even
during insolvency corporate assets "are not in any true

and complete sense trusts." Hollins v. Brierfield Coal &
Iron Co., 150 U. S. 371, 381-382 (1893).11
The Commission asserts, also, that if a director is free
to acquire corporate obligations at a discount during insolvency and later enforce them in full, he will be subject
to a possible conflict of interests inconsistent with his
role as fiduciary to creditors of the corporation. Specifically it is argued that he may seek to postpone adjustment of claims or the institution of proceedings for relief,
when such action would serve the interests of the corporation and its creditors, in order to continue his own purchase of corporate obligations at a market price lower
than the valuation which he has made with the benefit of
inside information.
This Court has recognized that equity must apply not
only the doctrines of unjust enrichment when fiduciaries
have yielded to the temptation of self-interest but also a
standard of loyalty which will prevent a conflict of interests from arising. See Weil v. Neary, 278 U. S. 160, 173
(1929); cf. Woods v. City Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 312
U. S. 262, 268 (1941). In this case the consideration
is whether or to what extent a conflict of interests
would arise from a director's opportunity to purchase
unmatured obligations of a corporation which, though
technically insolvent, remains nevertheless a going concern. That "there is no such conflict in the ordinary case
of the purchase by a director in a going corporation of its
outstanding obligations," Seymour v. Spring Forest Cemetery Assn., 144 N. Y. 333, 344, 39 N. E. 365, 367 (1895),
10 Other holdings upon which the Commission relies, Pepper v.
Litton, supra, note 7, and Woods v. City Nat. Bank & Trust Co.,
312 U. S. 262 (1941), were considered in Securitiesand Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corporation,318 U. S. 80, 89 (1943), and there
distinguished on grounds which are also dispositive here.

would seem true not only of solvent corporations.'
Certainly the present record does not tend to establish that
the opportunity for such purchases during insolvency
would deprive a going corporation of the sound judgment
of its officer. And in any event the potentiality of conflict must be weighed against the desirability of permitting reinforcement of the insolvent's position insofar as
a director's acquisition of claims may help."2 On this
record the probability that an actual conflict of loyalties
arose from the opportunity to purchase respondents'
claims, while the debtor was a going concern, is not great
enough to justify the exercise of equity jurisdiction which
petitioner urges."
Undoubtedly the possibilities of a conflict of interests
for the purchasing director are intensified as the corporation becomes less a going concern and more a prospective
subject of judicial relief. And if it is clear that a fiduciary
may ordinarily purchase debt claims in fair transactions
n1Courts of equity, in defining the responsibility of officers of a
corporation which is insolvent and yet a going concern, have frequently assigned greater importance to the corporation's vitality than
to its insolvency. E. g., Sanford Fork & Tool Co. v. Howe, Brown &
Co., 157 U. S. 312 (1895); White, Potter & Paige Mfg. Co. v. Henry
B. Pettes Importing Co., 30 F. 864 (E. D. Mo. 1887).
12 As respondents' purchases of debentures resulted in their securing
control of debtor, see note 2, supra, the acquisitions arguably were a
factor in preventing further financial deterioration of debtor. See
also 62 Harv. L. Rev. 1391, 1392 (1949): Insolvency "is the very
time when such purchases may be of most benefit to the corporation,
since the credit of the corporation may be improved if it is known
that directors are purchasing the corporation's securities; also it
may be possible to forestall a bankruptcy petition while the corporation improves its financial position."

Special Master: Claims of Macklin et al. (N. D. Ohio, 1949); see

during solvency of the corporation, 4 the lower federal
courts seem equally agreed that he cannot purchase after
judicial proceedings for the relief of a debtor are expected
or have begun. 5 In this case, which lies between, it is
unnecessary to determine precisely at what point the
probability of conflict requires that equity declare ended
the opportunity for profitable trading. It could hardly
have been prior to the latest purchases of Regine and
Emily Becker.'6
The nature of the relation between Fribourg and the
Becker directors makes immaterial that some of Fribourg's debentures may have been purchased after the
corporation ceased to have the potency of a going concern,
in expectation of or even after bankruptcy. Neither
director had any indirect interest in Fribourg's holdings
or served as his agent for purchase. Fribourg, moreover,
had begun to acquire debentures some months before the
negotiations leading to the election of the Beckers as
directors of the debtor and, according to Fribourg's uncontradicted testimony, he began to purchase after looking over the apartment following Sanford Becker's mention of his own purchase. There is nothing in the record
to indicate that Fribourg's purchases after the Beckers
became directors were influenced by advice from them.
See In re Philadelphia & Western R. Co., 64 F. Supp. 738, 739
(E. D. Pa. 1946); Ripperger v. Allyn, 25 F. Supp. 554, 555 (S. D.
N. Y. 1938); In re McCrory Stores Corp., note 9, supra, at 269.

Co., note 14, supra; In re Jersey Materials Co., note 9, supra; In re
Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., 46 F. Supp. 77 (S. D. Cal. 1941).
16 Thus it becomes unnecessary to determine whether the relation
of the Becker respondents to the directors was such as to require
limitation of these respondents' claims if they would be disallowed
in part as claims of directors.

Accordingly, any consideration of Fribourg's claim as that
of a director is precluded.
A word of caution as to the scope of our decision is
desirable in view of Judge Learned Hand's opinion below.
He suggested that if in fact liquidation had been imminent at the time of respondents' purchases or if it were
fairly demonstrable, as a matter of experience, that a director free from all potential self-interest would be more
likely to initiate liquidation proceedings or to effect a debt
settlement than one not wholly disinterested, a court of
equity should explore such issues and not dismiss them
out of hand. This decision is not meant to negative the
relevance of these issues when raised by a proper record.
We mention these matters because the Securities and Exchange Commission urges the importance of a decision
in this case for questions that may well arise in proceedings under Ch. X. In such proceedings the Securities
and Exchange Commission, acting as the statutory advisor to the court, would be within its rightful function in
submitting to the court the light of its experience on dealings of the general kind disclosed in this case. Here we
have proven facts in a particular case, and not a body of
evidence submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, presumably informed by expert understanding.

dition of the corporation, the more it needs the undivided
loyalty of its directors. Conflicts of interest must be
resolved in its favor. An example of the need for doing
so arises whenever, in the face of a prospect of the corporation's liquidation, some of its directors invest in its
notes at a substantial discount. An inherent conflict of
interests is thereby created. It may be necessary for
them to choose between a corporate policy of reorganization which might be best for the corporation and one of
liquidation which might yield more certain profits to them
as noteholding directors. The fiduciary obligation of
such directors to their corporation might thus conflict
with their personal interests as noteholders. Their access
to confidential corporate information emphasizes the good
faith expected of them. The solution lies in making them
accountable to their corporation for their profits from such
an investment, much as a trustee must account to his
beneficiaries for his profits from dealings in the subject
matter of his trust. This result would spring wholly from
the fiduciary nature of the obligations of directors to their
corporation. It would need no proof of a breach of trust
or of the actual overreaching of anyone.:
As long as a corporation enjoys the healthy status of
a going concern, its directors generally may invest freely
in its securities without accountability for their resulting
1 Expression has been given to such a principle in many cases
where there have also occurred breaches of trust of a nature so serious
as not to require a final reliance upon the principle. See, e. g., In re
The Van Sweringen Co., 119 F. 2d 231 (C. A. 6th Cir.); In re Norcor

profits. Their directorships should make them accountable for such profits when their personal interests as
purchasers of securities may conflict with their obligations
as directors.2 A mere excess of a corporation's liabilities
over its assets may not subject its directors to this accountability. Nevertheless, any evidence of the financial
instability of their corporation obligates the directors to
overcome whatever presumption of conflict of interests
between their own and those of the corporation or of
its creditors that such evidence presents.
In the instant case there should be a finding whether
or not, at the time of the purchases of the debentures in
question, there was a sufficient prospect of liquidation to
bring the interests of directors as debenture purchasers
into conflict with the interests of their corporation. If
such a conflict is established, it then will be necessary to
determine the extent, if any, to which the relatives and
associates of such directors are to be identified with them.
I agree with the reasoning of the dissent below. 173
F. 2d 944, 951. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further findings in accordance with this opinion.

Directors ordinarily may buy and sell the stock of their corpora-

tion, without accountability, except under special circumstances of
unfairness in the particular transaction. 3 Fletcher, Cyclopedia of
Corporations §§ 1171, 1174 (1947); Ballantine on Corporations § 80
(Rev. ed. 1946). Their purchase of stock increases their stake in
the ultimate interests of the corporation they serve.
