BOYD v. GRAND TRUNK W. R. CO.
Opinion of the Court.

BOYD v. GRAND TRUNK WESTERN RAILROAD
COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN.

No. 17.

Argued October 11, 1949.-Decided November 7, 1949.

An agreement between a railroad and an employee injured by its
negligence, which limits the venue of any action thereafter brought
by the employee under the Federal Employers' Liability Act and
deprives him of his right to bring an action in any forum authorized
by the Act, is void as conflicting with the Act. Pp. 263-266.
321 Mich. 693, 33 N. W. 2d 120, reversed.

In a suit brought by a railroad company in a state
court of Michigan to enjoin petitioner from prosecuting
a Federal Employers' Liability Act case against it in
Illinois, the trial court held that a contract restricting
the choice of venue was void and dismissed the suit. The
Michigan Supreme Court reversed. 321 Mich. 693, 33
N. W. 2d 120. This Court granted certiorari. 337 U. S.
923, Reversed, p. 266.

PER CURIAM.

In issue here is the validity of a contract restricting the
choice of venue for an action based upon the Federal
Employers' Liability Act.' Petitioner was injured in the
course of his duties as an employee of respondent railroad
in November, 1946. Twice during the following month
petitioner was advanced fifty dollars by respondent. On
each of these occasions petitioner signed an agreement
1 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U. S. C. § 51.

stipulating that if his claim could not be settled and he
elected to sue, "such suit shall be commenced within the
county or district where I resided at the time my injuries
were sustained or in the county or district where my
injuries were sustained and not elsewhere."2 Although
this provision defined the available forum as either the
Circuit Court of Calhoun County, Michigan, or the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan, petitioner brought an action in the Superior
Court of Cook County, Illinois. To enjoin petitioner's
prosecution of the Illinois case, respondent instituted this
suit. The Michigan Circuit Court held that the contract
restricting the choice of venue was void and dismissed
the suit. The Michigan Supreme Court reversed. 321
Mich. 693, 33 N. W. 2d 120 (1948).
Certiorari was granted, 337 U. S. 923 (1949), because
the federal and state courts which have considered the
issue have reached conflicting results.' We agree with
2 The agreement also provided that the sums advanced would be
deducted from whatever settlement or recovery petitioner finally
achieved. As to this, the proviso in § 5 of the Liability Act specifies "That in any action brought against any such common carrier
under or by virtue of any of the provisions of this Act, such common
carrier may set off therein any sum it has contributed or paid to
any insurance, relief benefit, or indemnity that may have been
paid to the injured employee or the person entitled thereto on account of the injury or death for which said action was brought."
Referring to this provision, and interpreting a contract similar to
the one here involved, at least one federal court has held that "The

contract to waive the venue provisions is of no effect . . .because

there was no consideration for it." Akerly v. New York C. R. Co.,
168 F. 2d 812,815 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1948).

S. F. R. Co., 65 F. Supp. 630 (N. D. Ill. 1946); Herringtonv. Thompson, 61 F. Supp. 903 (W. D. Mo. 1945); Clark v. Lowden, 48 F.
Supp. 261 (D. Minn. 1942); Detwiler v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 15
F. Supp. 541 (D. Minn. 1936); Detwiler v. Lowden, 198 Minn. 185,
188, 269 N. W. 367, 369, 107 A. L. R. 1054, 1059 (1936). In conflict with the ruling before us are: Krenger v. Pennsylvania R. Co.,

Opinion of the Court.

those courts which have held that contracts limiting the
choice of venue are void as conflicting with the Liability
Act.
Section 6 of the Liability Act provides that "Under
this Act an action may be brought in a district court
of the United States, in the district of the residence of
the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose,
or in which the defendant shall be doing business at
the time of commencing such action. The jurisdiction
of the courts of the United States under this Act shall
be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States,
and no case arising under this Act and brought in any
state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to
any court of the United States." It is not disputed that
respondent is liable to suit in Cook County, Illinois, in
accordance with this provision. We hold that petitioner's
right to bring the suit in any eligible forum is a right of
sufficient substantiality to be included within the Congressional mandate of § 5 of the Liability Act: "Any contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever, the purpose
or intent of which shall be to enable any common carrier
to exempt itself from any liability created by this Act,
shall to that extent be void . . . ." The contract before
us is therefore void.
Any other result would be inconsistent with Duncan v.
Thompson, 315 U. S. 1 (1942). That opinion reviewed
the legislative history and concluded that "Congress
wanted § 5 to have the full effect that its comprehensive
phraseology implies." 315 U. S. at 6. In that case as
in this, the contract before the Court was signed after
174 F. 2d 556 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1949), petition for certiorari denied
this day, see post, p. 866; Akerly v. New York C. R. Co., 168 F.
2d 812 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1948); Fleming v. Husted, 68 F. Supp. 900
(S. D. Iowa 1946); Sherman v. Pere Marquette R. Co., 62 F. Supp.
590 (N. D. Ill. 1945); Petersen v. Ogden U. R. & D. Co., 110 Utah
573, 175 P. 2d 744 (1946); cf. Porter v. Fleming, 74 F. Supp. 378
(D. Minn. 1947).

the injury occurred. The court below, in holding that
an agreement delimiting venue should be enforced if it
was reached after the accident, disregarded Duncan.
The vigor and validity of the Duncan decision was not
impaired by Callen v. PennsylvaniaR. Co., 332 U. S. 625
(1948). We there distinguished a ful compromise enabling the parties to settle their dispute without litigation, which we held did not contravene the Act, from a
device which obstructs the right of the Liability Act plaintiff to secure the maximum recovery if he should elect
judicial trial of his cause.4 And nothing in Ex parte
Collett, 337 U. S. 55 (1949), affects the initial choice of
venue afforded Liability Act plaintiffs. We stated expressly that the section of the Judicial Code there involved, 28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a), "does not limit or otherwise modify any right granted in § 6 of the Liability Act
or elsewhere to bring suit in a particular district. An
action may still be brought in any court, state or federal,
in which it might have been brought previously." 337
U. S. at 60.
The right to select the forum granted in § 6 is a substantial right. It would thwart the express purpose of
the Federal Employers' Liability Act to sanction defeat
of that right by the device at bar.
Reversed.

Judge Hand in Krenger v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 174 F.
