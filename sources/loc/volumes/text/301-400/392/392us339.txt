Opinion of the Court.

392 U. S.

Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts held that appellant, First Agricultural National
Bank of Berkshire County, was subject to Massachusetts'
recently enacted sales and use taikes I on purchases for
its own use of tangible personal property. For reasons
to be stated we believe this decision was erroneous, and
we reverse.
As long ago as 1819, in the historic case of M'Culloch
v. Maryland,4 Wheat. 316, this Court declared unconstitutional a state tax on the bank of the United States
since, accordingto Chief Justice Marshall, this amounted
to a "tax on the operation of an instrument employed
by the government of the Union to carry its powers into
execution." 4 Wheat., at 436-437. A long line of subsequent decisions by this Court has firmly established the
proposition that the States are without power, unless
authorized by Congress, to tax federally created, or, as
they are presently called, national, banks. Owensboro
Nat. Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S.664, 668; Des Moines
Nat. Bank v. Fairweather,263 U. S.103, 106; First-Nat.
Bank v. Hartford, 273 U. S. 548, 550; Iowa-Des Moines
Nat. Bank v. Bennett, 284 U. S.239,.244. As recently
as 1966, MR. JUSTICE FORTAS, speaking for a unanimous
Court, thought this ancient principle so well established
that he used national banks as an example in holding
the American Red Cross immune from state taxation:
"In those respects in which the Red -Cross differs
from the usual government agency-e. g., in that its
employees are not employees of*the United States,
and that government officials do not direct its
everyday affairs--the Red Cross is like other institutions-e, g., national banks-whose status as taximmune instrumentalities of the United States is

beyond dispute." Department of Employment v.
United States, 385 U. S. 355, 360. (Emphasis
added.)
The decision below recognized the strong precedents
against taxation, but the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court was of the opinion that the status of national
banks has been so changed by the establishment of the
Federal Reserve System 2 that they should no longer be
considered nontaxable by the States as instrumentalities
of the United States. Essentially the reasoning of the
Supreme Judicial C6urt is that under present-day conditions and regulations there is no substantial difference
between national banks and state banks; and the implication of this is, of course, that national banks lack any
unique quality giving them the charactir of a federal
instrumentality. Because of pertinent congressional legislation in the banking field, we find it :unnecessary to
reach the constitutional question of whether today national banks should be considered nontaxable as federal
instrumentalities.
As will be seen, Congress has been far from reluctant
to pass legislation in the bafiking field. There are important committees on banking and currency in both
Houses which continually monitor banking affairs and
propose new legislation when changes are felt to! be
needed. For purposes of' this tase, the most important
piece of banking legislation is 12 U. S. 'C. § 548 8 which

originated as part of the Act of June 3, 1864, c. 106, § 41,
13 Stat. 111. This section allows state taxation of national banks in any one of four specified ways in addition
to taxes on their real estate. Before this legislation was
originally enacted in 1864, there was sharp controversy,
in the Congress over the extent to which the States
should be allowed to tax national banks. A vocal opponent to any state taxation of national banks was the
powerful Senator Sumner of Massachusetts, who said:
"If you allow the State to interfere with the proposed system [of national banks] in any way, may
they not embarrass it? Where shall they stop?
Where will you run d line?
"Now, sir, every consideration, every argument
which goes to sustain this great judgment [M'Culloch v. Maryland] may be employed against the
proposed concession to the States of the power to tax
this national institution in any particular, whether
directly or indirectly." Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 1st
Sess., 1893-1894 (1864).
On the other side, proposed amendments expressly permitting much broader state and local taxation of national
banks were introduced, debated, and rejected by the
Congress. Among these was an amendment introduced
in the House which would have made national banks
holder thereof, or (3) tax such associations on their net income,
or (4) according to or measured by their net income ....
"1. (a) The imposition by any -State of any one of the above
four forms of taxation shall be in lieu of the others ....
"3. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt the real property
of associations from taxation in any State or in any subdivision
thereof, to the same extent, according to its value, as other real
property is taxed."

subject, without exception, to all state and local general
taxes on personal as well as real property:
"And the said associations or corporations shall
severally be subject to State and municipal taxation
upon their real and personal estate, the same as
persons residing at their respective places of business
are subject to such taxation by State laws." Cong.
Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 1392 (1864).
The result of this conflict was that the legislation, when
finally passed, was a compromise which permitted state
taxation of natiohal banks in certain ways, but prohibited
all other forms of state taxation. Senator Fessenden,
Chairman of the Finance Committee, clearly defined the
compromise that was being enacted:
"If the Senator reads this bill he will perceive that
all the power of taxation upon the operations of
the bank itself, all upon the circulation, all upon the
deposits, all upon everything which can properly be
made by. a tax is reserved to the General Government;
that the States cannot touch it in any possible form;
that they are limited and controlled; the simple
right is given them to say that the property which
their own citizens have invested in'it shall contribute
to State taxation precisely as other property."
Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 1895 (1864).
It seems clear to us from the legislative history that
12 U. S. C. § 548 was intended to prescribe the only ways
in which the States can tax national banks. And this is
certainly 'not a novel interpretation, of the section, as
shown by previous decisions of this Court. As early as
1899 the Court declared:
"This section [R. S. § 5219, 12 U. S. C. § 548],
then, of the Revised Statutes is the measure of the
power of a State to tax national banks, their prop312-243 0 - 69 - 2b

erty or their franchises. By its unambiguous provisions the power is confined to a taxation of the
shares of stock in the names of the shareholders and
to an assessment of the real estate of the bank. Any
state tax therefore which is in excess of and not in
conformity to these requirements is void." Owensboro Nat. Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S. 664, 669.
A more complete explanation of § 548 and its meaning
appears in this Court's opinion in Bank of California v.
Richardson, 248 U. S. 476, where it was said:
"There is also no doubt from the
section [R. S.
§ 5219, 12 U. S. C. § 548] that. it was intended to
comprehensively control the subject with which it
dealt and thus to furnish the exclusive rule governing state taxation as to the federal agencies created
as provided in the section.
"Two provisions in apparent conflict were adopted.
First, the absolute exclusion of power in the States
to tax the banks, the national agencies created, so
as to prevent all interference with their operations,
the integrity of their assets, or the administrative
governmental control over their affairs. Second,
preservation of the taxing power of the several States
so as to prevent any impairment thereof from arising
from the existence of the national agencies created,
to the end that the financial resources engaged in
their development might not be withdrawn from the
reach of state taxation ....
"The first aim was attained by the non-recognition
of any power whatever in the States to tax the federal agencies, the banks, except as to real estate
•speciaty provided for, and, therefore, the exclusion
of all such powers. The second was reached by a
recognition of the fact that, considered from the
point of View of ultimate and beneficial interest,

Opinion of the Court.

every available asset possessed or 'enjoyed by the
banks would be owned by their stockholders and
would be, therefore., reached by taxation of the
stockholders as such ... ." 248 U. S., at 483.
Finally, so there can be no doubt, consider these words
of the Court in Des Moines Bank v. Fairweather,263
U. S. 103:
"This section [R. S. § 5219, 12 U. S. C. § 5483
shows, and the decisions under it hold, that what
Congress intended was that national banks and their
property should be free from taxation under state
authority, other than taxes on their real property
and on shares held by them in other national banks;
and that all shares in such banks should be taxable
to their owners, the stockholders, much as other
personal property is taxable...." 263 U. S., at 107.
Thus, at least since the Owensboro decision, supra,.in
1899, it has been abundantly clear that 12 U. S. C. § 548
marks the outer limit within which States can tax national banks. Now this Court is asked to change what
legislative history and prior decisions have established is
the precise meaning of an Act of Congress. This we
cannot do. For, as we pointed out above, the banking
field has traditionally been an area of particular congressional concern marked by legislation responsive to
new problems. This can be illustrated by the history
of § 548 alone. It was originally passed in 1864 because
the 1863 Currency Act 4 contained no provision for state
taxation of national banks or their shares. In 1868 a
technical amendment was made to the section. 5 Then in
1923 a substantive amendment was made which, among
other things, authorized the state taxation of national

bank income and dividends.6 Another important part of
this amendment was the declaration that "bonds, notes,
or other evidences of indebtedness" in the hands of individual citizens were not to be considered "moneyed capital . . . coming into competition with the business of
national banks." Just two years before, this Court had
ruled in Merchants'Nat. Bank of Richmond v. Richmond,
256 U. S. 635 (1921), that such bonds and notes were
moneyed capital in competition with national banks and
thus covered by § 548. Senator Pepper, who spoke for
the amendment, made clear that it was offered as a response to this Court's decision which had placed an erroneous interpretation on the section.' Then again in 1926,
§ 548 was amended to permit States to levy franchise and
excise taxes on national banks measured by the entire
income (including income from tax-exempt securities) of
the banks.' Finally, in 1950, a bill was sent to the Senate
Committee on Banking and Currency which expressly
permitted the levying of state sales and use taxes on
national banks, but Congress did not pass it.9
Because of § 548 and its legislative history, we are convinced that if a change is to be made in state taxation
of national banks, it must come from the Congress, which
has established the present limits.
With this primary question out of the way, there is
one additional issue whi'h must be resolved. The court
below held, contrary to appellant's contention, that the
Massachusetts sales tax is not imposed upon the bank
as a purchaser, but is a tax upon vendors -who sell
tangible personal property to the bank. Of course if

Opinion of the Court.

this is true, the bank cannot object if a particular vendor
decides to pass the burden of the tax on to it through
an increased price. But if this is not true, and if the
tax is on the bank as a purchaser, then, because it is a
national bank, appellant is exempt under 12 U. S. C.
§ 548. Because the question here is whether the tax
affects federal immunity, it is clear that for this limited
purpose we are not bound by the state court's characterization of the tax. See Society for Savings v. Bowers,
349 U. S. 143, 151, and the cases cited therein. And
essentially the question for us is: On whom does the incidence of the tax fall? See Kern-Limerick, Inc. v.
Scurlock, 347 U. S. 110, 121-122. Also see Carson v.
Roane-Anderson Co., 342 U. S.232.
It would appear to be indisputable that a sales tax
which by its terms must be passed on to the purchaser
imposes the legal incidence of the tax upon the purchaser.
See Federal Land Bank v. Bismarck Lumber Co., .314
U. S.95, 99. Subsection 3 of the Massachusetts sales tax
provides:
"Reimbursement for the tax hereby imposed shall
be paid by the purchaser to the vendor and each
vendor in this commonwealth shall add to the sales
price and shall collect from the purchaser the full
amount of the tax imposed by this section, or an
amount equal as nearly as possible or practicable
to the average equivalent thereof; and such tax shall
be a debt from the purchaserto the vendor, when so
added to the sales price, and shall be recoverable at
law in the same manner as other debts." Acts and
Resolves, 1966, c. 14, § 1, subsec. 3. (Emphasis
added.)
This subsection reads to us as a clear requirement that
the sales tax be passed on to the purchaser. And this
interpretation is reinforced by subsection 23"which pro-

hibits as unlawful advertising the holding out by any
vendor that he will assume or absorb the tax on any
sale that he may make. We cannot accept the reasoning of the court below that simply because there is no
sanction against a vendor who refuses to pass on the
tax (assuming this is true), this means the tax is on
tle vendor. There can be no doubt from the clear wording of the statute that the Massachusetts Legislature
intended that this sales tax be passed on to the purchaser. For our purposes, at least, that intent is controlling. And it seems clear to us that the force of
the law, especially the language in subsection 3, is such
that, regardless of sanctions, businessmen will attempt,
in their everyday commercial affairs, to conform to its
provisions as written.
For these reasons we reverse and hold that appellant
is immune from both the Massachusetts use and sales
taxes.

' The reductio ad absurdum in the text is, unlike most, somewhat
accurate. One item upon which, appellant informed its supplier, it
should not have to. pay the sales tax was a wastebasket (as well as,
e. g., "1 Box 5 x 7 Index. Cards"). The record does not reveal the
extent of appellant's liability for use taxes; appellant paid a total
of $575.66 in sales taxes for the three months of the year 1966 that
are specifically at issue here.

decide that constitutional question in order properly to
interpret 12 U. S. C. § 548, upon which the Court bases
its decision. Moreover, the refusal to decide the issue
gives further life to a largely outmoded doctrine.
Mr. Justice Brandeis rightly cautioned that "[i]n
cases involving* constitutional issues
'this Court

bring its opinions into agreement with experience and
with facts newly ascertained, so that its judicial authority
may . . . 'depend altogether on the force of the reasoning by which it is supported.' "2 I think that in light
of the present functions and role of national banks they

A. The starting point of the constitutional inquiry is,
of course, M(, ulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).
That case involved a state statute applicable to any bank
established in Maryland "without authority from the
State," i. e., the Second Bank of the United States, chartered by Congress in 1816. It prohibited the circulation'
of notes (currency) by such a bank except on payment
of a 2% stamp tax, or, alternatively, upon the payment
annually to the State of $15,000. Substantial monetary
penalties were provided for violations of the statute,
for which the State had sued cashier M'Culloch. In a
celebrated' opinion Chief Justice Marshall, a principal
architect of our fedejralism, struck down the Maryland
statute.

J., dissenting.

392 U.S.

In Osborn v. Bank of the United States,.9 Wheat. 738
(1824), M'Culloch was applied to strike down an Ohio
statute that attempted to extract an annual tax of $50,000
from each branch of a business -operating in the State
without its authority. The statutes 'found unconstitutional in both of those cases Were patently discriminatory
against the Second Bank of th6 'United States (the Ohio
statute specifically .mentioned it-), for the'taxes did not
apply to state-chartered banks. Chief Justice Marshall,
however, did not limit his opinions in the two cases to discriminatory ttxation, and they were applied by the Court
in Owensboro Nat. Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S.664
(1899), with little independent analysis to hold that
Kentucky could not collect a nondiscriminatoryranchise
tax from a hational bank. There was no discussion of
the possible differences between federal functions performed by the kind of national bank involved there,
.which existed by virtue of legislation enacted in 1863
and 1864, and the quite distinct functions performed by
the Second. Bank of the United States involved in
M'Culloch and Osborn.
Virtually all of the later cases in which national banks
have been held to be federal instrumentalities immune
from state taxation depend upon these three cases. One
could, and perhaps should, read M'Culloch and Osborn
simply for the principle that the Constitution prohibits
a State from taxing discriminatorily a federally established instrumentality. On that view, Chief Justice
Marshall's statement that "the power to tax involves
the power to destroy," M'Culloch v. Maryland, supra,
at 431, did not relate to a principle entirely necessary
to the decision. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out
in reference to what he called that "seductive clichU":
"The web of unreality spun from Marshall's famous
dictum was brushed away by one stroke of Mr.

AGRICULTURAL BANK v. TAX COMM'N.
339

MARSHALL,

351

J., dissenting.

Justice Holmes's pen: 'The power to tax is not the
power to destroy while this Court sits.' "
Absent an examination of the differences between the
bank involved in Owensboro and the Second Bank of the,
United States involved in M'Culloch and Osborn, the
Owensboro decision might be justified upon either of
the following grounds: its alternative holding that th4
statute that is now § 548 constituted congressional delineation of the permissible scope of the power of the State
to tax a national bank, or perhaps that the-particular
franchise tax was invalid as applied because it was based
upon a valuation that included the national bank's required investment in nontaxable bonds of the United
States.4 Or one might view Owensboro, in holding a
nondiscriminatory tax invalid, as simply incorrect.
Such a limited view of those boary cases would, of
course, require a re-evaluation of the validity of the
doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunities-a doctrine
which does not rest upon any specific provisions of the
3 Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 489, 490
(1939) (concurring opinion), quoting from Panhandle Oil Co. v.
Knox, 277 U. S. 218, 223 (1928) (dissenting opinion).
4 Owensboro might also be viewed simply as prohibiting a
franchise tax, i. e., as holding that a State may not condition the privilege to operate within its borders granted to the bank by Congress,
by exacting that kind of tax. (Such a tax is permissible under
12 U. S. C. § 548, as amended after Owensboro, see Tradesmens Nat.
Bank v. Tax Comm'n, 309 U. S. 560 (1940).) The taxes in M'Culloch and Osborn, apart from their discriminatory aspects, might be.
similarly viewed: the Maryland tax was directly upon the bank's
operations, and alternatively upon its privilege to operate within
the State; the Ohio tax in Osborn was also a condition upon the
bank's privilege to transact business there. While the language and
holdings of later cases go well beyond that limited view, that view
would seem preferable to me to interpreting those constitutional
decisions as flatly prohibiting all forms of state taxation, aside from
exceptions listed in M'Culloch, 4 Wheat., at 436 (see infra, at 361).

Constitution, but rather upon this Court's concepts of
federalism. See M'Culloch v. Maryland, supra, at 426;
Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 487492 (1939) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); T. Powell,
Vagaries and Varieties in Constitutional Interpretation,
c. IV (1956). I have no doubt that Congress could provide (and has provided, see in!ra, at 362) statutory immunity from state taxation for the federal instrumentalities it may establish. See, e. g., United States v. City
of Detroit,355 U. S. 466, 474 (1958); MaricopaCounty v.
Valley Nat. Bank, 318 U. S. 357, 361 (1943); Railroad
Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 37-38 (1873) (concurring
in judgment). Given that congressional power, there
is little reason for this Court to cling to the view that
the Constitution itself makes federal instrumentalities
immune from state taxation in the absence ;of authorizing legislation:. The disparate kinds of instrumentalities and forms of state taxation create' difficulties for
ad hoc resolution of the immunity issue by this Court
based only upon abstract concepts of federalism. See
generally Powell, Waning of Intergovernmental Tax
Immunities; 58 Harv. L. Rev. 633 (1945); Powell, Remnant of Intergovernmental Tax Immunities, 58 Harv. L.
Rev. 757 '(1945). As the Court has sometimes realized:
"Wise and flexible adjustment of intergovernmental
tax immunity calls foi' political and economic considerations of the greatest difficulty and delicacy.
Such complex problems are ones which Congress is
best qualified to resolve." United States v City of
Detroit, 355 U. S., at 474.
B. The Court has never indicated any great desire to
reconsider in toto the doctrine of the constitutional immunity of. federal instrumentalities from state taxation.
The Court has, however, noted the trend in itw 06,cisions
toward restricting "the scope of 'immunity [from taxes]

ernmental character," Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Texas
Co., 336 U. S. 342, 352 (1949). The wisdom of that
trend counsels, I think, a rejection of the constitutional
argument in this case.
As the Court said last Term, "there is no simple test
for ascertaining whether an institution is so clQsely related to governmental activity as to become a taximmune instrumentality," Department of Employment
v. United States, 385 U. S. 355, 3.58-359 (1966) (holding
Red Cross immune). Various formulations of the controlling test have been used to determine' whether institutions or individuals are immune: whether they "have
been so incorporated into the government structure as to
become instrumentalities of the United States and thus
enjoy governmental immunity," United States v. Boyd,
378 U. S. 39, 48 (1964); whether they "are arms of
the (overnment deemed by it essential for the performance of governmental functions," and "are integral
parts of [a government department and] . . . share in
fulfilling the duties entrusted to it," Standard Oil Co.
v. Johnson, 316 U. S. 481, 485 (1942) (Army postexchanges immune); whether. they have been so "assimilated by the Government as to become one of its constituent parts," United States v. Township of Muskegon,
355 U. S. 484, 486 (1958); and whether the institution
is regarded "virtually as an arm of the Government,"
Department of Employment v. United States, supra, at
359-360.
Under those general rubrics, the Court has looked to
various specific factors and characteristics to deterinine
the status of the specific institution: whether it is organized for private profit, and whether the Government has
retained such control over it so that "it could properly
be called a 'servant' of the United States in agency
terms," United States'v. Township of Muskegon, supra,
at 486; whether it was organized to effectuate a spe-

appointed by the Government, Department of Employment v. United States, supra; compare Railroad Co.
v. Peniston, supra; whether the Government gives it
significant financial aid, whether it is charged by law with
carrying out some of the Government's international
commitnents, and whether it performs "functions indispensable to the workings" of a governmental unit, Department of Employment v. United States, supra, at 359.
Under any of those rubrics and applying the factors
listed above-a list not intended to be exhaustive-a
national bank cannot be considered a tax-immune federal
instrumentality. It is a privately owned corporation
existing for the'private profit of its shareholders. It
performs no significant federal governmental function
that is not performed equally by state-chartered banks.
Government officials do not run its day-to-day operations
nor does the Government have any ownership interest
in a national bank.
Appellant points to two factors as leading to the conclusion that national banks are federal instrumentalities:
that they "owe their very existence to congressional legislation," and that they are subject to extensive federal
regulation. But the fact that institutions "owe their
existence to," i. e., are chartered by, the Government, has
been definitely rejected as a basis alone for determining
they should be tax immune. Railroad Co. v. Peniston,
supra; cf. Broad River Power Co. v. Query, 288 U. S.
178 (1933). Similarly, a whole host of businesses and

institutions are subject to extensive federal regulation
and that has never been thought to bring them within
the scope of the "federal instrumentalities" doctrine.
The plain fact is that one could hold that national
banks have a constitutional tax-immune status today
only by mechanically applying the three seminal cases of
M'Culloch, Osborn, and Owensboro. It is instructive,
therefore, to examine the functions performed by the
national banks involved in those cases.
The Second Bank of the United States, involved in
, M'Culloch and Osborn, would clearly be a federal instrumentality under the Court's most recent discussion of
the doctrine (Department of Eniployment, supra): the
United States owned 20% of its capital stock (the remainder being owned by private persons); the President
appointed five of its 25 directors, and the Government,
as a shareholder, participated in the election of the
others; the Secretary of the Treasury was required .to
deposit all of the public funds in the bank, unless he
could give reasons to Congress why he should not do so;
the bank was required to transmit funds for the United
States without charge; the bank issued currency which
was established as legal tender for all debts owing to the
Government; and the bank clearly acted as the fiscal
agent of the Government, handling its foreign exchange
transactions. See P. Studenski & H. Krooss, Financial
History of the United States 83-88, 103-106 (2d ed.
1963); Federal Reserve System, Banking Studies. 7-8,
18, 39-41 (1941).
Even the national bank involved in Owensboro might
warrant tax-ihmnune status were it in existence today.
It was established pursuant to the National Currency
Acts of 1863 and 1864 ' which were enacted largely to
5Act of February 25, 1863, 12 Stat. 665 ("An Act to provide
a national Currency . . ."); Act of June 3, 1864, 13 Stat. 99 ,("An

bolster the Union's financial status, shaky because of the
Civil War. Banking Studies, supra, at 43-46. Most
trportantly, from the standpoint of analyzing the federal
functions such'banks served; national banks under the
Civil War legisl.tion,4 to which national banks today trace
their history, had important and significant functions
concerning currency. They.were authorized to issue cur•rency, printed for them by the Treasury Department, and
suh currency was establish.ed as' legal tender for all
debts, owing to, or payable by, the Government. To
insurer the stability of the national currency by insuring
the tability of the issuing banks, as well as to provide
a ready market for the Government, each such national
bank was. required to secure its currency by depositing
United States bonds with the Treasury Department.
Banking Studies, supra, 14-16, 41-46; Studenski &
Krooss, supra, 154-.155.
All of this was. radically changed with the passage of
the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 251, as amended,
12 U. S. C. §221 et seq., and by subsequbnt developments
with respect, both to the Federal Reserve System and to
national banks. To capsuli " those developments greatly,
suffice it to say that the Federal Reserve banks (and
System) are now the monetary and fiscal agents of the
United States. 12 U. S. C. § 391. By 1935, the power
* of national banks to issue currency had ceased and now
*Federal Reservebanks are the only banking institutions"
that can do so. Banking Studies, supra, at 240; Federal

importance of national banks as federal functionaries was
compensated for by the enactment of legislation designed
to make 'them more competitive with state banksf e. g.,

To be sure, the Federal Reserve System could not function without national banks, which are required to be
members therein, 12 U. S. C. § 222, and in that sense they
are part and parcel of the establishment and effectuation
of the national fiscal and monetary policies. But, in my
view, that does not make them sufficiently quasi-public
to enjoy the tax-immune status of federal instrumentalities. If that alone were~enough, then it would seem that
state banks which elect to join the Federal Reserve System should also be tax-immune federal instrumentalities.,
In any event, there is little difference today between
a national bank' and its state-chartered competitor: the
ownership, control and capital source of each is private;
each exists for private profit. More importantly, neither
may issue legal tender:
"With the passing of the national bank notes, the
United States lost much of the difference between
the national banking system and the state banking
systems. Except for automatic membership in the

Today the national banks perform no significant fiscal
services to the Federal Government not performed by
their state competitors. Any federally insured bank,
state or national, may be a government depository. 12
U. S. C. § 265. The principal checking accounts of the
Government are carried today, not by national banks, but
by the Federal Reserve banks. When a new issue of government securities is offered, the Federal Reserve banks
receive the applications of purchasers. When government securities are to be redeemed or exchanged, the
transactions are handled by the Federal Reserve banks.
Those banks administer for the Treasury the tax and loan
deposit accounts of the banks in their respective districts.

of the one governmenu correspondingly curtails the

immunity is invoked by the private citizen it tends
to operate for his benefit at the expense of the taxing
government and without corresponding benefit to

immune from nondiscriminatory state taxation as federal instrumentalities.' I might also add that I am a
bit mystified that under the Court's decisions in this field
the Federal Government in practical effect must pay
a state tax in dealing with its contractors (who pass
the tax on to the Government), see, e. g., Alabama v.
King & Boozer, 314 U. S. 1 (1941), but that a national
bank, a private profit-making corporation, is constitutionally immune from state taxation.
II.
The Court holds that 12 U. S. C. § 548, ante, at 341,
n. 3, "was intended to prescribe the only ways in which the
States can tax national banks." Ante, at 343. I would
be less than candid not to acknowledge that that holding
has the virtue of being supported by substantial precedent. But that seems to me to be its only virtue.
That interpretation of § 548 has its judicial origin in the
Owensboro case. Given the constitutional premise of
Owensboro, that interpretation would be quite clearly
correct. But since I reject the constitutional premise
so far as national banks today am concerned, it seems
to me § 548 ought to be examined freshly, for the "immunity formerly said to rest on constitutional implication
[should not] . ..now be resurrected in the form of statutory implication." Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. United
States, 319 U. S.598, 604 (1943).

taxes: those on national bank shares, on dividends on
shares in the hands of stockholders, on the income of the

insure thw competitive equality of the banks with other
businesses by preventing the bank or its shareholders
from being subjected to more than one of the four enumerated types of taxes, other than real property taxes,
so as to prevent multiple taxation of the same income,
unless the States taxed the income of other businesses
in similar multiple fashion. See 12 U. S. C. § 548, subsections 1 (b), (c), and (d), supra, n. 1t. All that the
majority can point to in the legislative history of § 548 is
that the Congress was well awaie of M'Culloch v. Maryland. And that decision specifically stated the following:
"This opinion does not deprive the States of any
resources which they originally possessed. It does
not extend to a tax paid by the real property of
the bank, in common with the other real property
within the State, nor to a tax imposed on the interest which the citizens, of Maryland may hold in
this institution, in common with other property
of the same description throughout the State."
(4 Wheat., at 436.)
I view § 548 as congressional delineation, of those areas of
state taxation of national banks permitted by the M'Culloch decision itself. I would hold that the section was
"merely designed to insure that the inherent taxing
powers which were recognized in" that case-"e. g., the
power to tax the real property of the banks as well as
the privately owned shares--be exercised in a nondiscriminatory fashion." Liberty Nat. Bank v. Buscaglia, 21 N. Y. 2d 357, 370, 235 N. E. 2d 101, .108 (1967).
As this Court said in Tradesmens Nat. Bank v. Oklahoma
Tax Comm'n, 309 U. S. 560, 567 (1940), "-the various
restrictions [§ 548] . . . places on the permitted methby the State where the association is located and not elsewhere;
and such association shall make return of such shares and pay the
tax thereon as agent of such nonresident shareholders."

ods of taxation are designed to prohibit only those systems of state taxation which discriminate in practical
operation against national banking associations or their
.
shareholders as a class."
Moreover, whatever else may be said of the statute,
it most assuredly does not provide specifically that it
is the sole measure of the State's power of taxation.
One could argue that, given the state of.,constitutional
law as it then existed, Congress saw no need to say
specifically in § 548 that national banks were immune
from state taxation except as that section permitted.
Aside from the misreading of M'Culloch that such a
view entails, the constitutional immunity of federal instrumentalities was just as plain when Congress provided statutory immunity for such agencies as, e. g.,
the Federal Reserve banks, 38 Stat. 258 (1913), 12
U. S. C. § 531; Federal land banks, 39 Stat. 380 (1916),
12 U. S. C. § 931; many other federal banking institutions; " the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, 47 Stat.
9 (1932), 15 U. S. C. § 607; and the Public Housing
Administration, 50 Stat. 890 (1937), 42 U. S. C. § 1405 (e),
and a host of government-owned corporations. 2
It is not without relevance in construing § 548, it seems
to me, that the kinds of state taxes here involved did not
exist at the time the section was adopted and were not
a significant factor in the raising of state revenue until
the early 1930's, subsequent to the last amendment of
§ 548 in 1926. See generally H. R. Rep. No. 565,
89th Cong., 1st Sess., 608 (1965). I think we should
be reluctant to interpret a statute having such narrow
" E. g., federal intermediate credit banks, 12 U. S. C. § 111l;
Federal Home Loan Bank, 12 U. S. C. § 1433; federal savings and
loan associations, 12 U. S. C. § 1464 (h).
12 E. g., Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 12 U. S. C. § 1825. See
Government Corporation Control Act of 1945, 59 Stat. 597, as

scope as § 548 as encompassing such a broad prohibitory
application. It seems to me that we would do far better
to recognize that the Constitution does not prohibit nondiscriminatory state taxation of national banks, and that
§ 548 limits only the kinds of taxes specifically set forth
therein. Only in that way is Congress free to re-evaluate
the situation. That is, sQ far as construing §548 is concerned, in practical effect the issue is who shall bear the
burden of seeking congressional action. I would put the
burden where it ought to be, namely, on the private
profit-making corporation that seeks exemption from
nondiscriminatory state taxation.
Finally, a major national banking policy has been to
foster competitive equality of national~and state banks.
See, e. g., First Nat. Bank v. Walker Bank, 385 U. S. 252
(1966); Lewis v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 292 U. S. 559
(1934). We ought, if other considerations are not decisive, to promote rather than retard that strong policy.
For the reasons stated, I would affirm.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: In addition to the reasons given

I would affirm the judgment below on the basis of that
part of Justice Reardon's opinion for the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts which upheld the application
