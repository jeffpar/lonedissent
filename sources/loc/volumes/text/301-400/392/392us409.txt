v. ALFRED H. MAYER CO.

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 645.

Argued April 1-2, 1968.-Decided June 17, 1968.

Petitioners, alleging that respondents had refused to sell them a
home for the sole reason that petitioner Joseph Lee Jones is a
Negro, filed a complaint in the District Court, seeking injunctive
and other relief. Petitioners relied in part upon 42 U. S. C. § 1982,
which provides that all citizens "shall have the same right, in every
State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to
inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal
property." The District Court dismissed the complaint and the
Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that § 1982 applies only to
state action and does not reach private refusals to sell. Held:
1. Congress' enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, containing in Title VIII detailed housing provisions applicable to a
broad range of discriminatory practices and enforceable by a complete arsenal of federal authority, had no effect upon this litigation
or upon § 1982, a general statute limited to racial discrimination
in the sale and rental of property and enforceable only by private
parties acting on their own initiative. Pp. 413-417.
2. Section 1982 applies to all racial discrimination in the sale
or rental of property. Pp. 417-437.
(a) Section 1982 has previously been construed to do more
than grant Negro citizens the general legal capacity to buy and
rent property free of prohibitions that wholly disable them because
of their race. Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24. Pp. 417-419.
(b) The question whether purely private discrimination unaided by any governmental action violates § 1982 remains one of
first impression in this Court. Hurd v. Hodge, supra; Corrigan v.
Buckley, 271 U. S. 323; the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3; and
Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, distinguished. Pp. 419-420.
(c) On its face, the language of § 1982 appears to prohibit
all discrimination against Negroes in the sale or rental of property.
Pp. 420-422.
(d) The legislative history of § 1982, which was part of § 1 of
the Civil Rights Act of 1866, likewise shows that both Houses of
Congress believed that they were enacting a comprehensive statute

forbidding every form of racial discrimination affecting the basic
civil rights enumerated therein-including the right to purchase
or lease property-and thereby securing all such rights against
interference from any source whatever, whether governmental or
private. Pp. 422-436.
(e) The scope of the 1866 Act was not altered when it was
re-enacted in 1870, two years after ratification of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Pp. 436-437.
(f) That § 1982 lay partially dormant for many years does
not diminish its force today. P. 437.
3. Congress has power under the Thirteenth Amendment to do
what
42 U. S. C. § 1982 purports to do. Pp. 437-444.
(a) Because the Thirteenth Amendment "is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an
absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not
exist in any part of the United States," Civil Rights Cases, 109
U. S. 3, 20, it has never been doubted "that the power vested in
Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation," ibid.,
includes the power to enact laws "operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not." Id., at
23. See Clyatt v. United States, 197 U. S. 207. P. 438.
(b) The. Thirteenth Amendment authorized Congress to do
more than merely dissolve the legal bond by which the Negro
slave was held to his master; it gave Congress the power rationally
to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery
and the authority to translate that determination into effective
legislation. Pp. 439-440.
(c) Whatever else they may have encompassed, the badges
and incidents of slavery that the Thirteenth Amendment empowered Congress to eliminate included restraints upon "those
fundamental rights which are the essence of civjl freedom, namely,
the same right . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey
property, as is enjoyed by white citizens." Civil Rights Cases,
109 U. S. 3, 22. Insofar as Hodges v. United States, 203 U. S. 1,
suggests a contrary holding, it is overruled. Pp. 441-443.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In this case we are called upon to determine the scope
and the constitutionality of an Act of Congress, 42
U. S. C. § 1982, which provides that: "
"All citizens of the United States shall have the
same right, in every State and Territory, as is
enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal
property."
On September 2, 1965, the petitioners filed a complaint in the District Court for the Eastern District of
Missouri, alleging that the respondents had refused to
sell them a home in the Paddock Woods community of
St. Louis County for the sole, reason that petitioner
Joseph Lee Jones is a Negro. Relying in part upon
§ 1982, the petitioners sought injunctive and other relief.'
The District Court sustained the respondents' motion to
dismiss the complaint,2 and the Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that § 1982
applies only to state action and does not reach private
refusals to sell.' We granted certiorari to consider the
To vindicate their rights under 42 U. S. C. § 1982, the petitioners invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court to award
"damages or . . .equitable or other relief under any Act of Congress

providing for the protection of civil rights . . . .". 28 U. S. C.
§ 1343 (4). In such cases, federal jurisdiction does not require that
the amount in controversy exceed $10,000. Cf. Douglas v. City of

questions thus presented. For the reasons that follow,
we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We
hold that § 1982 bars all racial discrimination, private
as well as public, in the sale or rental of property, and
that the statute, thus construed, is a valid exercise of
the power of Congress to enforce the Thirteenth
Amendment.'
I.
At the outset, it is important to make clear precisely
what this case does not involve. Whatever else it may
be, 42 U. S. C. § 1982 is not a comprehensive open housing law. In sharp contrast to the Fair Housing Title
(Title VIII) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Pub. L.
90-284, 82 Stat. 81, the statute in this case deals only
with racial discrimination and does not address itself
to discrimination on grounds of religion or national
origin.' It does not deal specifically with discrimination
in the provision of services or facilities in connection
with the sale or rental of a dwelling.7 It does not prohibit advertising or other representations that indicate
discriminatory preferences.' It does not refer explicitly
to discrimination in financing arrangements I or in the
provision of brokerage services." It does not empower
4 389 U. S. 968.
5 Because we have concluded that the discrimination alleged in

the petitioners'- complaint -violated a federal statute that Congress
had the power to enact under the Thirteenth Amendment, we find
it unnecessary to decide whether that discrimination also violated
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

7 Contrast § 804 (b).
8
Contrast §§804 (c), (d), (e).
9 Contrast § 805.
10 Contrast § 806. In noting that 42 U. S. C. § 1982 differs from
the Civil Rights Act of 1968 in not dealing explicitly and exhaustively with such matters (see also nn. 7 and 9, supra), we intimate

no view upon the question whether ancillary services or facilities
of this sort might in some situations constitute "property" as that
term is employed in § 1982. Nor do we intimate any view upon
the extent to which discrimination in the provision of such services
might be barred by 42 U. S. C. § 1981, the text of which appears
in n. 78, infra.
11 Contrast the Civil Rights Act of 1968, §§ 808-811.
12 Contrast § 813 (a).
13The petitioners in this case sought an order requiring the respondents to sell them a "Hyde Park" type of home on Lot No.
7147, or on "some other lot in [the] subdivision sufficient to accommodate the home selected . . . ." They requested that the respondent be enjoined from disposing of Lot No. 7147 while litigation
was pending, and they asked for a permanent injunction against
future discrimination by the respondents "in the sale of homes in
the Paddock Woods subdivision." The fact that 42 U. S. C. § 1982
is couched in declaratory terms and provides no explicit method of
enforcement does not, of course, prevent a federal court from fashioning an effective equitable remedy. See, e. g., Texas & N. 0. R.
Co. v. Ry. Clerks, 281 U. S. 548, 568-570; Deckert v. Independence Corp., 311 U. S. 282, 288; United States v. Republic Steel
Corp., 362 U. S. 482, 491-492; J. I.Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S.
426, 432-435. Cf. Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123; Griffin v. School
Board, 377 U. S. 218.
14 Contrast the Civil Rights Act of 1968, § 812 (c).
The complaint in this case alleged that the petitioners had "suffered actual
damages in the amount of $50.00," but no facts were stated to
support or explain that allegation. Upon receiving the injunctive
relief to which they are entitled, see n. 13, supra, the petitioners
will presumably be able to purchase a home from the respondents
at the price prevpiling at the time of the wrongful refusal in 1965substantially less, the petitioners concede, than the current market
value of the property in question. Since it does not 6pear that
the petitioners will then have suffered any uncompensated injury,
we need not decide here whether, in some circumstances, a party

Thus, although § 1982 contains none of the exemptions
that Congress included in the Civil Rights Act of 1968,"
it would be a serious mistake to suppose that § 1982 in
any way diminishes the significance of the law recently
enacted by Congress. Indeed, the Senate Subcommittee
on Housing and Urban Affairs was informed in hearings
held after the Court of Appeals had rendered its decision
in -this case that § 1982 might well be "a presently valid
federal statutory ban against discrimination by private
persons in the sale or lease of real property." 16 The
Subcommittee was told, however, that even if this Court
should so construe § 1982, the existence of that statute
would not "eliminate the need for congressional action"
to spell out "responsibility on the part of the federal
government to enforce the rights it protects." 1 The
point was made that, in light of the many difficulties
aggrieved by a violation of § 1982 might properly assert an implied
right to compensatory damages. Cf. Texas & Pacific R. Co. v.
Rigsby, 241 U. S. 33, 39-40; Steele v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 323
U. S. 192, 207; Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States,
389 U. S. 191, 202, 204. See generally Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.
678, 684. See also 42 U. S. C. § 1988. In no event, on the facts
alleged in the present complaint, would the petitioners be entitled
to punitive damages. See Philadelphia, Wilmington, & Baltimore R.
Co. v. Quigley, 21 How. 202, 213-214. Cf. Barry v. Edmunds, 116
U. S.550, 562-565; Wills v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 200 F. Supp.

might be awarded in a case of this sort arising in the future under
the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

confronted by private litigants seeking to enforce such
rights on their own, "legislation is needed to establish
federal machinery for enforcement of the rights guaranteed under Section 1982 of Title 42 even if the plaintiffs
in Jones v. Alfred H,. Mayer Company should prevail
in the United States Supreme Court." 18
On April 10, 1968, Representative Kelly of New York
focused the attention of the House upon the present
case and its possible significance. She described the
background of this litigation, recited the text of § 1982,
and then added:
"When the Attorney General was asked in court
about the effect of the old law [§ 1982] as compared with the pending legislation which is being
considered on the House floor today, he said that the
scope was somewhat different, the remedies and
procedures were different, and that the new law was
still quite necessary." 19
Later the same day, the House passed the Civil Rights
Act of 1968. Its enactment had no effect upon § 1982 20
See also id., at 129, 162-163, 251. And see Hearings on S. 1026, S.. 1318, S. 1359, S. 1362, S. 1462, H. R. 2516, and

19114 Cong. Rec. H2807 (April 10, 1968). See also id:, at
H2808. The Attorney General of the United States stated during
the oral argument in this case that the Civil Rights Act then
pending in Congress "would provide open housing rights on a complicated statutory scheme, including administrative, judicial, and other
sanctions for its effectuation . . . ." "Its potential for effectiveness," he added, "is probably much greater than [§ 1982] because of
the sanctions and the remedies that it provides."
20 At oral argument, the Attorney General expressed the view that,
if Congress should enact the pending bill, § 1982 would not be
affected in any way but "would stand independently." That is, of
course, correct. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 does not mention
42 U. S. C. § 1982, and we cannot assume that Congress intended

and no effect upon this litigation,1 but it underscored
the vast differences between, on the one hand, a gencral
statute applicable only to racial discrimination in the
rental and sale of property and enforceable only by private parties acting on their own initiative, and, on the
other hand, a detailed housing law, applicable to a broad
range of discriminatory practices and enforceable by a
complete arsenal of federal authority. Having noted
these differences, we turn to a consideration of § 1982
itself.
II.
This Court last had occasion to consider the scope of
42 U. S. C. § 1982 in 1948, in Hurd v. Hadge, 334 U. S.
24. That case arose when property owners in the District of Columbia sought to enforce racially restrictive
covenants against the Negro purchasers of several homes
on their block. A federal district court enforced the.
restrictive agreements by declaring void the deeds of the
Negro purchasers. It enjoined further attempts to sell
or lease them the properties in question and directed
them to "remove themselves and all of their personal
belongings" from the premises within 60 days. The
to effect any change, either substantive or procedural, in the prior

statute. See United States v. Borden Co., 308 U. S. 188, 198-199.
See also § 815 of the 1968 Act: "Nothing in this title shall be
construed to invalidate or limit any law of . . . any . . . jurisdiction in which this title shall be effective, that grants, guarantees,
or protects the . . . rights . . . granted by this title .... "
21 On April 22, 1968, we requested the views of the parties as to
what effect, if any, the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968
had upon this litigation.

The parties and the Attorney General,

representing the United States as amicus curiae, have informed us
that the respondents' housing development will not be covered by
the 1968 Act until January 1, 1969; that, even then, the Act will
have no application to cases where, as here, the alleged discrimina-

tion occurred prior to April 11, 1968, the date on which the Act

392 U. S.

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
affirmed,22 and this Court granted certiorari 23 to decide
whether § 1982, then § 1978 of the Revised Statutes of
1874, barred enforcement of the racially restrictive agreements in that case.
The agreements in Hurd cGovored only two-thirds of
the lots of a single city block, and preventing Negroes
from buying or renting homes in that specific area would
not have rendered them ineligible to do so elsewhere in
the city. Thus, if § 1982 had been thought to do no,
more than grant Negro citizens the legal capacity to buy
and rent property free of prohibitions that wholly disabled them because of their race, judicial enforcement
of the restrictive covenants at issue would not have violated § 1982. But this Court took a broader view of
the statute. Although the covenants could have been
enforced without denying the general right of Negroes
to purchase or lease real estate, the enforcement of those
covenants would nonetheless have denied the Negro
purchasers "the same right 'as is enjoyed by white
citizens . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and
convey real and personal property.'" 334 U. S., at 34.
That result, this Court concluded, was prohibited by
became law; and that, if the Act were deemed applicable to such
cases, the petitioners' claim under it would nonetheless be barred
by the 180-day limitation period of §§ 810 (b) and 812 (a).
Nor did the passage of the 1968 Act after oral argument in
this case furnish a basis for dismissing the writ of certiorari as
improvidently granted. Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, 349 U. S. 70,
relied upon in dissent, post, at 479, was quite unlike this case,
for the statute that belatedly came to the Court's attention in Rice
reached precisely the same situations that would have been covered
by a decision in this Court sustaining the petitioner's claim on the
merits. The coverage of § 1982, however, is markedly different
from that of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

§ 1982. To suggest otherwise, the Court said, "is to
reject the plain meaning of language." Ibid.
Hurd v. Hodge, supra, squarely held, therefore, that
a Negro citizen who is denied the opportunity to purchase the home he wants "[s]olely because of [his] race
and color," 334 U. S., at 34, has suffered the kind of
injury that § 1982 was designed to prevent. Accord,
Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 79; Harmon v. Tyler,
273 U. S. 668; Richmond v. Deans, 281 U. S. 704. The
basic source of the injury in Hurd was, of course, the
action of private individuals-white citizens who had
agreed to exclude Negroes from a residential area. But
an arm of the Government-in that case, a federal
court-had assisted in the enforcement of that agreement.24 Thus Hurd v. Hodge, supra, did not present
the question whether purely private discrimination,
unaided by any action on the part of government, would
violate § 1982 if its effect were to deny a citizen the right
to rent or buy property solely because of his race or
color.
The only federal court (other than the Court of Appeals in this case) that has ever squarely confronted
that question held that a wholly private conspiracy
among white citizens to prevent a Negro from leasing
a farm violated § 1982. United States v. Morris, 125
F. 322. It is true that a dictum in Hurd said that
§ 1982 was directed only toward "governmental action,"
334 U. S., at 31, but neither Hurd nor any other case
24 Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668, invalidating a New
Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination
by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community,
or any white person to establish a home in a Negro commijnity,
"except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the
opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City
to be affected." See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12.

before or since has presented that precise issue for adjudication in this Court.2 5 Today we face that issue f~r
the first time.
III.
We begin with the language of the statute itself. In
plain and unambiguous terms, § 1982 grants to all citizens, without regard to race or color, "the same right''
to purchase and lease property "as is enjoyed by white
citizens." As the Court of Appeals in this case evidently recognized, that right can be impaired as effec2!

Two of this Court's early opinions contain dicta to the general

effect that § 1982 is limited to state action. Virginia v. Rives, 100
U. S. 313, 317-318; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 16-17. But
all that Virginia v. Rives, supra, actually held was that § 641 of the
Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act
of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not
authorize the removal of a state prosecution wliere the defendants,
without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could
only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might
go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322. See Georgia v.
Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804. And of course the Civil Rights
Cases, supra, which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act
of 1875, 18 Stat. 335, did not involve the present statute at all.
It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31,
characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323, as having "held"
that "[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute . . .
[are] directed is governmental action." 334 U. S., at 31. But no
such statement appears in the Corrigan opinion, and a careful examination of Corrigan reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the
proposition attributed to it in Hurd. In Corrigan, suits had been
brought to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia. The courts of the District had
granted relief, see 55 App. D. C. 30, 299 F. 899, and the case reached
this Court on appeal. As the opinion in"
Corrigan specifically recognized, no claim that the covenants could not validly be enforced
against the appellants had been raised in the lower courts, and no such'
claim was properly before this Court. 271 U. S., at 330-331. The
only question presented for decision was whether the restrictive
covenants themselves violated the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth
Amendments, and §§ 1977, 1978, and 1979 of the Revised Statutes

JONES v. MAYER CO.

Opinion of the Court.

tively by "those who place property on the market" 26
as by the State itself. 'For, even if the State and its
agents lend no support to those who wish to exclude
persons from their communities on racial grounds, the
fact remains that, whenever property "is placed on the
market for whites only, whites have a right denied to
Negroes." 27 So long as a Negro citizen who wants to
buy or rent a home can be turned away simply because
he is not white, he cannot be said to enjoy "the same
right . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . to . . .
purchase [and] lease . . . real and personal property."
42 U. S. C. § 1982. (Emphasis added.)
On its face, therefore, § 1982 appears to prohibit all
discrimination against Negroes in the sale or rental of
property-discrimination by private owners as well as
discrimination by public authorities. Indeed, even the
respondents seem to concede thatif § 1982 "means what
it says"-to use the words of the respondents' briefthen it must encompass every racially motivated refusal
(now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981, 1982, and 1983). Ibid. Addressing itself
to that narrow question, the Court said that none of the provisions
relied upon by the appellants prohibited private individuals from

Even if Corrigan should be regarded as an adjudication that 42

prohibit private individuals from agreeing not to sell their property

prohibits an actual refusal ta.sell to a Negro. Moreover, since the.
appellants in Corrigan hadnot even argued in this Court fhat the

reading of § 1982, the respondents argue that Congress
cannot possibly have intended any such result. Our
examination of the relevant history, however, persuades
us that Congress meant exactly what it said.
IV.
In its original form, 42 U. S. C. § 1982 was part of
§ 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.28 That section was
cast in sweeping terms:
"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That all persons born in the
United States and not subject to any foreign
power, . . .are hereby declared to be citizens of the
United States; and such citizens, of every race and
color, without regard to any previous condition of
slavery or involuntary servitude, . . . shall have the
same right, in every State and Territory in the
United States, to make and enforce contracts, to
sue, be parties, and give evidence, 'to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal
property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws
and proceedings for the security of person and
property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall
be subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties,
and to-none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.""
28

Act of April 9, 1866, c. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27, re-enacted by § 18
of the Enforcement Act of 1870, Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114, § 18,
16 Stat. 140, 144, and codified in §§ 1977 and 1978 of the Revised
Statutes of 1874, now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981 and 1982. For the text
of § 1981, see n.78, infra.

The crucial language for our purposes was that which
guaranteed all citizens "the same right, in every State
and Territory in the United States, . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal
property

. .

.

as is enjoyed by white citizens .....

To the Congress that passed the Civil Rights Act of
1866, it was clear that the right to do these things might
be infringed not only by "State or local law" but also
by "custom, or prejudice." 80 Thus, when Congress provided in § 1 of the Civil Rights Act that the right to
purchase and lease property was to be enjoyed equally
throughout the United States by Negro and white citiwithstanding." The phrase was obviously inserted to qualify the reference to "like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other,"
thus emphasizing the supremacy of the 1866 statute over inconsistent
state or local laws, if any. It was deleted, presumably as surplusage,
in § 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874.
30 Several weeks before the House began its debate on the Civil
Rights Act of 1866, Congress had passed a bill (S. 60) to enlarge
the powers of the Freedmen's Bureau (created by Act of March 3,
1865, c. 90, 13 Stat. 507) by extending military jurisdiction over
certain areas in the South where, "in consequence of any State or
local law, .
custom, or prejudice, any of the civil-rights .. .belonging to white persons (including the right... to inherit, purchase,
lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property . . .)are
refused or denied to negroes . ..on account of race, color, or any
previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude . . . ." See
Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 129, 209. (Emphasis added.)
Both Houses had passed S. 60 (see id., at 421, 688, 748, 775),
and although the Senate had failed to override the President's veto
(see id., at 915-916, 943) the bill was nonetheless significant for its
recognition that the "right to purchase" was a right that could be
"refused or denied" by "custom or prejudice" as well as by "State
or local law." See also the text accompanying nn. 49 and 59, infra.
Of course an "abrogation of civil rights made 'in consequence of ...
custom, or prejudice' might as easily be perpetrated by private
individuals or by unofficial community activity as by state officers
armed with statute or ordinance." J. tenBroek, Equal Under Law

zens alike, it plainly meant to secure that right against
interference from any source whatever, whether governmental or private."'
Indeed, if § 1 had been intended to grant nothing more
than an immunity from governmental interference, then
much of § 2 would have made no sense at all.32 For that
section, which provided fines and prison terms for certain
31 When Congressman Bingham of Ohio spoke of the Civil Rights
Act, he charged that it would duplicate the substantive scope of the
bill recently vetoed by the President, see n. 30, supra, and that it
would extend the territorial reach of that bill throughout the United
States. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1292. Although the Civil
Rights Act, as the dissent notes, post, at 457, 462, made no explicit
reference to "prejudice," cf. n. 30, supra, the fact remains that nobody who rose to answer the Congressman disputed his basic premise
that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 would prohibit every form of racial
discrimination encompassed by the earlier bill the President had
vetoed. Even Senator Trumbull of Illinois, author of the vetoed
measure as well as of the Civil Rights Act, had previously remarked
that the latter was designed to "extend to all parts of the country,"
on a permanent basis, the "equal civil rights" which were to have
been secured in rebel territory by the former, id., at 322, to the end

that "all the badges of servitude . . . be abolished."

Id., at 323.

(Emphasis added.)
32 Section 2 provided:
"That any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance,
regulation, or custom, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any
inhabitant of any State or Territory to the deprivation of any right
secured or protected by this act, or to different punishment, pains,
or penalties on account of such person having at any time been held
in a condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a
punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, or by reason of his color or race, than is prescribed for the
punishment of white persons, shall b& deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction, shall be punished by fine not exceeding
one thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or
both, in the discretion of the court." (Emphasis added.)

individuals who deprived others of. rights "secured or
protected" by § 1, was carefully drafted to exempt private violations of § 1 from the criminal sanctions it
imposed.3" There would, of course, have been no private
violations to exempt if the only "right" granted by § 1
31 When Congressman Loan of Missouri asked the Chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Wilon of Iowa, "why' [does] the
committee limit the provisions of the second section to those who act
under the color of law," Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1120, he
was obviously inquiring why the second section did not also punish
those who violated the first without acting "under the color of law."
Specifically, he asked:
"Why not let them [the penalties. of § 2] apply to the whole
community where the acts are committed?" Ibid.
Mr. Wilson's reply was particularly revealing. If, as floor manager
of the bill, he had viewed acts not under color of law as not violative
of § 1 at all, that would of course have been the short answer to
the Congressman's query. Instead, Mr. Wilson found it necessary
to explain that the Judiciary Committee did not want to make "a
general criminal code for the States." Ibid. Hence only those who
discriminated "in reference to civil rights . . . under the color of...
local laws" were made subject to the criminal sanctions of § 2. Ibid.
Congress might have thought it appropriate to confine criminal
punishment to state officials, oath-bound to support the supreme federal law, while. allowing only civil remedies-or perhaps only preventive relief-against private violators. Or Congress might have
thought that States which did not authorize abridgment of the rights
declared in § 1 would themselves punish all who interfered with those
rights without official authority. See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong.,
1st Sess., 1758, 1785. Cf. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 19, 24-25.
Whatever the reason, it was repeatedly stressed that the only violations "reached and punished" by the bill, see Cong. Globe, 39th
Cong., 1st Sess., at 1294 (emphasis added), would be those "done
under color of State authority." Ibid. It is observed in dissent,
post, at 458, that Senator Trumbull told Senator Cowan that § 2 was
directed not at "State officers especially, but [at] everybody who
violates the law." That remark, however, was nothing more than
a reply to Senator Cowan's charge that § 2 was "exceedingly objectionable" in singling out state judicial officers for punishment for the
first time "in the history of civilized legislation." Id., at 500.

had been a right to be free of discrimination by public
officials. Hence the structure of the 1866 Act, as well
as its language, points to the conclusion urged by the
petitioners in this case-that § 1 was meant to prohibit
all racially motivated deprivations of the rights enumerated in the statute, although only those deprivations
perpetrated "under color of law" were to be criminally
punishable under § 2.
In attempting to demonstrate the contrary, the respondents rely heavily upon the fact that the Congress
which approved the 1866 statute wished to eradicate
the recently enacted Black Codes-laws which had saddled Negroes with "onerous disabilities and burdens, and
curtailed their rights . . . to such an extent that their
freedom was of little value . . . ." Slaughter-House
Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 70.1' The respondents suggest that
the only evil Congress sought to eliminate was that of
racially discriminatory laws in the former Confederate
States. But the Civil Rights Act was drafted to apply
throughout the country,"5 and its language was far

8 See n. 31, supra. It is true, as the dissent emphasizes, post,
at 460, that Senator Trumbull remarked at one point that the Act
"could have no operation in Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, or
most of the States of the Union," whose laws did not themselves
discriminate against Negroes. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.,
1761. But the Senator was simply observing that the Act would
"in.no manner [interfere] with the . . . regulations of any State
which protects all alike in their rights of person and property."

broader than would have been necessary to strike down
discriminatory statutes.
That broad language, we are asked to believe, was a
mere slip of the legislative pen. We disagree. For the
same Congress that wanted to do away with the Black
Codes also had before it an imposing body of evidence
pointing to the mistreatment of Negroes by private individuals and unofficial groups, mistreatment unrelated to
any hostile state legislation. "Accounts in newspapers
North and South, Freedmen's Bureau and other official
documents, private reports and correspondence were
all adduced" to show that "private outrage and atrocity"
were "daily inflicted on freedmen ....

injustices against Negroes-references to white employers
who refused to pay their Negro workers,"' white planters
who agreed among themselves not to hire freed slaves

no effect upon nondiscriminatory legislation. Senator Trumbull
obviously could not have meant that the law would apply to racial
discrimination in some States but not in others, for the bill on its
face applied upon its enactment "in every State and Territory in the
United States," and no one disagreed when Congressman Bingham
complained that; unlike Congress' recently vetoed attempt to expand
the Freedmen's Bureau, see n. 30, supra, the Civil Rights Act would
operate "in every State of the Union." Id., at 1292. Nor, contrary
to a suggestion made in dissent, post, at 460, was the Congressman
speaking only of the Act's potential operation in any State that
might enact a racially discriminatory law in the future. The Civil

citizens who assaulted Negroes " or who combined to
drive them out of their communities. °
Indeed, one of the most comprehensive studies then
before Congress stressed the prevalence of private hostility toward Negroes and the need to protect them from
the resulting persecution and discrimination. 4' The report noted the existence of laws virtually prohibiting
Negroes from owning or renting property in certain
towns, 4 but described such laws as "mere isolated cases,"
representing "the local outcroppings of a spirit. . . found
to prevail everywhere" "-a spirit expressed, for example,
3 Id., at 339-340, 1160, 1835. It is true, as the dissent notes,
post, at 462, that some of the references to private assaults occurred
during debate on the Freedmen's Bureau bill, n. 30, supra, but the
congressional discussion proceeded upon the understanding that all
discriminatory conduct reached by the Freedmen's Bureau bill would
be reached as well by the Civil Rights Act. See, e. g., n. 31, supra.
40 Id., at 1835. It is clear that these instances of private mistreatment, see also text accompanying n. 41, infra, were understood
as illustrative of the evils that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 would
correct: Congressman Eldridge of Wisconsin, for example, said this:
"Gentlemen refer us to individual cases of wrong perpetrated upon
the freedmen of the South as an argument why we should extend
the Federal authority into the different States to control the action
of the citizens thereof. But, I ask, has not the South submitted to
the altered state of things there, to the late amendment of the
Constitution, to the loss of their slave property, with a cheerfulness
and grace that we did not expect? . . . I deprecate all these
measures because of the implication they carry upon their face that
the people who have heretofore owned slaves intend to do them
wrong. I do not believe it. . . . The cases of ill-treatment are
exceptional cases.". Id., at 1156.
So it was that "opponents denied or minimized the facts asserted"
but "did not contend that the [Civil Rights Act] would not reach
such facts if they did exist." J. tenBroek, supra, n. 30, at 181.

by lawless acts of brutality directed against Negroes who
traveled to areas where they were not wanted.4" The
report concluded that, even if anti-Negro legislation were
"repealed in all the States lately in rebellion," equal
treatment for the Negro would not yet be secured. 5
In this setting, it would have been strange indeed if
Congress had viewed its task as encompassing merely
the nullification of racist laws in the former rebel States.
That the Congress which assembled in the Nation's
capital in December 1865 in fact had a broader vision
of the task before it became clear early in the session,
when three proposals to invalidate discriminatory state
statutes were rejected as "too narrowly conceived." 46
From the outset it seemed clear, at least to Senator
Trumbull of Illinois, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that stronger legislation might prove necessary.
After Senator Wilson of Massachusetts had introduced
his bill to strike down all racially discriminatory laws in
the South,' Senator Trumbull said this:
"I reported from the Judiciary Committee the
second section of the [Thirteenth Amendment] for
the very purpose of conferring upon Congress authority to see that the first section was carried out

in good faith . . . and I hold that under that second
section Congress will have the authority, when the
constitutional amendment is adopted, not only to
pass the bill of the Senator from Massachusetts,
but a bill that will be much more efficient to protect
the freedman in his rights. . . . And, sir, when
the constitutional amendment shall have been
adopted, if the information from the South be that
the men whose liberties are secured by it are deprived of the privilege to go and come when they
please, to buy and sell when they please, to make
contracts and enforce contracts, I give notice that,
if no one else does, I shall introduce a bill and urge
its passage through Congress that will secure to
those men every one of these rights: they would
not be freemen without them. It is idle to say that
a man is free who cannot go and come at pleasure,
who cannot buy and sell, who cannot enforce his
rights. . . . [So] when the constitutional amendment is adopted I trust we may pass a bill, if the
action of the people in the southern States should
make it necessary, that will be much more sweeping
and efficient than the bill under consideration."48
48 Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 43.
(Emphasis added.) The
dissent seeks to neutralize the impact of this quotation by noting

that, prior to making the above statement, the Senator had argued
that the second clause of the Thirteenth Amendment was inserted
"for the purpose, and none other, of preventing State Legislatures
from enslaving, under any pretense, those whom the first clause declared should be free." See post, at 455, 462-463. In fact, Senator
Trumbull was simply replying at that point to the contention of
Senator Saulsbury of Delaware that the second clause of the Thirteenth Amendment was never intended to authorize federal legislation
interfering with subjects other than slavery itself. See id., at 42.
Senator Trumbull responded that the clause was intended to authorize precisely such legislation. That, "and none other," he said for
emphasis, was its avowed purpose. But Senator Trumbull did not
imply that the force of § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment would be

Opinion of the Court.

Five days later, on December 18, 1865, the Secretary
of State officially certified the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. The next day Senator Trumbull
again rose to speak. He had decided, he said, that the
"more sweeping and efficient" bill of which he had
spoken previously ought to be enacted
"at an early day for the purpose of quieting apprehensions in the minds of many friends of freedom
lest by local legislation or a prevailing public sentiment in some of the States persons of the African
race should continue to be oppressed and in fact
deprived of their freedom ....""
On January 5, 1866, Senator Trumbull introduced the
bill he had in mind-the bill which later became the
Civil Rights Act of 1866.50 He described its objectives
in terms that belie any attempt to read it narrowly:
"Mr. President, I regard the bill to which the
attention of the Senate is now called as the most
important measure that has been under its consideration since the adoption of the constitutional
amendment abolishing slavery. That amendment
declared that all persons in the United States should
be free. This measure is intended to give effect to
that declaration and secure to all persons within
the United States practical freedom. There is very
little importance in the general declaration of
abstract truths and principles unless they can be
carried into effect, unless the persons who are to be
spent once Congress had nullified discriminatory state laws. On the
contrary, he emphasized the fact that it was "for Congress to determine, and nobody else," what sort of legislation might be "appropriate" to make the Thirteenth Amendment effective. Id., at 43. Cf.

themselves of their benefits." "I
Of course, Senator Trumbull's bill"would, as he pointed
out, "destroy all [the] discriminations" embodied in
the Black Codes,52 but it would do more: It would
affirmatively secure for all men, whatever their race or
color, what the Senator called the "great fundamental
rights":
"the right to acquire property, the right to go and
come at pleasure, the right to enforce rights in the
courts, to make contracts, and to inherit and dispose
of property." 53
As to those basic civil rights, the Senator said, the bill
would "break down all discrimination between black
men and white men." 5'

States would fully "perform their constitutional obligations."

remarks of Senator Lane of Indiana, id., at 602-603; and the remarks of Congressman Wilson of Iowa, id., at 1117-1118. But it
would be a serious mistake to infer from such statements any notion
(see the dissenting opinion, post, at 460) that, so long as the States
refrained from actively discriminating against Negroes, their "obligations" in this area, as Senator Trumbull and others understood
them, would have been fulfilled. For the Senator's concern, it will
be recalled (see text accompanying n. 49, supra), was that Negroes
might be "oppressed and in fact deprived of their freedom" not
only by hostile laws but also by "prevailing public sentiment," and
he viewed .his bill as necessary "unless by local legislation they [the
States] provide for the real fi-eedom of their former slaves." Id.,
at 77. See also id., at 43. And see the remarks of Congressman
Lawrence of Ohio:

citizens of these absolute, inherent, and inalienable rights: either by

Opinion of the Court.

That the bill would indeed have so sweeping an effect
was seen as its great virtue by its friends 11 and as its great
danger by its enemies 11 but was disputed by none. Opponents of the bill charged that it would not only regulate
state laws but would directly "determine the persons who
[would] enjoy . . . property within the States," 57 threatening the ability of white citizens "to determine who
[would] be members of [their] communit[ies] ....
The bill's advocates did not deny the accuracy of those
characterizations. Instead, they defended the propriety
of em-pMying federal authority to deal with "the white
man . . . [who] would invoke the power of local prejudice" against the Negro. 9 Thus, when the Senate passed
the Civil Rights Act on February 2, 1866,O it did so fully
aware of the breadth of the measure it had approved.
In the House, as in the Senate, much was said about
eliminating the infamous Black Codes." But, like the
Senate, the House was moved by a larger objectivethat of giving real content to the freedom guaranteed by
the Thirteenth Amendment. Representative Thayer of
Pennsylvania put it this way:

Representative Cook of Illinois thought that, without
appropriate federal legislation, any "combination of men
in [a] neighborhood [could] prevent [a Negro] from
having any chance" to enjoy those benefits. 6
To Congressman Cook and others like him, it seemed evident
that, with respect to basic civil rights-including the
"right to . ..purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey...
property," Congress must provide that "there . . . be
no discrimination" on grounds of race or color."

Opinion of the Court.

It thus appears that, when the House passed the Civil
Rights Act on March 13, 1866,6" it did so on the same
assumption that had prevailed in the Senate: It too
believed that it was approving a comprehensive statute
forbidding all racial discrimination affecting the basic
civil rights enumerated in the Act.
President Andrew Johnson vetoed the Act on March
27,66 and in the brief congressional debate that followed,
his supporters characterized its reach in all-embracing
terms. One stressed the fact that § 1 would confer
"the right .

.

. to purchase

.

.

. real estate .

.

. without

any qualification and without any restriction whatever ...
." 67 Another predicted, as a corollary, that the
Act would preclude preferential treatment for white persons in the rental of hotel rooms and in the sale of church
pews."
Those observations elicited no reply. On
April 6 the Senate, and on April 9 the House, overrode the President's veto by the requisite majorities, 69
and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 became law."'

OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Opinion of the Court.

392 U. S.

In light of the concerns that led Congress to adopt
it and the contents of the debates that preceded its
passage, it is clear that the Act was designed to do just
what its terms suggest: to prohibit all racial discrimination, whether or not under color of law, with respect to
the rights enumerated therein-including the right to
purchase or lease property.
Nor was the scope of the 1866 Act altered when it was
re-enacted in 1870, some two years after the ratification
of the Fourteenth Amendment.7 It is quite true that
some members of Congress supported the Fourteenth
Amendment "in order to eliminate doubt as to the constitutional validity of the Civil Rights Act as applied
to the States." Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 32-33.
But it certainly does not follow that the adoption of
the Fourteenth Amendment or the subsequent readoption of the Civil Rights Act were meant somehow to
limit its application to state action. The legislative
history furnishes not the slightest factual basis for any
such speculation, and the conditions prevailing in 1870
make it highly implausible. For by that time most, if
not all, of the former Confederate States, then under the
control of "reconstructed" legislatures, had formally
repudiated racial discrimination, and the focus of congressional concern had clearly shifted from hostile statutes to the activities of groups like the Ku Klux Klan,
operating wholly outside the law. 2
-Section 18 of the Enforcement .pt of 1870, Act of May 31,
1870, c. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 144:
"And be it further enacted, That the act to protect all persons in
the United States in their civil rights, and furnish the means of their
vindication, passed April nine, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, is
hereby re-enacted ...
"

American Law 116 (1910).

Opinion of the Court.

Against this background, it would obviously make no
sense to assume, without any historical support whatever,
that Congress made a silent decision in 1870 to exempt
private discrimination from the operation of the Civil
Rights Act of 1866.11 "The cardinal rule is that repeals
by implication are not favored." Posadas v. National
City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503. All Congress said in 1870
was that the 1866 law "is hereby re-enacted." That is
all Congress meant.
As we said in a somewhat different setting two Terms
ago, "We think that history leaves no doubt that, if we
are to give [the law] the scope that its origins dictate,
we must accord it a sweep as broad as its language."
United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 801. "We are
not at liberty to seek ingenious analytical instruments,"
ibid., to carve from § 1982 an exception for private conduct--even though its application to such conduct in
the present context is without established precedent.
And, as the Attorney General of the United States said
at the oral argumdnt of this case, "The fact that the
statute lay partially dormant for many years cannot
be held to diminish its force today."
V.
The remaining question is whether Congress has
power under the Constitution to do what § 1982 purports
to do: to prohibit all racial discrimination, private and
public, in the sale and rental of property. Our starting
point is the Thirteenth Amendment, for it was pursuant
73 The Court of Appeals in this case seems to have derived such
an assumption from language in Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313,
317-318, and Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31. See 379 F. 2d 33,
39-40, 43. Both of those opinions simply asserted that, at least
after its re-enactment in 1870, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was directed only at governmental action. Neither opinion explained why
that was thought to be-so, and in each case the statement was merely
dictum. See n. 25, supra.

to that constitutional provision that Congress originally
enacted what is now § 1982. The Amendment consists
of two parts. Section 1 states:
"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except
as a punishment for crime whereof the party
shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within
the United States, or any place subject to their
jurisdiction."
Section 2 provides:
"Congress shall have power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation."
As its text reveals, the Thirteenth Amendment "is not
a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery
or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of
the United States." Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 20.
It has never been doubted, therefore, "that the power
vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate
legislation," ibid., includes the power to enact laws
"direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not."
Id., at 23."
Thus, the fact that § 1982 operates upon the unofficial
acts of private individuals, whether or not sanctioned
by state law, presents no constitutional problem. If
Congress has power under the Thirteenth Amendment
to eradicate conditions that prevent Negroes from buying
and renting property because of their race or color, then
no federal statute calculated to achieve .that objective
40So

it was, for example, that this Court unanimously upheld

the power of Congress under the Thirteenth Amendment to make
it a crime for one individual to compel another to work in order to
discharge a debt. Clyatt v. United States, 197 U. S. 207.

can be thought to exceed the constitutional power of
Congress simply because it reaches beyond state action
to regulate the conduct of private individuals. The
constitutional question in this case, therefore, comes to
this: Does the authority of Congress to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment "by appropriate legislation" include
the power to eliminate all racial barriers to the acquisition
of real and personal property? We think the answer to
that question is plainly yes.
"By its own unaided force and effect," the Thirteenth
Amendment "abolished slavery, and established universal
freedom." Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 20. Whether
or not the Amendment itself did any more than thata question not involved in this case-it is at least clear
that the Enabling Clause of that Amendment empowered Congress to do much more. For that clause clothed
"Congress with power to pass all laws necessary and
proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery
in the United States." Ibid. (Emphasis added.)
Those who opposed passage of the Civil Rights Act of
1866 argued in effect -that the Thirteenth Amendment
merely authorized Congress to dissolve the legal bond by
which the Negro slave was. held to his master." Yet
many had earlier opposed the Thirteenth Amendment on the very ground that it would give Congress virtually unlimited power to enact laws for the protection of
Negroes in every State." And the majority leaders in
Congress-who were, after all, the authors of the Thirteenth Amendment-had no doubt that its Enabling
Clause contemplated the sort of positive legislation that

Swas embodied in the 1.866 Civil Rights Act. Their chief
spokesman, Senator Truinbull of Illinois, the Chairman
of the Judiciary Committee, had brought the Thirteenth
Amendment to the floor of the Senate in 1864. In
defending the constitutionality of the 1866 Act, he argued
that, if the narrower construction of the Enabling Clause
were correct, then
"the trumpet of freedom that we have been blowing
throughout the land has given an 'uncertain sound,'
and the promised freedom is a delusion. Such was
not the intention of Congress, which proposed the
constitutional amendment, nor is such the fair meaning of the amendment itself. . . . I have no doubt
that under this provision . . . we may destroy all

these discriminations in civil rights against the black
man; and if we cannot, our constitutional amendment amounts to nothing. It was for that purpose
that the second clause of that amendment was
adopted, which says that Congress shall have authority, by appropriate legislation, to carry into effect
the article prohibiting slavery. Who is to decide
what that appropriate legislation is to be? The
Congress of the United States; and it is for Congress
to adopt such appropriate legislation as it may think
proper, so that it be a means to accomplish the
end."
Surely Senator Trumbull was right. Surely Congress
has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents
of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation. Nor can we say that
the determination Congress has made is an irrational

one. For this Court recognized long ago that, whatever
else they may have encompassed, the badges and incidents of slavery-its "burdens and disabilitles"-included
restraints upon "those fundamental rights which are the
essence of civil freedom, namely, the same right . . . to
inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is
effjoyed by white citizens." Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S.
3, 22.8 Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil
78

The Court did conclude in the Civil Rights Cases that "the act

of . . . the owner of the inn, the public conveyance or place of
amusement, refusing . . . accommodation" cannot be "justly regarded as imposing any badge of slavery or servitude upon the
applicant." 109 U. S., at 24. "It would be running the slavery
argument into the ground," the Court thought, "to make it apply
to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make
as to the guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take
into his coach or cab or car, or admit to his concert or theatre,
or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business. Id., at
24-25. Mr. Justice Harlan dissented, expressing the view that
"such discrimination practised by corporations and individuals in
the exercise of their public or quasi-public functions is a badge of
servitude the imposition of which Congress may prevent under its
power, by appropriate legislation, to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment.". Id., at 43.
Whatever the present validity of the position taken by the majority on that issue-a question rendered largely academic by Title II of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243 (see Heart of Atlanta
Motel v. United States,-379.U. S. 241; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379
U. S. 294)-we note that the entire Court agreed upon at least one
proposition: The Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress not
only to outlaw all forms of slavery andinvoluntary servitude but also
to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of a society half slave and
half free, by securing to al.citizens, of every race and color, "the same
right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence,
and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed
by white citizens." 109 U. S., at 22. Cf. id., at 35 (dissenting

War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes
from white communities became a substitute for the
Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men
sawmill. The terrorizers were convicted under 18 U. S. C. § 241
(then Revised Statutes § 5508) of conspiring to prevent the Negroes
from exercising the right to contract for employment, a right secured
by 42 U. S. C. § 1981 (then Revised Statutes § 1977, derived from
§ 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, see n. 28, supra). Section 1981
provides, in terms that closely parallel those of § 1982 (then Revised
Statutes § 1978), that all persons in the United States "shall have the
same right . . . to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties,
give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by
white .citizens . . . ." (Emphasis added.)
This Court reversed the conviction. The majority recognized that
"one of the disabilities of slavery, one of the indicia of its existence,
was a lack of power to make or perform contracts." 203 U. S.,
at 17. And there was no doubt that the defendants had deprived
their Negro victims, on racial grounds, of the opportunity to dispose
of their labor by contract. Yet the majority said that "no mere
personal assault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce the
individual to a condition of slavery," id., at 18, and asserted that only
conduct which actually enslaves someone can be subjected to punishment under legislation enacted to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment.

interpretation the majority placed upon the Thirteenth Amendment

hostile to the freedom estab-

lished by the supreme law of the land." 203 U. S., at 37. That interpretation' went far, they thought, "towards neutralizing many
declarations made as to the object of the recent Amendments of the
Constitution, a common purpose of which, this court has said, was
to secure to a people theretofore in servitude, the free enjoyment,
without discrimination merely on account of their race, of the essential rights that appertain to American citizenship and to freedom."

on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.
Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom-freedom to
"go and come at pleasure" 11 and to "buy and sell when
they please" 8 --would be left with "a mere paper guarantee" 81if Congress were powerless to assure that a
dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same
thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man.

At the

very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to
secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the
freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right
to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress
cannot say that being a free man means at least this
much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise
the Nation cannot keep.
Representative Wilson of Iowa was the floor manager
in the House for the Civil Rights Act of 1866. In urging
that Congress- had ample authority to pass the pending
bill, he recalled the celebrated words of Chief Justice
Marshall in McCulloch v. .1aryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421:
"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the
scope of the constitution, and all means which are
appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end,
which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter
and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional." 82
"The end is legitimate," the Congressman said, "because
it is defined by the Constitution itself. The end is the
cilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in
the Civil Rights Cases and incompatible with the history and purpose
of the Amendment itself. Insofar as lodges is inconsistent with our

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

Enabling a Negro to buy and sell real and personal
property is a removal of one of many badges of slavery.
"Slaves were not considered men. . . . They could
own nothing; they could make no contracts; they
could hold no property, nor traffic in property; they
could not hire out; they could not legally marry nor
constitute families; they could not control their children; they could not appeal from their master; they
could be punished at will." W. Dubois, Black Reconstruction in America 10 (1964). 1

The true curse of slavery is not what it did to the black
man, but what it has done to the white man. For the
existence of the institution produced the notion that the
white man was of superior character, intelligence, and
morality. The blacks were little more than livestockto be fed and fattened for the economic benefits they
could bestow through their labors, and to be subjected
to authority, often with cruelty, to make clear who was
master and who slave.
Some badges of slavery remain today. While the institution has been outlawed, it has remained in the minds
and hearts of many white men. Cases which have come
to this Court depict a spectacle of slavery unwilling
to die. We have seen contrivances by States designed
to thwart Negro voting, e. g., Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S.
268. Negroes have been excluded over and again from
juries solely on account of their race, e. g., Strauder v.
West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, or have been forced to sit in
segregated seats in courtrooms, Johnson v. Virginia, 373
U. S. 61. They have been made to attend segregated and
inferior schools, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347
U. S. 483, or been denied entrance to colleges or graduate
schools because of their color, e. g., Pennsylvaniav. Board
of Trusts, 353 U. S. 230; Sweatt v. Painter,339 U. S. 629.
Negroes have been prosecuted for marrying whites, e. g.,
Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1. They have been forced to
live in segregated residential districts, Buchanan v.
Warley, 245 U. S. 60, and residents of white neighborhoods have denied them entrance, e. g., Shelley v.
Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1. Negroes have been forced to use
segregated facilities in going about their daily lives, having been excluded from railway coaches, Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537; public parks, New Orleans Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege, 3587U. S. 54; restaurants,

That brief sampling of discriminatory practices, many
of which continue today, stands almost as an annotation
to what Frederick Douglass (1817-1895) wrote nearly
a century earlier:.
"Of all the races and varieties of men which have
suffered from this feeling, the colored people of this
country have endured most. They can resort to no
disguises which will enable them to escape its deadly
aim. They carry in front the evidence which marks
them for persecution. They stand at the extreme
point of difference from the Caucasian race, and
their African origin can be instantly recognized,
though they may be several removes from the typical
African race. They may remonstrate like Shylock'Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter,
as a Christian is?'-but such eloquence is unavailing.
They are Negroes-and that is enough, in the eye
of this unreasoning prejudice, to justify indignity
and violence. In nearly every department of American life they are confronted by this insidious influence. It fills the air. It meets them at the
workshop and factory, when they apply for work
It meets them at the church, at the hotel, at the

ballot-box, and worst of all, it meets them in the
jury-box. Without crime or offense against law or
gospel, the colored man is the Jean Valjean of
American society. He has escaped from the galleys,
and hence all presumptions are against him. The
workshop denies him work, and the inn denies him
shelter; the ballot-box a fair vote, and the jury-box
a fair trial. He has ceased to be the slave of an
individual, but has in some sense become the slave
of society. He may not now be bought and sold
like a beast in the market, but he is the trammeled
victim of a prejudice, well calculated to repress his
manly ambition, paralyze his energies, and make
him a dejected and spiritless man, if not a sullen
enemy to society, fit to prey upon life and property
and to make trouble generally. 11"
Today the black is protected by a host of civil rights
laws. But the forces of discrimination are still strong.
A member of his race, duly elected by the people to
a state legislature, is barred from that assembly because
of his views on the Vietnam war. Bond v. Floyd, 385
U. S. 116.
Real estate agents use artifice to avoid selling "white
property" to the blacks.3 The blacks who travel the
country, though entitled by law to the facilities for sleeping and dining that are offered all tourists, Heart of
Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, may well
learn that the "vacancy" sign does not mean what it
says, especially if the motel has a swimming pool.
On entering a half-empty restaurant they may ind

couraged discrimination in housing. Reitman v. Mulkey,
387 U. S. 369.
This recital is enough to show how prejudices, once
part and parcel of slavery, still persist. The men who
sat in Congress in 1866 were trying to remove some of
the badges or "customs" ' of slavery when they enacted
§ 1982. And, as my Brother STEWART shows, the Congress that passed the so-called Open Housing Act in 1968
did not undercut any of the grounds on which § 1982
rests.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE WHITE joins,
dissenting.
The decision in this case appears to me to be most illconsidered and ill-advised.
The petitioners argue that the respondents' racially
motivated refusal to sell them A house entitles them
to judicial relief on two separate grounds. First, they
claim that the respondents acted in violation of 42 U. S. C.
§ 1982; second, they assert that the respondents' conduct
amounted in the circumstances to "state action"' and
was therefore forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment
even in the absence of any statute. The Court, without
My Brother HARLAN'S listing of some of the "customs" prevailing in the North at the time § 1982. was first enacted shows
the extent of organized white discrimination against newly freed
blacks. As he states, "[r]esidential segregation was the prevailing pattern almost everywhere in the North." Post, at 474-475.
Certainly, then, it was "customary." To suggest, however, that there
might be room for argument in this case (post, at 475, n. 65) that

the discrimination against petitioners was not in some measure a
part and product of this longstanding and widespread customary
pattern is to pervert the problem by allowing the legal mind to
draw lines and make distinctions that have no place in the jurisprudence of a nation striving to. rejoin the human race.
1 This "state action" argument emphasizes the respondents' role
as housing developers exercising continuing authority over a suburban
housing complex with about 1,000 inhabitants.

r-tching the second ground alleged, holds that the petitioners are entitled to relief under 42 U. S. C. § 1982, and
that § 1982 is constitutional as legislation appropriate to
enforce the Thirteenth Amendment.
For reasons which follow, I believe that the Court's
construction of § 1982 as applying to purely private action is almost surely wrong, and at the least is open to
serious doubt. The issues of 'the constitutionality of
§ 1982, as construed by the Court, and of liability under
the Fourteenth Amendment alone, also present formidable difficulties. Moreover, the political processes of our
own era have, since the date of oral argument in this
case, given birth to a civil rights statute 2 embodying "fair
housing" provisions 3 which would at the end of this year
make available to others, though apparently not to the
petitioners themselves,' the type of relief which the petitioners now seek. It seems to me that this latter factor
so diminishes the public importance of this case that by
far the wisest course would be for this Court to refrain
from decision and to dismiss the writ as improvidently
granted.
I.
I shall deal first with the Court's construction of § 1982,
which lies at the heart of its opinion. That construction
is that the statute applies to purely private as well as to
state-authorized discrimination.
A.
The Court's opinion focuses upon the statute's legislative history, but it is worthy of note that the precedents
in this Court are distinctly opposed to the Court's view
of the statute.

In the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, decided less than
two decades after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act
of 1866, from which § 1982 is derived, the Court said in
dictum of the 1866 Act:
"This law is clearly corrective in its character, intended to counteract and furnish redress against
State laws and proceedings, and customs having the
force of law, which sanction the wrongful acts specified. . . . The Civil Rights Bill here referred to is
analogous in its character to what a law would have
been under the original Constitution, declaring that
the validity of contracts should not be impaired, and
that if any person bound by a contract should refuse
to comply with it, under color or pretence that it had
been rendered void or invalid by a State law, he
should be liable to an action upon it in the courts
of the United States, with the addition of a penalty
for setting up such an unjust and unconstitutional
defence." Id., at 16-17. 5
In Corriganv. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323, the question was
whether the courts of the District of Columbia might
enjoin prospective breaches of racially restrictive covenants. The Court held that it was without jurisdiction
to consider the petitioners' argument that the covenant
was void because it contravened the Fifth, Thirteenth,
and Fourteenth Amendments and their implementing
statutes. The Court reasoned, inter alia, that the statutes, including the immediate predecessor of § 1982,1 were
inapplicable because
"they, like' the Constitutional Amendment under
whose sanction they were enacted, do not in any
manner prohibit or invalidate contracts entered into

by private individuals in respect to the control and
disposition of their own property." Id., at 331.'
In Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, the issue was again
whether the courts of the District might enforce racially
restrictive covenants. At the outset of the process of reasoning by which it held that judicial enforcement of such
a covenant would violate the predecessor of § 1982, the
Court said:
"We may start with the proposition that the
statute does not invalidate private restrictive agreements so long as the purposes of those agreements
are achieved by the parties through voluntary adherence to the terms. The action toward which the
provisions of the statute under consideration is [sic]
directed is governmental action. Such was the holding of Corrigan v. Buckley .... " Id., at 31.8 B.
Like the Court, I begin analysis of § 1982 by examining its language. In its present form, the section
provides:
"All citizens of the United States shall have the
same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed
by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease,
sell, hold, and convey real and personal property."
The Court finds it "plain and unambiguous," ante, at 420,
that this language forbids purely private as well as stateauthorized discrimination. With all respect, I do not
find it so. For me, there is an inherent ambiguity in the

8 It seems to me that this passage is not dictum, as the Court
terms it, ante, at 419 and n. 25, but a holding. For if the Court hadheld the covenants in question invalid as between the parties, then
it would not have had to rely upon a finding of "state action."

term "right," as used in § 1982. The "right" referred to
may either be a right to equal status under the law, in
which case the statute operates only against state-sanctioned discrimination, or it may be an "absolute'" right
enforceable against private individuals. *To me,. the
words of the statute, taken alone, suggest the former
interpretation, not the latter.'
Further, since intervening revisions have not been
meant to alter substance, the intended meaning of § 1982
must be drawn from the words in which it was originally
enacted. Section 1982 originally was a part of § 1 of the
Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27. Sections 1 and 2
of that Act provided in relevant part:
"That all persons born in the United States
and not subject to any foreign power ... are hereby
declared to be citizens of the United States; and
such citizens, of every race 'and color . . . , shall
have the same right, in every State and Territory
oDespite the Court's view that this reading flies in the face of
the "plain and unambiguous terms" of the statute, see ante, at 420,
it is not without precedent. In the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3,
the Court said of identical language in the*predecessor statute to
§ 1982:
"[C]ivil rights, such as are guaranteed by the Constitution against
State aggression, cannot be impaired by the wrongful acts of~ individuals, unsupported by State authority . . :.

The wrongful act

of an individual, unsupported by any such authority, is simply a
private wrong, or a crime of that individual; an invasion of the
rights of the injured party, it is true .

.

. ; but if not sanctioned

in some way by the State, or not done under State authority, his
rights remain in full force, and may presumably be vindicated by
resort to the laws of the State for redress. An individual cannot
deprive a man of his right ... to hold property, to buy and sell ...

;

he may, by force or fraud, interfere with the enjoyment of the right
in a particular case; . . . but, unless protected in these wrongful

acts by some shield of State law or State authority, he cannot
destroy or injure the right .

It seems to me that this original wording indicates even
more strongly than the present language that § 1 of the
Act (as well as § 2, which is explicitly so limited) was
intended to apply only to action taken pursuant to state
or community authority, in the form of a "law, statute,
ordinance, regulation, or custom." 1o And with deference
I suggest that the language of § 2, taken alone, no more
implies that § 2 "was carefully drafted to exempt private
violations of § 1 from the criminal sanctions it imposed,"
see ante, at 425, than it does that § 2 was carefully drafted
to enforce all of the rights secured by § 1.

The Court rests its opinion chiefly upon the legislative
history of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. I shall endeavor

equally well be drawn. I shall consider the legislative

history largely in chronological sequence, dealing separately with the Senate and House debates.
The First Session of the Thirty-ninth Congress met
on December 4, 1865, some six months after the preceding Congress had sent to the States the Thirteenth
Amendment, and a few days before word was received of
that Amendment's ratification. On December 13, Senator Wilson introduced a bill which would have invalidated all laws in the former rebel States which discriminated among persons as to civil rights on the basis of
color, and which would have made it a misdemeanor to
enact or enforce such a statute.1 1 On the same day,
Senator Trumbull said with regard to Senator Wilson's
proposal:
"The bill does not go far enough, if what we have
been told to-day in regard to the treatment of freedmen in the southern States is true. . . . [U]ntil
[the Thirteenth Amendment] is adopted there may
be some question ... as to the authority of Congress
to pass such a bill as this, but after the adoption
of the constitutional amendment there can be none.
"The second clause of that amendment was inserted for some purpose, and I would like to
know ... for what purpose? - Sir, for the purpose,
and none other, of preventing State Legislatures
from enslaving, under any pretense, those whom the
first clause declared should be free." 12
Senator Trumbull then indicated that he would introduce separate bills to enlarge the powers of the recently
founded Freedmen's Bureau and to secure the freedmen
in their civil rights, both bills in his view being authorized
by the second clause of the Thirteenth Amendment.'

Since he had just stated that the purpose of that clause
was to enable Congress to nullify acts of the state legislatures, it seems inferable that this was also to be the
aim of the, promised bills.
On January 5, Senator Trumbull introduced both the
Freedmen's bill and the civil rights bill.14

The Freed-

men's bill would have strengthened greatly the existing
system by which agents of the Freedmen's Bureau exercised protective supervision over freedmen wherever they
were present in large numbers. Inter alia, the Freedmen's bill would have permitted the President, acting
through the Bureau, to extend "military protection and
jurisdiction" over all cases in which persons in the former
rebel States were
"in consequence of any State or local law, ordinance,
police or other regulation, custom, or prejudice,
[denied or refused] any of the civil rights or immunities belonging to white persons, including the
right . . .to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and
convey real and personal property, . ..on account
of race .
, 11

The next section of the Freedmen's bill provided that the
agents of the Freedmen's Bureau might try and convict of
a misdemeanor any person who deprived another of such
rights on account of race and "under color of any State
-or local law, ordinance, police, or other regulation or
cstom . . . ." Thus,., the Freedmen's bill, which was.

and which was correspondingly more sweeping in its proSee Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 129.

failed to override the President's veto. See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong.,

tection of the freedmen than the civil rights bill,"
defined both the rights secured and the denials of those
rights which were criminally punishable in terms of acts
done under the aegis of a State or locality. The only
significant distinction was that denials which occurred
"in consequence of a State or local ...prejudice" would
have entitled the victim to military protection but would
not have been criminal. In the corresponding section
of the companion and generally parallel civil rights bill,
which was to be effective throughout the Nation, the
reference to ."prejudice" was omitted from the rightsdefining section. This would seem to imply that the
more widely applicable civil rights bill was meant to
provide protection only against those discriminations
which were legitimated by a state or community sanction
sufficiently powerful to deserve the name "custom."
The form of the Freedmen's bill also undercuts the
Court's argument, ante, at 424, that if § 1 of the Civil
Rights Act were construed as extending only to "state
action," then "much of § 2 [which clearly was so limited]
would have made no sense at all." For the similar
structure of the companion Freedmen's bill, drafted by
the same hand and largely parallel in structure, would
seem to confirm that the limitation to "state action" was
deliberate.
The civil rights bill was debated intermittently in
the Senate from January 12, 1866, until its eventual
16 Section 7 of the Freedmen's bill would have permitted the
President to extend "military protection and jurisdiction" over all
cases in which the specified rights were denied, while § 3 of the
Civil Rights Act merely gave the federal courts concurrent jurisdiction over such actions. Section 8 of the Freedmen's bill would
have allowed agents of the Freedmen's Bureau to try and convict
those who violated the bill's criminal provisions, while § 3 of the

Civil Rights Act only gave the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction
over such actions.

passage over the President's veto on April 6. In the
course of the debates, Senator Trumbull, who was by
far the leading' spokesman for the bill, made a number
of statements which can only be taken to mean that the
bill was aimed at "state action" alone. For example, on
January 29, 1866, Senator Trumbull began by citing a
number of recently enacted Southern laws depriving men
of rights named in the bill. He stated that "[t]he purpose of the bill under consideration is to destroy all these
discriminations, and carry into effect the constitutional
amendment." 11 Later the same day, Senator Trumbull
quoted § 2 of the bill in full, and said:
"This is the valuable section of the bill so far as
protecting the rights of freedmen is concerned....
When it comes to be understood in all parts of the
United States that any person who shall deprive
another of any right ... in consequence of his color
or race will expose himself to fine and imprisonment,
I think such acts will soon cease." 18
These words contain no hint that the "rights" protected
by § 2 were intended to be any less broad than those
secured by § 1. Of course, § 2 plainly extended only to
"state action." That Senator Trumbull viewed §§ 1
and 2 as co-extensive appears even more clearly from his
answer the following day when asked by Senator Cowan
whether there was "not a provision [in the bill] by which
State officers are to be punished?" Senator Trumbull
replied: "Not State officers especially, but everybody who
violates the law. It is the intention to punish everybody
who violates the law." '1

On January 29, Senator Trumbull also uttered the first
of several remarkably similar and wholly unambiguous
statements which indicated that the bill was aimed only
at "state action." He said:
"[This bill] may be assailed as drawing to the Federal Government powers that properly belong to
'States'; but I apprehend, rightly considered, it is
not obnoxious to that objection. It will have no
operation in any State where the laws are equal,
where all persons have the same civil rights without
regard to color or race. It will have no operation
in the State of Kentucky when her slave code and
all her laws discriminating between persons on account of race or color shall be abolished." 20
Senator Trumbull several times reiterated this view. On
February 2, replying to Senator Davis of Kentucky, he
said:
"Why, sir, if the State of Kentucky makes no discrimination in civil rights between its citizens, this
bill has no operation whatever in the State of Kentucky. Are all the rights of the people of Kentucky
gone because they cannot discriminate and punish
one man for doing a thing that they do not punish
another for doing? The bill draws to the Federal
affect persons other than "officers" in spite of its "under color"
language, for it was there said in dictum that:
"The Civil Rights Bill .. .is analogous . ..to [a law] under the
original Constitution, declaring that the validity of contracts should
not be impaired, and that if any person bound by a contract should
refuse to comply with it, under color or pretence that it had been
rendered, void or invalid by a State law, he should be liable to an
action upon it in the courts of the United States, with the addition
of a penalty for setting up such an unjust and unconstitutional
defence." 109 U. S., at 17. (Emphasis added.)

Government no power whatever if the States will
perform their constitutional obligations." 21
On April 4, after the President's veto of the bill, Senator
Trumbull stated that "If an offense is committed against
a colored person simply because he is colored, in a State
where the law affords him the same protection as if he
were white, this act neither has nor was intended to have
anything to do with his cage, because he has adequate
remedies in the State courts

.

,,22

Later the same

day, he said:
"This bill in no manner interferes with the municipal regulations of any State which protects all
alike in their rights of person and property. It
could have no operation in Massachusetts, New
York, Illinois, or most of the States of the Union." 2
The remarks just quoted constitute the plainest possible statement that the civil rights bill was intended to
apply only to state-sanctioned conduct and not to purely
private action. The Court has attempted to negate the
force of these statements by citing other declarations by
Senator Trumbull and others that the bill would operate
everywhere in the country. See ante, at 426, n. 35. However, the obvious and natural way to reconcile these
two sets of statements is to read the ones about the bill's
nationwide application as declarations that the enactment of a racially discriminatory law in'any State would
bring the bill into effect there."4 It seems to me that

denied to Negroes rights enumerated in the Act. See G. Stephenson,

very great weight must be given these statements of
Senator Trumbull, for they were clearly made to reassure
Northern and Border State Senators about the extent of
the bill's operation in their States.
On April 4, Senator Trumbull gave two additional indications that the bill was intended to reach only statesanctioned action. The first occurred during .Senator
Trumbull's defense of the part of § 3 of the bill which
gave federal courts jurisdiction "of all causes, civil and
criminal, affecting persons who afe denied or cannot
enforce in the courts . . of the State or locality where
they may be any of the rights secured to them by the
first section of this act . . . ." Senator Trumbull said:
"If it be necessary in order to protect the freedman
in his rights that he should have authority to go into
the Federal courts in all cases where a custom prevails in a State, or where there is a statute-law of
the State discriminating against him, I think we have
the authority to confer that jurisdiction under the
second clause of the [Thirteenth Amendment]." 2
-If the bill had been intended to reach purely private
discrimination it seems very strange that Senator Trumbull did not think it necessary to defend the surely more
dubious federal jurisdiction over cases involving no state
action whatsoever. A few minutes later, Senator Trumbull reiterated that his reason for introducing the civil
rights bill was to bring about "the passage of a law by
Congress, securing equality in civil rights when denied by
State authorities to freedmen and all other inhabitants

of the United States..

rally looked for an explanation of its terms, 'indicating
that the bill would prohibit only state-sanctioned
discrimination.
The Court puts forward in support of its construction
an impressive number of quotations from and citations
to the Senate debates. However, upon more circumspect
analysis than the Court has chosen to give, virtually all
of these appear to be either irrelevant or equally consistent with a "state action" interpretation. The Court's
mention, ante, at 427, of a reference in the Senate debates
to "white employers who refused to pay their Negro
workers" surely does not militate against a "state action"
construction, since "state action" would include conduct
pursuant to "custom," and there was a very strong
"custom" of refusing to pay slaves for work done. The
Court's citation, ante, at 427-428, of Senate references to
"white citizens who assaulted Negroes'! is not in point,
for the debate cited by the Court concerned the Freedmen's bill, not the civil rights bill.2" The former by its
terms forbade discrimination pursuant to "prejudice,"
as well as "custom," and in any event neither bill provided a remedy for the victim of a racially motivated
assault.2"

The Court's quotation, ante, at 429-430, of Senator
Trumbull's December 13 reference to the then-embryonic
civil rights bill is also compatible with a "state action" interpretation, at least when it is recalled that the unedited
quotation, see supra, at 455, includes a statement that
See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 339-340.
Court also gives prominence, see ante, at 428-429, to a report by General Carl Schurz which described private as well as official
discrimination against freedmen in the South. However, it is apparent that the Senate regarded the report merely as background,
and it figured relatively little in the debates. Moreover, to the
extent that the described discrimination was the product of "custom,"
it would have been prohibited by the bill.
27

28 The

the second clause of the Thirteenth Amendment, the
authority for the proposed bill, was intended solely as
a check on state legislatures. Senator Trumbull's declaration the following day that the forthcoming bill would
be aimed at discrimination pursuant to "a prevailing
public sentiment" as well as to legislation, see ante, at
431, is also consistent with a "state action" reading of the
bill, for the bill explicitly prohibited actions done under
color of "custom" as well as of formal laws.
The three additional statements of Senator Trumbull
and the remarks of senatorial opponents of the bill,
quoted by the Court, ante, at 431-433, to show the bill's
sweeping scope, are entirely ambiguous as to whether
the speakers thought the bill prohibited only statesanctioned conduct or reached wholly private action as
well. Indeed, if the bill's opponents thought that it
would have the latter effect, it seems a little surprising
29
that they did not object more strenuously and explicitly.
The remark of Senator Lane which is quoted by the
Court, ante, at 433, to prove that he viewed the bill as
reaching "'the white man . . . [who] would invoke the
power of local prejudice' against the Negro," seems to
have been quoted out of context. The quotation is taken
from a part of Senator Lane's speech in which he defended the section of the bill permitting the President
to invoke military authority when necessary to enforce
the bill. After noting that there might be occasions
"[w]here organized resistance to the legal authority
assumes that shape that the officers cannot execute a
writ," 30 Senator Lane concluded that "if [the white
man] would invoke the power of local prejudice to override the laws of the country, this is no Government unless
the military may be called in to enforce the order of the

civil courts and obedience to the laws of the country." 81

It seems to me manifest that, taken in context, this
remark is beside the point in this-case.
The post-veto remarks of opponents of the bill, cited
by the Court, ante, at 435, also are inconclusive. Once it
is recognized that the word "right" as used in the bill is
ambiguous, then Senator Cowan's statement, ante, at 435,
that the bill would confer "the right ... to purchase...
real estate ... without any qualification" 32 must inevi-

tably share that ambiguity. The remarks of Senator
Davis, ibid., with respect to rental of hotel rooms and
sale of church pews are, when viewed in context, even
less helpful to the Court's thesis. For these comments
were made immediately following Senator Davis' plaintive acknowledgment that "this measure proscribes all
discriminations . .. that may be made . ..by any 'ordi-

nance, regulation, or custom,' as well as by 'law or statute.' " 11 Senator Davis then observed that ordinances,
regulations, and customs presently conferred upon white
persons the most comfortable accommodations in ships
and steamboats, hotels, churches, and railroad cars, and
stated that "[t]his bill ...

declares all persons who en-

force those distinctions to be criminals against the United
States . .

. .

"

Thus, Senator Davis not only tied these

obnoxious effects of the bill to its "customs" provision
but alleged that they were brought about by § 2 as well
as § 1. There is little wonder that his remarks "elicited
no reply," see ibid., from the bill's supporters.
The House debates are even fuller of statements indicating that the civil rights bill was intended to reach only
state-endorsed discrimination. Representative Wilson

was the bill's sponsor in the House. On the very first
day of House debate, March 1, Representative Wilson
said in explaining the bill:
"[1]f the States, seeing that we have citizens of
different races and colors, would but shut their eyes
to these differences and legislate, so far kat least as
regards civil rights and immunities, as though all
citizens were of one race or color, our troubles as a
nation would be well-nigh over. . . . It will be
observed that the entire structure of this bill rests
on the discrimination relative to civil rights and
immunities made by the States on 'account of race,
color, or previous condition of slavery.'" 5
A few minutes later, Representative Wilson said:
"Before our Constitution was formed, the great
fundamental rights [which are embodied in this
bill] belonged to every person who became a memThe entire
ber of our great national family. ....

other things, to secure a more perfect enjoyment of
these rights. . . I assert that we possess the
power to do those things which Governments are

by the law of a single State; . . . that this power
permeates our whole system, is a part of it, without
which the States can run riot over every fundamental right belonging to -citizens of the United
States

"

These statements surely imply that Representative Wilson believed the bill to be aimed at state-sanctioned
discrimination and not at purely private discrimination,

which of course existed unhindered "[b]efore our Constitution was formed."
Other congressmen expressed- similar views. On
March 2, Representative Thayer, one of the bill's supporters, said:
"The events of the last four years ...have changed
[the freedmen] from a condition of slavery to that
of freedom. The practical question now to be decided is whether they shall be in fact freemen. It
is whether they shall have the benefit of this great
charter of liberty given to them by the American
people.
"Sir, if it iscompetent for the new-formed Legiskhtures of the rebel States to enact laws
which declare, for example, that they shall not have
the privilege of purchasing a home for themselves

A. few minutes later, he said:

[W]hat

a state of freed6m is subject to the tyranny of laws
which deprive him of [those] rights . . .?" 8

A little later, Representative Thayer added:
"[The freedmen] are entitled to the benefit of that
guarantee of the Constitution which secures to every
citizen the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property,
and no just reason exists why they should not enjoy
the protection of that guarantee ....

on March 9:
"[W]hat, then, is proposed by the provision of the
first section? Simply to strike down by congressional enactment every State constitution whidh
makes a discrimination on account of race or color
in any of the civil rights of the citizen." 49
Representative Shellabarger, a supporter of the bill,
discussed it on the same day. He began by stating that
he had no doubt of the constitutionality of § 2 of the
bill, provided Congress might enact § 1. With respect to
§ 1, he said:
"Its whole effect is not to confer or regulate rights,
but to require that whatever of these enumerated

members thereof as such of the rights enumerated
in this act. This is the whole of it." 41
Thus, Representative Shellabarger'said in'so many words
that the bill had no impact on "mere private wrongs."
After the President's veto of the bill,, Representative
Lawrence, a supporter, stated his views. He said:
"The bill does not fi~eclare who shall or shall not
have the right to sue, give evidence, inherit, purchase, and sell property. These questions are left
to the States to determine, subject only to the limitation that there are some inherent and inalienable
rights pertaining to every citizen, which cannot be
abolished or abridged by State constitutions or
laws ..
"Now, there are two ways in which a State may
undertake to deprive citizens of these . . . rights:
either by prohibitory laws, or by a failure to protect
any one of them.
"If the people of a State should become hostile to
a large class of naturalized citizens and should enact
laws to prohibit them and no other citizens.., from
inheriting, buying, holding, or selling property, ...
that would be prohibitory legislation. If the State
should simply enact laws for native-born citizens
and provide no law under which naturalized citizens
could enjoy any one of these rights, and should deny
them all protection by civil process or penal enact42
ments, that would be a denial of justice."
41 Id., at 1293-1294.
It is quite clear that Representative Shellabarger was speaking of the bill's first section, for he did not mention
the second section until later in his speech, and then only briefly and
in terms which indicated that be thought it co-extensive with the
first ("I cannot remark on the second section further than to say
that it is the ordinary case of providing punishment for violating
a law of Congress."). See id., at 1294.

From this passage it would appear that Representative
Lawrence conceived of the word "right" in § 1 of the bill
as referring to a right to equal legal status, and that he
believed that the sole effect of the bill was to prohibit
state-imposed discrimination.
The Court quotes and, cites a number of passages from
the House debates in aid of its construction of the bill.
As in the case of the Senate debates, most of those appear
upon close examination to provide little su;port. The
first significant citation, ante, at 425, n. 33, is a dialogue
between Representative Wilson and Representative Loan,
another of the bill's supporters.
The full exchange went as follows:
"Mr. LOAN. Mr. Speaker, I . . .ask the chairman . . . why the committee limit the provisions
of the second section to those who act under the
color of law. Why not let them apply to the whole
community where the acts are committed?
"Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. That grows out of the
fact that there is discrimination in reference to civil
rights under the local laws of the States. Therefore we provide that the persons who under the color
of these local laws should do these things shall be
liable to this punishment.
"Mr. LOAN. What penalty is imposed upon
others than officers who inflict these wrongs on the
citizen?
"Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. We are not making a
general criminal code for the States.
"Mr. LOAN. Why not abrogate those laws instead of inflicting penalties upon officers who execute
writs under them?
"Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. A law without a sanction is of very little force.
"Mr. LOAN. Then why not put it in the bill
directly?

trying to do." 4

392 U. S.

That is what we are

The interpretation which the C~urt places on Representative Wilson's remarks, see ante, at 425, n. 33, is a
conceivable one. 4 However, it is equally likely that,
since both participants in the dialogue professed concern
solely with § 2 of the bill, their remarks carried no implication about the scope of § 1. Moreover, it is possible
to read the entire exchange as concerned with discrimination in communities having discriminatory laws, with
Representative Loan urging that the laws should be
abrogated directly or that all persons, not merely officers,
who discriminated pursuant to them should be criminally
punishable.
The next significant reliance upon the House debates
is the Court's mention of references in the debates "to
white employers who refused to pay their 1egro workers,
white planters who agreed among themselves not to hire
freed slaves without the permission of their former
masters, white citizens who assaulted Negroes or who
combined to drive them out of their communities."
Ante, at 427-428.11 (Footnotes omitted.) As was pointed
out in the discussion of the Senate debates, supra, at 462,
the references to white men's refusals to pay freedmen
48d., at 1120.
44

It is worthy of note, however, that if Representative Wilson

believed that § 2 of the bill would apply only to state officers, and
not to other members of the community, he apparently differed from
the bill's author. See the remarks of Senator Trumbull quoted,
supra, at 458.
45 The Court's reliance, see ante, at 425, n. 33, on the statement
of Representative Shellabarger that "the violations of citizens' rights,
which are reached and punished by this bill, are those which are...
done under color of state authority . . .

,"

Cong. Globe, 39th Cong.,

1st Sess., 1294, seems very misplaced when the statement is taken in
context. A fuller version of Representative Shellabarger's remarks

and their agreements not to hire freedmen without their

itmasters' "

consent are by no means contrary to a "state
action" view of the civil rights bill, since the bill expressly
forbade action pursuant to "custom" and both of these
practices reflected "customs" from the time of slavery.
The Court cites two different House references to assaults
on Negroes by whites. The first was by Congressman
Windom, 4 6 and close examination reveals that his only
mention of assaults was with regard to a Texas "pass
system," under which freedmen were whipped if found
abroad without passes, and a South Carolina law permitting freedmen to be whipped for insolence.
Since
these assaults were sanctioned by law, or at least by
"custom," they would be reached by the bill even under
a "state action" interpretation. The other allusion to
assaults, as well as the mention of combinations of whites
to drive freedmen from communities, occurred in a speech
by Representative Lawrence.48 These references were
shortly preceded by the remarks of Congressman Lawrence quoted, supra, at 468, and were immediately followed by his comment that "If States should undertake to
authorize such offenses, or deny to a .class of citizens all
protection against them, we may then inquire whether
the nation itself may be destroyed . .. ." " These fore
and aft remarks imply that Congressman Lawrence's
concern was that the activities referred to would receive
state sanction.
The. Court, ante, at 428, n. 40, quotes a statement
of Representative Eldridge, an opponent of the bill,
in which he mentioned references by the bill's sup
porters to "individual cases of wrong perpetrated upon

,,o However, up to

that time there had been no mention whatever in the
House debates of any purely private discrimination, 51
so one can only conclude that by "individual cases" Representative Eldridge meant "isolated cases," not "cases
of purely private discrimination."
The last significant reference 52 by the Court to the
House debates is its statement, ante, at 434, that "Representative Cook of Illinois thought that, without appropriate federal legislation, any 'combination of men in
[a] neighborhood [could] prevent [a Negro] from having any chance' to enjoy" the benefits of the Thirteenth
Amendment. This quotation seems to be taken out
of context. What Representative Cook said was:
"[Wlhen those rights which are enumerated in this
bill are denied to any class of men on account of race
or color, when they are subject to a system of
vagrant laws which sells them into slavery or involuntary servitude, which operates upon them as upon
no other part of the community, they are not secured in the rights of freedom. If a man can be
sold, the man is a slave. If he is nominally freed
.by the amendment to the Constitution, . . .he has

depend. Any combination of men in his neighborhood can prevent him from having any chance to

These remarks clearly were addressed to discriminations effectuated by law, or sanctioned by "custom." As
such, they would have been reached by the bill even
under a "state action" interpretation.
D.
The foregoing analysis of the language, structure, and
legislative history of the 1866 Civil Rights Act shows,
I believe, that the Court's thesis that the Act was meant
to extend to purely private action is open to the most
serious doubt, if indeed it does not render that thesis
wholly untenable. Another, albeit less tangible, consideration points in the same direction. Many of the
legislators who took part in the congressional debates
inevitably must have shared the individualistic ethic of
their time, which emphasized personal freedom" and
embodied a distaste for governmental interference which
was soon to culminate in the era of laissez-faire. 5 It
seems to me that most of these men would have regarded

it as a great intrusion on individual liberty for the Government to take from a man the power to refuse for
personal reasons to enter into a purely private transac-

tion involving the disposition of property, albeit those
personal reasons might reflect racial bias. It should be
remembered that racial prejudice was not uncommon in
1866, even outside the South."' Although Massachusetts had recently enacted the Nation's first law prohibiting racial discrimination in public accommodations,5

where in the North."2 There were no state "fair housing" laws in 1866, and it appears that none had ever
been proposed. 3 In this historical context, I cannot
conceive that a bill thought to prohibit purely private
discrimination not only in the sale or rental of housing
but in all property transactions would not have received
a great deal of criticism explicitly directed to this feature.,
The fact that the 1866 Act received no criticism of thia
kind ' is for me strong additional evidence that it was
not regarded as extending so far.
In sum, the most which can be said with assurance
about the intended impact of the 1866 Civil Rights Act
upon purely private discrimination is that the Act probably was envisioned by most members of Congress as
prohibiting official, community-sanctioned discrimination
in the South, engaged in pursuant to local "customs"
which in the recent time of slavery probably were embodied in laws or regulations."5 Acts done under the

83It has been noted that:

"Residential housing, despite its importance . . . , appears to be
the last of the major areas of discrimination that the states have
been willing to attack." M. Konvitz & T. Leskes, supra,at 236.
And as recently as 1953, it could be said:
"Bills have been introduced in state legislatures to forbid racial or
religious discrimination in 'multiple dwellings' (those housing three
or more families), . . . but these proposals have not been considered seriously by any legislative body." Maslow & Robison, supra,
at 408. (Footnotes omitted.)
04In contrast, the bill was repeatedly and vehemently attacked,
in the face of emphatic denials by its sponsors, on the ground that
it allegedly would invalidate two types of state laws: those denying
Negroes equal voting rights and those prohibiting intermarriage.

that the discrimination complained of in this case was the product
of such a "custom."

color ot such "customs." were, of course, said by the Court,
in the Civil Rights Caes, 109 U. S. 3, to constitute
"state action" prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.
See id., at 16, 17, 21. Adoption of a "state action" construction of the Civil Rights Act would therefore have
the additional merit of bringing its interpretation into
line with that of the Fourteenth Amendment, which this
Court has consistently held to reach only "state action."
This seems especially desirable in light of the wide agreement that a major purpose of the Fourteenth Aimendment, at least in the minds of its congressional proponents, was to assure that the rights conferred by the
then recently enacted Civil Rights Act could not be
takeji away by a subsequent Congress."
II.

The foregoing, I think, amply demonstrates that the
Court has chosen to resolve this case by according to a
loosely worded statute a meaning which is open to the
strongest challenge in light of the statute's legislative
history. In holding that the Thirteenth Amendment is
sufficient constitutional authority for § 1982 as interpreted, the Court also decides a question of great
importance. Even contemporary supporters of the aims
of the 1866 Civil Rights Act doubted that those goals
could constitutionally be achieved under the Thirteenth
Amendment,67 and this Court has twice expressed similar

doubts. See Hodges v. UnitedStates, 203 U. S. 1, 16-18;
Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323, 330. But cf. Civil
Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 22. Thus, it is plain that the
course of decision followed by the Court today entails the
resolution of important and difficult issues.
The only apparent way of deciding this case without
reaching those issues would be to hold that the petitioners are entitled to relief on the alternative ground advanced by them: that the respondents' conduct amounted
to "state action" forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. However, that route is not without formidable
obstacles of its own, for the opinion of the Court of Appeals makes it clear that this case differs substantially
from any "state action" case previously decided by this
Court. See 379 F. 2d, at 40-45.
The fact that a case- is "hard" does not, of course,
relieve a judge of his duty to decide it. Since, the
Court did vote to hear this case, I normally would consider myself obligated to decide whether the petitioners
are entitled to relief on either of the grounds on which
they rely. After mature reflection, however, I have concluded that this is one of those rare instances in which
an event which occurs after the hearing of argument'
so diminishes a case's public significance, when viewed
in light of the difficulty of the questions presented, as to
justify this Court in dismissing the writ as improvidently
granted.
The occurrence to which I refer is the recent enactment
of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Pub. L. 90-284, 82 Stat.
73. Title VIII of that Act contains comprehensive "fair.
housing" provisions, which by the terms of § 803 will
become applicable on January 1, 1969, to persons who,
like the petitioners, attempt to buy houses from developers. Under those provisions, such persons will be
entitled to injunctive relief and damages from developers

who refuse to sell to them on account of race or color,
unless the parties are able to resolve their dispute by
other means. Thus, the type of relief which the petitioners seek will be available within seven months' time
under the terms of a presumptively constitutional Act
of Congress. 8 In these circumstances, it seems obvious
that the case has lost most of its public importance, and
I believe that it would be much the wiser course for this
Court to refrain from deciding it. I think it particularly
unfortunate for the Court to persist in deciding this case
on the basis of a highly questionable interpretation of a
sweeping, century-old statute which, as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at 415, contains none of the exemptions which the Congress of our own time found it necessary to include in a statute regulating relationships so
personal in nature. In effect, this Court, by its construction of § 1982, has extended the coverage of federal
"fair housing" laws far beyond that which Congress in
its wisdom chose to provide in the Civil Rights Act of
1968. The political process now having taken hold again
in this very field, I am at a loss to understand why the
Court should have deemed it appropriate or, ip. the circumstances of this case, necessary to proceed with such
precipitate and insecure strides.
I am not dissuaded from my view by the circumstance
that the 1968 Act was enacted after oral argument in
this case, at a time when the parties and amici curiae
had invested time and money in anticipation of a decision on the merits, or by the fact that the 1968 Act
apparently will not entitle these petitioners to the relief
which they seek.69 For the certiorari jurisdiction was not

HARLAN,

J., dissenting.

conferred upon this Court "merely to give the defeated
party in the . . . Court of Appeals another hearing,"
Magnum Co. v. Coty, 262 U. S. 159, 163, or "for the
benefit of the particular litigants," Rice v. Sioux City
Cemetery, 349 U. S. 70, 74, but to decide issues, "the settlement of which is of importance to the public as distinguished from . . . the parties," Layne & Bowler Corp. v.
Western Well Works, Inc., 261 U. S. 387, 393. 1 deem
it far more important that this Court should avoid, if
possible, the decision of constitutional and unusually
difficult statutory questions than that we fulfill the
expectations of every litigant who appears before us.
One prior decision of this Court especially suggests
dismissal of the writ as the proper course in these unusual circumstances. In Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery,
supra, the issue was whether a privately owned cemetery
might defend a suit for breach of a contract to bury on
the ground that the decedent was a Winnebago Indian
and the contract restricted burial privileges to Caucasians. In considering a petition for rehearing following
an initial affirmance by an equally divided Court, there
came to the Court's attention for the first time an Iowa
statute which prohibited cemeteries from discriminating
on account of race, but which would not have benefited
the Rice petitioner because of an exception for "pending litigation." Mr. Justice Frankfurter, speaking for
a majority of the Court, held that the writ should be
dismissed. He pointed out that the case presented "evident difficulties," 349 U. S., at 77, and noted that "[h]ad
the statute been properly brought to our attention ....
the case would have assumed such an isolated significance that it would hardly have been brought here in
the first instance." Id., at 76-77. This case certainly
presents difficulties as substantial as those in Rice. Compare what has been said in this opinion with 349 U. S.,

at 72-73; see also Bell v. Maryland, 378 U. S. 226.
And if the petition for a writ of certiorari in this case
had been filed a few months after, rather than a few
months before, the passage of the 1968 Civil Rights Act,
I venture to say that the case would have been deemed
to possess such "isolated significance," in comparison
with its difficulties, that the petition would not have been
granted.
For these reasons, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari
as improvidently granted.
