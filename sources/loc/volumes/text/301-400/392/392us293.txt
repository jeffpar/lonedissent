ROBERTS v. RUSSELL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 920, Misc. Decided June 10, 1968.
Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, which overruled Deli Paoli
v. United States, 352 U. S. 232, and held that, despite instructions
to the jur. to disregard implicating statements in determining a
codefendant's guilt or innocence, admission at a joint trial of a
defendant's extrajudicial confession implicating a codefendant
violates the codefendant's Sixth Amendment right to crossexamination, is to be applied retroactively, both to state and
federal prosequtions.
Certiorari granted; judgme'nt vacated and remanded.

George F. McCanless, Attorney General of Tennessee,
and Paul E. Jenninos, Assistant Attorney General, for
respondent.
PER CURIAM.

In Britton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, decided
May 20, 1968. we overruled Delli Paoli v. United States,
352 U. S. 232, and held that, despite instructions to the
jury to disregard the implicating statements in determining the codefendant's guilt or innocence, admission at a
joint trial of a defendant's extrajudicial confession 4mplicating a codefendant violated the codefendant's right of
cross-examination secured by the Conffrontation Clause
of the Sixth Amendment. This case presents the question whether Bruton is to be applied retroactively. We
hold that it is.
. The facts parallel the facts in Bruton. The petitioner
was convicted by a jury of armed robbery at a joint trial
with one Rappe in I)avidson County, Tennessee. A
police officer testified that Rappe orally confessed to
him that petitioner and Rappe committed the crime.

OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Per Curiam.

392 U.S.

The trial judge instructed the jury that Rappe's confession was admissible against her but that her statements implicating petitioner were not to be considered
in determining petitioner's guilt or innocence. The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction.
Petitioner filed a proceeding in federal habeas corpus in
the United States District Court for the Middle District
of Tennessee. That court relied on Delli Paoli and denied relief. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
affirmed.
Although Bruton involved a federal prosecution and
this is a state prosecution, the right of cross-examination
secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth
Amendment. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400; Douglas
v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 415.
"We have . . . retroactively applied rules of criminal
procedure fashioned to correct serious flaws in the factfinding process at trial." Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S.
293, 298. See Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368; Gideon
v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335; Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S.
433; Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 639, n. 20;
Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U. S. 719, 727-728; cf.
Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U. S. 1. Despite the cautionary
instruction, the admission of a defendant's confession
which implicates a codefendant results in such a 'serious
flaw." The retroactivity of the' holding in Bruton is
therefore required; the error "went to the basis of fair
hearing and trial because the procedural apparatus never
assured the [petitioner] a fair determination" of his guilt
or innocence. Linkletter v. Walker, supra, at 639, n. 20.
As we said in Bruton:
"[T]here are-some contexts in which the risk that
the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so
great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the
defendant, that the practical and human limitations

ROBERTS v. RUSSELL.

of the jury system cannot be ignored. .

.

. Such

a context is presented here, where the powerfully
incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant . . . are deliberately spread before the jury

in a joint trial." 391 U. S., at 135-136.
Due regard for countervailing considerations-reliance
on the old stahdard of Delli Paoli and the impact. of
retroactivity upon the administration of justice, Stovall
v. Denno, supra, at 298-does not counsel against
retroactiv'ity of Bruton. The element of reliance is not
persuasive, for Delli Paoli has been under attack from
its inception and many courts have in fact rejected it.
See Bruton v. United States, supra, at 128-135 and nn. 4,
8, 10. And even if the impact of retroactivity may be
significant, the constitutional error presents a serious risk
that the issue of guilt or innocence may not have been
reliably determined.
The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis
and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the
case is remanded to the District Court for further consideration in light of Bruton v. United States, supra.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs in the Court's holding as
to retroactivity for the reasons given in his dissent in
Linkletter v. Walker,.381 U. S. 618, 640, and not for the
reasons given in the Court's opinion today.

opinion in Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, 138
