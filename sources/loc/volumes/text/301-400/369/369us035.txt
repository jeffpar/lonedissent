IN RE SHUTTLESWORTH.
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS
CORPUS.

No. 1073, Misc.

Decided February 26, 1962.

Certiorari granted; order of Court of Appeals vacated; case remanded
to District Court with instructions.

William M. Kunstler for petitioner.
PER CURIAM.

Treating this application for habeas corpus as a petition
for certiorari to review the denial by a judge of the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit of a certificate of probable
cause for appeal *(28 U. S. C. ยง 2253) from the District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama, cf. In re
Burwell, 350 U. S. 521, 522, we grant it as such, vacate
the order of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case
to the District Court with instructions to hold the matter while petitioner pursues his state remedies (as indicated in the opinion of Judge Rives denying a certificate of probable cause), including an application for
bail to state courts pending disposition of petitioner's
application for state relief. In the event of failure to
secure such relief, or to secure admission to bail pending
such relief within five (5) days from the date of application for bail, petitioner may, upon appropriate showing,
proceed on this application in the United States District Court which may then consider all state remedies
exhausted and proceed to hear and determine the cause,
including any application for bail pending that court's
final disposition of the matter. The Clerk is directed to
issue the judgment forthwith.
