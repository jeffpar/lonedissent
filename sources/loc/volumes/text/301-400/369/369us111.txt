PUBLIC AFFAIRS PRESS, v. RICKOVER.
CERTIORARI 'TO. THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.

No. 36.

Argued November 6-7, 1961.-Decided March 5, 1962.*

In this action under the Declaratory Judgment. Act for a determination of the rights of Vice Admiral Rickover with respect to his
speeches, the record, consisting mainly of a sketchy agreed statement of facts, is not a satisfactory basis for a discretionary grant
of declaratory relief relating to claims to intellectual property
arising out of public employment. Pp. 111-114.
109 U. S. App. D. C. 128, 284 F. 2d 262, judgment vacated and cause
remanded.

Harry N. Rosenfield argued the cause for Public Affairs
Associates, Inc. With him on the briefs was Stanley B.
Frosh.
Joseph A. McDonald argued the cause for Vice Admiral
Rickover. With him on the briefs were Edwin S. Nail
and Harry Buchman.
PER CURIAM.

These two cases arose under the Declaratory Judgment
Act of June 14, 1934, 48 Stat. 955, as amended, now
28 U. S. C. (1958 ed.) §§ 2201 and 2202. The plaintiff,
an educational publishing corporation, asked defendant,
Vice Admiral Rickover, for leave to publish, to an undefined extent, uncopyrighted speeches he had theretofore
delivered. He refused on the ground that what he
claimed to be exclusive publishing rights had been sold

to another publisher, and he gave notice of copyright on
speeches subsequent to the plaintiff's demand. Since the
defendant threatened restraint of plaintiff's use of his
speeches, the plaintiff sought this declaratory relief. The
District Court dismissed the complaint on the merits, 177
F. Supp. 601. The Court of Appeals (one judge dissenting), agreeing with the District Court that the defendant
had, as to his uncopyrighted speeches, the common-law
rights of an author, held that he had forfeited his rights
by reason of their "publication"; as to his copyrighted
speeches, that court remanded the case to the District
Court for determination of the extent to which "fair use"
was open to the plaintiff. 109 U. S. App. D. C. 128, 284
F. 2d 262. By petition for certiorari and cross-petition
both parties sought review and because serious public
questions were in issue we brought the cases here. 365
U. S. 841.
The Declaratory Judgment Act was an authorization,
not a command. It gave the federal courts competence
to make a declaration of rights; it did not impose a duty
to do so. Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., 316 U. S. 491, 494,
499; GreatLakes Co. v. Huffman, 319 U. S. 293, 299-300;
Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U. S. 450, 462;
Mechling Barge Lines v. United States, 368 U. S. 324, 331.
Of course a District Court cannot decline to entertain such
an action as a matter of whim or personal disinclination.
"A declaratory judgment, like other forms of equitable
relief, should be granted only as a matter of judicial discretion, exercised in the public interest." Eccles v.
Peoples Bank, 333 U. S. 426, 431.. We have cautioned
against declaratory judgments on issues of public moment,
even falling short of constitutionality, in speculative situations. Eccles v. Peoples Bank, supra, at 432.
In these cases we are asked to determine matters of
serious public concern. They relate to claims to intel-

lectual property arising out of public employment. They
thus raise questions touching the responsibilities and
immunities of those engaged in the public service, particularly high officers, and the rightful demands of the
Government and the public upon those serving it. These
are delicate problems; their solution is bound to have farreaching import. Adjudication of such problems, certainly by way of resort to a discretionary declaratory
judgment, should rest on an adequate and full-bodied
record. The record before us is woefully lacking in these
requirements.
The decisions of the courts below rested on an Agreed
Statement of Facts which sketchily summarized the circumstances of the preparation and of the delivery of the
speeches in controversy in relation to the Vice Admiral's
official duties. The nature and scope of his duties were
not clearly defined and less than an adequate -exposition
of the use by him of government facilities and government pe;sonnel in the preparation of these speeches was
given. Administrative practice, insofar as it may relevantly shed light, was not explored. The Agreed Statement of Facts was in part phrased, modified and interpreted in the course of a running exchange between trial
judge and counsel. The extent of the agreement of counsel to the Agreed Statement of Facts was in part explained
in the course of oral argument in the District Court.
None of the undetailed and loose, if not ambiguous, statements in the Agreed Statement of Facts was subject to the
safeguards of critical probing through examination and
cross-examination. This is all the more disturbing where
vital public interests are implicated in a requested declaration and the Government asserted no claim (indeed
obliquely may be deemed not to have disapproved of the
defendant's claim) although the Government was invited
to appear in the litigation as amicus curiae and chose not

to do so. So fragile a record is an unsatisfactory basis on
which to entertain this action for declaratory relief.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

vacated, with direction to return the case to the District
Court for disposition not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
MR. JusTicE DOUGLAS, concurring.

It is conceded that the Declaratory Judgment Act
is an authorization, not a command-a conclusion as well
settled as is the proposition that the jurisdiction of
federal courts is confined to "cases" or "controversies."'
Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227. The
requirements of a "case" or "controversy" and the propriety of the use of the declaratory judgment are at
times closely enmeshed. In resolving those issues the
Court has on the whole been niggardly in the exercise
of its authority. Thus, in Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U. S. 429, a taxpayer's suit to declare that a
public school system could not be used for religious
instruction was dismissed because there was not "the
requisite financial interest." Id., at 435. Frothingham
v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447-a decision with which I have
great difficulty-was given new dimenqions. That case
held that a taxpayer of the United States had no standing
to challenge a federal appropriation, since the question
was essentially a matter of public, not private, concern.'
""Back in 1923, the Cour, went further and held that the mere
fact that a person could show he paid federal taxes made no difference in this respect and gave him no standing to challenge an act of
Congress appropriating public funds. The Court recognized that an
unconstitutional spending of public money might conceivably necessitate a rise in subsequent tax levies. Nevertheless it held that the
causal connection between any specific expenditure and future tax
rates would be too remote and uncertain to constitute an immediate

Id., at 487. This ruling was projected into the state
field by the Doremus case, barring relief to those legitimately concerned with the operation of the public school
system.
At times the question of the "ripeness" of an issue for
judicial review is brigaded with the appropriateness of
declaratory relief. In Public Service Comm'n v. Wycoff
Co., 344 U. S. 237, 244, relief was denied though a carrier's
certificate to do an interstate business was placed in
jeopardy by threatened statc action. That principle was
extended in Eccles v. Peoples Bank, 333 U. S. 426, to deny
relief in a situation comparable to a suit to remove a cloud
from one's title.. For a bank was being saddled with
conditions by the Federal Reserve System that crippled
its activities and restricted the market for its stock. On
other occasions, "mootness" has been used as the rubric
to deny relief through the route of a declaratory judgment, even though the litigant was still insecure and
in peril as a result of administrative action. Mechling
Barge Lines v. United States, 368 U. S. 324.
At other times the issue is said to be "abstracj" because
of the lack of immediacy in the threatened enforcement
of a law. Thus, a person must risk going to jail or losing
his job to get relief. That was true in Poe v. Ullman,
367 U. S. 497, a case involving Connecticut's birth-conpersonal injury to a taxpayer. Hence he would have no more to
complain about than others.
"Rulings of this kind, designed to keep peace among the departments of government, are eminently sensible as over-all policies. Yet
they also provide a way to immunize a bad law from attack in the
courts; one need only frame the law in such a way as to violate the
basic rights of nobody in particular but everybody in general, that is,
of the entire American people. Then, since no one can point to an
injury that is distinguishable from his neighbors', no one can come
into court and challenge the legislation!" Edmond Cahn, How to
Destroy the Churches, Harper's Magazine, Nov. 1961, p. 36.

trol law, and in United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330
U. S.-75, involving Civil Service Rules restricting the
political rights of federal employees.
The list is not complete. But these cases illustrate the
restrictive nature of the judge-made rules which have
made the federal courts so inhospitable to litigation to
vindicate private rights. At no time has the Court been
wholly consistent; nor have I. Compare Connecticut Ins.
Co. v. Moore, 333 U. S. 541, 556 (dissenting opinion), with
Western Union Co. v. Pennsylvania, 368 U. S. 71. But
my maturing view is that courts do law and justice a disservice when they close their doors to people who, though
not in jail nor yet penalized, live under a regime of peril
and insecurity. What are courts for, if not for removing
clouds on title, as well as adjudicating the rights of those
against whom the law is aimed, though not immediately
applied?
Evers v. Dwyer, 358 U. S. 202, is illustrative of what I
deem to be the important role served by the declaratory
judgment. A Negro who had not been arrested for riding
a segregated bus brought a class action to have his rights
and those of his class adjudicated. We held there was an
"actual controversy," because it was clear that the local
authorities were bent on enforcing the segregation law,
2
though they had not enforced it against this plaintiff.
2 And see Mitchell v. United States, 313 U. S. 80, where we held
that a Negro who filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce
Commission against an interstate carrier for discriminating against
him had standing to complain, though it did not appear that he
intended to make a similar railroad journey:
"He is an American citizen free to travel, and he is entitled to
go by this particular route whenever he chooses to take it and in
that event to have facilities for his journey without any discrimination against him which the Interstate. Commerce Act forbids." Id.,
at 93.

WAmEN, C. J., dissenting.

The opinion of the Court in this case seems to set
declaratory relief apart as suspect; it leaves the innuendo
that if the case were here under a different complaint,
the result might be different. I share none of these disparaging thoughts. I agree, however, that no matter
what the cause of action might be, the present record
leaves gaps which make an adjudication impossible. The
lack of evidence as to the extent to which Rickover's
literary works were products of his office is fatal for me,
though, of course, it would not be to one who considers
those facts irrelevant to the legal issue. The approach
we take today has often been used to abdicate the judicial
function under resounding utterances concerning the
importance of. judicial self-denial. See, e. g., United
States v. Auto. Workers, 352 U. S.567, 590-592. It has
also served to place undue emphasis upon the clarity and
precision of the questions presented, as in Rescue Army
v. Municipal Court, 331 U. S. 549, where the Court subjected the appellant "to the burden of undergoing a third
trial" in order that the issues might be in a more "cleancut and concrete form." Id., at 584. But on the present
record I have.no other choice, for without additional facts
I must withhold decision.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN,

with whom MR.

JUSTICE

concurs, dissenting.

With respect to those of Admiral Rickover's speeches
written and delivered prior to December 1, 1958, I would
affirm. The record made below and filed here is, I
believe, adequate to support the judgment of the Court
of Appeals that the Admiral's practice of distributing
numerous copies of his speeches, without limitations as
to the persoiis who would receive them or the purposes to
which they would be put by the recipients, and without

so much as a suggestion of a copyright claim, amounted to
a dedication of those works to the public domain. At
the same time, I recognize the inadequacy of the present
record for determining now whether speeches on which a
copyright notice had been placed were effectively protected by that notice from other than "fair use," and
whether Public Affairs intended to make only "fair use"
of those works. I would, therefore, also affirm the remand
to the District Court ordered by the Court of Appeals as
to such speeches.
In the light of these views, I find it unnecessary to pass
now on the questions raised in No. 36, and would dismiss
that case as premature.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN,

dissenting.

The basic issue which brought these cases here was
whether Admiral Rickover's speeches were copyrightable
in light of the following provision of the Copyright Act:
"No copyright shall subsist in . . . any publication of
the United States Government." (17 U. S. C. § 8.) As
I see it, decision of that issue turns not merely on whether
such speeches were made by the Admiral in the "line of
duty," but also, and in my view more fundamentally, on
whether such speeches were in any event "publication [s]
of the United States Government." In my opinion the
record is sufficient to require adjudication on both aspects
of that issue, and on this phase of the controversy I agree
with the result reached by the Colirt of Appeals. I also
agree with its determination as to the adequacy of the
copyright notice affixed tb speeches delivered after
December 1, 1958.
However, I consider the record inadequate to justify
adjudication as to whether Admiral Pickover's right to
copyright was lost with respect to speeches delivered

before December 1, 1958, by reason of their alleged entry
into "the public domain. ' '" As to that issue I would
vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand
the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In
all other respects I would affirm the judgment below.

*The stipulation states that with respect to 20 of the 22 speeches
made before December 1, 1D53, "Admiral Rickover mailed some to
individuals who had requested copies or who Admiral Rickover
believed would be interested in the subject. Some were sent by
Admiral Rickover . . . to the sponsor of the speech to be made
available to the press and others at the place where the speech
was to be delivered." (Emphasis added.) It appears from the stipulation that no further distribution other than for press use was ever
made. Whether the foregoing publications were general enough to
amount to a dedication to the public of all or any of these speeches
depends on more precise information than is afforded by the
stipuJation.
