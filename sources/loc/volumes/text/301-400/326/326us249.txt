useful end. But that did not advance the frontiers of
science in this narrow field so as to satisfy the exacting
standards of our patent system. Where there has been
use of an article or where the method of its manufacture is
known, more than a new advantage of the product must

be discovered in order to claim invention. See DeForest
Radio Co. v. General Electric Co., 283 U. S. 664, 682. It

No. 54.

Argued October 17, 1945.-Decided November 13, 1945.

1. The nature and extent of the legal consequences of the expiration
of a patent are federal questions, the answers to which are to be
derived from the patent laws and the policies which they adopt.
P. 255.
2. An assignor of a patent is not estopped by virtue of his assignment
to defend a suit for infringement of the assigned patent on the
ground that the alleged infringing device is that of a prior-art expired patent. Westinghouse Co. v. FormicaCo., 266 U. S. 342, distinguished. Pp. 250, 257.
3. The application of the doctrine of estoppel so as to foreclose the
assignor of a patent from asserting the right to make use of the
prior-art invention of an expired patent, which anticipates that of
the assigned patent, is inconsistent with the patent laws which
dedicate to public use the invention of an expired patent. P. 257.

MR.CHIEF JUSTICE STONE, delivered

the opinion of the

Court.
In this patent infringement suit the question is whether
the assignor of a patent is estopped by virtue of his assignment to defend a suit for infringement of the assigned
patent on the ground that the alleged infringing device is
that of a prior art, expired patent.
Automatic Paper Machinery Company, Inc., petitioner's assignor, acquired by assignment, from respondent
Marcalus, Patent No. 1,843,429 of February 2, 1932, issued
on the application of Marcalus for "a method and machine
for mounting a cutting strip of a hard non-metallic substance on an edge of a box blank." The patent describes
and claims a method, and a machine for employing it,
whereby, in substantially one operation, indurated paper
is drawn from a roll and brought into overlapping relationship with the edge of a box blank, when a strip of the paper
is automatically cut off and glued to the box blank in such
position that its longitudinal edge projects beyond the
edge of the box blank. The box thus equipped with the
cutting edge of the strip is useful as a dispensing container
for rolled wax paper which, as drawn from the roll, may
be cut in any desired lengths by drawing it across the

cutting edge at an angle with the plane of the cutter.
Marcalus, while an officer and employee of petitioner,
made the patented invention and assigned his patent application to petitioner for a valuable consideration. The
patent issued on the application as filed, without amendment, after which Marcalus severed his connection with
petitioner and organized respondent company, which he
controls, and which, like petitioner, is engaged in producing and selling box blanks having a cutting edge.
In the present suit, brought by petitioner for infringement of the assigned patent, respondents defended on the
ground that their accused machine is a copy of that of the
expired, prior art patent issued to Inman in 1912. The
District Court gave judgment for petitioner, 54 F. Supp.
105, holding that inasmuch as respondents were estopped
by Marcalus' assignment of the patent to show its invalidity, they could not, by recourse to the prior art to
show noninfringement, accomplish the same result by indirection. The Court of Appeals reversed, 147 F. 2d 608,
holding that the prior art may be resorted to by the
assignor to measure the extent of anticipation for the
purpose of limiting the claims of the assigned patent, and
thus avoid infringement. Because of the identity patentwise of the Inman patent with the assigned patent and
with the accused device, the court held that the claims
of the assigned patent were limited to naught, and hence
that there could be no infringement.
To sustain its right to enjoin infringement by the
assignor of a patented invention anticipated by a prior
art patent, petitioner relies on the doctrine of estoppel as
applied to the assignor of a patent for value. Its basic
principle is said to be one of good faith, that one who has
sold his invention may not, to the detriment of the purchaser, deny the existence of that which he has sold. See
Westinghouse Co. v. Formica Co., 288 F. 330, 333. The
rule, as stated by this Court in Westinghouse Co. v. For-

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.

mica Co., 266 U. S. 342, 349, is "that an assignor of a patent
right is estopped to attack the utility, novelty or validity
of a patented invention which he has assigned or granted
as against any one claiming the right under his assignment or grant. As to the rest of the world, the patent may
have no efficacy and create no right of monopoly; but the
assignor can not be heard to question the right of his
assignee to exclude him from its use. Curranv. Burdsall,
20 Fed. 835; Ball & Socket Fastener Co. v. Ball Glove

Machine Co., 60 Fed. 283, 284; Babcock v. Clarkson, 63
Fed. 607; Noonan v. Chester Park Athletic Co., 99 Fed.
90, 91."
Respondents, denying that the doctrine of estoppel can
rightly be applied to patent assignments, also insist that
the present case is not within the scope of the doctrine.
Compare Buckingham Products Co. v. McAleer Mfg._Co.,
108 F. 2d 192 with Casco Products Corp. v. Sinko Tool &
Mfg. Co., 116 F. 2d 119. Both parties rely on the decision
of this Court in the Formicacase, supra, which, although
stating that the assignor cannot deny the novelty and
validity of the assigned patented invention, nevertheless
held that the claims of a patent may be narrowed by reference to the prior art so as to restrict them to so much of
the invention described by the specifications as is not exhibited by the prior art. Klein v. Russell, 19 Wall. 433,
466, 467; Garneau v. Dozier, 102 U. S. 230; Wollensak v.
Reiher, 115 U. S. 87; Beidler v. United States, 253 U. S.

6 R. P. C. 190.
This Court in the Formica case, passing the question,.
not present here, whether the estoppel of the assignor extends to claims added by the assignee to the application
in the Patent Office, held that the estoppel did not, in any

Opinion of the Court.

event, preclude the assignor charged as an infringer from
narrowing or qualifying their construction by reference
to the prior art, saying, 266 U. S. at 351: "The distinction
may be a nice one but seems to be workable." It accordingly, by reference to the prior art, interpreted the claims,
by narrowing them to a two-step process, shown by the
specifications, which the court found to be the assignor's
advance over the prior art, but which was not in terms
embodied in the claims. The Court thus sustained the
defense of noninfringement by restricting the claims by
reference to the prior art, and by holding in effect that the
invention assigned was not as broad in scope as the claims
would otherwise on their face define it to be.
Petitioner, pointing to the logical embarrassment in
applying a doctrine which forbids the assignor to deny
validity of the patented invention for want of novelty, but
nevertheless allows him to narrow its scope by reference
to the prior art in order to save his accused device from
infringement, insists that the court below has resorted to
the prior art, not for the purpose of narrowing the claims
and distinguishing from the prior art something which the
assignor invented, but for the purpose of destroying the
claims because anticipated. This is said to be precisely
the same in purpose and effect as to deny invention for
want of novelty. It is urged that the permission thus given
to respondent assignor to show want of novelty which he
is estopped to deny, is to disregard the estoppel by which,
by hypothesis, he is bound.
Respondents, on the other hand, insist that a literal
application of the rule of the Formicacase limits the claims
of the assigned patent to a structure having certain minor
mechanical additions made by Marcalus to the machine
of the Inman patent which respondents copied by their
accused device. These additions, it is conceded, may not
involve invention, but if so, it is said, respondents are
estopped to assert it. And applying the rule of the

254

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of the Court.

326 U. S.

Formicacase they urge that the claims of the patent may
nevertheless be narrowed to a machine embodying the
additional, minor features not found in the Inman
machine, and infringement may thus be avoided.
But in the circumstances of this case we find it unnecessary to pursue these logical refinements, or to determine
whether, as respondent asks, the doctrine of estoppel by
patent assignment as stated by the Formica case should
be rejected. To whatever extent that doctrine may be
deemed to have survived the Formica decision or to be
restricted by it, we think that case is not controlling here.
For other considerations are dispositive of this case, in
which, unlike Formica, the accused machine is precisely
that of an expired patent. Neither in that case nor in
any other, so far as we are advised, was the doctrine of
estoppel applied so as to penalize the use of the invention
of an expired patent. That we think is foreclosed by the
patent laws themselves.
Revised Statutes, §§ 4886, 4884 as amended, 35 U. S. C.
§§ 31, 40, provide for the grant of a patent for a term of
seventeen years to any person who has invented a "new
and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of
matter." The grant is conditioned upon the filing of an
application in the Patent Office describing the invention
and the manner of making and using it. R. S. § 4888 as
amended, 35 U. S. C. § 33. Revised Statutes, §§ 4895,
4898, 35 U. S. C. §§ 44, 47, authorize the assignment of an
invention while the application for a patent is pending
and of the patent rights to the invention after the patent
has issued. Section 24 (7) of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C.
§ 41 (7), confers on district courts of the United States
jurisdiction of cases arising under the patent laws, and
R. S. § 4921 as amended, 35 U. S. C. § 70, gives the district
courts authority to entertain suits to restrain infringement
and for recovery of any resulting damage from the infringement of any right secured by the patent grant.

SCOTT PAPER CO. v. MARCALUS CO.

255

Opinion of the Court.

The enactment of these provisions is the mode by which
Congress has chosen to carry into effect the policy sanc-

tioned by the Constitution, Article I, § 8, Cl. 8 "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing
for limited Times to . . . Inventors the exclusive Right
to their . . . Discoveries." The nature and extent of the
legal consequences of the expiration of a patent are federal
questions, the answers to which are to be derived from the
patent laws and the policies which they adopt. Cf. Sola
Electric Co. v. Jefferson Co., 317 U. S.173, 176; Steele v.
L. & N. R. Co., 323 U. S. 192, 204, and cases cited. By the
patent laws Congress has given to the inventor opportunity to secure the material rewards for his invention for
a limited time, on condition that he make full disclosure
for the benefit of the public of the manner of making and
using the invention, and that upon the expiration of the
patent the public be left free to use the invention. See
Special Equipment Co. v. Coe, 324 U. S.370, 378. As has
been many times pointed out, the means adopted by Congress of promoting the progress of science and the arts is
the limited grant of the patent monopoly in return for the
full disclosure of the patented invention and its dedication
to the public on the expiration of the patent. Grant v.
Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 241-242; Gill v. Wells, 22 Wall. 1;
Bauer v. O'Donnell, 229 U. S. 1; Motion Picture Co. v.
Universal Film Co., 243 U. S. 502, 510-511, and cases
cited.
The aim of the patent laws is not only that members of
the public shall be free to manufacture the product or
employ the process disclosed by the expired patent, but
also that the consuming public at large shall receive the
benefits of the unrestricted exploitation, by others, of its
disclosures. Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U. S.
111, 117-120. If a manufacturer or user could restrict himself, by express contract, or by any action which would
give rise to an "estoppel," from using the invention of an

256

326 U. S.

expired patent, he would deprive himself and the consuming public of the advantage to be derived from his free use
of the disclosures. The public has invested in such free
use by the grant of a monopoly to the patentee for a limited time. Hence any attempted reservation or continuation in the patentee or those claiming under him of the
patent monopoly, after the patent expires, whatever the
legal device employed, runs counter to the policy and purpose of the patent laws. And for the same reason a
stranger, such as respondent Marcalus, cannot, by securing
and assigning a patent on the invention of the expired
Inman patent, confer on petitioner any right to deprive
the public of the benefits of the free use of the invention
for which the public has paid by the grant of a limited
monopoly.
By the force of the patent laws not only is the invention of a patent dedicated to the public upon its expiration,
but the public thereby becomes entitled to share in the
good will which the patentee has built up in the patented
article or product through the enjoyment of his patent
monopoly. Hence we have held that the patentee may
not exclude the public from participating in that good
will or secure, to any extent, a continuation of his monopoly by resorting to the trademark law and registering
as a trademark any particular descriptive matter appearing in the specifications, drawings or claims of the expired
patent, whether or not such matter describes essential
elements of the invention or claims. Kellogg Co. v.
NationalBiscuit Co., supra, 117-120; Singer Manufacturing Co. v. June Manufacturing Co., 163 U. S. 169, 185.
It is thus apparent that the patent laws preclude the
patentee of an expired patent and all others including
petitioner from recapturing any part of the former patent
monopoly; for those laws dedicate to all the public the
ideas and inventions embodied in an expired patent.
They do not contemplate that anyone by contract or any

Opinion of the Court.

form of private arrangement may withhold from the
public the use of an invention for which the public has

paid by its grant of a monopoly and which has been appropriated to the use of all. The rights in the invention are
then no longer subject to private barter, sale, or waiver.
Cf. Phillips Co. v. Grand Trunk R. Co., 236 U. S. 662;
Midstate Horticultural Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 320
U. S. 356, 361; Brooklyn Bank v. O'Neil, 324 U. S. 697,
704. It follows that the patent laws preclude the petitioner assignee from invoking the doctrine of estoppel, as
a means of continuing as against respondent, his assignor,
the benefit of an expired monopoly, and they preclude the
assignor from estopping himself from enjoying rights
which it is the policy of the patent laws to free from all
restrictions. For no more than private contract can
estoppel be the means of successfully avoiding the requirements of legislation enacted for the protection of a public
interest. Compare Pittsburgh,C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v.
Fink, 250 U. S. 577, 583 with Louisville & Nashville R.
Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 476-477; New York Central
& H. R. R. Co. v. Gray, 239 U. S. 583, 586-587; Norman
v. B. & 0. R. Co., 294 U. S. 240, 304-305, 309-310,
and cases cited. The interest in private good faith is not
a universal touchstone which can be made the means of
sacrificing a public interest secured by an appropriate
exercise of the legislative power. The patent laws preclude us from saying that the patent assignment, which
they authorize, operates to estop the assignor from asserting that which the patent laws prescribe, namely, that the
invention of an expired patent is dedicated to the public,
of which the assignor is a member.
The judgment is affirmed for the reason that we find
that the application of the doctrine of estoppel so as to
foreclose the assignor of a patent from asserting the right
to make use of the prior art invention of an expired patent,
which anticipates that of the assigned patent, is incon-

sistent with the patent laws which dedicate to public use
the invention of an expired patent. The assignor has a
complete defense to an action for infringement where the
alleged infringing device is that of an expired patent.
We have no occasion to consider the question discussed
in briefs and arguments of counsel, whether the estoppel
by patent assignment violates either the terms or policy
of the laws against restraints of trade and competition.*
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE REED considers that the dominant rule of
Westinghouse Co. v. Formica Co., 266 U. S. 342, 349, is
"that an assignor of a patent right is estopped to attack
the utility, novelty or validity of a patented invention
which he has assigned or granted as against any one claiming the right under his assignment or grant." The fact
that the prior art is evidenced by an expired patent does
not seem significant to him. Consequently he would
reverse.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON took no part in the consideration

or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.

When by a fair and free bargain a man sells something
to another, it hardly lies in his mouth to say, "I have sold
you nothing." It certainly offends the rudimentary sense
of justice for courts to support one who purports to sell

unreasonable and hence unlawful if it "is based on a promise to refrain

something to another in saying "What I have sold you is
worthless," even though he did not expressly promise that
what he sold had worth. The obvious implications of
fair dealing in commercial transactions have been part of
our law for at least a hundred years. And it would be surprising indeed if the law made a difference whether what
was purported to be sold was a diamond, or a secret process
for manufacturing a commodity, or a patented machine.
It has never been questioned that courts will not make
themselves instruments of unfair dealing when what is
sold is a patent. In technical language, the sale of a patent
means its assignment. Congress might have confined the
right to exploit a patent solely to the patentee. Congress
has acted on the contrary policy. Ever since the Act of
February 21, 1793, 1 Stat. 318, Congress has sanctioned
the right to assign patents, requiring only fulfillment of
certain formalities. To be sure, Congress has not said in
so many words that the seller of a patent-an assignoris subject like other sellers to the obligations of fair dealing. It has not said that he cannot turn around on the
morrow and render futile that which he has sold by claiming that what he purported to sell as a patent was in truth
not a patent, and, since it was not a patent, he, the seller,
could not be charged with impairing the worth of the
patent by practising it himself. Until this day such a
sophistical argument to accomplish overreaching in a
business transaction has uniformly been rejected by the
courts, and it has been rejected by this Court on basic
considerations of "fair dealing." Westinghouse Co. v.
Formica Co., 266 U. S. 342, 350. It is relevant to recall
that insistence on this doctrine was unanimously made in
the Formica case by a Court which included Mr. Justice
Brandeis, than whom no one was more zealously alert
against the slightest inroads upon the public interest
through undue extension of patent rights. It is important
to emphasize that the principle of good faith which the

260

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
FRANIU-RTER, J., dissenting.

326 U.S.

conscience of equity has thus enforced binds only an
assignor who seeks to use the courts to defeat that which
he purported to sell. It merely restricts one person, the
assignor, from denying that he sold a patent when he purported to sell it, leaving the whole rest of the world free
to assail the validity or novelty of the patent.
To be sure, the patent legislation does not in so many
words formulate this doctrine of fair dealing between assignor and assignee. But patent legislation, like other
legislation and indeed like all compositions, impliedly contains presuppositions which need not be spelled out precisely because they are taken for granted. The fair intendment of a patent assignment authorized by Congress
is as much to be respected as the same meaning explicitly
stated. Patent legislation is part of the great body of law.
Familiar equitable doctrines, applicable to the whole domain of law and unquestioned as part of the judicial
process, are infused into specific enactments dealing only
with the specific problems that call for specific formulation. If warrant in the language of Congress had to be
found for all adjudications made by this Court in litigation
involving patents, no inconsiderable volume of decisions
drawn from general equitable principles ought never to
have been made and should be undone.
The principle of fair dealing as between assignor and
assignee of a patent whereby the assignor will not be allowed to say that what he sold as a patent was not a patent
has been part of the fabric of our law throughout the life
of this nation. It has been undeviatingly enforced by
English-speaking courts in this country, in England, in
Canada, and Australia. See, e. g., Oldham v. Langmead,
cited in Hayne v. Maltby, 3 T. R. 438, 439, 441 (1789);
Indiana Mfg. Co. v. Smith, 10 Can. Exch. 17 (1905);
Shepherd v. Patent Composition Pavement Co., 5 Aust.
Jur. 27 (1874). If there are reasons of public policy
against the continued application of this equitable doc-

SCOTT PAPER CO. v. MARCALUS CO. 261

Fmwmnmvm, J., dissenting.

trine in the case of a patent, Congress has ready means of
undoing that which has always been part of the patent
law, as is true of other provisions which in its wisdom
may call for change. This doctrine, voluminously applied
in the Law Reports, has never been questioned by Congress in the successive enactments amending the patent
law. Only very recently bills dealing with this subject
have been introduced but have not yet been acted upon.
See, e. g., H. R. 97 and H. R. 3462, 79th Cong., 1st Sess.
(1945); H. R. 3874, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943). The
place for reconsidering the policy which this Court more
than twenty years ago characterized as "a rule well settled
by forty-five years of judicial consideration," Westinghouse Co. v. Formica Co., supra, at 349, is the Congress.
That forum is not confronted with the stark alternatives
of either adhering to the rule or wiping it out, but has the
wide range of legislative discretion in considering what is
good and what is bad in the rule and fashioning legislation
appropriate to the diversified aspects of the problem.
The Court professes neither to reject, nor to adhere to,
the equitable principle of fair dealing reaffirmed by the
Formica case. It finds ground for avoiding what seem to
me to be inescapable alternatives by the claim that the
assignor here purported to assign a patent which turns
out to be invalid because it now appears that it was based
on an earlier expired patent. Since an expired patent
makes it part of the public domain, the assignor, although
he had sold what need not have been bought, could enter
the domain like the rest of the public. So goes the argument. But this, I submit with all respect, is to throw out
the baby with the bath. For it amounts to saying that the
assignor in raising invalidity in a suit for infringement
is just a part of the general public and can ask the Court
to enforce every defense open to the rest of the public.
The essence of the principle of fair dealing which binds
the assignor of a patent in a suit by the assignee, even

326 U. S.

though it turns out that the patent is invalid or lacks
novelty, is that in this relation the assignor is not part of
the general public but is apart from the general public.

The isolated, individual relation between assignor and
assignee, due to the sale by the assignor of something
which he afterwards should not be allowed to say was
nothing, is the basis of the doctrine of fair dealing which
operates against him and against nobody else. That doctrine is wholly consistent with the right of the general
public to the free and unfettered use of a patent after its
time has expired. It is suggested, also, that the public
is harmed by removing the assignor from the ranks of

actual or potential manufacturers of what is covered by
the patent.

But that is true of every case in which the

assignor is barred from questioning the validity of his
assignment. As against the loss to the public of one possible manufacturer is put the public policy of fair dealing
between man and man. That is the meaning of the

Formicadoctrine.'
IThe complicated facts in the Formica case have somewhat obscured the true scope and meaning of that decision. What was
decided is perhaps best disclosed in the lower court's opinion which
was here affirmed. That opinion was by Judge Denison who spoke
with special authority on patent law: "It may be granted that these
two claims [in controversy] were properly readable upon the specification and drawings of the application signed by O'Connor [the
assignor]-that is to say, in the language of the Patent Office, that he
had the right to make these claims. Nevertheless they expressed a
conception of the invention, which rested solely on the 'nonplaniform'
shape of the article and was in this respect broader than any claim
which O'Connor had drafted, and if the prior Baekeland patent had
been known to O'Connor, as it became known to his assignees when
it later compelled them to abandon the original broad claims, he probably never would have claimed as his the invention thus formulated.
The record does not support the inference that O'Connor either expressly or impliedly represented to the Westinghouse Company [the
assignee] that he was the inventor of the process defined in these two
claims, and hence the claim of estoppel must fail." 288 F. 330, 334.

FRANKFuRTER, J., dissenting.

A machine that is not patentable because it is not novel
is just as much part of the public domain as a machine on
which the patent has expired. If public policy does not
preclude an individual from being held to a fair bargain
with another when he purported to sell as a patent what
in fact was never patentable, what is there in reasonfor there is nothing in what Congress has said-that should
preclude enforcement of a fair bargain whereby an individual agreed, in effect, not to compete with another regarding a machine which turns out not to have been
patentable because it represented an expired patent open
to all the rest of the world? Of course, parties cannot by
agreement defeat an explicit provision or purpose of legislation. One shipper cannot, for instance, secure the private
advantage of a lower rate when the Interstate Commerce
Act provides for equality of rates among shippers, Pittsburgh, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Fink, 250 U. S. 577; nor can
an employer defeat the protective purpose of the Fair
Labor Standards Act setting minimum wage limits, by an
agreement based on the inequality of bargaining power
between employers and individual employees, Brooklyn
Savings Bank v. O'Neil, 324 U. S. 697, 706. There is
nothing comparable to such situations in the language or
purpose of the patent laws regarding assignment of patents. On the contrary, as we have seen, the principle
whereby an assignor is held to his bargain with the assignee has been part of the texture of our patent law
throughout its history. Congress in its successive enactments modifying the patent law has respected this principle and left it untouched.!
2 Nor can the assignor of an expired patent, when the assignee seeks

to hold him to his bargain, invoke the law condemning contracts in
restraint of trade. So far as the hitherto recognized principle of fair
dealing between an assignor and his assignee unduly restrains the
freedom of action of the assignor, it merely restrains in the manner
that every contract is a restraint of trade. See Chicago Board of

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.

Happily law is not so divorced from ethical standards
that a hitherto unquestioned principle of fair dealing
should be deemed hostile to any branch of the law. But
if the principle of fair dealing as between the assignor and
the assignee of a patent that has for so long been part of
the patent law is to be repudiated judicially, it is better to
do so explicitly, not by circumlocution.

Trade v. United States, 246 U. S. 231, 238. And it restrains equally
whether what is assigned is an expired patent or something that never
was a patent. In fact, however, the doctrine of such fair dealing does
not run counter to the' considerations by which the law outlaws restraints which persons may impose on themselves by contract. For
such an implied restraint as is found in the assignment of a patent,
purportedly valid but in fact invalid, like all reasonable restraints,
does not offend the objections to unreasonable restraints. The underlying rationale of the law against unreasonable restraints is twofold.
The first of these reasons is that the law will not lend its aid in the
enforcement of a contract by means of which a man may deprive himself of the possibility of earning a livelihood and deprive the public
of the "benefit of his labor." The second, "that such restraints tended
to give .

.

. the beneficiary of such restraints, a monopoly of the

trade, from which he had thus excluded one competitor, and by the
same means might exclude others." Taft, J., in United States v.
Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 F. 271, 279, modified, 175 U. S. 211.
Neither consideration is pertinent here.
