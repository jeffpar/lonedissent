HAWK v. OLSON, WARDEN.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEBRASKA.

No. 17. Argued October 8, 1945.-Decided November 13, 1945.
1. Upon review of a state court judgment dismissing a petition for

habeas corpus for failure to state a cause of action, this Court determines for itself whether the allegations of the petition entitle the

petitioner to a hearing on his claim that in his conviction of murder
he was denied due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 273.
2. The petition to a state court of Nebraska for habeas corpus, by one
under sentence of a court of that State upon a conviction of murder
in the first degree, sufficiently alleged that at his trial the petitioner
was denied opportunity to consult with counsel in the critical period
between his arraignment and the impaneling of the jury-a denial
of due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment-and he
was entitled to a hearing upon the petition. Pp. 276-278.
Denial of opportunity to consult with counsel on any material
step after indictment or similar charge and arraignment violates
the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 278.
3. Petitioner will have an opportunity on the new hearing to furnish
such further specification as the state practice may require in support of his claim that his conviction was procured by the use of
testimony known by the prosecutor and the trial court to have been
perjured. P. 273.

MAR. JUSTIcE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
This writ of certiorari brings before us the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Nebraska which affirmed a judgment of a district court dismissing a petition for habeas
corpus to inquire into petitioner's detention for want of
merit and failure to state a cause of action. Hawk v.
Olson, 145 Neb. 306, 16 N. W. 2d 181.1 Petitioner was in
the penitentiary after conviction for murder. The writ
was granted because a substantial federal question as to
restraint without due process of law under the Fourteenth
The opinion of the Supreme Court of Nebraska does not deal with
an alternate ground of the district court judgment. This was that
previous petitions for habeas corpus had "fully and finally adjudicated" the present issues. Compare Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224,
230; Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S. 114, 118. We do not consider this
issue.
The following reported cases show the efforts of petitioner to secure
release. There are other proceedings not reported. Hawk v. O'Grady,

Amendment seemed to be presented by the petition for
certiorari and the response. 324 U. S. 839.
As no response was filed or evidence received in the
district court, we accept as true all well-pleaded allegations of the petition and, in the exercise of the duty which
lies on us as well as the Nebraska courts to safeguard the
federal constitutional rights of petitioner, examine for
ourselves whether under the facts stated the petitioner is
now entitled to a hearing on the claimed violations of the
due process clause in his conviction for murder in the first
degree. Lisenba v. California,314 U. S. 219, 237; White
v. Ragen, 324 U. S. 760.
In its opinion the Supreme Court of Nebraska carefully considers a number of claims of denial of due process.
It is said that some of the grounds for release are pleaded
in the form of conclusions and that Nebraska procedure
requires in habeas corpus proceedings that the applicant
must set forth the facts from which it must appear that
he will be entitled to discharge. Hawk v. Olson, 16 N. W.
2d 181, 183, 1. c. We assume, since such grounds appear
in the petition, that one of these pretermitted grounds is
that "Conviction was obtained by the use of perjured
testimony knowingly used by the Prosecuting Officials
and the Trial Court." See Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S.
114, 116. Whatever Nebraska may require in the way of
further specification may be furnished, if available, and
permissible uifder the law of Nebraska (see Hawk v. Olson,
supra, 183, r. c.), by petitioner on a new hearing, Cf.
Tomkins v. Missouri, 323 U. S. 485, 487. On the issues
of the sufficiency of the evidence and the interference with
the right of appeal, we accept the decision of Nebraska
that the first cannot be raised by habeas corpus (Hawk v.
Olson, 16 N. W. 2d 181, 183) and that the second is not
supported by the facts stated by petitioner.' Other ob2 Lack

jections to the judgment have been made which are not
discussed herein but which we have looked into and which
we do not consider merit further attention.
Petitioner contends that his conviction violates the
Fourteenth Amendment because of denial at his trial of
an opportunity to examine the charge, subpoena witnesses,
consult counsel and prepare a defense. Denial of effective
assistance of counsel does violate due process. Powell v.
Alabama,287 U. S.45, 58; House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42, 46;
compare White v. Ragen, 324 U. S. 760, 764.
Since Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 331, this Court
has recognized that habeas corpus in the federal courts
by one convicted of a criminal offense is a proper procedure "to safeguard the liberty of all persons within the
jurisdiction of the United States against infringement
through any violation of the Constitution," even though
the events which were alleged to infringe did not appear
upon the face of the record of his conviction. This opportunity for an examination into the "very truth and
substance of the causes of his detention" was said in the
Frank case to have come from the adoption in 1867 of a
statute which empowered federal courts to examine into
restraints of liberty in violation of the Constitution of the
United States. 14 Stat. 385, c. 28.1 The legislation enof the Supreme Court of Nebraska disposes of this by pointing out

that petitioner never alleged a request to the Public Defender for
assistance on appeal and that a mandamus (for the record) was

denied. We assume the denial was proper as petitioner makes no
complaint as to it. On the present record the failure to seek review
from the conviction was without excuse. 16 N. W. 2d 181, 184.
8 This statute was reenacted as R. S. §§ 752-761. The provision
now appears in 28 U. S. C. § 453:
"The writ of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to a prisoner
in jail unless where he is . . . in custody in violation of the Constitution or of a law or treaty of the United States . . ."
The section had its origin in a bill (No. 605) reported by the Judiciary Committee of the House in response to a resolution directing

larged for the federal courts the "bare legal review" of
the authority under which a petitioner was held which
had been previously afforded by habeas corpus.' Johnson
v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 465-67. See also In re Neagle,
135 U. S. 1, 69-76; McNally v. Hil, 293 U. S. 131.
This liberalization of habeas corpus required federal
courts, when the issue was presented, to examine whether
a conviction occurred under such influence by mob spirit
as to deny due process. Frank v. Mangum, supra, 331, 335,
dissent 347. The power was called into play a few years
later to examine a state conviction under alleged community coercion; and this Court said that, if the facts set
out were true, the trial would not support a conviction.
Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86. In Mooney v. Holohan,
294 U. S. 103, 112, it was declared that the knowing use
of material perjured testimony by a state prosecutor would
make a trial unfair within the meaning of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
When the absence of counsel at a trial was urged as a
ground for a federal writ of habeas corpus, we held that
in federal courts a felony conviction without benefit of
counsel is subject to collateral attack because a violation
of the accused's constitutional right to the services of an
attorney unless he has intelligently waived that privilege.

States . . . to enforce the liberty of all persons under the operation
of the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery." See Cong.
Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 87, 4151. The debates on the bill in the
House and Senate, while mostly concerned with incidental matters,
indicated that jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus was not
intended to be limited merely to violations of. the Thirteenth Amendment. See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 4150, 4151, 4229;
Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., 730, 790.

Waley v. Johnston,316 U. S. 101, 104.
In state prosecutions a conviction on a plea of guilty,

or, after refusal of a proper request for counsel, because of
the accused's incapacity adequately to defend himself,
Williams v. Kaiser, 323 U. S. 471, will not support imprisonment. Such procedure violates the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution. See Tomkins v. Missouri, 323 U. S.485; Cochran v. Kansas, 316 U. S.255.
That Amendment is violated also when a defendant is
forced by a state to trial in such a way as to deprive him
of the effective assistance of counsel. Powell v. Alabama,
supra, 52, 58; House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42. Compare
Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S.114; Glasser v. United States,
315 U. S.60, 69-70. When the state does not provide corrective judicial process, the federal courts will entertain
habeas corpus to redress the violation of the federal constitutional right. White v. Ragen, 324 U. S.760. When
the corrective process is provided by the state but error,
in relation to the federal question of constitutional violation, creeps into the record, we have the responsibility to
review the state proceedings. Williams v. Kaiser, 323
U. S.471; Tomkins v. Missouri,supra.
Petitioner, a layman, set out the following allegations
in his petition. On March 16, 1936, at 4:15 p. m., the
petitioner, who had previously had a preliminary hearing,
was brought to Omaha from the federal penitentiary at
Leavenworth, Kansas. He was held incommunicado in
the Omaha jail except for a visit of fifteen minutes that
evening, 11 to 11:15 p. m., by the Public Defender and
his assistant. These officials tried to intimidate the petitioner to plead guilty. This petitioner refused to do,

to do with Petitioner's trial scheduled for trial the following morning." The next day petitioner was arraigned and
was read an information charging the murder to which he
pleaded "not guilty," I and "forthwith moved the Trial
Court orally for a continuance of twenty-four (24) hours
for the purpose of consulting counsel, examine the charge,
subpoena witnesses and prepare a defense, and forthwith
the Trial Court overruled the motion for a continuance
and ordered the trial to proceed at which time the Clerk
of the Court began to impanel the trial jury and had called
two or three jurymen, when Joseph M. Lovely, a Public
Official (Public Defender) and John N. Baldwin, his
assistant stepped forward and entered the case, without
ever having consulted your Petitioner, and without ever
having been assigned by the Trial Court to represent your
Petitibner.
"Your Petitioner had no consultation whatsoever with
either of the aforesaid Public Officials regarding his defense, they picked the jury and testimony was adduced
and a continuance or recess taken until the following
morning March 18 (Wednesday), 1936." Petitioner
claimed the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The record is either silent on or not inconsistent with
anything material in these allegations. Cf. Tomkins v.
Missouri,323 U. S. 485,487. There is no allegation or sug5Petitioner does not allege whether or not he had previously received a copy of the charge in conformity with the requirement of

the sheriff on receiving such copy shall serve the same upon the
defendant. No one shall be, without his assent, arraigned or called
on to answer to any indictment until one day shall have elapsed, after

gestion of ignorance of or unfamiliarity with procedural
or substantive law or sub-normal mentality.
These facts, if true, we think, set out a violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment. They are not conclusions of law.
They are not too vague. The charge upon which petitioner was convicted was murder in the first degree. He
had no advice of counsel prior to the calling of the jury.
His motion for continuance to examine the charge and
consult counsel was made without assistance. Homicide
has degrees in Nebraska. Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929, § 28-401
to § 28-403. There are difficulties in the application of the
rules. In re Application of Cole, 103 Neb. 802, 805, 174
N. W. 509; Bourne v. State, 116 Neb. 141, 216 N. W. 173.
The defendant needs counsel and counsel needs time. Cf.
Tomkins v. Missouri,323 U. S. 485, 488.
As the Supreme Court of Nebraska considered the motion for continuance on the merits,' no question of state
procedure for the reexamination of criminal convictions
arises. As to the issue on the motion for continuance, our
duty requires us to determine only whether or not the denial under the facts alleged violates due process. We think
there was an allegation that no effective assistance of
counsel was furnished in the critical time between the plea
of not guilty and the calling of the jury. Continuance
may or may not have been useful to the accused, but the
importance of the assistance of counsel in a serious criminal charge after arraignment is too large to permit speculation on its effect. We hold that denial of opportunity to
consult with counsel on any material step after indictment
or similar charge and arraignment violates the Fourteenth
Amendment.
Petitioner states a good cause of action when he alleges
facts which support his contention that through denial of
asserted constitutional rights he has not had the kind of

Fourteenth Amendment requires. This, of course, does
not mean that uncontradicted evidence of a witness must
be accepted as true on the hearing. Credibility is for the
trier of facts. The evidenceinay show that the charge was
served upon petitioner well in advance of the trial (see
note 5, supra) and that he had ample opportunity to consult with counsel and secure any needed witnesses. He
may have intelligently waived his constitutional rights.
