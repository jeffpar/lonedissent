have been no reasonable doubt in the judicial mind that
the 55Â¢ rate was neither confiscatory nor unjust and unreasonable. Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 258 U. S.,
165."
Considering the rules which the Court of Civil Appeals
declared applicable to the trial, quite evidently appellant
had no adequate opportunity to submit the law and facts
relevant to the controversy to a fair judicial tribunal for
determination according to its own independent judgment.
A tribunal required to accept weighty presumptions
against a defendant, resolve all doubts against it, pare
down valuations to the utmost and refuse a judgment in
its favor when the evidence is conflicting as to valuations
or other important elements, could not reach an independent judgment in respect of the law and facts-could not
arrive at a fair judicial determination. To us the
proceedings in the state courts seem an empty show.

WATER CO. v. MALTBIE.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Gay H. Brown, with whom Mr. Wendell P. Brown
was on the brief, for appellees.
PER CURIAM.

In a proceeding before the Public Service Commission
of the State of New York relating to rates for water supplied by appellant to the City of Utica and adjacent communities, the Commission, on June 28, 1933, after full
hearin'g and upon findings determining the fair value of
the property of appellant used and useful in rendering
service to its customers, the amount of annual operating
income required to yield a six per cent. return upon such
fair value, and the average operating income of the company for the years 1930 and 1931 (as adjusted to allow
for additional expense), directed appellant to file a schedule of rates which should effect a reduction in its annual
operating revenues of at least $120,000 per annum. The
Commission denied a rehearing with permission to apply
for an increase of rates if, after a reasonable time, it
should appear that a definite change in prices had
occurred.
In certiorari proceedings, appellant challenged these
determinations and orders as unlawful and confiscatory,
in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States. The Appellate Division, Third Department, of the Supreme Court of the State, sustained the
action of the Commission, 245 App. Div. 866; 282 N. Y.
S. 412, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the order of
the Appellate Division. 275 N. Y. 357; 9 N. E. 2d 961.
The case comes here on appeal which appellees move to
dismiss for the want of jurisdiction upon the ground that
no substantial federal question is involved.
1. Appellant contends that it is entitled to the exercise
of the independent judgment of a court as to the law and
the facts witn respect to the issue of confiscation and that

such a review has not been accorded because of the limitations imposed by the state practice in certiorari proceedings. 275 N. Y. at p. 370; 9 N. E. 2d 961. Appellant
has no standing to raise this question as appellant itself
sought review by certiorari and has not invoked the plenary jurisdiction of a court of equity and it does not appear that this remedy is not available under the state
law. Matter of ?ennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 211 App. Div. 253, 256; 207 N. Y. S. 599;
Matter of New Rochelle Water Co. v. Maltbie, 248 App.
Div. 66, 70; 289 N. Y. S. 388.
2. Upon the review of the Commission's orders by certiorari, only questions of law were open undo.' the state
practice, including the question whether there was evidence to sustain the findings of the Commission. 275
N. Y. at p. 366; 9 N. E. 2d 961. In that view no substantial federal question is presented. Cedar Rapids Gas
Co. v. Cedar Rapids, 223 U. S. 655, 668-670; Interstate
Commerce Comm'n v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 227
U. S. 88, 91, 92; New York ex rel. New York & Queens
Gas Co. v. McCall, 219 N. Y. 84, 88-90; 245 U. S. 345,

Dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO took no part in the consideration
and decision of this case.
