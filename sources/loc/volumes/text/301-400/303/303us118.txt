Mr. Arnold Raum, with whom Solicitor General Reed,
Assistant Attorney General Morris, and Messrs. Sewall
Key and George H. Foster were on the brief, for the
United States.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioners- right (as executors) to an income tax refund depends upon whether a dividend paid by the Foster Lumber Company in 1930 is tax exempt as representing corporate earnings accumulated before March 1, 1913.

FOSTER v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

This dividend is taxable under the Revenue Act of 1928 1
if paid from earnings accumulated after 1913. The Court
of Claims found the dividend taxable.!
Petitioners contend that the 1930 dividend was traceable to the Company's pre-1913 accumulations because
its post-1913 earnings had been exhausted by a distribution in 1929. The circumstances of the 1929 distribution
and the 1930 dividend were:
The Foster Lumber Company was a family corporation, organized in 1896 with a capital stock of $200,000.
March 1, 1913, when the federal income tax became
effective, the increased value of the company's property
and its undistributed profits were more than $3,725,000.
Petitioners insist that a distribution of $1,025,000 on
October 10, 1929, completely exhausted the $330,578.98
total undistributed profits which had accumulated since
March 1, 1913. This 1929 distribution, however, was not
a dividend. It was paid by the company to cancel and
liquidate five hundred shares of its own $100 par value
stock and represented payment of $2,050 per share, the
agreed value as of March, 1913. February 11, 1930, the
company declared a $225,000 dividend and this refund
is sought for the tax paid upon a shareholder's part of
this dividend. Between October 10, 1929 (the date of
the $1,025,000 stock purchase) and February 11, 1930
(the date of .the $225,000 dividend) the company's earnings amounted to only $82,758.17. Petitioners take the
position that only $82,758.17 of this $225,000 dividend
of 1930 can be taxed, urging that the balance is tax
exempt because it must be treated as representing pre1913 accumulations.
Subsection (a) of ยง 115 of the Revenue Act of 1928
defines "dividend,". for income tax purposes, as "any

distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders,
... out of its earnings or profits accumulated after
February 28, 1913."
Subsection (b) of this income tax law exempts corporate earnings and profits accumulated before March 1,
1913. This subsection also provides that for income tax
purposes all distributions are paid from "the most recently accumulated earnings or profits." The obvious
purpose of the provision was to prevent corporations
from attributing dividend payments to pre-1913 accumulations to avoid taxes imposed upon profits earned after
March, 1913. Petitioners' contention is that the $330,578.98 earned after 1913, as "the most recently accumulated earnings or profits" was automatically exhausted in
part payment of the $1,025,000 stock purchase and thus
escaped taxation. In this manner, pre-1913 corporate
non-taxable earnings could be used to avoid taxes on
corporate profits earned after 1913.
We have previously said that Subsections (a) and (b),
supra, construed together, disclose legislative purpose
that pre-1913 accumulations shall not be distributed "in
such a fashion as to permit profits accumulated after that
date to escape taxation." ' Petitioners ask that we now
construe these provisions in a way which would facilitate
the escape of such profits from taxation and thereby defeat the undoubted purpose of Congress. We are urged
so to expand and broaden an exemption granted by Congress as a "concession to the equity of stockholders" 5
that such concession would in reality serve to nullify
and defeat the tax on corporate profits earned after 1913.
Courts should construe laws in harmony with the legislative intent and seek to carry out legislative purpose.
With respect to the tax provisions under consideration,
there is no uncertainty as to the legislative purpose to

tax post-1913 corporate earnings. We must not give
effect to any contrivance which would defeat a tax Congress plainly intended to impose. The use of bookkeeping terms and accounting forms and devices cannot be
permitted to devitalize valid tax laws.
The transaction under which this Company paid
$1,025,000 cash for its own stock of $50,000 par value
does not fall within Subsections (a) and (b) of ยง 115.
Its character and effect are determined by Subsections (c)
and (h) which relate to distributions in complete or partial corporate liquidation.'
Subsection (c), governing this stock purchase transacIn the case of amounts distribtion, directs that "...
uted in partial liquidation . . . the part of such distribution which is properly chargeable to capital account shall
not be considered a distribution of ,earnings or profits
within the meaning of subsection (b) . . . for the purpose of determining the taxability of subsequent distributions . . ."7
This provision of' the Revenue Act of 1928 also substantially obtained in the Revenue Act of 1924.8 Prior
even to the 1924 Act, this Court had determined that, for
income tax purposes, earnings of a corporation accumulated prior to 1913 are to be considered capitalY In the

light of these decisions, Congress obviously intended that
corporate funds distributed under the circumstances here
shown should be "chargeable to capital account" and that
stock purchases of the type here involved should not be
considered "for the purpose of determining the taxability
of subsequent distributions by the corporation."
Acceptance of petitioners' contention would permit corporate profits accumulated since March, 1913 to escape
taxation, contrary to the provisions and purpose of the
1928 Revenue Act. The bookkeeping mingling of corporate earnings and profits made before and after March
1, 1913, does not alter the Act nor can such action render
taxable profits non-taxable. In this case, the distribution
of $1,025,000 was "properly chargeable to capital account"
and was not paid out of profits earned since March 1,
1913.
The $1,025,000, paid for the Company's stock, cannot,
therefore, be considered "for the purpose of determining
the taxability of subsequent distributions by the corporation" and this purchase of stock did not exhaust any part
of the $330,578.98 profits accumulated since 1913. It
follows that the total dividend of 1930 received by petitioners' decedent is taxable and the judgment of the Court
of Claims is
