CERTIORARI,

302 U. S. 667, to review a judgment affirm-

ing a judgment against the petitioner, 117 N. J. L. 40;
186 Atl. 689, in a suit to enforce against him a statutory
liability based on his refusal to honor a writ of attachment.
Messrs. Clement K. Corbin and Edward A. Markley
submitted on brief for petitioner.
Mr. Aaron Gordon, with whom Mr. John W. Ockford
was on the brief, foe respondent.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The issue is whether the master of a vessel is entitled
to the benefit of § 12 of the Act of March 4, 1915,' exempting wages of seamen from attachment.
The respondent recovered judgment against one Findlay, the captain of the tug Waverly, a registered vessel
of the United States operating in New York Harbor. Under a state statute Findlay's wages due from his employer, the Erie Railroad Company, were attached by
the service of an order on the petitioner, superintendent
of the marine department of the railroad company. It
is not disputed that if Findlay's wages were subject to
c. 153, 38 Stat. 1164, 1169; U. S. C. Tit. 46, § 601.

garnishment the order, and its service upon the petitioner,
were regular and lawful. The petitioner asserted that
the federal statute exempted Findlay's wages from execution and refused to honor the order. Thereupon action
was instituted by respondent against petitioner, pursuant to local statute which in such a case renders the
recusant officer liable for the amount of the judgment.
On the trial petitioner's motions for a nonsuit and for
a directed verdict were denied and judgment went for the
respondent. The petitioner successively appealed to the
Supreme Court and the Court of Errors and Appeals.
The judgment was affirmed.- Because of the importance
of the question we granted the writ of certiorari.
The words of the statute are: "No wages due or accruing
to any seaman or apprentice shall be subject to attachment or arrestment from any court . . ." While, within
the purview of some of the acts concerning shipping, a
master is included in the class designated seamen, in others
the expression excludes the master.' In this case we must
determine whether Congress intended, by § 12 of the Act
of 1915, to extend to a master the exemption of seamen's
wages from garnishment. Decision is aided by a consideration of the provision in its original setting. It was
first enacted as § 61 of the Act of June 7, 1872,' which
authorized the appointment of shipping commissioners
to protect merchant seamen and to superintend their
shipment and.discharge. Scrutiny of the Act as a whole
leads to the view that in all matters affecting wages seamen were treated as a class which excluded masters; 'and
this conclusion is required by § 65,' which is in part:
"That to avoid doubt in the construction of this act, every
person having the command of any ship belonging to any

Opinion of the Court.

citizen of the United States shall, within the meaning
and for the purposes of this act, be deemed and taken to
be the 'master' of such ship; and that every person (apprentices excepted) who shall be employed or engaged to
serve in any capacity on board the same shall be deemed
and taken to be a 'seaman' within the meaning and for
the purposes of this act; .
In its present form the pertinent language of § 12-of
the Act of March 4, 1915, is identical with that originally
employed in § 61 of the Act of 1872, which became § 4536
of the Revised Statutes. Section 12 of the Act of March
4, 1915, re~nacted the section, adding a provision to make
it applicable to fishermen employed on fishing vessels as
well as to seamen. The statute is now § 601 of Title 46
of the United States Code.
Section 65 of the Act of 1872 became § 4612 of the
Revised Statutes and, with immaterial amendments, now
is § 713 of Title 46 of the United States Code. Various
other provisions of the Act of 1872 embodied in the Revised Statutes, either in their original form or as amended
by the Act of March 4,1915, and by the Merchant Marine
Act of 1920,6 now appear, with provisions of other statutes,
as sections of Title 46 of the Code. In compiling it the
original language of § 65 of the Act of 1872 "To avoid
doubt in the construction of this act," was, in § 713 of
Title 46, changed to read: "In the construction of this
chapter." The change in phraseology has given rise to
the impression that the definitions found in § 713 apply
indifferently to the various statutes affecting merchant
shipping.7 To avoid confusion in determining the applicability of the definitions contained in that section, it is
necessary to trace to their origin the substantive sections
to which it may be deemed to refer, and to construe them
in the light of the evident intent of Congress in the use

of the word "seaman" in the original Act. Since the pertinent provision of § 12 of the Act of 1915 here under
consideration and the definitions of § 713 of Title 46 of
the Code were commonly derived from the Act of 1872
and have not been materially changed, they must be read
in collocation, and when this is done, the intent of Congress to exclude masters from the exemption accorded
seamen is plain.8
The petitioner contends that § 61 of the Act of 1872
was modified by the Act of June 9, 1874,' whereby the
provisions of the Act of 1872 were made inapplicable to
vessels in the coastwise trade. The latter Act has been
carried into the Code as § 544 of Title 46, and it is said
that the repeal of § 61 by the Act of March 4, 1915, and
the reenactment of the section, slightly altered, did not
operate to repeal the Act of 1874. In view of our decision
that a master is not within the exemption granted by § 12
of the Act of 1915 we need not pass upon this question.
The judgment is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
