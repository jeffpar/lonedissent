members of some other class, religion, race or color demand that he give them precedence.*
Design thus to promote strife, encourage trespass and
stimulate intimidation, ought not to be admitted where,
as here, not plainly avowed. The ultimate result of the
view now approved to the very people whom present petitioners claim to represent, it may be, is prefigured by the
grievous plight of minorities in lands where the law has
become a mere political instrument.

Messrs. Willianm R. &,ians and Randolph Barton, Jr.
for respondent.

M.

JUSTICE BLACK

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Revenue Act of 1928' imposed a tax upon the
annual "net income" of corporations. It defined "net
income" as "gross income . . . less the deductions allowed . . . ," and "gross income" as including "gains,
profits and income derived from . . . trades . . . or sales,
or dealings in property, . . . or gains or profits and income . . . from any source whatever." "
Section 112 of the Act exempts certain gains which
are realized from a "reorganization" similar to, or in the
nature of, a corporate merger or consolidation. Under
this section, such gains are not taxed if one corporation.
pursuant to a "plan of reorganization" exchanges its property "solely for stock or securities, in another corporation
a party to the reorganization." But, when a corporation
not only receives "stock or securities" in exchange for its
property, but also receives "other property or money" in
carrying ou.t a "plan of reorganization,"
"(1) If the corporation receiving such other property
or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized
from the exchange, but
"(2) If the corporation receiving such other property
or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan
of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation
shall be recognized [taxed] . .
In this case, there was a merger or "reorganization" of
the Borden Company and the Hendler Creamery Company, Inc., resulting in gains of more than six million
dollars to the Hendler Company, Inc., a corporation of
'Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Statt. 791, § 13.

which respondent is transferee. The Court of Appeals.
believing there was an exemption under § 112, affirmed
the judgment of the District Court ' holding all Hendler
gains non-taxable.
This controversy between the government and respondent involves the assumption and payment-pursuant to
the plan of reorganization-by the Borden Company of
$534,297.40 bonded indebtedness of the Hendler Creamery
Co., Inc. We are unable to agree with the conclusion
reached by the courts below that the gain to the Hendler
Company, realized by the Borden Company's payment,
was exempt from taxation under § 112.
It was contended below and it is urged here that since
the Hendler Company did not actually receive the money
with which the Borden Company discharged the former's
indebtedness, the Hendler Company's gain of $534,297.40
is not taxable. The transaction, however, under which
the Borden Company assumed and paid the debt and obligation of the Hendler Company is to be regarded in
substance as though the $534,297.40 had been paid directly
to the tlendler Company. The Hendler Company was
the beneficiary of the discharge of its indebtedness. Its
gain was as real and substantial as if the money had been
paid it and then paid over by it to its creditors. The
discharge of liability by the payment of the Hendler
Company's indebtedness constituted income to the {endler Company and is to be treated as such."
Section 112 provides no exemption for gains-resulting
from corporate "reorganization"-neither received as
"stocks or securities," nor received as "money or other
property" and distributed to stockholders under the plan
of reorganization. In Minnesota Tea Co. v. Helvering,

Syllabus.

302 U. S. 609, it was said that this exemption "contemplates a distribution to stockholders, and not payment
to creditors." The very statute upon which the taxpayer
relies provides that "If the corporation receiving such
other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to
the corporation shall be recognized [taxed] . .
Since this gain or income of $534,297.40 of the Hendler
Company was neither received as "stock or securities"
nor distributed to its stockholders "in pursuance of the

plan of reorganization" it was not exempt and is taxable
gain as defined in the 1928 Act.

This $534,297.40 gain

to the taxpayer does not fall within the exemptions of
§ 112, and the judgment of the court below is
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOzO and MR. JUSTICE REED took no
part in the consideration or decision of this case.
