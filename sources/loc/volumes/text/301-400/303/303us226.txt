RE-

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA.

No.,63.

Argued November 19, 1937. Reargued January 3, 1938.Decided February 28, 1938.

1. Lack of jurisdiction of the District Court over the subject-matter
can not be waived by the parties; when discovered on appeal,

dismissal of the bill must be ordered. P. 229.
2. The jurisdiction to set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, conferred upon the District Court of three judges by
the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, does not apply
to negative orders. P. 232.
3. An order of the Interstate Commerce Commissign declining,
upon re-examination, to increase the compensation for carrying
mail fixed by an earlier order pursuant to the Railway Mail Pay
Act, is a negative order. P. 234.
4. Orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission fixing the compensation payable by the Government to railroads for carrying
the mails, even if affirmative orders, are not subject to the extraordinary remedy of the Urgent Deficiencies Act, since they are not
within the reasons for it, namely, to guard against ill-considered
action by a single judge and to avert delays ordinarily incident
to litigation, in cases of wide public interest. P. 234.
Denial of jurisdiction under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, leaves
,pen other ways to judicial review of orders respecting railway
-mail pay. P. 238.
5. A suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set aside an order
concerning mail pay is not primarily against the Commission,

but is a suit against the United States.

The United States can

not be sued without authority specifically conferred. The Railway Mail Pay Act does not confer that authority. P. 238.
Reversed.

JUSTICE

BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

court.
The sole question requiring decision is one of statutory
construction: The Railway Mail Pay Act of July 28, 1916,
c. 261, § 5, 39 Stat. 412, 425, 429, 430, provides that the
Interstate Commerce Commission "shall establish by order a fair, reasonable rate or compensation to be received" by railroads for carrying the mail; 1 and authorizes the Commission to modify the order upon a "re-examination." The Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22,
1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220 (amending Act of June
18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539) declares that district courts
shall have jurisdiction "of cases brought to enjoin, set
1 "The

Postmaster General is authorized and directed to adjust

the compensation to be paid to railroad companies for the transportation and handling of the mails and furnishing facilities and services
in connection therewith upon the conditions and the rates hereinafter
provided."'- 39 U. S. C. § 524.
"All railway common carriers are hereby required to transport
such mail matter as may be offered for transportation by the United
States in the manner, under the conditions, and with the service
prescribed by the Postmaster General and shall be entitled to receive
fair and reasonable compensation for such transportation and for

the service connected 'therewith." 39 U. S. C. § 541,

aside, annul or suspend in whole or in part any order of the
Interstate Commerce Commission." May suit be brought
under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set aside an order
refusing, upon "re-examination," to increase the allowance for railway mail compensation theretofore made to
this carrier?
The suit was brought,' under the Urgent Deficiencies
Act, in the federal court for southern Georgia, by the
receivers of the Georgia & Florida Railroad against the
United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission,
to set aside an order made May 10, 1933, under the Railway Mail Pay Act, Railway Mail Pay, Georgia & Florida
R. Co., 192 I. C. C. 779; and to grant a permanent injunction. By that order the Commission had denied
upon a "re-examination" an application further to increase the compensation allowed by the order of July 10,
1928. Railway Mail Pay, 144 I. C. C. 675. The 1928
order had, upon a "re-examination," increased the compensation originally fixed by order of December 23, 1919.
Railway Mail Pay, 56 I. C. C. 1. As grounds for setting
aside the order of May 10, 1933, the receivers alleged,
among other things, that the order was unlawful, because
the finding that the existing rates were fair and reasonable was without evidence to support it and contrary
to the evidence and that the order will violate the Fifth
Amendment by taking property without just compensation.
The jurisdiction of the court was not challenged; and
the case was heard by three judges on the merits. A
decree was rendered setting aside as unlawful the order
of May 10, 1933, and directing the Commission to take
further action. Additional hearings were then had by
the Commission; and on February 4, 1936, it again declined to order any increase over that which had been
allowed July 10, 1928. Railway Mail Pay, Georgia &
Florida R. Co., 214 I. C. C. 66. The last order of the

Opinion of the Court.

Commission was assailed by a supplemental bill on the
same grounds as that assailed in the original bill. The
juisdiction of the court was not challenged; the case
was again heard on the merits by three judges; and a decree was entered setting aside the order of February 4,
1936, and directing the Commission to take "such further
action in the premises as the law requires in view of the
annulment and setting aside of" the order.
From that decree the United States and the Interstate
Commerce Commission have appealed to this Court.
Here, although answering to the merits, they challenged
the jurisdiction of the District Court. Since lack of jurisdiction of a federal court touching the subject matter
of the litigation cannot be waived by the parties, we
must upon this appeal examine the contention; and, if
we conclude that the District Court lacked jurisdiction
of the cause, direct that the bill be dismissed. United
States v. Corrick, 298 U. S.435, 440. We at first thought
that the District Court had jurisdiction, and ordered a
reargument of the case on the merits. But, upon further consideration of the jurisdictional question, we are
of opinion that the remedy provided by the Urgent Deficiencies Act is not applicable to this order.
First. The Railway Mail Pay Act terminated the system theretofore prevailing of service under voluntary
contracts.2 As embodied in United States Code, Title 39,
:Prior to the Act of 1916, the carriage of mail by railroads-with
the exception of some aided by land grant-was held to be not compulsory "at adequate compensation to be judicially determined,"

under contracts voluntarily entered into with the Postmaster General.

their right to compensation, which is to be fixed by the
Commission.
"The Interstate Commerce Commission is hereby empowered and directed to fix and determine from time to
time the fair and reasonable rates and compensation for
the transportation of such mail matter by railway common carriers and the services connected therewith, prescribing the method or methods by weight, or space, or
both, or otherwise, for ascertaining such rate or compensation, and to publish the same, and orders so made and

§ 551.
Eleven sections of the act deal with the procedure on
hearings before the Commission.- No provision is made
for a judicial review. But provision is made for administrative review by "re~xamination"'of an order.
"Either the Postmaster General or any such carrier
may at any time after the lapse of six months from the
entry of the order assailed apply for a rexamination and
thereupon substantially similar proceedings shall be had
with respect to the rate or rates for service covered by
said application, provided said carrier or carriers have an
interest therein." 39 U. S. C. § 553.
There have been many administrative reviews by "reexamination."
The case at bar appears to be the only

Section 544 provides: "The procedure for the ascertainment of
the rates and compensation shall be as provided in sections 545 to
554 of this title"; and § 554 provides: "For the purposes of Sections
524 to 568 of this title the Interstate Commerce Commission is
hereby vested with all the powers which it is authorized by law to
exercise in the investigation and ascertainment of the justness and
reasonableness of freight, passenger, and express rates to be paid
by private shippers."

made by the Commission December 23, 1919. Railway Mail Pay,

rates on a space basis, with higher rates for certain short lines less

instance in which an attempt has been made to set aside
a mail order by suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act.
Second. The Urgent Deficiencies Act provides a method
of judicial review of orders of the Interstate Commerce
Commission possessing the following extraordinary features: (1) The original hearing in the district' court is
not before a single judge, but before three, of whom one
must be a circuit judge; (2) From the decree of the district court as so constituted a direct appeal to the Supreme Court is granted as of right, instead of a review by
a circuit court of appeals; (3) Upon both the trial court
and the Supreme Court rests the obligation to give the
case precedence over others. These features were first
introduced by the Expediting Act of 1903, 32 Stat. 823,
for suits by the United States to enforce the antitrust
and commerce laws. They were extendedby the Hepburn Act of 1906, § 5, 34 Stat. 584, 590, 592, to suits to
enforce or to set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. When that jurisdiction was vested in the
Commerce Court provisions with like effect were proLine Railroads, 120 I. C. C. 439, on reconsideration, 151 I. C. C. 734;
Railway Mail Pay, Winston-Salem Southbound Ry., 123 I. C. C. 33;

734; Railway Mail Pay, Georgia & Florida R., 192 I. C. C. 779, on
rehearing, 214 I. C. C. 66.
A number of other decisions relating to railway mail pay have
also been made. Railway Mail Pay, Certain Short Lines, 165 I. C. C.

Opinion of 111e Court.

vided for cases coming-before it. 36 Stat. 539. To its
jurisdiction the district court succeeded, with these features, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act.
In the opinion of Congress jurisdiction with the extraordinary features of the Urgent Deficiencies Act was justified by the character of the cases to which it appliedcases of public importance because of the widespread effect
of the decisions thereof. In such cases Congress sought to
guard against ill-considered action by a single judge and
to avert the delays ordinarily incident to litigation. In
construing the Act, this Court concluded that despite the
broad language used in the Commerce Court Act, Congress
could not have intended to include in this special jurisdiction suits to set aside every kind of order issued by the
Commission. For substantially every decision, and every
other kind of action by the Commission is expressed in,
or is followed by, an order; and many of the orders are
obviously not of such public importance and widespread
effect as to justify, in cases affecting them, the extraordinary features of the Urgent Deficiencies Act.
The Commerce Court had (36 Stat. 539) jurisdiction
"over all cases of the following kinds":
"First. All cases for the enforcement, otherwise than by
adjudication and collection of a forfeiture or penalty or
by infliction of criminal punishment, of any order of the
Interstate Commerce Commission other than for the payment of money.
"Second. Cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or
suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate
Commerce Commission. .

....

This Court concluded that, as the intent of Congress
was "to relieve parties in whole or in part from the duty
of obedience to orders which are found to be illegal," there
was jurisdiction to set aside only those kinds of orders
which there was jurisdiction to enforce; that a distinction
must be drawn between "affirmative" and "negative"

orders; and that jurisdiction under the Commerce Court
Act was applicable only to "affirmative" orders. Procter
& Gamble Co. v. United States, 225 U. S.282; Hooker v.
Knapp, 225 U. S.302. Since the abolition of the Commerce Court, that rule has been consistently followed in
cases brought under the Urgent Deficiencies Act. Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, 243 U. S. 412; Piedmont & NorthernRy. Co. v. United States, 280 U. S. 469;
Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 283 U. S. 235; United
States v. Corrick, 298 U. S. 435. Compare Delaware)&
Hudson Co. v. United States, 266 U.. S. 438; United States
v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., 273 U. S. 299.
The order of February 4, 1936, here assailed, does not
command either the Government or the Railroad to do
anything. It is simply a refusal, upon a second "re-examination" of the order of July 11, 1928, further to increase the compensation thereby awarded upon a "re-examination" of the compensation originally awarded by the
order made December 23, 1919. The order assailed, being
a refusal to change the existing status, was a "negative"
order. The District Court lacked jurisdiction to set it
aside, and should have dismissed the bill.
Third. Congress cannot be'assumed to have made the
extraordinary remedy of the Urgent Deficiencies Act applicable for the determination of the validity of railway
mail pay orders, even if "affirmative." The issue here is
whether the existing mail revenue of $35,728 should be
increased for the year by $31,227. There is no wide public interest in its speedy determination. There is no
danger of temporarily interrupting the mail service
through the improvident issue of an injunction by a single
judge. Only the method or amount of payments currently to be made would be affected. Such orders are
in character unlike those under the Boiler Inspection Act,
36 Stat. 913, as amended, 38 Stat. 1192, 43 Stat. 659, and
the Inland Waterways Corporation Act, 43 Stat. 360, 361,

as amended, 45 Stat. 978, 48 Stat. 968, of which jurisdiction was taken although the statutes contained no provision for judicial review.'
In Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, 277 U. S.
172, we held that there was not jurisdiction under the
Urgent Deficiencies Act of a suit to set aside an order of
the Interstate Commerce Commission made under Title
II of the Transportation Act of 1920 determining the
amount due a railroad on the Government's guaranty of
income for the period following relinquishment of'federal
control. And in United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake
R. Co., 273 U. S. 299, we held that there was not jurisdiction under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of a suit to set
aside a final order under the Valuation Act, even though
that statute was enacted as an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act itself. 37 Stat. 701, as amended, 41
Stat. 456, 474, 493, 42 Stat. 624.0
In recent years the field of administrative determination has been widely extended; and the duty of making
many of these determinations has been imposed upon
the Interstate Commerce Commission.' Some of the

Opinion of the Court.

Communications Commission).8 The orders for which
review is provided by each of these statutes are like the
orders under the Interstate Commerce Act fixing rates
payable by shippers. Improper injunctive relief of such
orders or delay in final determination of their validity
may seriously affect the public interest by preventing
or obstructing action under those statutes.
While the compensation fixed in a railway mail pay
order is ordinarily measured by a rate, the ultimate
question determined by the Commission is, as in the
Great Northern case, the proper compensation to be paid
by the Government to the railroad for services and the
use of its property-the quantum meruit for carrying the
mail. There is nothing in the history of the Railway
Mail Pay Act which requires that the Urgent Deficiencies
Act be made applicable to the determination of the validity of such orders.
8 Compare

Merchant Marine Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1985, 1967

(United States Maritime Commission). A similar procedure has also
been provided for certain suits to enjoin the enforcement or operation of state and federal statutes on the ground that they are unconstitutional. Judicial Code, § 266, 36 Stat. 557, 1162, as amended, 37
Stat. 1013, 43 Stat. 938; Judiciary Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 751, 752.
11The provision calling for the Interstate Commerce Commission to
fix the rates at which the mail is to be carried was introduced in the
Senate as an amendment to the bill by Senator Cummins of Iowa.
In answer to questions as to "whether the amendment provides for
an appeal in this case as in other rate-making cases before the Interstate Commerce Commission," he stated: "I think it would permit,
the same review. ...
There would be the same remedy precisely
tinder my amendment for the railway companies that now exists in
the case of the establishment of a rate for a private shipper ...
It is provided for in just the same way the present law does." 53
Cong. Rec., 9694-95. No further reference to judicial review occurs
in the debates on this provision in either House; and no reference
to judicial review was made in the report of the Coirnittee of either
House, nor in that of the Conference Committee whose recommendations were adopted. See Sen. Rep. 459, H. R. Rep. 91, H. R. Rep.

Fourth. The absence in the Railway Mail Pay Act of
a provision for judicial review and the denial of jurisdiction under the Urgent Deficiencies Act do not preclude
every character of judicial review. If the Commission
makes the appropriate finding of reasonable compensation but fails, because of an alleged error of law, to order
payment of the full amount which the railroad believes
is payable under the finding, the Court of Claims has
jurisdiction of an action for the balance, as the claim
asserted is one founded upon a law of Congress. Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 271 U. S. 603.
Compare United States v. New York Central R. Co., 279
U. S. 73, affirming 65 Ct. Cl. 115, 121.10 And since railway mail service is compulsory, the Court of Claims
would, under the general provisions of the Tucker Act,
have jurisdiction also of an action for additional compensation if an order is confiscatory. United States v. Great
Falls Mfg. Co., 112 U. S. 645; North American Transportation & Trading Co. v. United States, 253 U. S. 330,
333; Jacobs v. United States, 290 U. S. 13, 16. Moreover, as district courts have jurisdiction of every suit at
law or in equity "arising under the postal laws," 28
U. S. C., § 41 (6), suit would lie under their general
jurisdiction if the Commission is alleged to have acted
in excess of its authority, or otherwise illegally. Compare Powell v. United States, 300 U. S. 276, 288, 289.
But a suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set aside
an order concerning mail pay is not primarily one against
the Commission. Primarily, it is a suit against the

COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 352. Argued January 14, 17, 1938.-Decided February 28, 1938.
Cattle in a railway car were brought to the place where they were

to be unloaded for water, feed and rest, as required by the Act
of June 29, 1906, arriving there before the period allowed by

that the carrier's yardmaster, aware of the situation, negligently

failed to notify another employee of the carrier whose duty it,

was to unload them. Held that the carrier "knowingly and willfully" failed to comply with the statute and was subject to the
