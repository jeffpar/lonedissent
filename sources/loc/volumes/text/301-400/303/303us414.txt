Petitioners suggest that the rule just laid down may
have the effect of penalizing the unsecured creditors for
the precaution of the receiver in litigating doubtful claims
asserted against segregated assets. This could be true
only where the interest accruing to the secured creditors
during the pendency of the litigation exceeds the appreciation in value of, and the income from, the security.
And since in many cases if the receiver is successful his
conduct of the litigation will inure to the advantage of
the general creditors, they may fairly be charged with the
expenses of contesting the claim, including interest by
way of damages. Cf. Chemical National Bank v. Armstrong, supra, 59 Fed. at 384.

Under § 610 of the Revenue Act of 1928, barring suits in the name
of the United States to recover -amounts erroneously refunded,
unless brought within two years "after the making of such refund," the period of limitation begins to rue, not from the time of

of its payment. P. 416.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Under the Revenue Act of 1928,1 forbidding suit by
the United States to recover an erroneous tax refund unless brought "within two years after the making of such
refund," 'does the two year limitation begin when the
refund is allowed or when it is paid?
The Court of Appeals affirmed 2 the District Court's
judgment holding the Government barred by this limitation because the present suit was not brought within
two years after the Commissioner allowed the refund by
signing the schedule of over-assessments.
The facts show that:
March 15, 1932, the Commissioner erroneously approved a refund of taxes paid by respondent for the year
1929. April 30, 1932, a check was mailed to the taxpayer
for this erroneous refund. April 26, 1934, more than two
years after the allowance of the refund, but lessr than two
years after actual payment, the Government brought
this suit to recover the erroneous refund.
The Government by appropriate action can recover
funds which its agents have wrongfully, erroneously, or
illegally paid.'

the United States to sue in such a case. The right to sue
is independent of statute, . . ." United States v. Bank

1928 Act, relied upon as barring recovery of this erroneous and unwarranted tax refund, does not grant the
Government a new right,, but is a limitat*ion of the
Government's long-established right to sue for money
wrongfully or erroneously paid from the public treasury.
Ordinarily, recovery of Government funds, paid by mistake to one having no just right to keep the funds, is not
barred by the passage of time. There is no contention
here that respondent has any right to retain this refund
erroneously paid by the Government. His defense is
that the statutory bar prevents recovery. The Government's right to recover funds, from a person who received
them by mistake and without right, is not barred unless
Congress has "clearly manifested its intention"' to raise
a statutory barrier.
Section 610-urged by respondent as a statutory barrier-requires that the Government bring suit "before the
expiration of two years after the making of such [erroneous] refund. . . ." Respondent contends that the
Revenue Act of 1932 0 indicated Congressional intent to
designate the date of allowance of a refund (the date the
Commissioner signs the schedule of over-assessments) as
the date of refund for computing the period of limitations
under § 610. The 1932 Act provides:
"Where the Commissioner has (before or after June 6,
1932) signed a schedule of overassessments in respect of
any internal revenue tax imposed' by [the Revenue Act
of 1932] or any prior revenue Act, the date on which
he first signs such schedule (if after May 28, 1928)
shall be considered as the date of allowance of refund or
credit in respect of such tax." This Act in no manner

relates to limitations on suits for erroneous refunds. It
has no purpose in common with § 610 of the 1928 Act.
The 1932 Act throws no light on the meaning of § 610.
Section 610 is clear when its words are given their commonly accepted import. "Congress may well be supposed
to have used language in accordance with the common
understanding."' Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed., Unabridged) defines "refund" as "that which
is refunded" and defines the transitive verb as: "to return (money) in restitution, repayment . . ." Only by
ignoring the common understanding of words could "making . . . [a] refund" be considered synonymous with
"allowing a refund."
That Congress had in mind the separate and distinct
meanings of these two expressions is clearly cdemonstrated
in House Report No. 2, 70th Congress, 1st Session, p. 34,
35, containing the Committee Report on the Revenue
Act of 1928:
"The section (610) provides that any erroneous refund,
. . . may be recovered by suit brought in the name of
the United States if such suit is begun within two years
after the making of the refund."
Immediately following, in referring to § 614, the Report
stated:
"The principal change made in existing law is that in
the case of a refund the interest period now terminates
with the allowance of "the refund, a date which often precedes the actual making of the refund . . ."
The Commissioner's signature on a schedule of overassessments does not finally establish a claimant's right
to a refund and does not preclude further investigation
and consideration of the claim. The Commissioner could
later take his signature from, the schedule and as pointed
out by this Court might--even after a check was signed

and mailed-cancel the payment and revoke the authority
of payment erroneously made.8
It would require language so clear as -to leave room for
no other reasonable construction in order to induce the
belief that Congress. intended a statute of limitations to
begin to run before the right barred by it has accrued.
Obviously, the Government had no right to sue this taxpayer to recover money before money had been paid to
him. The construction urged by respondent would allow
the statute of limitations to begin to run against recovery
on an erroneous payment before any such payment is
made. As said by a House Committee in reporting on a
statute of limitations contained in a revenue act,9 "Logically the period of limitation should run from the date
of payment, since it is at that time that the right ac=.
crues."
We are of opinlon" that Congress did not intend the
limitations of § 610 to run against the Government until
the Government's right "has accrued in a shape to be
effectually enforced." 10
This statute does not begin to run against the Government when a claim is erroneously allowed. It begins to
run from the date of payment. The judgment below is
not in accord with this constructin of the statute
and is
Reversed.
