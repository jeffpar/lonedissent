HUMPHREY v. SMITH.
Opinion of the Court.

HUMPHREY, WARDEN, v. SMITH.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 457.

Argued March 30, 1949.-Decided April 25, 1949.

1. In habeas corpus proceedings to review court-martial judgments,
courts cannot pass on the guilt or innocence of persons convicted
by courts-martial. P. 696.
2. Failure to conduct a pre-trial investigation in the manner prescribed by the 70th Article of War does not deprive a general
court-martial of jurisdiction nor subject its judgment to invalidation in a habeas corpus proceeding. Pp. 696-701.
170 F. 2d 61, reversed.

In a habeas corpus proceeding challenging the validity
of a conviction by a court-martial, a federal district court
denied relief. 72 F. Supp. 935. The Court of Appeals
reversed. 170 F. 2d 61. This Court granted certiorari.
336 U. S. 908. Reversed, p. 701.
Robert W. Ginnane argued the cause for petitioner.
With him on the brief were Solicitor General Perlman,
Assistant Attorney General Campbell, Robert S. Erdahl
and Philip R. Monahan.
Daniel F. Mathews argued the cause and filed a brief
for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

The respondent, Bernard W. Smith, an American soldier, was convicted by an Army court-martial for rape
of one woman and assault with intent to rape another
in violation of the 92d and 93d Articles of War. 10
U. S. C. §§ 1564 and 1565. His punishment was dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances,

and imprisonment for life. Army reviewing authorities
approved the conviction and sentence, but the President
reduced the punishment to sixteen years' imprisonment.
This habeas corpus proceeding was brought in a District
Court challenging the validity of the conviction. The
District Court denied relief. 72 F. Supp. 935. The
Court of Appeals reversed, ordering respondent's discharge. 170 F. 2d 61. We granted certiorari because
the petition raises questions concerning important phases
of court-martial statutory powers and the scope of judicial review of court-martial convictions.
We may at once dispose of the contention that the
respondent should not have been convicted on the evidence offered. That evidence was in sharp dispute. But
our authority in habeas corpus proceedings to review
court-martial judgments does not permit us to pass on
the guilt or innocence of persons convicted by courtsmartial.'
It is contended that the court-martial was without
jurisdiction to try respondent. If so the court-martial
exceeded its lawful authority and its judgment can be invalidated despite the limited powers of a court in habeas
corpus proceedings.2 The soundness of this contention
depends upon an interpretation of the 70th Article of
War, the pertinent part of which is set out below.' It

3 "No charge will be referred to a general court martial for trial

been made. This investigation will include inquiries as to the truth
of the matter set forth in said charges, form of charges, and what
disposition of the case should be made in the interest of justice
and discipline. At such investigation full opportunity shall be given
to the accused to cross-examine witnesses against him if they

provides the manner in which pre-trial investigations shall
be made preliminary to trials of soldiers before general
courts-martial. A part of the language is that "No charge
will be referred to a general court martial for trial until
after a thorough and impartial investigation thereof shall
have been made." The contention is that this requirement is jurisdictional in nature; that the kind of pretrial investigation prescribed is an indispensable prerequisite to exercise of general court-martial jurisdiction;
and that absent such prior investigation a judgment of
conviction is wholly void.
Here there was an investigation. The claim is that
it was neither "thorough" nor "impartial" as the 70th
Article requires. The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, so held, and its reversal was rested on that
finding. There was no finding that there was unfairness
in the court-martial trial itself.
We do not think that the pre-trial investigation procedure required by Article 70 can properly be construed
as an indispensable prerequisite to exercise of Army
general court-martial jurisdiction. The Article does serve
important functions in the administration of court-martial procedures and does provide safeguards to an accused.
Its language is clearly such that a defendant could object to trial in the absence of the required investigation.
In that event the court-martial could itself postpone
trial pending the investigation. And the military reare available and to present anything he may desire in his own
behalf either in defense or mitigation, and the investigating officer shall examine available witnesses requested by the accused.
If the charges are forwarded after such investigation, they shall be
accompanied by a statement of the substance of the testimony taken

on both sides." 41 Stat. 759, 802, as amended 50 Stat. 724; 10
U. S. C. § 1542. See also Act of June 24, 1948, §§ 222, 231, 244, 62

viewing authorities could consider the same contention,
reversing a court-martial conviction where failure to
comply with Article 70 has substantially injured an
accused.4 But we are not persuaded that Congress intended to make otherwise valid court-martial judgments
wholly void because pre-trial investigations fall short
of the standards prescribed by Article 70. That Congress has not required analogous pre-trial procedure for
Navy courts-martial is an indication that the investigatory plan was not intended to be exalted to the
jurisdictional level.
Nothing in the legislative history of the Article supports the contention that Congress intended that a conviction after a fair trial should be nullified because of the
manner in which an investigation was conducted prior
to the filing of charges. Its original purposes were to
insure adequate preparation of cases, to guard against
hasty, ill-considered charges, to save innocent persons
from the stigma of unfounded charges, and to prevent
trivial cases from going before general courts-martial.
4 Military reviewing authorities do not revise court-martial convictions for failure to follow pre-trial procedure unless it appears
to them that such failure has injuriously affected the substantial
rights of the accused. CM 229477, Floyd, 17 B. R. 149, 153-156
(1943). The Assistant Judge Advocate General testifying before
the Committee on Armed Services stated: "If it appeared in the
Office of the Judge Advocate General that the man had been deprived
of any substantial right, such as the presentation of testimony in his
own behalf, or something of that kind, it would be possible for us
to say that the error injuriously affected the rights of the accused
and that the sentence should therefore be vacated. The case of real
injury would be rare. Ordinarily guilt or innocence is and should
be determined at the trial and not by what occurred prior to the
trial." Hearings before Subcommittee No. 11, Legal, of House Committee on Armed Services on H. R. 2575, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 20592060 (1947).

War Department, Military Justice During the War, 63
(1919). All of these purposes relate solely to actions
required in advance of formal charges or trial. All the
purposes can be fully accomplished without subjecting
court-martial convictions to judicial invalidation where
pre-trial investigations have not been made.
Shortly after enactment of Article 70 in 1920 the Judge
Advocate General of the Army did hold that where there
had been no pre-trial investigation, court-martial proceedings were void ab initio.5 But this holding has been
expressly repudiated in later holdings of the Judge Advocate.' This later interpretation has been that the pretrial requirements of Article 70 are directory, not mandatory, and in no way affect the jurisdiction of a courtmartial. The War Department's interpretation was
pointedly called to the attention of Congress in 1947
after which Congress amended Article 70 but left unchanged the language here under consideration.'

representatives were subjected to considerable questioning as to
whether pre-trial requirements should be made jurisdictional prerequisites. One of many statements supporting the War Department's view was that of Under Secretary of War Royall, who
testified:
"However, our bill does not make it a jurisdictional factor, but
it does contemplate a thorough investigation. In the States in
which I have practiced law, preliminary investigations are never a
jurisdictional requirement. I know they are not in the Federal
courts . . . . We would be departing radically from accepted judicial
practice, generally throughout the United States, if we made that a

We hold that a failure to conduct pre-trial investigations as required by Article 70 does not deprive general
courts-martial of jurisdiction so as to empower courts in
habeas corpus proceedings to invalidate court-martial
judgments. It is contended that this interpretation of
Article 70 renders it meaningless, practically making it a
dead letter. This contention must rest on the premise
that the Army will comply with the 70th Article of War
only if courts in habeas corpus proceedings can invalidate
any court-martial conviction which does not follow an
Article 70 pre-trial procedure. We cannot assume that
judicial coercion is essential to compel the Army to obey
this Article of War. It was the Army itself that initiated
the pre-trial investigation procedure and recommended
congressional enactment of Article 70.8 A reasonable
assumption is that the Army will require compliance
with the Article 70 rinvestigatory procedure to the end
that Army work shall not be unnecessarily impeded and
that Army personnel shall not be wronged as the result
of unfounded and frivolous court-martial charges and
trials.'

the Durham bill and this, as I understand."

MURPHY,

J., dissenting.

This court-martial conviction resulting from a trial
fairly conducted cannot be invalidated by a judicial finding that the pre-trial investigation was not carried on in
the manner prescribed by the 70th Article of War."°
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE concur, dissenting.

Pre-trial investigation under the Seventieth Article of
War performs a dual function. It saves the Army's time
by eliminating frivolous cases; it protects an accused
from the ignominy of a general court martial when the
charges against him are groundless. These policies, of
course, mean more than the protection of the respondent
in this case. Their primary service appears when the
defendant is clearly innocent. If the Article is ignored,
and the court martial finds the defendant innocent, the
error can never be corrected-the officers' time has been
wasted and the defendant's record is forever besmirched
by the words "general court martial." Yet if the prisoner
is found guilty, there is still no sanction. For military
authorities will not set aside a conviction unless the very
accused asking reversal has been prejudiced. And if the
trial has been fair, and resulted in conviction, who will
say that the defendant has been prejudiced because preliminary investigation was wanting?
Unless a civilian court is able to enforce the requirement, then, it is not a requirement at all, but only a suggestion which should be observed. Today the Court
10 District Courts and Courts of Appeal have not been in agreement
on the question. Henry v. Hodges, 76 F. Supp. 968, 970-974;
Anthony v. Hunter, 71 F. Supp. 823, 830-831; Hicks v. Hiatt, 64
F. Supp. 238, 242; Waite v. Overlade, 164 F. 2d 722, 723-724; De War

adopts the latter alternative. It holds that the error of
noncompliance with A. W. 70 is not jurisdictional. It
makes A. W. 70 a virtual dead letter.
I cannot impute so bland a rule to the Congress. And
no evidence of such sterility has been brought to our
attention. What the Eightieth Congress thought about
the problem is irrelevant, of course, for A. W. 70 was the
product of the Sixty-Sixth Congress, in 1920, and respondent was tried in 1944, long before the Eightieth Congress
convened. Had respondent's trial taken place in 1948,
the result might be entirely different. The available evidence indicates clearly that the Sixty-Sixth Congress
considered preliminary investigation vital before trial.
The language of the Article is that of command-"no
charge will be referred" without investigation. The report accompanying the 1920 statute, after referring to an
investigation of unfairness in administering military justice, and concluding that "the personal element entered
too largely into these cases," listed twenty-three changes
in the law. The second change mentioned was this:
"Speedy but thorough and impartial preliminary investigation will be had in all cases." H. R. Rep. No. 940,
66th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2 (1920).
In 1924, just four years after A. W. 70 became the law,
the Board of Review construed the language directly
opposite to the Court's present interpretation. It held
that the error was jurisdictional. CM 161728, Clark.
Two later holdings, both in 1928, confirmed this view.
CM 182225, Keller; CM 183183, Claybaugh. In Keller,
the investigation took place, but was not "thorough."
The Board held that a thorough investigation was "an
absolute right given to the accused by statute." And
in 1937 Congress reenacted the same language we are
construing now, the same language the Board of Review
expounded in 1924 and 1928. 50 Stat. 724. It seems
extraordinary to say that reversals of the prior rulings

in 1943, CM 229477, Floyd, 17 B. R. 149, should govern
when Congress has apparently acquiesced in the first,
and contemporary, interpretations.
Congressional belief in the importance of preliminary
investigation should not now be frustrated by a holding
that noncompliance cannot be attacked by habeas corpus.
I agree with the court below that the preliminary investigation in this case did not meet the proper standard,
and would affirm the judgment.
