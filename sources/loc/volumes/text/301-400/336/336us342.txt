OKLAHOMA TAX COMMISSION v. TEXAS
COMPANY.
NO. 40.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF
OKLAHOMA.*

Argued November 19, 1948.-Decided March 7, 1949.
1. A lessee of mineral rights in allotted and restricted Indian lands
in Oklahoma has no immunity under the Federal Constitution
from nondiscriminatory state gross production taxes and state
excise taxes on petroleum produced from such lands. Pp. 343-367.
2. Overruling Choctaw, 0. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison, 235 U. S. 292;
Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S.522;
Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U. S. 503; Large Oil Co. v. Howard,
248 U. S. 549; and Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, 296 U. S.
521. Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S.376, held
controlling and not limited to income taxes. Pp. 364-365.
3. No question is here presented as to the immunity from state
taxation of the Indian lands themselves or of the Indians' share
of production, since only the interests of lessees were assessed.
Pp. 347 (n. 14), 353.
4. A constitutional immunity of such a lessee is not to be inferred
from Acts of Congress authorizing a state gross production tax
on minerals produced from the lands of certain Indians, since the
purpose of those statutes was to remove immunities of the Indians
themselves. Pp. 366-367.
5. Congressional approval of the doctrine of immunity enunciated
in the cases herein overruled is not to be inferred from mere congressional silence. P. 367.
Reversed.

State gross production taxes and state excise taxes on
petroleum produced from allotted and restricted Indian
lands by respondents, who were lessees of mineral rights
in the lands, were held invalid by the Oklahoma Supreme
Court. This Court dismissed appeals by the State Tax
Commission and granted certiorari. 333 U. S.870. Reversed and remanded, p. 367.

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The principal question is whether a lessee of mineral
rights in allotted and restricted Indian lands is immunized
by the Constitution against payment of nondiscriminatory
state gross production taxes and state excise taxes on
petroleum produced from such lands. In effect the issue
is whether this Court's previous decisions in Howard v.
Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U. S. 503; Large Oil Co. v. Howard,
248 U. S. 549; and Oklahoma v. BarnsdallRefineries, 296
U. S. 521, invalidating such taxes as applied to like lessees,
have been so undermined by later decisions, in particular
Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376,
that they should now be overruled.
With certain exceptions,' the lands from which was
extracted the petroleum sought to be taxed are held in
'Interests in the lands to which the United States does not hold
title are of two kinds: (1) undivided interests acquired by nonIndians; (2) an interest (which is still restricted) conveyed to the
son of an allottee by approved noncompetent Indian deeds, pursuant
to the Act of March 1, 1907, 34 Stat. 1018, 25 U. S. C. § 405.

trust by the United States, pursuant to allotments made
under the General Allotment Act,' for various members
of the Pottawatomie, Apache, Comanche, and Otoe and
Missouria Tribes2 All the lands are located within the
State of Oklahoma and at all material times they were restricted' against alienation by the Indian cestui owners
without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior.' He

3The allotments were made to members of the Apache and Comanche tribes pursuant to the agreement approved by Congress on
June 6, 1900, 31 Stat. 676. Members of the Citizen Band of the
Pottawatomie Tribe were allotted land pursuant to the agreement
of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1016. Allotments were made to the Otoe
and Missouria Indians under the General Allotment Act without
special agreement. Mills, Oklahoma Indian Land Laws § 438 (1924).
The nature of the Indians' interest has been described as follows:
.. the United States retained the legal title, giving the Indian
allottee a paper or writing, improperly called a patent, showing that

at a particular time in the future, unless it was extended by the

President, he would be entitled to a regular patent conveying the fee."
United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432, 436.
4With these exceptions: (1) In a single immaterial instance in No.
40, an undivided 7/16th interest in one of the leases was alienable
and was owned by non-Indians. The Texas Company paid without
protest the taxes levied against it which were attributable to this
7/16th interest. (2) In No. 41, an undivided 1/4th interest in the
lands subject to one of the leases and an undivided 1/3d interest in
the land subject to another lease were owned by non-Indians. The
effect of the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court was to deny
the portion of the assessments applicable to these interests. However, it was conceded at the argument here that the assessments were
valid insofar as they applied to interests in lands owned, when the
assessments were made, by non-Indian owners or by Indian owners
not under restriction.
524 Stat. 389, 390, as amended, 25 U. S. C. §§ 348, 349. See
Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 108-109 (1942). Leases
of allotted land for mining purposes may be made with the approval
of the Secretary of the Interior under 35 Stat. 783, 25 U. S. C. § 396.

approved each of the leases now in question. The respondents Texas Company (No. 40) and Magnolia Petroleum Company (No. 41) acquired their leases before
Oklahoma levied the assessments now in issue, either as
original lessees or by assignment from non-Indians who
were such lessees. The companies thus became owners
of all right, title and interest in their respective leases,
subject only to the one-eighth royalty interest reserved
to the Indian lessors, and were such owners at the times
of the respective assessments. It may be taken that they
have operated the leases in conformity with the applicable regulations of the Department of the Interior I and
of the State of Oklahoma,' except for the payment of
the state taxes in question.'
The Oklahoma gross production tax requires payment
of five per cent of the gross value of production, including royalty interests. It is imposed on every person engaged in the production in Oklahoma of petroleum, crude
oil or other mineral oil, and natural gas and casinghead
gas. The tax is exacted in lieu of all taxes by the state

The assumption stated in the text is made, although in No. 41 the
commission excluded, as irrelevant, evidence tendered to show compliance with the federal and state regulations, and in No. 40 no
evidence of compliance was introduced.
8 The three oil and gas leases involved in No. 40 were made by
members of the Apache Tribe to non-Indian lessees who assigned
their interests to the Texas Company. In No. 41, in which eight
leases are involved, the Indian lessors are members of the Apache,
Comanche, Citizen Pottawatomie, and Otoe and Missouria Tribes.
Undivided interests in the lands subject to certain leases were held
by non-Indians at the time of assessment. See notes 1 and 4.

and its political subdivisions on property rights in minerals and mineral rights, producing leases, machinery used
in connection with any oil or gas well, the oil and gas
during the tax year in which it is produced, and any investment in any leases, minerals, or other property. The
statute authorizes the state board of equalization to raise
or lower the rate of tax to equate the amount payable
with the amount which would be payable if the general
ad valorem property tax were assessed against the property of the producers subject to taxation. The board's
rate changes are subject to review by the state supreme
court.' In consequence of these provisions, the tax has
been construed consistently by the state courts to be a
tax on the lessee's property, not an occupation or excise
tax.0
968 Okla. Stat. §821 (1941). The (general) scheme of the tax
is as follows: The tax falls due on the first day of each calendar
month as to production during the preceding month. The purchaser
pays the tax on oil or gas sold at the time of production and is
authorized to deduct the amount of tax paid when settling with the
producer (and with the royalty owner in cases in which the tax
applies to him, see note 14). If the tax becomes due before the oil
is sold, the producer is required to pay the tax for himself (and, in
cases where the tax applies to royalties, see note 14, for the royalty
owner, and is permitted to deduct the amount of tax paid on royalty
oil when settling with the royalty owner). 68 id. § 833. The tax is
a first and paramount lien against the property of the person liable
for the tax. 68 id. § 836.
Of the proceeds received from the tax, 78 per cent is paid into the
state treasury to be used for the general expenses of state government. Ten per cent is paid to the county treasurer of the county
in which the oil or gas was produced, and is used for the construction and maintenance of county highways. Ten per cent is paid to
the county treasurer for distribution among the county's school
districts. The remaining two per cent is placed to the credit of the
Oklahoma Tax Commission and is used for collection and enforcement activities. 68 id. § 827 (Cum. Supp. 1947).

Opinion of the Court.

The petroleum excise tax requires payment of one mill,
formerly one-eighth of one cent,11 per barrel on every

barrel of petroleum produced in Oklahoma. The statute
was enacted first in 1933 to defray the expenses of administering the state's newly adopted proration law "2and has
been reenacted at each subsequent session of the legislature. 3 The tax, unlike the gross production tax, is construed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court as an excise tax
on the production of oil.

tober and November, 1942. In No. 41 the commission
likewise assessed both taxes, less royalties, on the Magnolia Company's production for various periods between
June 1, 1942, and March 1, 1946. The orders were
entered after the cases were consolidated for hearing
before the commission and were thus heard by it.
In No. 40 the Texas Company paid the taxes under
protest and brought suit to recover them in an Oklahoma
trial court. After hearing, that court sustained the commission's demurrer to the company's amended petition
and ordered it dismissed. Appeal was duly taken to the
state supreme court. In No. 41, following a different
statutory procedure, the Magnolia Company appealed
from the assessments against it directly to that court.
In both cases the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, with
one judge dissenting, held the assessments invalid. The
decisions rested flatly on the ground that the lessee was
an instrumentality of the Federal Government and as
such, under prior and controlling decisions of this Court,
particularly in the Large Oil, Gipsy Oil, and Barnsdall
Refineries cases, supra, not subject to the taxes in question. 5 In the Texas Company case the court expressly
distinguished Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp.,
supra,on the ground that the decision in that case related
exemption is based." 68 Okla. Stat. § 821 (1941). This provision
is made applicable to the petroleum excise tax by the first section of
each of the several enactments establishing and continuing that
exaction. See note 13 supra. Only the interests of the lessees were
assessed in these cases.
"5The Oklahoma Supreme Court rendered separate, unreported
opinions. The principal opinion, filed in the Texas Company case,
was followed in the later one filed in the Magnolia Petroleum case.
Rehearing was denied in both cases.
The original judgment in the Texas Company case provided for
reversal of the trial court's judgment, with directions to overrule
the commission's demurrer "and proceed consistent with the views

to income taxes assessed against the lessee there situated
as were the lessees here. The opinion, indicating the
writer's personal view that reconsideration of the earlier
decisions well might be sought, nevertheless stated:
"But it is thought beyond the power of this court
to now engage in such reconsideration, in view of
the cited decisions of the higher authority which
thus far wholly sustain the claim of [the Texas
Company] to immunity from the tax here involved.
"Upon questions of federal law, citizens and their
attorneys have the right to rely upon decisions of
the Supreme Court of the United States, and upon
such questions it is our fixed duty to follow such
decisions, leaving to the United States Congress or
Supreme Court the making of the necessary changes
in such legal rules."
From the state supreme court's decisions 16 the Oklahoma Tax Commission filed appeals in this Court. We
dismissed the appeals for want of jurisdiction. But
treating them as applications for certiorari, 7 we granted
the writs and consolidated the cases for argument. 333

Opinion of the Court.

336 U. S.

Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, 296 U. S. 521, decided
in 1936, the problems of taxation and intergovernmental
immunity these cases present would seem subject to solution on well-settled or fairly obvious legal principles.
It has long been established that property owned by
a private person and used by him in performing services
for the Federal Government is subject to state and local
ad valorem taxes."8 And the oil and gas produced is, of
course, subject to such taxation. Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, 288 U. S. 325.
Both by the substance of the statute's explicit provisions
and by the consistent construction of the Oklahoma
Supreme Court, 9 that state's so-called gross production
tax in its presently applicable form is a tax on the lessee's
property used in carrying out its contractual obligations
with the Federal Government and on the oil and gas
during the tax year in which it was produced. The tax
is levied expressly in lieu of all property taxes which
the state might constitutionally impose in ad valorem
form, the gross production levy being a tentative measure
for the value of that property. To guard against that
measure's being utilized to lay in effect a tax not actually
of that character, the state board of equalization is authorized, indeed is required upon complaint, to equate
the amount payable with what would be payable if the
general ad valorem tax were assessed against the property
of the producing lessees subject to taxation, with provision for judicial review of the board's action.
Unembarrassed by some of this Court's prior decisions,
therefore, Oklahoma's so-called gross production tax

would seem to be sustained by the well-established line
of decisions cited above. °
Moreover, even if the status of respondents as federal
instrumentalities, in the sense in which they use the term,
were fully conceded, it seems difficult to imagine how
any substantial interference with performing their functions as such in developing the leaseholds could be
thought to flow from requiring them to pay the small
tax Oklahoma exacts to satisfy their shares of the state's
expense in maintaining and administering its proration
program. That system works for respondents' benefit
in performing their producing function, as it does for
the benefit of all other producers, by stabilizing production, eliminating waste, and preventing runaway competition in an industry notorious for those evils in the
absence of some such control.

v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Co., 310 U. S. 573; Republic
Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, 334 U. S. 62, dissenting opinion
Part III, 89. Indeed respondents do not claim they are
exempt from the plan's regulatory features. They claim
only that they are constitutionally immune from con20

But see text infra, Part III. Unless the measure of a tax is

fairly to be considered as designed to conceal or distort unduly its
true nature, the tax is not to be invalidated because the measure
is not one customarily employed if as applied it achieves fairly the
purpose for which it is avowedly laid, that purpose of course being
one within the legislative power to accomplish. American Mfg. Co.
v. St. Louis, 250 U. S. 459; Hope Gas Co. v. Hall, 274 U. S. 284;
Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, 286 U. S. 165. Moreover, ordinarily the construction given to a state statute by the state's highest
court capable of deciding the question is taken as binding on this
Court. See e. g., Knights of Pythias v. Meyer, 265 U. S. 30, 32-33;

tributing to the plan's support. As a matter entirely
fresh, the contention would not seem weighty.
II.
But neither issue is fresh. Each is complicated by
this Court's prior decisions squarely ruling that the taxes
are invalid as unconstitutional intrusions by the state
upon the performance of federal functions. Those decisions have not been explicitly overruled. But it is
strongly urged that our later decisions, especially in Helvering v. Mountain ProducersCorp., supra, have stricken
the foundation from beneath the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil
and Barnsdall Refineries decisions, supra, so that the
latter no longer can stand in reason and consistency with
the former.
It is true that this Court's more recent pronouncements have beaten a fairly large retreat from its formerly
prevailing ideas concerning the breadth of so-called intergovernmental immunities from taxation, a retreat which
has run in both directions-to restrict the scope of immunity of private persons seeking to clothe themselves
with governmental character from both federal and state
taxation. The history of the immunity, by and large
in both aspects, represents a rising or expanding curve,
tapering off into a falling or contracting one.
Our present problem lies on the constitutional level.
It requires reconsideration of former decisions specifically in point, together with later ones deviating in
rationale. It is of substantial importance both for the
states' powers of taxation and for the subjects on which
they may impinge. Moreover, even though the immediate questions are closely related to federal policies
concerning Indian lands, they are equally tangent to
considerations affecting other types of situation raising
questions of immunity. For these reasons it will not

342

353

Opinion of the Court.

be amiss to consider the questions in the context of two
conflicting courses of decision.
Before we turn to the survey, however, two delimitations of the specific issues should be made.
These cases present no question concerning the immunity of the Indian lands themselves from state taxation. There is no possibility that ultimate liability for
the taxes may fall upon the owner of the land. Cf.
Wilson v. Cook, 327 U. S. 474, dissenting opinion, 489.
Nor, as has been noted, do the cases involve challenges
to the immunity from state taxation of royalty oil, the
Indian's share of production."1
III.
Despite the possibility that the prospect of taxation
by the state may reduce the amount the United States
might receive from the sale of its property, it is well
established that property purchased by a private person
from the Federal Government becomes a part of the
general mass of property in the state and must bear
its fair share of the expenses of local government. The
theoretical burden which state ad valorem property taxation thus imposes upon the Federal Government is
regarded as too remote and indirect to justify tax immunity for property purchased from that Government.
New Brunswick v. United States, 276 U. S. 547; Forbes
v. Gracey, 94 U. S. 762; Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall.
See note 14 supra. Cf. Carpenterv. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, holding
that oil royalties received by Indian lessors from nontaxable allotted
lands were not subject to a state gross production tax, the tax being
regarded as on the lessor's interest rather than on the severed oil.
But royalty income is subject to state and federal net income taxes.

Tribes v. Commissioner, 295 U. S. 418; Leahy v. State Treasurer,

527; see Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468. Also
subject to local ad valorem taxation, as has been noted
above,22 is property owned by a private party and used
by him in performing services for the Federal Government. Where oil produced by a private lessee from restricted Indian lands was owned solely by the lessee and
had been removed from the leased lands and stored in
the lessee's tanks, it was held subject to state ad valorem
taxation. Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board
of Equalization, 288 U. S. 325.3 And equipment used
by a lessee of restricted Indian lands has been held subject to the same sort of exaction. Taber v. Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co., 300 U. S. 1. Cf. Thomas v.
Gay, 169 U. S. 264, sustaining a state tax on cattle grazing
on tribal lands leased from Indians by the non-Indian
owner of the cattle.
Anomalous in the light of these rulings was the evolution of a line of decisions of this Court condemning forms
of taxation which would have imposed no more direct
or substantial burden upon the United States than would
an ad valorem property tax applied to property purchased
from the United States. Private lessees of restricted or
tribal Indian lands came to be held "federal instrumentalities" like the lands themselves, and so immune from
various forms of state taxation ranging from a gross production tax on production from the leased lands to a tax
upon the lessee's net income. The theory of the Court
was the one which was rejected in directly analogous
cases: A state tax on the lessee, the lease, or the profits
from the lease would be "a direct hamper upon the effort
of the United States to make the best terms that it can

Alternatively, "A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the
power to make them, and could be used to destroy the
power to make them." Indian Territory Illuminating
Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522, 530.
The history of this development is a progression "from
exemption of the gross income of the lessee of Indian
lands . . . through exemption of net receipts to serious

impairment of the taxing powers of Oklahoma." Cohen,
Handbook of Federal Indian Law 257, n. 29 (1942). The
development is an outgrowth and a progressive extension
of early rulings that tribal lands themselves are immune
from state taxation.24 More immediately it stems from
the later ruling that allotted Indian lands held in trust by
the United States were "an instrumentality employed by
the United States for the benefit and control of this
dependent race," and so were immune from state taxation.
United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S.432, 437-439.
In 1908 Oklahoma imposed, in addition to ad valorem
property taxes, a gross production tax, the progenitor of
the present tax bearing that label, on oil, gas and other
minerals produced within the state. Okla. Laws, 1908,
24

See The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737; The New York Indians,

5 Wall. 761. Those early decisions seem to rest on the basis that
the Indian tribes possessed many attributes of sovereignty.
As to the immunity from state taxation of lands acquired by

522). Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U. S. 503; Large
Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U. S. 549.
Suspicions that this Court had overlooked the fact that
under the revised statute the gross production tax was
in lieu of rather than in addition to all other ad valorem
property taxes,' were dispelled by Mr. Justice Holmes'
remark in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra at 504-505, that
the statutory change had been noticed and regarded as
immaterial.'
If a gross receipts tax was a burden on the
Federal Government "so as to interfere with the performance of its functions, it could not be saved because
it was in lieu of a tax upon property or was so characterized." See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S.
134,158.
The high-water mark of immunity for non-Indian
lessees of restricted and allotted Indian lands came in
1922 when the Gillespie decision, supra, invalidated an
Oklahoma net income tax upon income derived by a
lessee from sales of his share of oil produced from restricted lands.
The non-Indian lessee's immunity was last sustained
here by Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, supra. That
decision held, on application of a rule of strict construction of congressional waivers, that Congress' express
waiver of immunity from gross production taxes on oil
produced from the specified Indian lands did not extend
to petroleum excise taxes. The state did not challenge

the implied constitutional immunity but pitched its
argument on the ground of statutory exemption."
The instrumentality doctrine has been applied to confer
a correlative immunity upon private lessees of stateowned lands. The Texas rule that oil and gas leases are
present sales to the lessees of the oil and gas in place
caused this Court to sustain the imposition of the federal
income tax upon income of the lessee derived from the
sale of oil and gas produced from lands leased from that
state. It was observed that ". . . the remote and indirect effects upon the one government of such a non-discriminatory tax by the other have never been considered
adequate grounds for thus aiding the one at the expense
of the taxing power of the other." Group No. 1 Oil Corp.
v. Bass, 283 U. S. 279, 282.
Although this decision may be taken to mark a turning point in expansion of the lessee's immunity, it was not
immediately permitted to impair the Gillespie rationale.
A tax on income would be no greater burden where, under
applicable state law, "title" to the oil did not "pass"
until the oil was removed from the ground. And although Justices Brandeis, Stone, Roberts and Cardozo
contended that the Gillespie decision could not stand
consistently with the principles which had been reaffirmed
in the Group No. 1 Oil case, a majority of one in Burnet
v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, provided a
corollary to the rule of the Gillespie case. This was done
by holding that the Federal Government was barred from
taxing the income of a lessee of state lands as the state
was barred from taxing the income of the lessee of federal
lands.
A parallel immunity from state occupational or privilege taxes was once accorded private contractors with,
or agencies of, the Government, Williams v. Talladega,

226 U. S. 404, notwithstanding the venerable rule that
the property of such a contractor or agency is liable to
state property taxation. See the cases cited supra in

note 18. Decisions curtailing this immunity were presaged by Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S.514. It
held subject to federal income taxation income received
by a consulting engineer from a state for services in
connection with temporary work. Equally significant
was Alward v. Johnson, 282 U. S. 509, 514, which sustained a state tax measured by gross receipts on the
property of a stage line engaged in carrying the mails. 1
Later this Court sustained a state tax on the gross receipts of a contractor with the Federal Government,
James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134; Silas
Mason Co. v. Tax Commission, 302 U. S. 186; a state
tax on the net income of such a contractor, Atkinson v.
Tax Commission, 303 U. S.20; state sales and use taxes
on purchases of materials used by a contractor in performing a cost-plus contract with the United States,
Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U. S.1; Curry v. United
States, 314 U. S. 14; and a state severance tax imposed
on a contractor who severed and purchased timber from
lands owned by the United States, Wilson v. Cook, 327
U. S. 474.

It was pointed out that

"... the Constitution, unaided by Congressional
legislation, . . . [does not prohibit] a tax exacted

from the contractors merely because it is passed on
economically, by the terms of the contract or otherwise, as a part of the construction cost to the Government. So far as such a non-discriminatory state
tax upon the contractor enters into the cost of the
materials to the Government, that is but a normal

incident of the organization within the same territory
of two independent taxing sovereignties. The asserted right of the one to be free of taxation by the
other does not spell immunity from paying the added
costs, attributable to the taxation of those who furnish supplies to the Government and who have been
granted no tax immunity." Alabama v. King &
Boozer, 314 U. S. 1, 8-9.
The opportunity to reexamine the Gillespie and Coronado cases arose in 1938 in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376, the decision upon which the
Oklahoma commission relies most strongly to secure reversal of the judgments in the present cases. The
Mountain Producers case involved the application of the
federal income tax law to a cestui of an express trust
which received the proceeds of the sale of oil taken from
school lands owned by the State of Wyoming. The Court
declined to distinguish the Gillespie and Coronado decisions on the narrow ground available, the fact that the
taxpayer was a cestui of a trust which received the proceeds of the sale of the oil rather than the lessee itself.
303 U. S. at 383.32
Rather the Court sought broader grounding, which lay
in reconsideration of the foundations of the Gillespie and
Coronado decisions. The opinion stated:
"The ground of the decision in the Gillespie case,
as stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in speaking for
the Court, was that 'a tax upon the leases' was 'a
tax upon the power to make them, and could be
32 Cf. Burnet v. A. T. Jergins Trust, 288 U. S. 508, 516, in which
a city leased oil and gas land to a private trust, which was held liable
for a federal income tax on its share of the receipts, the Court stating
that "the doctrine of Gillespie v. Oklahoma is to be applied strictly
and only in circumstances closely analogous to those which it
disclosed."

used to destroy the power to make them' (240 U. S.
p. 530) and that a tax 'upon the profits of the leases'
was 'a direct hamper upon the effort of the United
States to make the best terms that it can for its
wards.' [257 U. S. at 506.] In the light of the
expanding needs of State and Nation, the inquiry has
been pressed whether this conclusion has adequate
basis .

303 U. S. at 384.

Noting that it had held that the Gillespie ruling should
be limited strictly to cases closely analogous, 3 and asserting that "the distinctions thus maintained have attenuated its teaching and raised grave doubt as to whether
it should longer be supported," 303 U. S. at 384-385,
the Court went on to say:
"In numerous decisions we have had occasion to
declare the competing principle, buttressed by the
most cogent considerations, that the power to tax
should not be crippled 'by extending the constitutional exemption from taxation to those subjects
which fall within the general application of nondiscriminatory laws, and where no direct burden is
laid upon the governmental instrumentality and
there is only remote, if any, influence upon the
exercise of the functions of government.' Willcuts
v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216, 225, and illustrations there
cited." 303 U. S. at 385.
That competing principle the Court found applicable to
the case before it and to require that the decisions in the
Gillespie and Coronado cases be overruled. Rejecting as
insubstantial the distinction based on the passage of title
to the oil at the time of making the lease, compare Group
33Citing Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, which

IV.
Respondents strongly urge that the Mountain Producers decision is not controlling or effective to require
reversal in these cases, since it involved a tax on net
income rather than gross production and excise taxes.
And they insist that a sharp line should be drawn between what they call lessees performing a governmental
function and independent contractors doing work for the
Government.m The latter distinction is largely, if not
altogether verbal, in the context of the fact situations
in these cases. As for the former difference, although the
Court explicitly overruled only the Gillespie and Coro34Among the cases which one or the other of respondents attempts
to distinguish on the ground that the tax was imposed on an independent contractor rather than a "true Federal instrumentality" are:

McKinley, 308 U. S. 358; Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U. S. 1;

It is also contended that cases sustaining taxes on the property

nado cases, the groundings of the Mountain Producers
decision do not permit limiting its effects to so narrow an
application.35
The language last quoted above is as applicable to
the present cases as it was to the Gillespie and Coronado
decisions. The taxes here are nondiscriminatory. The
respondents are "private persons" who seek immunity
"for their property or gains because they are engaged in
operations under a government contract or lease." The
functions they perform in operating the leases are hardly
more governmental in character than those performed by
lessees of school lands or, indeed, by many contractors
with the Government. The lessees in the Mountain
Producers case stood identically with the respondents in
all these respects.
Moreover the burdens of the taxes here, if any of
a character likely to interfere with respondents in carrying out the terms of their leases, are as appropriately
to be judged by "regard .

. to substance and direct

effects," and as inappropriately to be determined "by
merely theoretical conceptions of interference with the
functions of government," as were those in the Mountain
Producerscase.3' True, as respondents say, a net income
35 The incongruity of the doctrine respondents ask us to perpetuate is underscored by decisions subsequent to the Mountain
Producers case withdrawing income tax immunity for state and
federal official salaries. Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405; Graves
v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466.
See generally, Powell, The Waning of Intergovernmental Tax Immunities, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 633; Powell, The Remnant of Intergovernmental Tax Immunities, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 757.
36 Respondents merely assert hypothetically that imposition of the
taxes might in some instances make the margin between successful
and unsuccessful operation. Leases approved by the Secretary of
the Interior provided for the same rental and royalty payments both
before and after the Mountain Producers decision. 25 C. F. R.
§ 189.16. And rental and royalty payments provided for by the

tax may be a step farther removed from interfering effect
than a gross production tax or an excise tax on production.
But this all depends upon the rate at which each tax is
levied.
To the adaptation of Marshall's oft-quoted aphorism
made by Mr. Justice McKenna in Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. at 530, and
followed by Mr. Justice Holmes in Gillespie v. Oklahoma,
257 U. S. at 505, namely, that "A tax upon the leases is
a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to
destroy the power to make them," Chief Justice Hughes in
the Mountain Producerscase did not explicitly make the
rejoinder given by Holmes in another connection, "The
power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court
sits." Panhandle Oil Co. v. Knox, 277 U. S. 218, 223.
But this was the effect of the Mountain Producersdecision, when in a single paragraph it challenged both the
aphorism and the assumption that "a tax upon the profits
of the leases" was "a direct hamper upon the effort of
the United States to make the best terms that it can for
its wards."
The Mountain Producers case was not decided on
narrow, merely technical or presumptive grounds. Its
very foundation was a repudiation of those insubstantial
bases for securing broad private tax exemptions, unjustified by actual interfering or destructive effects upon the
performance of obligations to or work for the government,
state or national. The decision came as the result of
Department of the Interior are the same for lands allotted under
the General Allotment Act as they are for lands of members of
the Five Civilized Tribes, 25 C. F. R. §§ 183.24, 189.16. Production
from the latter lands has been subject to Oklahoma's gross production tax since 1928. See note 42 infra. The Government, in its
brief amicus curiae, states that, because differences in the value of
different tracts of land would be reflected in the bonuses which
lessees are willing to pay, an exact comparison of bonuses is impossible.

experience and of observation of the constant widening
of the exempting process from tax to tax to tax.
Since that decision, as we have noted, the process has
been reversed in direction. True intergovernmental
immunity remains for the most part. But, so far as concerns private persons claiming immunity for their ordinary business operations (even though in connection with
governmental activities), no implied constitutional immunity can rest on the merely hypothetical interferences
with governmental functions here asserted to sustain
exemption. In the light of the broad groundings of the
Mountain Producers decision and of later decisions, we
cannot say that the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall
Refineries decisions remain immune to the effects of the
Mountain Producers decision and others which have followed it. They "are out of harmony with correct principle," as were the Gillespie and Coronado decisions and,
accordingly, they should be, and they now are, overruled.
This accords with the result reached in Santa Rita Oil
Co. v. State Board of Equalization, 112 Mont. 359.
Moreover, since the decisions in Choctaw, 0. & G. R.
Co. v. Harrison,supra, and Indian Territory Illuminating
Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, rest upon the same foundations as those underlying the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and
Barnsdall Refineries decisions, indeed supplied those
foundations, we think they too should be, and they now
are, overruled.
We do not imply, by this decision, that Congress does
not have power to immunize these lessees from the taxes
we think the Constitution permits Oklahoma to impose
in the absence of such action." The question whether
immunity shall be extended in situations like these is

essentially legislative in character. But Congress has
not created an immunity here by affirmative action," and
"The immunity formerly said to rest on constitutional
implication cannot now be resurrected in the form of
statutory implication." Oklahoma Tax Commission v.
United States, 319 U. S. 598, 604. And see Graves v.
New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 480: ". .. if
it appears that there is no ground for implying a constitutional immunity, there is equally a want of any ground
for assuming any purpose on the part of Congress to
create an immunity."
The Oklahoma Supreme Court appears to suggest,
though the opinions do not flatly so state, as a possible
alternative support for its conclusion in these cases that
"Congress has acted on the theory that such immunity
exists in the case of leases of this character unless waived,"
that is, several congressional enactments permit Oklahoma to impose a gross production tax on minerals produced from the lands of the Osages,89 the Kaws," the
Quapaws, 4 and the Five Civilized Tribes, 42 and authorize
payment of taxes due on account of the Indians' royalty
interest. But Congress' purpose in enacting these statutes was the removal of the immunities of the Indians
themselves, immunities which are not challenged in these
cases; the action was occasioned by the favorable ecov. Seber, 318 U. S. 705, 715-719; Oklahoma Tax Commission v.

us that this argument was urged upon the Oklahoma Supreme Court,
that court did not mention this possible state ground but rested its
decision exclusively on the federal ground. We do not purport

law denies.
