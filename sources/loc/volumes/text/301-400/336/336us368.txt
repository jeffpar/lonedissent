OF HAWAII, ET AL. v. MO HOCK KE LOK PO,

NO. 52.

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF HAWAII.*

Argued January 11-12, 1949.-Decided March 14, 1949.
1. Section 266 of the Judicial Code (now 28 U. S. C. §§ 2281, 1253,
etc.), which required that a suit to enjoin state officers from
enforcing a state statute on the ground of unconstitutionality
be heard and determined by a district court of three judges, and
which authorized a direct appeal to this Court from a final decree
in such suit, held not applicable to the Territory of Hawaii. Pp.
374-380.
2. A final judgment of the United States District Court for Hawaii
in a suit heard and determined by three judges, although not appealable directly to this Court because of the inapplicability of
Judicial Code § 266 (now 28 U. S. C. § 1253), was nevertheless
reviewable in the Court of Appeals and could be considered here
on certiorari to that court. Pp. 380-381.
3. A final judgment of the United States District Court for Hawaii,
erroneously constituted of three judges under Judicial Code § 266
(now 28 U. S. C. § 2281), enjoined territorial officers from enforcing an Act of the Territory on the ground of unconstitutionality.
A direct appeal was erroneously taken to this Court; an appeal
was also taken to the Court of Appeals; and this Court was
petitioned to review the case in the Court of Appeals by certiorari
before judgment. Held: As the record, arguments and briefs here
and the opinions of the District Court fully present the case
decided by the District Court, and to avoid further futile proceedings, this Court grants certiorari to review the case in the
Court of Appeals before judgment. Pp. 370-371.

Counsel for Parties.

4. Claiming that it was invalid under the Federal Constitution,
certain Chinese School Associations, a Chinese school, and a teacher
of Chinese in Chinese language schools sued in the United States
District Court for Hawaii to enjoin officers of the Territory from
enforcing an Act of the Territory which forbids the teaching of
foreign languages to children in certain circumstances. The sole
sanction for its enforcement was by injunction, in a suit for which
the defense of unconstitutionality would be available. The Act
had not been construed by the Hawaiian courts. Held: Assuming
the existence of federal and equitable jurisdiction, the District
Court, as a matter of its discretion, should have refused to grant
the injunction. Pp. 381-384.
5. Where equitable interference with state and territorial acts is
sought in federal courts, judicial consideration of acts of importance
primarily to the people of the state or territory should, as a
matter of discretion, be left by the federal courts to the courts
of the legislating authority, unless exceptional circumstances command a different course. Pp. 383-384.
74 F. Supp. 852, reversed.

Respondents sued in the United States District Court
for the District of Hawaii to enjoin officers of the Territory from enforcing an Act of the Territory challenged
as invalid under the Federal Constitution. The suit was
heard and determined by a court of three judges, which
granted the injunction. 74 F. Supp. 852. The defendants took a direct appeal to this Court (No. 52)
and an appeal to the Court of Appeals. They also petitioned this Court for review of the case in the Court
of Appeals by certiorari before judgment (No. 474). In
No. 52, the appeal is dismissed; in No. 474, certiorari
is granted, the judgment is reversed and the cause is
remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss
the complaint. P. 384.
Thomas W. Flynn, Deputy Attorney General of Hawaii, argued the cause for appellants in No. 52. With
him on the brief in No. 52 and the petition in No. 474

JUSTICE

REED delivered the opinion of the Court.

The appeal in No. 52, Stainback, Governor of the Territory of Hawaii, et al. v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po, An
Eleemosynary Corporation, et al., and the petition for
writ of certiorari in No. 474, a case with the same short
title, seek review of a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. This judgment
was entered by a special three-judge court that was called
pursuant to Judicial Code § 266, and by that section's provision was brought directly here on May 7, 1948, in case
No. 52. To guard against a frustration of review by
this Court's refusal to accept jurisdiction, a timely appeal
by the appellants here in No. 52 has been taken by them
in No. 474 to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
No judgment on that appeal has been entered by the
Court of Appeals; and appellants there, the Governor of
Hawaii et al., petitioned here on December 21, 1948, for

the allowance of a writ of certiorari under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1254 (1).'
A jurisdictional question as to whether Judicial Code
§ 266 was applicable in the Territory of Hawaii arises in
No. 52. It was postponed by order of this Court on June
1, 1948, to the hearing of that case on the merits. This
Court postponed action on the petition for certiorari in
No. 474 until the hearing of No. 52 on the merits. As the
record, arguments and briefs here and the opinions below
fully present the case decided by the District Court, to
avoid further futile proceedings we now grant the petition for the writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals
before its decree and proceed in No. 474 to a review of
the judgment of the District Court of Hawaii. The opinions appear in 74 F. Supp. 852, Mo Hock Ke Lok Po
v. Stainback.
Respondents here were plaintiffs in the trial court.
They are Chinese School Associations, a Chinese school,
all giving instruction in Chinese, and a teacher of Chinese
in Chinese language schools. After December 7, 1941,
these schools closed and have not reopened. Prior to that
date they had more than 2,000 pupils, several hundred
of whom were in the first and second grade, and numerous
teachers. Under Judicial Code § 266 they sought an injunction against officers of the Territory of Hawaii
charged by law with the administration of an Act of the
Territory "Regulating the Teaching of Foreign Languages
to Children," 2 from enforcing it in any particular against

the teaching of foreign languages to the respondents'
pupils.
The Act was grounded on a legislative finding "that the
study and persistent use of foreign languages by children
of average intelligence in their early and formative years
definitely detract from their ability properly to understand and assimilate their normal studies in the English
language." Revised Laws of Hawaii (1945), § 1871.
"School" was defined as any teaching regularly of two or
more persons in a group.' Requirements for pupils and
teachers in foreign language schools were set out.' Visitation of the foreign language schools by appropriate officials for enforcement purposes was authorized. § 1875.
The only sanction for enforcement is by injunction.'
3 "Sec. 1872. Definitions. As used in this chapter:
"'School' means any person, firm, group of persons, unincorporated
association, corporation, establishment, or institution, which teaches,
with or without fees, compensation or other charges therefor, any
language other than the English language, as a course of study, to
two or more persons as a group, as a regular and customary practice."
4 "No child shall be taught a foreign language in any school
unless he shall comply with one of the following requirements:
(a) That he shall have passed the fourth grade in public school
or its equivalent, and shall pass from time to time in each succeeding
grade a standard test in English composition and reading conducted
by or under the direction of the department of public instruction
attaining a score not lower than normal for his grade; or (b) that
he shall have passed the eighth grade in public school or its equivalent; or (c) that he shall have attained the age of fifteen years."
R. L. Haw. 1945, § 1873.
"No school shall permit the teaching of any foreign language to
any child under the age of fifteen unless the teacher shall have been
examined and certified by a board of examiners of three persons
appointed by the commissioners of public instruction to be reasonably
well versed in the usage and idiom of both the English language
and the foreign language to be taught by such teacher .. " R. L.
Haw. 1945, § 1874.

any person shall be found to be violating, or failing to comply with
any of the requirements of, this chapter, or there shall be reasonable

Opinion of the Court.

This lack of coercion by fine or imprisonment and the
limitation of enforcement to injunction are important
factors in our conclusion upon No. 474.
The complaint alleged that in violation of the Fifth
Amendment the Act deprived plaintiff schools of the
right to manage their property by contracting with instructors and parents for the teaching of Chinese, and
the plaintiff teacher of Chinese of his right to follow his
occupation. 6 See Farringtonv. Tokushige, 273 U. S. 284,
299. The judgment of the special district court granted
a sweeping permanent injunction against enforcement of
the Hawaiian Act. As our conclusions are based solely
upon procedural issues, any further discussion of the facts
or of the law applicable to the merits is not appropriate.
cause to believe that such school or person is violating, or failing
to comply with the requirements of, this chapter, the attorney
general, at his own instance or at the request of the department of
public instruction, shall institute appropriate proceedings in equity
in the circuit in which the violation occurs to enjoin the performance
of any acts or practices forbidden by this chapter, or to require
such school or person to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
Jurisdiction to hear and dispose of all actions under this section
is hereby conferred upon each circuit judge, and each such judge
shall have power to issue such orders and decrees, by way of injunction, mandatory injunction or otherwise, as may be appropriate
to enforce the provisions of this chapter. In the event any respondent or respondents shall fail or refuse to comply with 'any such
order or decree, the court, in addition to any other powers hereby
granted, shall have power to enjoin the operation and conduct of
such school until and unless this chapter is complied with or satisfactory assurance is given that this chapter will be complied with.
The county attorney of each county shall, at the request of the
attorney general, conduct such proceeding in behalf of the Territory.
All such suits shall be brought in the name of the Territory by
the attorney general." R.L. Haw. 1945.
6 There was a further allegation of a denial to plaintiffs of rights
under 8 U. S. C. §§ 41, 42, 43. This was not considered by the
District Court or relied upon in brief or argument here. We do
not consider it.

OCTOBER TERM, 1948.
Opinion of the Court.

336 U. S.

The complaint asked for and obtained a three-judge
court under the provisions of the Judicial Code § 266.1
The minute entries of proceedings and trial and the opinion re applicability of § 266, Judicial Code, 74 F. Supp. at
7 28 U. S. C. § 380 (see redistribution without change of importance in this case, 28 U. S. C. §§ 1253, 2101, 2281, 2284, as revised
by the Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 928, 964, 968, effective September 1, 1948):
"No interlocutory injunction suspending or restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of any statute of a State by restraining
the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution
of such statute, . . . shall be issued or granted . . . unless the application for the same shall be presented to a justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States, or to a circuit or district judge, and
shall be heard and determined by three judges .....
.Whenever
such application as aforesaid is presented to a justice of the Supreme
Court, or to a judge, he shall immediately call to his assistance
to hear and determine the application two other judges: .... .. An
appeal may be taken direct to the Supreme Court of the United
States from the order granting or denying, after notice and hearing,
an interlocutory injunction in such case. . . . The requirement respecting the presence of three judges shall also apply to the final
hearing in such suit in the district court; and a direct appeal to
the Supreme Court may be taken from a final decree granting or
denying a permanent injunction in such suit."
An interlocutory injunction was sought in the complaint, filed
,June 26, 1947, but the record presented to us does not show that
one was issued although the final injunction was not issued until
February 11, 1948. An opinion on the applicability of Judicial Code
§ 266, filed October 22, 1947, says that "All pertinent adjective
prerequisites specified by the Supreme Court in Ayrshire Collieries
Corporation v. United States, 331 U. S. 132, . . . and in Farrington
v. T. Tokushige, supra, necessary to make operative three judge
participation in the instant suit have occurred. An interlocutory
injunction has been sought and passed to a hearing in the District
Court at Honolulu and a substantial federal question of transcending
limitations of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution has been sufficiently alleged in the Amended Complaint." 74 F. Supp. 858, 859.
Despite appellants' suggestion that the application for an interlocutory injunction was not pressed, we think that in view of this

858, show suggestions that a special district court under
Judicial Code § 266 cannot be called for Hawaii. The
statement of jurisdiction laid bare the problem with commendable frankness. It lies at the threshold of any consideration of this appeal.8
Within the present decade, this Court summarized in
Phillips v. United States, 312 U. S. 246, the purpose and
effect of § 266 and extracted from its history and the precedents for the section's application a congressional requirement of strict construction to protect our appellate
docket while assuring the states that exceptionally careful
judicial consideration would guard them against all assaults, through federal courts, against their legislative
statutes or administrative board orders by applications
for injunction when those assaults were based on the Federal Constitution. Pp. 250-51. While we take judicial
notice that since the Phillips case air carriage has brought
Hawaii closer to the continent,9 the interference with the
normal adjudicatory and appellate processes of the federal judicial system and our docket persists.

The power

language it would be hypercritical for us to dismiss this appeal for
failure of the record to show more definitely that the prayer for an
interlocutory judgment was pressed. But see Healy v. Ratta, 289
U. S. 701, where the correspondence file in this Court shows receipt of
a supplemental record containing a formal waiver of prayer for temporary relief. Ayrshire Corp. v. United States, supra, at 140; Stratton v. St. Louis S. W. R. Co., 282 U. S. 10. Compare 28 U. S. C.
§ 1253 and 28 U. S. C. (1946 ed., Supp. II) pp. 1444, 1453, showing
repeal and redistribution of Judicial Code § 266. We therefore
assume that the quoted statement from the District Court opinion
establishes that the request for an interlocuory injunction was pressed
on that court.

to call a panel of judges under § 266 in Hawaii is to be
examined in the light of the Phillips case.
Hawaii is still a territory but a territory in which the
Constitution and laws of the United States generally are
applicable. 31 Stat. 141, § 5, as amended 48 U. S. C.
§ 495; Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304, 317. Not
only its federal courts but also its territorial courts are
of course subject to congressional legislation. 48 U. S. C.
§ 631, et seq. The Organic Act for Hawaii, § 86,10 provided in 1900:
"That there shall be established in said Territory
a district court to consist of one judge ....
. Said
court shall have, in addition to the ordinary jurisdiction of district courts of the United States, jurisdiction of all cases cognizable in a circuit court of
the United States, and shall proceed therein in the
same manner as a circuit court; .... " 31 Stat. 158.
When incorporated into the Code, this Court was given
"the jurisdiction of district courts of the United States,
and shall proceed therein in the same manner as a district
court." 48 U. S. C. § 642. It now has that jurisdiction. 1
The only change that could be considered significant is
the more definite integration of the district court for Hawaii into the federal judicial system by definition. 2 As
jurisdiction of this Court on appeal depends upon whether
or not a special three-judge court was properly called "
and not upon the power of this Court to review under
10 31 Stat. 158.

Opinion of the Court.

Judicial Code § 266, we need not analyze the method of
review of the judgments of the District Court of Hawaii.14
Our issue is narrowed to the inquiry of whether Congress intended that Judicial Code § 266 should apply in
the Territory of Hawaii under circumstances that would
require its application in a similar suit in a state. Congress in discussing an amendment to the Mann-Elkins
Act, which amendment evolved into this section, considered the geographical difficulties inherent in the requirement of a three-judge court and the burden thus placed
on the functioning of the federal judicial system, but
decided that such considerations were outweighed by the
desirability of having the constitutionality of a state
statute passed on by a court comparable to the court of
last resort of the state. 45 Cong. Rec. 7253-57. It is
to be noted that nowhere in § 266 is mention made of
territories nor as far as has been called to our attention in
the congressional debates and reports relating to this
section and its amendments.
While, of course, great respect is to be paid to the
enactments of a territorial legislature by all courts as it
is to the adjudications of territorial courts,15 the predom-

inant reason for the enactment of Judicial Code § 266 does
not exist as respects territories. This reason was a conReview of the judgments of the district court for Hawaii was
allowed in the Organic Act by § 86 to the ninth judicial circuit
in the same manner as from the then circuit courts to the circuit
courts of appeals. This was adjusted to conform to the elimination
of the circuit courts by Judicial Code § 128 as amended. See 48
U. S. C. § 645. Since this appeal was taken, the revision of the
United States Code, Title 28, §§ 1291, 1294, has become effective.
Under Judicial Code § 266 this Court had direct review, Judicial
Code §§ 128, 238, at the time of appeal and still has. 28 U. S. C.

gressional purpose to avoid unnecessary interference with
the laws of a sovereign state. 6 In our dual system of
government, the position of the state as sovereign over
matters not ruled by the Constitution requires a deference
to state legislative action beyond that required for the
laws of a territory.17 A territory is subject to congressional regulation."8
When the long-established rule of strict construction
of Judicial Code § 266 and that of protection of the docket
of this Court is also considered in conjunction with the
necessary interference with the normal operations of the
federal judicial system by the establishment of the threejudge requirement in Hawaii, we are not persuaded that
Congress intended § 266 to cover Hawaii. See 45 Cong.
Rec. 7253-57. Despite its generality the words of § 266
have been strictly construed so that "statute of a State"
does not include ordinances; "officer of such State" means
one with authority to execute or administer a state-wide
policy. 9
It is not merely the absence of the word "territory"
from § 266 that leads us to this conclusion. We recognize
that in some situations the word "state" includes territory. Andres v. United States, 333 U. S. 740. In that
16Ex parte Collins, 277 U. S. 565, 567-569.
Although Judicial Code § 266 originated in 1910, 36 Stat. 539,
557, it was not until 1937 that the requirement of a three-judge
district court to hear applications for injunctions against the enforcement of Acts of Congress was enacted. 50 Stat. 751, 752.

case we thought the purpose of Congress would be frustrated by a holding that the word "state" in a federal
statute providing for execution of a criminal in "the
manner prescribed by the laws of the State within which
the sentence is imposed" did not include "Territory."
There we held state included territory. ° Here the purpose of the statute to protect state sovereignty is not
furthered by an interpretation of state to include territory.
A former opinion of this Court lends strength to this
interpretation. In Farrington v. Tokushige, 273 U. S.
284, decided in the United States District Court of Hawaii on July 21, 1925, a temporary injunction forbidding
territorial officers from enforcing a territorial statute
somewhat similar to the one here involved was granted by
a single district judge on the ground of the invalidity of
the territorial statute under the Federal Constitution.
The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same ground, 11 F. 2d 710, and so did this
Court on certiorari. No question was raised in any court
as to the applicability of the requirement of § 266 that no
such injunction should be granted against a state without
three judges. If § 266 applied to Hawaii, the interlocutory order of injunction was entered without jurisdiction.
The Court of Appeals and this Court were without jurisdiction over the appeal. While it is sometimes said that
action, where the power to act is unquestioned, can hardly
be said to be a precedent for a future case,2' where as here
the responsibility was on the courts to see that the threealso Talbott v. Silver Bow County, 139 U. S. 438; Wynne

judge rule was followed, we think it significant that no
one sought to apply § 266 to Hawaii.2
We hold that Judicial Code § 266 is not applicable to
Hawaii, that we are without jurisdiction in case No. 52
and that the appeal therein must be dismissed.
We turn now to No. 474, here on writ of certiorari to
the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit before the
entry of a decree in that court. 28 U. S. C. § 2101 (d).
What we have said concerning the final judgment in
the District Court of Hawaii establishes that the judgment was entered by a court improperly constituted under
Judicial Code § 266. Nevertheless this order is subject
22 Stratton v. St. Louis S. W. R. Co., 282 U. S. 10, 13.
See also
Benedicto v. West India & Panama Telegraph Co., 256 F. 417.
Compare Porto Rico Light & Power Co. v. Colom, 106 F. 2d 345,
354-55.
The District Court thought that any question by reason of the
Tokushige case as to differences between that court and the United
States District Courts of the States so far as their powers under
§ 266 is concerned, had been "expressly and clearly removed by subsequent specific Congressional legislation. Title 48, Section 646,
U. S. C. A., Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rules 1, 65(e), 28
U. S. C. A. following section 723c." 74 F. Supp. at 860.
We do not think that either the section or the rules have any
effect upon the applicability of § 266 to the United States District
Court in Hawaii. 48 U. S. C. § 646 (now covered by 28 U. S. C.
§ 2072, see note 26 infra) made the rules applicable to Hawaii,
but the rules do not affect the question of the applicability of § 266
to Hawaii. Rule 1 states the scope of the rules. Rule 65 (e),
insofar as it has any possible bearing, says merely that "These rules
do not modify . . . the act of August 24, 1937, c. 754, § 3, relating
to actions to enjoin the enforcement of acts of Congress." Section 3
of c. 754, 50 Stat. 751, is the section that provides for a special district
court where an injunction is sought to restrain the enforcement,
operation or execution of, or to set aside, any act of Congress on the
ground that it is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.
In this present proceeding we are not dealing with an act of Congress
but with an act of the territorial legislature of the Hawaiian Islands.

Opinion of the Court.

to review in the Court of Appeals.23 It is the final order
of a district court although erroneously heard by three
judges instead of one and not appealable directly here
because not covered by § 266. But as a final order of
the District Court, it is reviewable in the Court of Appeals,24 and can be considered here.
Another procedural matter leads us to refuse consideration of case No. 474 on the merits. Respondents in
the United States District Court sought and obtained
injunctive relief from the enforcement of a territorial law
by a proceeding under 28 U. S. C. § 41 (1) on the plea
that the law violates the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment because respondents by the law were deprived of liberty and of property.2 The allegations of
irreparable injury consist of an assertion that it will be
necessary to incur a comparatively large liability for
building repairs and employment of teachers on the part
of the respondent schools before the Act will be violated,
sums that will be lost if the Act can be enforced constitutionally. The teacher claims to suffer irreparable
injury because he cannot follow his occupation. As the
District Court found irreparable injury to all respondents

the law or its administration. The Act covered all foreign languages.

Furthermore, there
is no problem as to whether or not there is an adequate

sole sanction, see note 5 supra, is by the institution of
proceedings in equity in territorial courts whereby the
extraordinary remedies of prohibitory and mandatory injunctions are utilized to stop violations of the Act. The

the circuit courts should have 'cognizance . . . of all suits of a civil
nature at common law or in equity' in cases appropriately brought in
those courts. This provision is perpetuated in § 24 (1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 41 (1), [now §§ 1331 et seq.] which declares
that the district courts shall have jurisdiction of such suits. The
'jurisdiction' thus conferred on the federal courts to entertain suits in
equity is an authority to administer in equity suits the principles
of the system of judicial remedies which had been devised and was
being administered by the English Court of Chancery at the time
of the separation of the two countries. . . . This clause of the statute does not define the jurisdiction of the district courts as federal
courts, in the sense of their power or authority to hear and decide,
but prescribes the body of doctrine which is to guide their decisions
and enable them to determine whether in any given instance a suit
of which a district court has jurisdiction as a federal court is an
appropriate one for the exercise of the extraordinary powers of a
court of equity. .. ."

Opinion of the Court.

respondents here, if such proceedings were brought, would
have such defenses as the laws of the territory allow,
including of course defenses based upon the present issues
of unconstitutionality under the Federal Constitution.
We are of the view, however, that the United States
District Court for Hawaii, as a matter of its discretion,
should have refused to grant this injunction. The complaint called for broad consideration of the application
of the Act to foreign language schools and teachers. It
had not been construed by the Hawaiian courts. Judge
McLaughlin pointed out in his conclusions of law on a
motion for preliminary injunction before the request for
a three-judge court that this law
... carries no criminal penalties for infractions.
Enforcement is in equity in the circuit courts of the
Territory. Plaintiffs have no reason to fear a court
of equity, and there is every reason to believe that
their constitutional rights would be fully protected
in the equity courts of the Territory and that an
appeal, if need be, eventually could be had to the
United States Supreme Court."
The statement applies as well to the final injunction.
Entirely aside from the question of the propriety of an
injunction in any court, 8 territorial like state courts are
the natural sources for the interpretation and application of the acts of their legislatures and equally of the
propriety of interference by injunction. 9 We think that
where equitable interference with state and territorial
acts is sought in federal courts, judicial consideration
of acts of importance primarily to the people of a state

or territory should, as a matter of discretion, be left by
the federal courts to the courts of the legislating authority unless exceptional circumstances command a different course. We find no such circumstances in this
case.
The appeal in No. 52 is dismissed.
The judgment in No. 474 is reversed and the cause
remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss
the complaint.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER,

with whom MR.

JUSTICE

RUTLEDGE joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

As to No. 52, I join the Court's opinion.
As to No. 474, I would leave the appeal now pending in
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to its adjudication there and not grant the petition for certiorari.
The power which Congress has given to this Court to
short-circuit the Courts of Appeals should not be exercised except for some compelling reason of wise judicial
administration. No reason is here present that would
not be equally available in almost every case which,
even though a constitutional issue may be involved,
cannot come here directly, but must first go to a Court
of Appeals. Congress decided not to provide for such
direct appeals here and we should not exercise our discretionary power to grant what Congress has withheld.
This discretionary power should come into play only for
those exceptional circumstances for which Congress designed it.
After finding that we are without jurisdiction to review
directly the decree of the District Court of Hawaii, the
Court in effect allows such direct review by not requiring
the appeal now pending in the Court of Appeals to run
its normal course of adjudication in that court. This
is justified on the ground that the case has been fully
presented in the District Court and here. But if we

FRANKFURTER, J.

would not have brought here an appeal undecided in
the Court of Appeals merely because it had been adjudicated on its merits in the District Court, there is no more
reason for doing so when a direct appeal from the District
Court has been improvidently sought here. Moreover,
the Court is not disposing of the case on its merits. By
lifting the case out of the Court of Appeals the Court
is assuming the burden of canvassing issues not dealt
with below. This entails the study of new questions and
the task of opinion writing. These are precisely the burdens from which the Court asked to be saved and from
which Congress saved the Court by the Judiciary Act
of 1925. If the regular course of proceeding were followed and the matter were to be disposed of by the Court
of Appeals, as it is now being disposed of here, the necessity for future consideration here might never arise beyond
that involved in finding no reason for granting a petition
for certiorari were one to be applied for. Drains on the
Court's time through jurisdictional misconceptions should
be strongly discouraged. We should follow the honored
practice of this Court in dismissing a proceeding that
should not be here ab initio, even though the Court's time
and effort had been expended after full argument in concluding that a case should never have been brought here.1
I Writs of certiorari granted because of an apparent conflict between courts of appeals have been dismissed because the existence
of such conflict did not survive argument. And for these reasons.
"If it be suggested that as much effort and time as we have given
to the consideration of the alleged conflict would have enabled us
to dispose of the case before us on the merits, the answer is that
it is very important that we be consistent in not granting the writ
of certiorari except in cases involving principles the settlement of
which is of importance to the public as distinguished from that of
the parties, and in cases where there is a real and embarrassing
conflict of opinion and authority between the circuit courts of appeal. The present case certainly comes under neither head." Layne
& Bowler Corp. v. Western Well Works, Inc., 261 U. S. 387, 393.

Syllabus.

If the attempt had been made to bring No. 474 here
prematurely it would surely have failed. It should not
succeed because No. 52 was improperly brought here.
Accordingly I agree with the Court in dismissing No.
52 for want of jurisdiction, and in No. 474 1 would deny
the petition for certiorari.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES
APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.*

COURT OF

Argued January 3-4, 1949.-Decided March 14, 1949.
A vessel owned by the United States and chartered under a bareboat
charter to an American corporation collided with a British vessel
in territorial waters of Belgium. The British vessel sank with all
of her cargo; her chief steward was killed; and the American
vessel damaged the bank of the river. Owners of the British
vessel sued the charterer of the American vessel in England, claiming damages of $1,000,000. Owners of the cargo of the British
vessel sued the United States and the charterer of the American
vessel in a federal district court for claims aggregating nearly
$1,000,000. Alleging that the value of the American vessel was
about $1,000,000, that the total claims would exceed that amount,
and that their liability under Belgian law was limited to $325,000,
the United States and the charterer petitioned the District Court
for limitation of liability under R. S. § 4285, as amended, 46
U. S. C. § 185. The United States posted no bond and the
charterer posted a bond of only $325,000. The District Court
dismissed the petition and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:
The District Court should not have dismissed the petition but
should have required the charterer (but not the United States)
to post a bond of $1,000,000, to guard against the possibility that
American law, and not Belgian law, might be found to control
the amount of liability. Pp. 388-399.
*Together with No. 130, United States v. Robert Stewart & Sons,
Ltd. et al., also on certiorari to the same court.
