RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS

ROWAN & NICHOLS OIL CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 681. Argued April 24, 25, 1940.-Decided June 3, 1940.
An order of a state commission for limiting and prorating the production of an oil field, fixed the maximum allowable to any well at
2.32% of its "hourly potential," but gave to "marginal" wells-those
which, if their low capacity were curtailed, would have to be prematurely abandoned-a special status, Allowing each of them production
up to twenty barrels per day. Because of the large number of such
low-capacity wells, approximately 385,000 barrels, out of a total
daily "allowable" of 522,000 barrels for the entire field, were exempt
from the "hourly potential" formula. A company whose wells were
favorably situated and capable of large production, but.were allowed
by the formula a daily production of but twenty-two barrels each,
claimed that the, regulation disregarded its right to the oil in place
within its ground; that it permitted others undue opportunity to
capture oil draining from its ground; that the "potential" method
failed to give sufficient weight to relevant factors in the measurement
of oil in place, especially to the depth of the company's reserves;
that only an allocation based upon acre-feet of the oil sand, or its
equivalent, would be reasonable; that the order was, in effect, an
allocation on a flat per-well basis, regardless of great variation in
the capacity of wells and the density of well drilling on different
tracts; that excessive drillings allowed by the commission as exceptions to its general spacing rule, enabled dens~ly drilled tracts, by
virtue of the "marginal" allowances, to drain away the company's
reserves; and that, for these reasons, the company's property was
taken without due proce of law. Held:

1. That, in view of the difficulties of the problem of fair allocation,
the speculation involved in an approach to its solution, and the
special function of the commission, a federal court should not undertake to determine it upon the conflicting testimony of experts.
P. 580.
2. In a controversy such as this, courts must not substitute their
notions of expediency and fairness for those which have guided the
agencies to whom the formulation and execution of policy have been
entrusted. Pp. 580-581.
3. Whether a system of proration based upon hourly potential is
as fair as one based upon estimated recoverable reserves or some
other factor or combination of factors, is in itself a question for
administrative and not judicial judgment. P. 581.
Inia domain of knowledge. still shifting and growing, and in a field
where judgment is therefore necessarily beset by the necessity of
inferences bordering on-conjecture even for those learned in the art,
it would be presumptuous for courts, on the basis of conflicting
expert testimony, to deem the view of the administrative tribunal,
acting under legislative authority, offensive to the Fourteenth
Amendment.
4. In making exceptions to its general spacing rule and general
restrictive production formula, in favor of small, irregularly shaped
tracts that, otherwise, might lose their oil by failure to drill or inability to operate at a profit, the commission was entitled to take into
account not only the individual interests of these small owners, but
also effects on the State's economy. P. 582.
5. It is not for the federal courts to supplant the commission's
judgment even in the face of convincing proof that a different result
would have been better. P. 583.

CERTIORAmI, 309 U. S. 646, to review the.affirmance of a
decree (28 F. Supp. 131) enjoining the enforcement of an
oil proration order.

with whom Messrs. Gerald C. Mann, Attorney General,
and W. F. Moore, First Assistant Attorney General, were
on the brief, for petitioners.

to recover substantially the equivalent of the oil and gas
originally in place beneath his land.
The respondent failed to establish that it is being irreparably injured by the enforcement of the proration orders
of the Railroad Commission, because the undisputed evidence shows that the respondent has suffered no physical
depletion of its lease, and has benefited from the operation
of the proration orders up to the present time.
Respondent failed to establish that it will be deprived,
by the'enforcement of the proration orders, of the opportunity of ultimately recovering from its lease an amount
of oil substantially equivalent to the amount of oil originally in place beneath its lease.
Respondent is without standing to attack the constitutionality of the proration orders, because it has benefited
from and acquiesced in the enforcement of the same
method of proration for over five years before bringing a
suit to set aside such orders, during which time property
rights have vested which would be destroyed by the invalidation of such orders.
Respondent failed to establish that the marginal or minimum allowable assigned to each well in the East Texas
field is not reasonably necessary in order to prevent waste
and the confiscation of property.
The well-potential method is the best practical means
of allocating the allowable pi, iduction according to the
productive capacities of the wells and, together with the
spacing rules, gives fair consideration to the recoverable
oil under each tract.
Prorating the allowable production in proportion to the
reserves of oil beneath each lease would be discriminatory
and confiscatory of the property of many operators in
the East Texas field and would permit operators in the
Fairway to recover much more than the equivalent of the
oil originally in place beneath their leases.

576

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Argument for Respondent.

310 U. S.

Mr. Dan Moody, with whom Mr. Rice M. Tilley was
on the brief, for respondent.
The Texas rule of property is that the owner of land
owns the oil and gas beneath it; that the owner of an oil
and gas lease owns the oil and gas in place beneath the
land affected by the lease.
The Texas law is that under proration the owner of
the oil and gas estate in land is entitled to "an equal opportunity with adjoining leaseholders of developing and realizing for his leasehold"; that he is entitled to "a fair chance
to recover the oil and gas in or under his land, or their
equivalent in kind"; that is, he is entitled to an opportunity "to recover a quantity of oil and gas substantially
equivalent in amount to the recoverable oil and gas under
his land."
The reasonableness of the potential method of proration is not material because that is not the method here
involved. -Approximately 99 per cent of the field "allowable" was divided among wells on a basis of 20 barrels per
well. Such a per well basis of proration does not result in
a distribution of the field allowable on a reasonable basis
as is required by law, and is arbitrary and confiscatory.
The method of proration-here enforced was not necessary
to prevent waste; it resulted in unnecessary and unreasonable drainage of respondent's oil by other operators and
prevented respondent's currently or ultimately recovering
its fair share or proportionate share of the recoverable oil.
Respondent repeatedly protested the inequities and unreasonableness of the method of proration here involVed,
and this suit to protect its property from confiscation was

timely.
By leave of Court, briefs were filed by Messrs. J. N. Saye
and W. T. Saye, and by.Mr. Norman L. Meyers, on behalf
of a number of owners ahd operators, as amicicuriae,urging
reversal.

RAILROAD COMMISSION v. OIL CO.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTFER

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question before us is the validity, when challenged
by appeal to the Fourteenth Amendment, of an oil proration order promulgated by the Railroad Commission of
Texas,
insofar as it applies to the respondent's wells.
To safeguard
its oil resources Texas has devised
a
regulatory scheme for their production, and has placed
its administration in the Railroad Commission's hands.
Revised Civil Statutes, Arts. 6014 et seq. In conformity
with this statute, which has familiar procedural provis-.
ions, the Commission in the fall of 1938 issued the
assailed proration order covering the East Texas oil field,
where respondent's wells are located. By this order each
well was allowed to produce 2.32% of its "hourly potential"-that is, 2.32% of its hourly productive capacity
under unrestricted flow. But the practical operation of
this order was largely cut across by allowances made to
"marginal wells." These are wells which, if their low,
productive capacity were legally curtailed, world have
to be prematurely abandoned. Therefore the Texas
statute gives them a special status. In accord with its
policy toward these marginal wells, the Commission freed
them from the burden of its hourly potential formula by
allowing them production up to twenty barrels a day.
Because of the large number of these low capacity units
in the East Texas field, approximately 385,000 barrels out
of a total daily "allowable" of 522,000 barrels were exempt
from the restricting formula, leaving only about 136,000
for the class within which respondents wells fell. Application to them of the hourly potential formula resulted
in an allotment of only about twenty-two barrels a day to
each well. Claiming that such a mode of regulation disregarded its right to the oil in place beneath its leases,
respondent sought and obtained a decree from the District

Court for the Western District of Texas enjoining the
Commission from carrying its proration plan into effect.
.28 F. Supp. 131. With modification not here relevant the
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 107 F. 2d
70. We brought the case here by certiorari, 309 U. S.
646, because of the importance of the matter in the administration of the Texas law and kindred conservation
statutes;
As sustained by the findings of the District Court and
accepted by the Circuit Court of Appeals, respondent's
claims may be summarized by what follows. The Commission's proration formula as applied permits other
leaseholders, more leniently treated, to capture oil at a
more rapid rate than is possible for the respondent,
thereby draining away oil which underlies -respondent's
leased lands. This is due both to the allocating formula
itself, and more especially to the permission granted
marginal wells to produce without limit up to twenty
barrels a day. The "potential" method of allocation fails
to give sufficient weight to relevant factors in the measurement of oil in place, especially to the depth of respondent's reserves situated in the "Fairway," a deep and rich
portion of the East Texas field. Only an allocation based
upon acre-feet of sand or its equivalent would be a reasonable means of measuring the oil in place beneath
respondent's leases; and any formula failing to do this
.takes respondent's property without due process of law.
Moreover, the allowance made to marginal wells absorbs
so much of the total "allowable" as to make the Commis,sion's order in effect an allocation on a flat per well basis,
regardless of great variation in the capacity of the wells
and the density with. which different leases have been
drilled. An important factor in producing this result is
the permission 'frequently granted by the Commission,
under power conferred upon it by statute, for departure
from its spacing and dkilling rules whereby the field has

573

Opinion of the Court.

been drilled with an irregular density. As a. consequence,
the more densely drilled tracts adjoining respondent'
leases may, by virtue of their marginal allowances, produce oil in such quantities as to drain away respondent's
reserves. Such is the basis for respondent's resistance
to the order.
Underlying these claims is as thorny a problem as has
challenged the ingenuity and wisdom of legislatures. In
major part it was created by the discovery of vast oil
resources and by their development under rules of law/
fashioned in the first instance by courts on the basis of
ahalogies drawn fron other fields of the common law. In
Texas, according to conventional doetrine, the holder of
an oil lease "owns" the oil in place beneath the surface.
Lemarv. Garner,121 Tex. 502; 50S. W. 2d 769; Stephens
County v. Mid-Kansas Oil & Gas Co., 113 Tex. 160; 254
S. W. 290; 1 Summers, Oil and Gas (2nd ed.), p. 16. But
equally recognized is the "rule of capture" which subjects
the lessee's interest ,to his neighbors' power to drain his1
oil away. Therefore, to speak of ownership in its relation
to oil, is to imply a.contingency of control not applicable
to ordinary interests in realty. See Ely, The Conservation of Oil, 51 Harv. L. Rev. 1209, 1218-22. Each leaseholder, that is to say, is at the mercy of all thos who
adjoin him, since oil is a fugaeious mineral, the movements of which are not confined by the artificial boundaries of surface tracts. This gap between the geological
nature of the oil pool and the formal surface rights of the
lessees is frequently bridged by the drilling of "offset,
wells" at the boundary of each surface tract, so that
owners may protect themselves against the exercise of
one another's capture rights. Partly to mitigate the undesirable consequences of this unsystematized development, the oil-prodicing states, Texas amng them, have
enacted conservation laws with appropriate administrative mechanisms to control drilling and production. -The

general scheme of the Texas statute- is not challenged.
Its constitutionality is here settled. Champlin Refining
Co. v. Commission, 286 U. S. 210,
But merely writing laws is only the beginning of the
matter. The administration of these laws is full of perplexities. State agencies have encountered innumerable
difficulties in trying to adjust the many conflicting interests which grow out of the rule of capture and its implications. The experience of Texas illustrates that a
brood of litigation almost inevitably follows the inherent
empiricism of. these attempted, solutions. See Ely, op.
cit. supra, at pp. 1225-29; Marshall and Meyers, The
Legal Planning of Petroleum Production: Two Years of
Proration, 42 Yale L. J. 701. For some years the Texas
Commission has been ngaged in experimental endeavor
to devise appropriate formulas for a fair allotment of the
allowable production. The commitment of 'such a delicate task to the administrative process has not escaped
challenge in the courts, and at times the challenge has
been successful. Compare MacMillan v. Railroad Commissmion, 51 F. 2d 400; Constantinv. Smitkh, 57 F. 2d 227;
Peoples' Petroleum Producers v. Smith, 1 F. Supp. 361;
Amazon Petroleum Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 5 F.
Supp. 633. But such cases are only episodes in the evolution of adjustment among private interests and in the
reconciliation of all these private interests with the underlying public interest in such a vital source of energy
for our day as oil. Certainly so far as the federal courts
are concerned the evolution of these formulas belongs to
the Commission and not to the judiciary. Except where
the jurisdiction rests, -as it does-not here, on diversity of
citizenship, the only question open to a federal tribunal is
whether the state action complained of has transgressed
whatever restrictions the vague contours of the Due
Process Clause may place upon the ozercise of the state's
regulatory power. A controversy like this always caUl

for fresh reminder that courts must not substitute their
notions of expediency and fairness for those which have
guided the agencies to whom the formulation and execution of policy have been entrusted.
General as these considerations may be, they are decisive of the present case. Both the District Court and
the Circuit Court of Appeals appear -to have been dominated by their own conception of the fairness and reasonableness of the challenged ord.r. For all we know, the
judgment of these two lower courts may have been wiser
than that of the Commission, and their standard of fairness a better one. But whether a system of proration
based upon hourly potential is as fair as one based upon
estimated recoverable reserves or some other factor or
combination of factors, is in itself a question for administrative and not judiolal judgment. According to the
Commission's experts, theories of alloation urged by the
respondent and accepted by the courts below would in
fact give to respondent more than its fair share of the oil
in the field. Respondent, the Commission's witnesses
contend, would gain undue benefit from the constant
eastward migrations of oil caused by the gradual influence
of subsurface pressure gradients-and this at the expense
of*other lessees in geologically less fortunate portions of
the field. The Commission's experts further insisted
that, though much technical progress has been made, estimates of recoverable reserves beneath the surface of a
particular tract remain largely an indeterminate venture;
and that hourly potential actually takes into account, at
least in some measure, all relevant factors for ascertaining
iecoverable reserves. Certainly in a domain of knowledge
still shifting and growing, and in a field where judgment is
therefore necessarily beset by the necessity of inferences
bordering on conjecture even for those learned in the art,
it would be presumptuous for courts, on the basis of conflicting expert testimony, to deem the view of the ad-

ministrative tribunal, acting under legislative authority,
offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment. CompareSouth Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., 303
U. S. 177, 191, et seq.
Equally enmeshed in a conflict of expertise is the claim
most vigorously urged by respondent that, taken in connection with exceptions made by the Commission to its
spacing rules and with the unrestricted twenty barrel.
allowance to marginal wells, the proration order substantially places production on a flat per well basis.
Such a result, according to respondent's claim as accepted
by the lower courts, gives a constitutionally inadmissible
advantage to smaller and more densely drilled tracts as
against those owned by respondent. But this claim really
presents a more specialized aspect of the general problem.
In. regulating flow of production the treatment to be
accorded to small and irregularly shaped tracts which do
not fit neatly into the Commission's general scheme for
spacing, has presented a difficulty almost as great as the
framing of proration formulas. Compare Walker, The
Problem of the Small Tract -under Spacing Regulations,
17 Tex. L. Rev. 157 (Supp. Bar Association Proceedings).
To deny the holders of these tracts permission to drill
might subject them to the risk of losing their oil in place
or of being put at the mercy of adjoining holders. In
many instances, therefore, the Commission has granted
exceptions to its ,general spacing rule on the basis of
which investments have been made and wells drilled. If
these wells, most of them small, were restricted to production on the basis of an hourly potential formula, it
might be unprofitable to operate them at all. Not only
are the individual interests of these small operators involved, but their effect on the' state's economy is an
appropriate factor to be taken into account when plans
are devised to keep the wells open.

RAILROAD COMMISSION v. OIL CO:
573

Opinion of the Court.

A flat per well allowance to these producers was not
an unnatural answer to the problem. Whether, as contended by the respondent, the maximum figure set .by
the Commission is too high in that it leads to the capture
of oil from beneath'its leases by neighboring operators,
and whether a lowel! limit might. suffice to assure profitable production-these questions take us into that debatable territory which it is not the province of federal
courts to enter. The record is redolent with familiar
dogmatic assertions by experts equally confident of contradictory contentions. These touch matters of geography and geology and physics and engineering. No less
is there conflict in the evidence as to the solidity of
respondent's apprehension that there will be drainage of
the oil beneath its surface by neighboring wells. The
Commission's experts insist that the threat, if existent
at all, is speculative, and that the Commission's power
of continuous oversight is readily available for relief if
real danger should arise in the future.
Plainly these -are not issues for our arbitrament. The
state was confronted with its general problem of proration
and with the special relation to it of the small tracts in
the particular configuration of the East Texas field.1 It
has chosen to meet these problems through the day-today exertions of a body specially entrusted with the task
'because presumably competent to deal with it. In striking the balances that have to be struck with the compli1

they have market outlets for permitted uses, to purchase gas from

cated and subtle factors that must enter into such
judgments, the Commission has observed established procedure. - If the history of proration is any guide, the
present order is but one more item in a continuous series
of adjustments. It is not for the federal courts to supplant the Commission's judgment even in the face of
convincing proof that a different result would have been
better.
The challenged decree must therefore be
Reversed.
MR. JusTIcE ROBERTs, dissenting:

The petitioners' proration order is challenged not merely
as unfair or unreasonable but as confiscatory of the respondent's property. Upon the allegations of the bill,
the District Court had jurisdiction. Although the problem of proration presented technical and difficult questions, and although the Commission was vested with a
broad discretion in dealing with them, these facts could
not justify the court's abdicating its jurisdiction to test
the Commission's order. The case was tried de novo and
neither the full record made before the Commission nor
its findings appear in the evidence, except for what is
contained in the Commission's orders. After aopainstaking trial, and upon detailed and well supported findings
of fact, the court reached the conclusion that the order
worked a confiscation of respondent's property. The
court said: "The respondents' [petitioners'] engineers
frankly admitted that the present scheme of proration
is nothing more or less than one on a per well basis."
Referring to such a basis, the court added: "It is sufficient to say that it takes no account of the difference in
the wells, of the richness or thickness of the sand, of the
128 F. Supp. 131.

location upon the structure, of the porosity or permeability of the sand, of the estimated oil reserves, or of the
acreage upon which the respective wells are situated.
The worst property is raised to the level of the best and
the best is lowered to the level of the worst." The court
concluded that the order operated to appropriate, for the
benefit of others, the respondent's oil without compensation.
The Circuit Court of Appeals approved and adopted
2
the findings and conclusions of the District Court.
The opinion of this court, in my judgment, announces
principles with respect to the review of administrative
action challenged under the due process clause directly
contrary to those which have been established. A recent
exposition of the applicable principles is found in the
opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis, written for a unanimous
court, in Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utiities Corp.,
300 U. S. 55, dealing with a proration order affecting
gas, entered by the same commission which entered the
order here in issue. I think that adherence to the principles there stated requires the affirmance of the decree.
