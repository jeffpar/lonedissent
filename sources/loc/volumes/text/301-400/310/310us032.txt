the shareholder could recover withdrawal value by suit. The
amendatory Act, here sustained, defined the receipts from one-half
of which withdrawals were to be satisfied; D'rovided that if in
any month the funds payable for withdrawals were insufficient
to pay all withdrawing members, they were to receive $500 each

matured shares; and so long as the funds of an association were

The legislation in question bears no reasonable relation to the public Welfare and is unjust and discriminatory, and the means adopted by the subsequent legislation are not reasonably adapted to the accomplishment
of its alleged purpose.
To delegate to the board of directors discretionary
power to allocate all of the income to reserves indefinitely,
is unreasonable and unconstitutional.
To delegate to the board of directors discretionary
power to prevent withdrawals indefinitely, is unreasonable and unconstitutional especially because the directors

Legislation which delegates to private boirds of directors of building and loan associations the unlimited discretionary power to suspend the prior laws regarding

time the applicable New Jersey statutes provided that
shares in such an association could be withdrawn -bygiving such written notice as the constitution or by-laws
of the association provided, not to exceed 30 days; that
withdiawals should be paid in the order in which notices
were received, with nol more -than one-half of the receipts
of any month being required to be used for payriient of
withdrawals, without the consent of the board of directors,
until the oldest unpaid claim of withdrawal had been on
file for six months; that no payment should be postponed
for longer than six months from the. date of notice; and
that any member who had given notice could sue and
recover the withdrawal value if it was not paid within six
months of the notice
On April 22;1932, these. statutes were amended in four
respects: (1) "total receipts" of an association, one-half
of which were required to be used for the payment of
withdrawals and which had not been previously defined,
were defined as income on authorized investments, dues
on shares of the association which were pledged with it
to secure loans, and repayments from loans; (2) if in any
one month the funds required to be payable for withdrawals were insufficient to pay all requested withdrawals,
withdrawing members were to receive $5070 each in the
order of priority until the fund for withdrawals was exhausted; (3) no withdrawals were to be paid if the funds
available for payment of matured shares were insufficient
to pay all matured shares, the payment of which had been
requested within thirty days after maturity; . (43 so long
as the funds of an association were applied as required
by the amendment, no member who had filed his withdrawal notice should have2 a right to sue for the withdrawal value of his shares.

310 U. S.

In 1935 another amendment was passed providing that
one-third of the "net receipts" of an association were to
be payable for withdrawals, with "net receipts" defined as
monies, other than borrowed monies, received by the association less operating expenses, payments on creditor obligations, payments for protecting the property of the
association and reserves for any of these purposes. At the
same time payment of withdrawals in the order in which
notices had been received was continued but the payments
were limited to $50 per member.
Minor amendments, not pbrtinent here, were added in
1936 and in 1937 the statutes, as they stood in 1936 with
some immaterial changes, were carried into a general revisioi of New Jersey's statute law.
On August 17, 1932, after the passage of the 1932
amendment, appellant filed a written notice of withdrawal with respondent. In 1939, he brought this suit
against respondent for the withdrawal value of his shares,
claiming that, in so far as any of the amendments referred
to altered the statutes in existence at the time of purchase
of the shares, the amendments were unconstitutional violations of the contracts clause of Article I and the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The allegations show that the Association was solvent at the
time of notice of withdrawal and has remained solvent.
The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint. The
Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed. 123 N. J. L. 356;
8 A. 2d 350.
The ruling was based squarely on the constitutionality
of the Act of 1932. The later acts were not referred to in
the opinion except by pointing out that the Act of 1932
would be found in the 1937 revision. 'The case is here on
appeal under ยง 237 (a) of the Judical Code. As this section gives a review to this Court only of state statutes held
valid by the highest court of a State against an attack for
repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States, we

deem ourselves limited to the Act of 19322 The question
.of the applicability to withdrawals of statutes on the subject which were passed subsequent to the notice of withdrawal is not considered in this opinion."
The New Jersey statutes concerning the regulation of
building and loan associations reach back many years
prior to the purchase of these shares. Beginning in 1903
general regulatory acts were passed at intervals with sections directed at the mode of withdrawal.' The form of
these statutes -and the judicial notice by the Court of
Errors and Appeals in the Bucsi case of the iml5ortance
to the State of New Jersey of building and loan associations makes clear that in .dealing in 1932 with the problem of withdrawals the legislature was faced with the
threat of wrecked associations and the consequent further
depression of real estate values throughout its area.
While the Act of 1932 now under review was not emergency legislation, the dangers of unrestricted withdrawals
then became apparent. It was passed in -the public interest to protect the activities of the associations for the
economic welfare of the State. It is also plain that the
1932 act was one of a long series regulating the many
integrated phases of the building and loan business such
as formation, membership, powers, investments, reports,
liquidations, foreign associations and examinations. We
are dealing here with financial institutions of major importance to the credit system of the State.'

Opinion of the Court.

310 U. S.

With institutions of such importance to its economy,
the State retains police powers adequate .to authorize the
enactment of statutes regulating the withdrawal of shares.7
Unquestionably for the future, the provisions of the 1932
act would be effective.' We think they were equally
effective as to shares bought prior to the enactment of
the statute, notwithstanding the provisions of Article
I, ยง 10 of the Constitution that "No State shall . . .
pass any

. .

. Law impairing the. obligation of con-

tracts'.-. ." This is so because the obligation of the
Association to respond to the application for withdrawal
was subject to the paramount police power. Beginning
with the 1903 act the State of New Jersey has laid down
specifically by statute the requirements for withdrawal.
The charter, by-laws and membership certificate ceased
to determine withdrawal rights. (See Note 5, supra.)
It was while statutory requirements were in effect that
petitioner purchased his shares. When he purchased into
an enterprise already regulated in the particular to which
he now objects, he purchased subject to further legislation upon the same topic?
In Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell10
this Court considered the authority retained by the State
over contracts "to safeguard the vital interests of its
people." The rule that all contracts are made subject
to this paramount authority was there, reiterated. Such
authority is not limited to health, morals and safety."

It extends to economic needs as well. 2 Utility rate contracts give way to this power,1 as do contractual arrange"
ments between landlords and tenants.
The cases cited in the preceding paragraph make repeated reference to the emergency existing at the time of
the enactment of the questioned statutes. Many of the
enactments were temporary in character. We are here
considering a permanent piece of legislation. So far as the
contract clause is concerned, is this significant? We think
not. "Emergency does not create [constitutional] power,
emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of
power." " We think of emergencies as suddenly arising
and quickly passing. The emergency of the Depression
may have caused the 1932 legislation, but the weakness
in the financial system brought to light by that emergency
remains. If the legislature could enact. the legislation
as to withdrawals to protect the associations in that emergency, we see no reason why the new status should not
continue. When the 1932 act was passed commercial
and savings banks, insurance companies and building and
loan associations were suffering heavy withdrawals. The
-liquid portion of their assets were being rapidly drained
off by their customers, leaving the long term investments

ment of the remaining liabilities. An acceleration or a
continuance o? this tendency to withdraw available funds
threatened a quick end to the abilit'r of the institutions
to meet even normal demands. Such threatened insolvency demands legislation for its control in the same way
that liquidation after -insolvency does. Such legislation
may be classed as emergency in one sense but it need not
be temporary. 16
This power of the State to protect its citizens by statu-torr enactments affecting contract rights, without a violation of the contract clause , of the Constitution, is
analogous to the power often reserved to amend charters.
Under this reserved power, it is held that the relations
between a stockholder or certificate holder and the corporation may be varied without impairing the contract
existing between the corporation and its stockholder or
member.' 7 The contract rights considered in Coombes v.
Getz"8 arose from a contract between a third party and
the corporation. And the power reserved against the corporation and its members was deemed to be ineffective
against a stranger to the reservation.
Appellant relies upon Treigle v. Acme Homestead Association"9as a determinative precedent in support of his
argument that the withdrawal arrangements between the
association and appellant were contractual and secure from
impairment by the statutory exercise of the paramount
police power of the State. In that case statutory changes
as to the right of withdrawal, similar to these involved
here, had been'made after the purchase of the shares. The
enactment in the Treigle case occurred after notice of

withdrawal. From all the circumstances of the Louisiana
building and loan situation at the time of the legislation
attacked in the Treigle case this Court reached the factual
conclusion that the withdrawal amendment to the building and loan statutes was directed merely toward a private
right and not deemed in the public interest.
It is to be noted that this Court was careful to point out
in the Treigle case 2 0 that where the police power is exercised "for an end which is in fact public" contracts must
yield to the accomplishment of that end.'
Certainly the protection of building and loan associations against the catastrophe of excessive withdrawal is,
today, within legislative power.
Separate consideration of the objection to the legislation under the due process and equal protection clauses of
the Fourteenth Amendment seems wholly unnecessary.
