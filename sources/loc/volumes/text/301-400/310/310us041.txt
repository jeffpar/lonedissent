withdrawal. From all the circumstances of the Louisiana
building and loan situation at the time of the legislation
attacked in the Treigle case this Court reached the factual
conclusion that the withdrawal amendment to the building and loan statutes was directed merely toward a private
right and not deemed in the public interest.
It is to be noted that this Court was careful to point out
in the Treigle case 2 0 that where the police power is exercised "for an end which is in fact public" contracts must
yield to the accomplishment of that end.'
Certainly the protection of building and loan associations against the catastrophe of excessive withdrawal is,
today, within legislative power.
Separate consideration of the objection to the legislation under the due process and equal protection clauses of
the Fourteenth Amendment seems wholly unnecessary.

entered in a suit by Bedford, Treasurer, against the Bank.
Mr. Walter W. Blood, with whom Mr. Frank N. Bancroft was on the brief, for appellant.
National banks may be taxed only as permitted by
Congress, and R. S. § 5219. as amended, measures that
permission. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316;
Bank v. Bennett, 284 U. S. 239.
The safe-deposit business of a national bank is a part
of its nationally chartered banking business, and. is a
banking function. Bank v. Dearing, 91 U. S. 29; R. S.
§ 5136, as amended; R. S. § 5228; National Bank v. Graham, 100 U. S. 699; Bank of California v. Portland, 157
Ore. 203.
The congressional grant of tax immunity extends not
only to the tangible property, shares, and income of a
national bank, but also to all of its nationally chartered
functions, including its safe-deposit business. The case
is entirely different from those in which an implied immunity may be claimed or asserted; and the tax is prohibited even though it be paid or payable by the user
of the bank's services. Federal Land Bank v. Crosland,

Opinion of the Court.

The express exemption in § 7 (a) of the tax Act from
taxation of safe-deposit services, should be applied so as
to avoid unconstitutionality, because by the Act and decisional law the bank is the "taxpayer." New Orleans v.
Houston, 119 U. S. 265; Opinion of the Justices, 88 N. H.
500; In re Atlas Television Co.. 273 N. Y. 51; Doby v.
Tax Commission, 234 Ala. 150; C'ovington v. Tax Commission, 257 Ky. 84.
Assuming that the bank is not the taxpayer and the tax
burden is not unlawful, nevertheless the other burdens
which the Act then imposes upon the bank, as the performer of national banking functions, render the Act
unconstitutional. The Act should therefore be construed as making the performer of services the taxpayer,
and as exempting all intra vires national banking services from taxation. In re Opinion of the Justices, supra;

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This appeal involves the validity of the Public Revenue
Service Tax Act of Colorado. The act, § 3, imposes upon
the services specified in the act. a percentage tax based
upon the value of the services rendered or performed by
any person subject to its provisions.

OCTOBER, TERM. 1939.

Opinion of the Court.

Section 5 (c) imposes a tax equivalent to two per cent
of the value of services rendered by "banks, finance companies, trust companies and depositories . . ." The per-

son rendering the services "shall be liable and responsible
for the payment of the entire amount

. .."

§ 6. He

is required to remit all taxes collected and due the state
from him to the treasurer less three per cent to cover
the* expense of the service. Under ! 6 (B) persons
rendering or performing the services are required "as far
as practicable,. [to] add the tax imposed . . . to the

value of services or charges showing such tax as a separate
and distinct item and when added such tax shall constitute a part of such value ofservice or charge, shall be
a debt from the user to the person rendering or performing service until paid, and shall be recoverable at law
in the same manner'as other debts." By subsection (d)
the person rendering the service is forbidden to hold out
directly or indirectly that he will assume or absorb the
tax. By § 7 the user may recover illegally collected
taxes. Where services are rendered which become a part
of an article subject to a sales tax, the services are exempt
and the person performing the service recovers where
they are illegally assessed. § 3. By § 12, all sums paid
by the user as taxes are public money and trust funds of
the State of Colorado. It is made a misdemeanor, § 17,
for any person rendering or performing services to refuse
to make the returns required. The state treasurer is
made administrator of the act and given authority to issue
regulations. § 19. The usual separability clause is contained in the act. § 22.
* The definitions of the act appear in § 2. By its subsection (c) the term "services rendered or performed" is
defined as those rendered for a valuable consideration by
a person covered by the act for the ultimate user thereof.
"The term 'user' shall mean the person for whom or
for whose benefit services are rendered or performed."

COLORADO BANK v. BEDFORD.
41

Opinion of the Court.

By subsection (e) taxpayer is defined as "any person
obligated to account to the state treasurer for taxes collected or to be collected or due the state under the terms
of this act." Subsection (h) provides for a credit on
future taxes of a tax paid on accounts eventually found
worthless.
Under the rules and regulations issued by the treasurer
on the Public Revenue Service Tax Act, the service tax
is construed as invalid as applied to so-called banking
services.2
Under rule 27, however, such service as the furnishing
of safety vaults by depositories or banks is held to come
within the act, and the two per cent tax applies to the
charges made for this service. These regulations were
approved by the judgment and decree of the trial court
and that judgment was affirmed in all-particulars by the
Supreme Court of Colorado.
While § 4 (a) makes, it unlawful for any person to
render the defined.services without "first having obtained
a license therefor,' the treasurer demands no license fe~es
from a national bank. Such exception was held proper
by the lower court
The appellant here, the Colorado National Bank, was
a national banking corporation duly organized and existing under the national banking act. The bank operated
a safe-deposit service under its own name and in the
building and vaults used for its other banking activities.
The rentals received for the use of that portion of its
vaults utilized for safe-deposit boxes were reported to the
Comptroller of the Currency as income in the bank; the
fixtures employed in the business are part of the assets of
the bank and are supervised by the Comptroller of the
Currency.

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

310)U. S.

The appellee Bedford. as treasurer of the State of Colorado and administrator of the Service Tax Act, demanded
payment from appellant bank of two per cent of the value
of the services rendered by the bank to its safe deposit
box customers. The bank refused payment and the treasurer brought this action under the Uniform Declaratory
Judgments Act (Colorado Stat. Anno., 1935, c. 93, §§ 7879) for a declaration of rights to the effect that the services performed by the bank are taxable pursuant to the
Service Tax Act. The bank answered claiming the state
statute as applied to it was repugnant to the Constitu"tion and laws of the United States; setting up the immunity of national banks from state taxation except as
permitted by R. S. § 5219; ' claiming that the safe-deposit
business of national banks was authorized by Congress and
therefore was part of its federally authorized business, immune from taxation whether the bank or the user of its
services is the taxpayer. The bank further contended that
even though it is not the taxpayer and the tax burden as
such is not unlawful, the burden of collection, report and
visitation materially interfere with the performance. of
its national banking functions. A general demurrer to
the answer was filed.
The trial court sustained the bank. The supreme court
first affirmed by an equally divided court and then on reS12 U. S. C. § 548.
"The legislature of each State may determine and direct, subject
to the provisions of this section, the manner and place of taxing
all the shares of national banking associations- located within its
limiti. The several States may (1) tax said shares, or (2) include
dividends derived therefrom in the taxable income of an owner or
holder thereof, or (3) tax such associations on their net income, or
(4) according to or measured by their net income, provided the
following conditions are complied with:
"1. (a) The imposition by any State of any one of the above four
forms of taxation shall be in lieu of the others, except az- hereinafter
provided in subdivision (c) of this clause."

hearing reversed and remanded, the case to the district
court. The trial court entered a second judgment declaring as prayed by the treasurer which judgment was affirmed by the supreme court on the authority of the former decision.
(1) This appeal is here under § 237 (a) of the Judicial
Code. The treasurer makes the point that as the federal
question raised was the immunity to the exaction of the
bank as a federal instrumentality withdrawn from state
taxation by congressional action, the determination that
the tax was on a non-banking activity foreign to its federal character and on the user of the services eliminated
the necessity of a decision on the federal question. As the
statute was held valid after the conclusion of the Supreme
Court of Colorado that the manner of state taxation of
national banks must accord with R. S. § 5219 and must not
interfere with federal functions,' it seems clear the federal
question as to the validity of the statute as tested by the
Constitution and laws of the United States was necessarily
involved and decided. This gives this Court jurisdiction
of the appeal!
Gully v. First National Bank,' relied upon by the
treasurer, dealt with the right to remove to a federal
court" because the cause of action arose under the federal
laws,"° but the issue here is the right to appeal where a
state statute is held valid against a defense of repugnancy to the same laws." The difference is brought out

in the Gully case, where it is said: "If there were no
federal law permitting the taxation of shares in national
banks, a suit to recover such a tax would not be one arising under the Constitution of the United States, though
thebank would have the aid of the Constitution when
it came to its defense." .
(2) The genesis of the preseit system of national banks
is the National Bank Act of4 June 3, 1864. It was
called "An Act to provide a National Currency, secured
by a Pledge of United States Bonds and to provide for
the Circulation and Redemption thereof." From this act,
correlated with the Federal Reserve Act, 4 there has developed the present nationwide banking facilities. R. S.
§ 5153 makes these associations the depositories of public money. Though the national banks' usefulness as an
agency to provide for currency has diminished markedly,
their importance as general bankers shows a constant
growth.' We may assume that national banks possess
only the powers conferred by Congress."6 These are set
out in R. S. § 5136 as frequently amended and include
"all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry
on the business of banking," with the proviso "that in

deposit business the association shall not invest in the
capital stock of a corporation organized under the law of
any State to conduct a safe-deposit business in an amount
in excess of 15 per centum of the capital stock of the
association actually paid in and unimpaired and 15 per
centum of its unimpaired surplus." 17 We have recently
found the authority to secure federal funds within these
incidental powers, coupled with a long continued practice recognized by the Comptroller of the Currency.18 The
right to accept special deposits is recognized by the banking act." These are monies and other valuables the
identical deposits of which are kept, preserved and returned in kind. It differs little if at all from a safedeposit business. The language of the proviso of § 24,
just quoted, is the language suitable to impose restrictions on a recognized power, not the language that
would be used in creating a new power. As the limitation on the power to invest in real estate protected in a
measure customers and stockholders from risky investments, " the banks" own investment in safety deposit
facilities evidently did not seem to Congress to require
the same regulation as the purchase of stock in a safedeposit corporation. A subsidiary safe-deposit corporation would give priority to the creditors of the subsidiary
over the depositors and other creditors of the bank itself.
The obvious fact, known to all, is that national banks do
and for many years have carried on a safe-deposit business. State banks, quite usually, are given the power to

vene to protect its instrumentalities from any other tax
which threatens their usefulness."0
Congress has not legislated against taxation of the customers of national banks. This Court has approved a tax
assessed upon the deposits of- customers of national
banks. "' By § 6 of the Colorado act the "person rendering
or performing services shall be liable" for the payment of
the tax imposed. But as subsection (b) of that same
section requires the tax paid to be added to the charges
for service "as a separate and distinct item" and makes
it a debt from the user of the services until paid, the tax
is upon the user of the safe-deposit boxes, not upon the
bank. Furthermore, as by § 2 (h) credit is given to the
bank for taxes paid on accounts subsequently found
worthless and the bank is in a position to require payment of box rentals and taxes in advance, there is no
occasion for a bank ever to have saddled upon it any part
of the tax burden.
In National Bank v. Commonwealth 24 this Court determined a similar question in favor of the validity of the
state tax. The case was decided in 1869. At that time
the applicable federal statute 29 read: "Sec. 41. . . . Provided, That nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent all the shares in any of the said associations, held by
any person . . . from being included in the valuation of
the personal property of such person . . . in the assessment of taxes imposed by or under state authority at the
"
place where such bank is located, and not elsewhere ...

each share. The same- statute enacted: "The cashier of

a bank, whose stock is taxed, shall, on the first day in July
of each year. pay into the treasury the amount of tax due.
If such tax be not paid, the cashier and his sureties shall
be liable for the same, and twenty per cent. upon the
amount; and the said bank or corporation shall thereby
forfeit the privileges of its charter."
A national bank refused payment on the ground that

it as a bank was not subject to state taxation. It was
decided that this was a tax on shares, that the state in
a legal proceeding against the shareholder could have
garnisheed the bank and that because the bank was a
federal instrumentality was no reason for not requiring
it to collect and pay over the money from the shareholder. A similar tax was upheld in Des Moines Bank
v. Fairweather."

The person liable for the tax, primarily, cannot always be said to be the real taxpayer. The taxpayer is
the person ultimately liable for the tax itself.: The
funds which were r:eceived by the State came from the
assets, of the user, not from those of the federal instrumentality, the bank." The Colorado Supreme Court
holds the user is the taxpayer.3 The determination of
the state court as to the incidence of the tax has great
weight with us and, when it follows logically the language
of the act, as here, is controlhing.'1 As the user directly
furnishes the funds for the tax, not as an ultimate consumer with a transferred burden but by § 12 of the act
as the responsible obligor, we conclude the tax is upon

(4) The tax being a permissible tax on customers of
the bank, it is settled by our prior decisions that the
statutory provisions requiring collection and remission of
the taxes do not impose an unconstitutional burden on
a federal instrumentality.2 Especially is this true since

FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.

No. 592.

Argued March 27, 1940.-Decided April 22, 1940.

As to casualty and surety risku in Virginia, insured against by corporations authorized to do business in that State, a Virginia. law
requires that the insurance shall be "through regularly constituted
and registered resident agents 6r agencies of such companies";
and that such resident agents shall receive "the usual and cu.toniary commissions allowed on such contracts," and may not
share more than one-half of a commission with a non-resident
licensed broker. Held:
1. That the regulation is constitutionally within the power of the
State, even though one effect of it may be to increase the cost of
"master" policies negotiated by brokers in other States, through
which an assured may obtain a reduced rate and commission by
pooling all of his risks, in and out of Virginia, in one contract.
