Opinion of the Court.

deficiency for a particular year is the sole question presented by this case. The Board held that it did not possess
such jurisdiction, but the court below reversed, 133 F. 2d
131. We granted certiorari, 319 U. S. 737, the problem being one of importance in the administration of the revenue
laws.
An audit made in 1938 of the books of the respondent
corporation disclosed an erroneous valuation of its inventory of June 30, 1935.2 Because of this error, respondent
had been overassessed and had overpaid its income and excess profits taxes for the 1935 fiscal year. This excess payment was not subject to refund because barred by the statute of limitations. On the basis of the adjusted inventory,
however, the Commissioner determined that there was a
tax deficiency for the 1936 fiscal year. The overpayment
of the prior fiscal year exceeded the amount of this deficiency. On appeal to the Board for a redetermination of
the deficiency, the respondent sought in its amended petition to have the 1935 overpayment applied as an offset or
recoupment against the 1936 deficiency. The Board, consistent with its past decisions,' refused to grant this relief
"for jurisdictional reasons."
We hold that the Board's position was correct and that
it had no jurisdiction to determine or to apply any overpayment of the taxes for the 1935 fiscal year against the
1936 deficiency.
The respondent filed its tax returns on the basis of a fiscal year
ending on June 30. The inventory of June 30, 1935, was common to
successive years, being the closing inventory for the 1935 fiscal year
and the opening inventory for the 1936 fiscal year.

OCTOBER TERM, 1943.
Opinion of the Court.

320 U. S.

The Board is but "an independent agency in the Executive Branch of the Government," 1 and the legislative pattern of its jurisdiction is clear and unambiguous. The
Board is confined to a determination of the amount of deficiency or overpayment for the particular tax year as to
which the Commissioner determines a deficiency and as to
which the taxpayer seeks a review of the deficiency assessment. Internal Revenue Code, §§ 272, 322 (d). It has
no power to order a refund or credit should it find that
there has been an overpayment in the year in question.
United States ex rel. Girard Trust Co. v. Helvering, 301
U. S. 540, 542. Section 272 (g) of the Internal Revenue
Code specifically provides that "the Board in redetermining a deficiency in respect of any taxable year shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other taxable
years as may be necessary correctly to redetermine the
amount of such deficiency, but in so doing shall have no
jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any
other taxable year has been overpaid or underpaid."
The Board's want of jurisdiction to apply the doctrine
of equitable recoupment in this case is manifest from these
statutory provisions. The Commissioner assessed a deficiency only for the 1936 fiscal year and it was this assessment of which the respondent sought a review. The
Board thus had jurisdiction to do no more than redetermine the 1936 deficiency distinct from any overpayment
or underpayment in any prior or subsequent year. There
was no occasion here for the Board to exercise its power
under § 272 (g) to consider any facts relating to the taxes
for the 1935 fiscal year." The redetermination of the tax
liability for the 1936 fiscal year was in no way dependent
'53 Stat. 158, 26 U. S. C.§ 1100.
aThe Board has not hesitated to exercise its jurisdiction under
§ 272 (g) to consider the taxes for other taxable years insofar as relevant to the correct redetermination of the deficiency in question.
See Evens &Howard Fire Brick Co. v. Commissioner, 8 B. T. A. 867;

Opinion of the Court.

on any prior tax assessment or overpayment. Likewise,
neither the fact that the prior overpayment could no
longer be refunded nor the fact that the overpayment exceeded the amount of the deficiency had any relevance
whatever to the redetermination of the correct tax for the
1936 fiscal year. The respondent, in other words, was
seeking to have the 1935 overpayment used, not as an aid
in redetermining the 1936 deficiency, but as an affirmative
defense or offset to that deficiency.8 This necessarily involved a determination of whether there was an overpayment during the 1935 fiscal year. The absolute and unequivocal language of the proviso of § 272 (g), however,
placed such a determination outside the jurisdiction of the
Board. Thus to allow the Board to give effect to an equitable defense which of necessity is based upon a determination foreign to the Board's jurisdiction would be contrary
to the expressed will of Congress.'
We are not called upon to determine the scope of equitable recoupment when it is asserted in a suit for refund
of taxes in tribunals possessing general equity jurisdiction.
Cf. Bull v. United States, 295 U. S. 247; Stone v. White,
Commercial Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 8 B. T. A. 1138; D. N. & E.
Walter & Co. v. Commissioner, 10 B. T. A. 620; J. C. Blair Co. v.
Commissioner, 11 B. T. A. 673; Greenleaf Textile Corp. v. Commissioner,26 B. T. A. 737, affirmed 65 F. 2d 1017; W. M. Ritter Lumber
Co. v. Commissioner, 30 B. T. A. 231, 277.
6As we said in Bullv. United States, 295 U. S. 247, 262, "recoupment
is in the nature of a defense arising out of some feature of the transaction upon which the plaintiff's action is grounded."
7Before § 272 (g) of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted, the
Board held that it had jurisdiction to determine an overpayment for
a year as to which no deficiency bad been found by the Commissioner
and to apply that overpayment against the liability for the year as
to which he had found a deficiency, thus giving effect to the doctrine
of equitable recoupment. Appeal of E..J. Barry, 1 B. T. A. 156.
Soon thereafter, however, Congress passed § 274 (g) of the Revenue
Act of 1926 (now § 272 (g) of the Internal Revenue Code) taking such
jurisdiction away from the Board.

Statement of the Cse.

301 U. S. 532. But its use in proceedings before the
Board is governed by the circumscribed jurisdiction of
that agency. The Internal Revenue Code, not general
equitable principles, is the mainspring of the Board's jurisdiction. Until Congress deems it advisable to allow the
Board to determine the overpayment or underpayment in
any taxable year other than the one for which a deficiency
has been assessed, the Board must remain impotent when
the plea of equitable recoupment is based upon an overpayment or underpayment in such other year. The judgment of the court below is therefore reversed and that of
the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
Reversed.
