MERCHANTS NATIONAL BANK OF BOSTON, EXECUTOR, v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.
No. 30. Argued October 19, 1943.-Decided November 15, 1943.
1. Section 303 (a) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1926, which allows
deduction for estate tax purposes of amounts bequeathed to or for
the use of charities, was validly implemented by Treasury Regulations 80 (1934 ed.), Arts. 44 and 47, which provide that, where a
trust is created for both charitable and private purposes, the charitable bequest, to be deductible, must have at the testator's death
a value "presently ascertainable, and hence severable from the interest in favor of the private use," and further, to the extent that
there is a power in a private donee or trustee to divert the property
from the charity, "deduction will be limited to that portion, if any,
of the property or fund which is exempt from an exercise of such
power." P. 260.
2. Under a trust created by will, the income was to be paid to the
testator's widow for life, and on her death all but a specified amount
of the principal was to go to designated charities. The trustee was
authorized, in his discretion, to invade the corpus for the "comfort,
support, maintenance, and/or happiness" of the widow, and was
directed to exercise that discretion with liberality towards the widow
and to consider her "welfare, comfort and happiness prior to claims

MR. JuscICE RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Ozro M. Field died in Massachusetts in 1936, leaving a
gross estate of some $366,000. In his will he provided,
after certain minor bequests, that the residue of his estate
be held in trust, the income to go to his wife for life, and
on her death all but $100,000 of the principal 1 to go "free
and discharged of this trust" to certain named charities.
Under the trust set up by the will, the trustee, petitioner
here, was authorized to invade the corpus "at such time
or times as my said Trustee shall in its sole discretion deem
I The $100,000 was to remain in trust, the income to go in equal
shares to his three adopted children and a niece of his wife, and on the
death of the last of these beneficiaries the corpus was also to go to
the named charities.

and/or happiness of my said wife, and it is my wish and
will that in the exercise of its discretion with reference to
such payments from the principal of the trust fund to my
said wife, May L. Field, my said Trustee shall exercise its
discretion with liberality to my said wife, and consider her
welfare, comfort and happiness prior to claims of residuary
beneficiaries under this trust."
In 1937 the trust realized gains of $100,900.31 from the
sale of securities in its portfolio.
In filing estate and income tax returns petitioner, which
was also Mr. Field's executor, sought to deduct $128,276.94
from the gross estate and the $100,900.31 from the 1937
income of the trust, on the theory that those sums constituted portions of a donation to charity and were therefore
deductible respectively under § 303 (a) (3) of the Revenue
Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 72)2 and §162 (a) of the Revenue
Act of 1936 (49 Stat. 1706).1

303 provides:
"For the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be
determined"(a) In the case of a resident, by deducting from the value of the
gross estate"(3) The amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers, to
or for the use of the United States, any State, Territory, any political

exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational

purposes, . . !"

"The net income of the estate or trust shall be computed in the same

Opinion of the Court.

The commissioner disallowed the deductions and determined deficiencies of $26,290.93 in estate tax and
$42,825.69 in income tax for 1937, but on the taxpayer's
petition for review the Board of Tax Appeals (now the
Tax Court) upheld the latter's contentions. The Court of
Appeals reversed the Board of Tax Appeals, 132 F. 2d 483,
and we granted certiorari because of an asserted conflict
with decisions of other circuit courts 4 and this Court.5
319 U. S. 734.
There is no question that the remaindermen here were
charities. The case, at least under § 303 (a) (3), turns on
whether the bequests to the charities have, as of the testator's death, a "presently ascertainable" value or, put another way, on whether, as of that time, the extent to which
the widow would divert the corpus from the charities could
be measured accurately.
Although Congress, in permitting estate tax deductions
for charitable bequests, used the language of outright
transfer, it apparently envisaged deductions in some circumstances where contingencies, not resolved at the testator's death, create the possibility that only a calculable
portion of the bequest may reach ultimately its charitable
destination." The Treasury has long acconinodated the
paid or permanently set aside for the purposes and in the manner
specified in section 23 (o), or is to be used exclusively for religious,
charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes. .. "

administration of the section to the narrow leeway thus
allowed to charitable donors who wish to combine some
private benefaction with their charitable gifts. The limit
of permissible contingencies has been blocked out in a more
convenient administrative form in Treasury Regulations
which provide that, where a trust is created for both charitable and private purposes the charitable bequest, to be
deductible, must have, at the testator's death, a value
"presently ascertainable, and hence severable from the
interest in favor of the private use," ' and further, to the
extent that there is a power in a private donee or trustee
to divert the property from the charity, "deduction will be
limited to that portion, if any, of the property or fund
which is exempt from an exercise of such power." B These
Regulations are appropriate implementations of § 303
(a) (3), and, having been in effect under successive reenactments of that provision, define the framework of the
inquiry in cases of this sort. Cf. Helvering v. Winmill,
305 U. S. 79; Taft v. Commissioner,304 U. S. 351.
Whatever may be said with respect to computing the
present value of the bequest of the testator who dilutes his
charity only to the extent of first affording specific private
legatees the usufruct of his property for a fixed period,
a different problem is presented by the testator who, preferring to insure the comfort and happiness of his private
legatees, hedges his philanthropy, and permits invasion
of the corpus for their benefit. At the very least a possibility that part of the principal will be used is then created,
and the present value of the remainder which the charity
will receive becomes less readily ascertainable. Not infrequently the standards by which the extent of permisthe Revenue Acts of 1918-§ 403 (a) (3) (40 Stat. 1098); 1921§ 403 (a)(3)(42 Stat. 279); 1924-§ 303 (a)(3)(43 Stat. 306);

Opinion of the Court.

sible diversion of corpus is to be measured embrace factors which cannot be accounted for accurately by reliable
statistical data and techniques. Since, therefore, neither
the amount which the private beneficiary will use nor the
present value of the gift can be computed, deduction is
not permitted. Cf. Humes v. United States, 276 U. S.
487.
For a deduction under § 303 (a) (3) to be allowed, Congress and the Treasury require that a highly reliable appraisal of the amount the charity will receive be available,
and made, at the death of the testator. Rough guesses,
approximations, or even the relatively accurate valuations
on which the market place might be willing to act are not
sufficient. Cf. Humes v. United States, 276 U. S. 487,
494. Only where the conditions on which the extent of
invasion of the corpus depends are fixed by reference to
some readily ascertainable and reliably predictable facts
do the amount which will be diverted from the charity
and the present value of the bequest become adequately
measurable. And, in these cases, the taxpayer has the
burden of establishing that the amounts which will either
be spent by the private beneficiary or reach the charity
are thus accurately calculable. Cf. Bank of America Assn.
v. Commissioner, 126 F. 2d 48 (C. C. A.).
In this case the taxpayer could not sustain that burden.
Decedent's will permitted invasion of the corpus of the
trust for "the comfort, support, maintenance and/or happiness of my wife." It enjoined the trustee to be liberal
in the matter, and to consider her "welfare, comfort and
happiness prior to the claims of residuary beneficiaries,"
i. e., the charities.
Under this will the extent to which the principal might
be used was not restricted by a fixed standard based on the
widow's prior way of life. Compare Ithaca Trust Co. v.
UnitedStates, 279 U.S. 151. Here, for example, her "happiness" was among the factors to be considered by the
trustee. The sums which her happiness might require to

be expended are of course affected by the fact that the trust
income was not insubstantial and that she was sixtyseven years old with substantial independent means and
no dependent children." And the laws of Massachusetts
may restrict the exercise of the trustee's discretion somewhat more narrowly than a liberal reading of the will
would suggest, although that is doubtful. Cf. Dana v.
Dana, 185 Mass. 156, 70 N. E. 49, and compare Sparhawk
v. Goldthwaite,225 Mass. 414, 114 N. E. 718. Indeed one
might well "guess, or gamble . . ., or even insure against"
the principal being expended here. Cf. Humes v. United
States, supra. But Congress has required a more reliable measure of possible expenditures and present value
than is now available for computing what the charity will
receive. The salient fact is that the purposes for which
the widow could, and might wish to have the funds spent
do not lend themselves to reliable prediction."° This is not

The Board of Tax Appeals found that decedent had adopted three
children-two girls and a boy-before his marriage to the present
Mrs. Field. She never adopted the children. The two girls were
married to husbands fully able to support them, and the boy was nearly
twenty-one at the testator's death.
Immediately after decedent's death the widow owned income-producing property worth about $104,000. Her total income from her
own property and the trust, and the amounts she has actually expended have been as follows:

Field purchased two automobiles and a fur coat, took two pleasure
trips, gave financial assistance to a niece, helped send a grand nephew
through medical school, and purchased a fur coat for one of her husband's daughters.

Douoms, J., dissenting.

a "standard fixed in fact and capable of being stated in definite terms of money." Cf. Ithaca Trust Co. v. United
States, supra. Introducing the element of the widow's
happiness and instructing the trustee to exercise its discretion with liberality to make her wishes prior to the
claims of residuary beneficiaries brought into the calculation elements of speculation too large to be overcome, notwithstanding the widow's previous mode of life was
modest and her own resources substantial. We conclude
that the commissioner properly disallowed the deduction
for estate tax purposes.
The deduction for income tax purposes stands on no
better footing. Congress permitted a deduction of that
part of gross income "which pursuant to the terms of the
will . . . is during the taxable year . . . permanently set

aside" for charitable purposes. In view of the explicit requirement that the income be permanently set aside, there
is certainly no more occasion here than in the case of the
estate tax to permit deduction of sums whose ultimate
charitable destination is so uncertain.
Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE DouGLAs, with whom MR. JUSTICE JACKSON
concurs, dissenting:
The Tax Court applied the correct rule of law in determining whether the gifts to charity were so uncertain
as to disallow their deduction. That rule is that the deduction may be made if on the facts presented the amount
of the charitable gifts are affected by "no uncertainty appreciably greater than the general uncertainty that attends human affairs." Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States,
279 U. S. 151, 154. In that event the standard fixed by
the will is "capable of being stated in definite terms of
money." Id., p. 154. The mere possibility of invasion
of the corpus is not enough to defeat the deduction. The

Tax Court applied that test to these facts. 45 B. T. A.
270, 273-274. Where its findings are supported by substantial evidence they are conclusive. We may modify
or reverse such a decision only if it is "not in accordance
with law." 44 Stat. 110, 26 U. S. C. § 1141 (c) (i). See
Wilmington Trust Co. v. Helvering, 316 U. S. 164, 168.
The discretion to pay to the wife such principal amounts
as the trustee deems proper for her "happiness" introduces of course an element of uncertainty beyond that
which existed in the Ithaca Trust Co. case. There the
trustee only had authority to withdraw from the principal
and pay to the wife a sum "necessary to suitably maintain
her in as much comfort as she now enjoys." But the frugality and conservatism of this New England corporate
trustee, the habits and temperament of this sixty-seven
year old lady, her scale of living, the nature of the investments-these facts might well make certain what on the
face of the will might appear quite uncertain. We should
let that factual determination of the Tax Court stand,
even though we would decide differently were we the
triers of fact.
