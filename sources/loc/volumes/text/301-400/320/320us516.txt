freight charges, for it may always insure their collection
by demanding the consignor's guarantee of all charges,
pursuant to ยง 7 of the conditions of the uniform bill of
lading, a provision which presupposes that the prepayment of freight clause is not as broad as the authorized
guarantee.
In the special circumstances of this case we have no
occasion to consider the broader contention of petitioner
that the prepayment clause contemplated an undertaking
upon its part to pay only the amount of freight charges
specified on the face of the bill of lading, whether or not
they were computed at the lawful rate on the shipments as
tendered and billed.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. T. J. Wills for petitioner.
Mr. Arnold Raum, with whom Solicitor General Fahy,
Assistant Attorney General Samuel 0. Clark, Jr., Mr.
Sewall Key, and Mrs. Maryhelen Wigle were on the brief,
for respondent.
MR. JusTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question presented concerns the propriety of the
respondent's disallowance of a deduction from income
which petitioner took in its federal income tax return for
1937.
In 1936 the Mississippi taxing authorities declared that
a solvent used by petitioner in its business was gasoline
within the meaning of a state law defining gasoline and
laying a tax upon its receipt and use. Accordingly a tax
was assessed against the petitioner with respect to the receipt and use of the solvent in 1936. Petitioner paid the
tax, and, in the same year, brought suit against the Motor
Vehicle Commissioner of Mississippi alleging that the
solvent was not within the comprehension of the state law
and that the Commissioner should be temporarily and permanently enjoined from future collections of tax in
respect of it. The Commissioner's demurrer to the complaint was sustained but, on appeal, the Supreme Court
of Mississippi decided that, on the pleadings, the solvent
was not within the definition of gasoline contained in the
state statute. After this decision petitioner denied that it
owed, and ceased and refused to pay, any gasoline tax on
solvent used by it.
In December 1937, on advice of counsel, petitioner
(which kept its books and filed its federal income tax
returns on the accrual basis) made book entries accruing
gasoline tax assessed by the Motor Vehicle Commissioner
in 1937. The actual accrual entries were made sometime
between January 1 and March 15, 1938, as of December 31,

1937, in the amount of approximately $21,000, and petitioner deducted this amount from income in making its
1937 federal income tax return, although the sum had not
been, and never was, paid.
In December 1938 petitioner and the Attorney General
of Mississippi filed an agreed statement of facts in the
state court suit, and, in the same month, the trial judge
entered a final decree perpetually enjoining the Motor
Vehicle Commissioner from assessing gasoline tax on the
solvent used by petitioner. This decree was subsequently
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi. In its
1938 federal income tax return petitioner, by way of compensating entry, included the sum of $21,000 as ineome
and as a recovery, in view of the Mississippi trial court's
decree of December 1938.
The sole question is whether the Commissioner was
right in disallowing the deduction for the tax year 1937.
The Board of Tax Appeals held that he was," and the
court below affirmed its decision.' We took the case because of a conceded conflict in principle with decisions in
other circuits.$
Section 23 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1936' permits the
deduction from gross income of taxes "paid or accrued
within the taxable year." Sections 41, 42, and 43 make
provision for tax accounting on the accrual basis, where
the taxpayer keeps his books on that principle, provided his
method clearly reflects his income in any taxable year.
The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1936 worked no
significant change over earlier Acts respecting the permissible basis of calculating annual taxable income. The applicable principles of accounting on the accrual basis had

Opinion of the Court.

been adduced and applied by the Board of Tax Appeals
in numerous decisions.5 It has never been questioned
that a taxpayer who accounts on the accrual basis may,
and should, deduct from gross income a liability which
really accrues in the taxable year.' It has long been held
that in order truly to reflect the income of a given year,
all the events must occur in that year which fix the
amount and the fact of the taxpayer's liability for items
of indebtedness deducted though not paid;' and this cannot be the case where the liability is contingent and is
contested by the taxpayer." Here the taxpayer was
strenuously contesting liability in the courts and, at the
same time, deducting the amount of the tax, on the theory
that the state's exaction constituted a fixed and certain
liability. This it could not do. It must, in the circumstances, await the event of the state court litigation and
might claim a deduction only for the taxable year in
which its liability for the tax was finally adjudicated.'
To this effect are the decisions of the Board of Tax
Appeals in numerous cases, and the instant decision was
in line with earlier rulings as to proper tax accounting
practice. Since the Board applied the correct rule of law,
its determination that the item in question was not
properly deducted on the accrual basis is entitled to the
finality indicated by Dobson v. Helvering, ante, p. 489.
The court below properly refused to disturb the Board's
