that the prosecution was based upon arbitrary and illegal
administrative action is not in keeping with the high
standards of our judicial system. Especially is this so
where neither public necessity nor rule of law or statute
leads inexorably to such a harsh result. The law knows
no finer hour than when it cuts through formal concepts
and transitory emotions to protect unpopular citizens
against discrimination and persecution. I can perceive
no other course for the law to take in this case.

UNITED STATES v. MYERS.
NO. 142.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.*

Argued December 16, 17, 1943.-Decided January 3, 1944.
1. Section 5 of the Act of February 13, 1911, as amended, creates an
obligation on the part of the United States to pay customs officers
the extra compensation therein prescribed. P. 567.
2. The extra compensation which § 5 of the Act of February 13, 1911,
as amended, requires that customs inspectors be paid for overtime,
Sundays and holidays, held payable, in respect of weekday service,
only for service beyond the regular daily tour of duty, whether day
or night; and for all service on Sundays and holidays. Pp. 573-574.
3. As the proviso of § 5 authorizes adjustments of hours but is silent
as to Sundays and holidays, the section's earlier grant of extra
compensation for Sundays and holidays remains unaffected by the
proviso. P. 575.
4. The requirements of § 5 of the Act of February 13, 1911, as amended,
in respect of extra compensation, apply to services of customs inspectors at bridges and tunnels. P. 575.
5. The extra compensation required by § 5 of the Act of February 13,
1911, as amended, to be paid for overtime, Sundays and holidays is
exclusive of the base pay. P. 576.

CERTIORARI, post, p. 722, to review judgments of the
Court of Claims in five suits to recover extra compensation
for services rendered by the plaintiffs as customs inspectors.

Assistant Attorney General Shea, with whom Solicitor
General Fahy and Messrs. Chester T. Lane, J. Frank
Staley, and Paul A. Sweeney were on the brief, for the
United States.
Mr. Robert M. Drysdale for respondents.
MR.JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
These five suits were filed in the Court of Claims by respondents, who are customs inspectors stationed at the
Port of Detroit.' They have been selected as test cases
from a larger number of similar suits. No significant
difference in the claims as to services rendered or otherwise
is pointed out to us, and we see none. Even the periods
for which recovery is sought, September 1, 1931, through
August 31, 1937, are identical. We shall therefore state
the issues and explain our conclusion in terms of the
Myers case only, and its determination requires a like
result in the other cases.
The precise issue is whether or not the provisions of § 5
of the Act of February 13, 1911, as amended,2 and §§ 401,

450 and 451 of the Tariff Act of 1930,' entitle Mr. Myers
to extra compensation over and above his regular salary
as customs inspector for night, Sunday and holiday servtion of passengers' baggage, such rates to be fixed on the basis of onehalf day's additional pay for each two hours or fraction thereof of at
least one hour that the overtime extends beyond five o'clock postmeridian (but not to exceed two and one-half days' pay for the full
period from five o'clock postmeridian to eight o'clock antemeridian),
and two additional days' pay for Sunday or holiday duty. The said
extra compensation shall be paid by the master, owner, agent, or
consignee of such vessel or other conveyance whenever such special
license or permit for immediate lading or unlading or for lading or
unlading at night or on Sundays or holidays shall be granted to the
collector of customs, who shall pay the same to the several customs
officers and employees entitled thereto according to the rates fixed
therefor by the Secretary of the Treasury: Provided, That such extra
compensation shall be paid if such officers or employees have been
ordered to report for duty and have so reported, whether the actual
lading, unlading, receiving, delivery, or examination takes place or
not. Customs officers acting as boarding officers and any customs
officer who may be designated for that purpose by the collector of
customs are hereby authorized to administer the oath or affirmation
herein provided for, and such boarding officers shall be allowed extra
compensation for services in boarding vessels at night or on Sundays
or holidays at the rates prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury
as herein provided, the said extra compensation to be paid by the
master, owner, agent, or consignee of such vessel: Provided further,
That in those ports where customary working hours are other than
those hereinabove mentioned, the Collector of Customs is vested with
authority to regulate the hours of customs employees so as to agree
with prevailing working hours in said ports, but nothing contained
in this proviso shall be construed in any manner to affect or alter the
length of a working day for customs employees or the overtime pay
herein fixed."

his assignment to duty, and, second, Sundays and holidays
without regard to the time of day when the authorized
services are performed. The Court of Claims entered
judgment for claimant for both nighttime and Sunday and
holiday services. 99 Ct. Cls. 158.
As the difficulties of applying the statute continually
arise at any port where the normal working hours of the
customs employees named in the section are not limited
to 8 A. M. to 5 P. M. with Sundays and holidays off, we
granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court
of Claims. We think the judgment should be reversed
as to nighttime services and affirmed as to Sunday and
holiday services.
The Port of Detroit possesses a wide variety of transportation facilities which connect it with Canada and
which require customs inspection of merchandise, baggage and passengers.' Evidently a rotation of assignments of posts and hours among inspectors at Detroit was
carried out by the collector. Mr. Myers had either night
or Sunday and holiday service or both at all the various
posts of duty which are listed in the note. He was paid
his annual salary throughout the period. This was a
base pay of $2,100, subject to additions and subtractions
which were generally applicable to government employees.' The claim is for service performed at night'The facilities were listed by the Court of Claims as follows:

At the threshold the Government urges that the statutes heretofore quoted do not create an obligation on the
part of the United States to pay the extra compensation
which is sought. A carrier may procure customs service
at night only by special license, and the statutes say the
extra compensation shall be paid "by the licensee" to the
collector of customs who shall pay the same "to the inspectors." ' As the extra compensation here sued for was
not collected in whole or part from the carriers concerned,
it is urged that the United States is not liable to the
plaintiff.8
The legislative history shows that the proponents of
extra compensation constantly made the point that the
Government would not be out of pocket by the legislation.' Where the United States stood as a protector of
Indians with statutory authority, carefully marked out by
a series of enactments, to collect sums for the benefit of

its dependents, we held that the Government's failure to
collect did not give rise to a liability. Creek Nation v.
United States, 318 U. S. 629, 637, 639. In that case we
said that authorization to collect did not create a mandatory duty, particularly where the Indians also might have
sued. Likewise, under similar circumstances, we have
determined that over-collection did not create liability
for reimbursement. United States v. Algoma Lumber
Co., 305 U. S. 415, 418-19, 423. But here the United
States is neither protector nor agent. It is an employer
who issues orders to the inspectors directing the performance of services. The work is done under the statutes.
No inspector may "receive any salary in connection with
his services as such an official or employee from any source
other than the Government of the United States." Act
of March 3, 1917, c. 163, 39 Stat. 1106. These payments
are made by the licensees to the collector at rates fixed by
the Secretary of the Treasury. This is extra compensation over and above the annual salary, not a payment
from licensees. Section 451 requires a bond from the
licensee to "pay the compensation and expenses of the
customs officers," but the payment must be made to the
collector under § 5. These facts lead us to the view that
the statutes create an obligation on the part of the United
States to pay to inspectors such sums as they may earn
under their provisions."
' 0 The First Deficiency Appropriation Act, fiscal year 1936, 49
Stat. 1636, June 22, 1936, and so within the period covered by this
suit, made the appropriation for the Bureau of Customs "available"
for payment of these claims. This has been continued, 56 Stat. 150,
155. The Treasury and Post Office Departments Appropriation Act
of 1944, Public Law 102, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., c. 179, slip law p. 7, 57
Stat. 250, 256, changed the form of the authorization from making
the appropriations available for this payment to a direct appropriation for payment. But see Hearings, Subcommittee of the Committee on Ways and Means (House) on H. R. 6577, 66th Cong., 1st Sess.,

We come then to an examination of the extent of the
obligation under the several sections heretofore quoted in
notes 2 and 3. From the earliest days, customs inspections have normally proceeded in daylight. By special
license, the work of the customs might be performed at
night." Inspectors were on duty continuously and at
first were paid on a per diem basis.2 By the Act of March
3, 1873, R. S. § 2871, the practice of licensees of paying extra compensation for nighttime service '" (between sunset
and sunrise) was formalized by authorizing the collector to
fix reasonable extra compensation and to collect and distribute it among the inspectors. The provisions of that
section gradually were extended to additional employees
and to different circumstances. 23 Stat. 53, 59; 34 Stat.
633. In 1911 further changes were made by an Act for
lading and unlading vessels. 36 Stat. 901. Section 5
under examination here emerges there in nearly its present
form. Extra compensation for nighttime services was
continued and was authorized for the first time for Sundays and holidays." The latest changes were made in
"I1 Stat. 665, § 50.
12The Government brief furnishes us a convenient summary of the
pay legislation: "The pay originally fixed at $2 per diem (Act of
March 2, 1799, 1 Stat. 704, 706) was gradually increased to a maxi-

mum of $6 in 1909 and $7.80 in 1923 (Act of April 26, 1816, 3 Stat.
306; Rev. Stat. § 2733; Act of April 29, 1864, 13 Stat. 61; Act of

March 4, 1909, 35 Stat. 1065, Sec. 2; Act of March 4, 1923, 42 Stat.
1453). By the Act of May 29, 1928, 45 Stat. 955 (19 U. S. C. 6 (a)),
customs inspectors were given fixed salaries and paid on annual basis.
Compensation of respondentk is $2,100 per annum, which may be
increased by promotion to a maximum of $3,300. Even prior to 1928,

when compensation was changed to an annual basis, customs inspectors, regularly employed and paid on a per diem basis, were paid
for 365 days . . . thus receiving the equivalent of an annual salary."

"Night" services became "overtime" services. Sundays and holidays were placed at the beginning
of the section in juxtaposition with "hours" which were
fixed at from 8 A. M. to 5 P. M. The last proviso vesting
authority in the Collector of Customs to regulate the hours
of employees "so as to agree with prevailing working hours
in the ports" was added." The tariff Act of 1922, §§ 401,
450 and 451, extended the provisions of § 5 of the lading
and unlading act so as to cover passengers and baggage arriving by vehicle. These sections as they now appear in
the Tariff Act of 1930 are in note 3, supra.
The Collector of Customs at Detroit, during the years
in question, assigned inspectors to tours of duty of eight
hours each day, which tours might be at any time within

four places for daytime service performed on Sundays and holidays,
even though within the 56-hour limit, but no excess pay was given for
nighttime service there on Sundays, holidays, or weekdays, performed
within the 56-hour period.
"After March 3, 1931, the date of going into effect of the Saturday

per week at the passenger station of the Michigan Central Railway,
at the Wabash Railway and Pere Marquette Railway ferries, and
at the Grand Trunk Railway Slip Dock, with conditions of excess

ulations 1931 and 1937. So far as here pertinent they are
substantially alike.18
The legislative history of the various acts makes clear
the intention of Congress to allow extra compensation
only when there are overtime services in the sense of work
hours in addition to the regular daily tour of duty without
regard to the period within the twenty-four hours when
the regular daily tour is performed. Congressman Moore
lThe references are to the 1937 editions:
"Art. 1242. Extra compensation.-(a) Customs officers and employees performing services at night, or on Sundays and holidays, for
lading or unlading of cargo or merchandise . . .shall receive extra

compensation, to be paid by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel,
or by the transportation company ... "
"(e) The extra compensation for overtime services is in addition
to the regular compensation paid by the Government in the case of
officers and employees whose compensation is fixed on the ordinary
per diem basis and those receiving a compensation per month or per
annum."
"Art. 1462. Hours of service.-(a) The official hours of officers,
clerks, examiners, and employees, except those hereinafter specified,
will be from 9 a. m. to 4:30 p. m., with a half hour for lunch.
"(b) The official hours of the following employees will be: Staff
officers, station inspectors, and inspectors to whatever duty assigned,
sugar samplers, samplers, laborers, storekeepers, and outside messengers, from 8 a. m. to 5 p. m., 1 hour for lunch; verifiers-openerspackers and openers and packers, 8 a. m. to 4:30 p. m., one-half
hour for lunch; customs guards not less than 8 hours.
"(c) The above hours may be extended as the needs of the service
demand, and such extension shall be without additional compensation,
except as provided for in the act of February 13, 1911, as amended
by the act of February 7, 1920.
"(d) The act of February 7, 1920, also provides that in those ports
where customary working hours are other than those above mentioned,
the collector of customs is vested with authority to regVlate the hours
of customs employees so as to agree with prevailing working hours
in said port, but nothing contained in this proviso shall be construed

explained the purpose as follows (Hearings on H. R. 9525,
61st Cong., 2d Sess., at p. 470): 10
"Mr. Fordney. The compensation for night work would
be more than twice the compensation for day work?
"Mr. Moore. I think not, but so long as a man works in
the daytime and then continues his work through the
night, if the expense does not come out of the Government
he should be paid double."
At the hearings, just prior to the 1920 amendment to § 5,
the understanding apparently was that extra compensation would begin only after a day's work of ten or eleven
hours. The pay of an inspector was per diem and was
paid for each day in the year. The Treasury Department
wrote to the Chairman:
"The department has under consideration a plan whereby boarding officers and inspectors of customs will be assigned to duty in eight-hour shifts and will not, therefore, be called upon to work overtime and no extra compensation paid to officers assigned to the night shift. In
order to carry out such plan it will be necessary to secure
additional appropriations, and pending the adoption of
the plan it will, of course, be necessary to detail inspectors
and other employees for night work." 20
There are other references in the hearings to the use of
the "shift" system to secure twenty-four hour service
without extra compensation. The legal basis for a collector's authority to assign inspectors in this way is the
last proviso of § 5, note 2, supra. It gives the collector
authority in those ports where customary working hours
are other than 8 A. M. to 5 P. M. to regulate the hours

of inspectors so as to agree with prevailing working hours
in the ports. In speaking of the provision after its adoption, an official of the Customs Inspectors Association
said at a hearing on an immigration inspectors bill (Hearings on S. 1504, S. 1774 and S. 2188, 67th Cong., 1st and
2d Sess., p. 130):
"To meet the condition at New Orleans, where the hours
of labor are from 7 o'clock a. m. to 4 o'clock p. m., this
proviso at the end of the bill was put in allowing collectors to adjust the inspectors' hours to the customary working hours at ports where the practices are different. This
proviso also applies to the Canadian border at places
where traffic is continuous during the 24 hours, such being the 'customary working hours'-and the inspectors
work in 8-hour shifts without overtime." 2
When we examine the language of § 5, either without
extrinsic aid or with the benefit of the historical and legislative background, we find convincing authority to
support the Government's view as to the meaning of
overtime. "Overtime" as we pointed out above was substituted by the 1920 amendment of § 5 for "nighttime"
services. The section requires employees to "remain" on
duty. The usual instance of the payment of extra
compensation would be for work after 5 P. M. by an inspector who had previously worked full time. The Government is correct in its interpretation of the last proviso of
§ 5 as permitting shifts in an inspector's regular hours of
work. Night assignments are an old administrative practice. It is true that the proviso apparently was passed
to meet a New Orleans situation but the language is
general. It does not restrict the collector to minor variations in hours. We are led to the conclusion that overtime, as applied to week days, refers to hours longer than
the daily limit of 8 A. M. to 5 P. M., nine hours with one

hour for food and rest. Furthermore, these tours of duty
under the proviso are movable within the twenty-four
hour period in accordance with prevailing working hours
and the requirements of the service.
We do not see that InternationalRy. Co. v. Davidson,
257 U. S. 506, decides otherwise. That was a suit to enjoin the Collector from enforcing the license provisions of
§5, note 2, supra,as to passengers and baggage, against an
international bridge. These were held inapplicable to
bridges. In speaking of § 5, the opinion stated: "This
substituted section defines what shall be deemed overtime,
how the rate of extra pay shall be fixed, and what the work
is, for which extra compensation shall be paid." It did
not, however, interpret the statute or consider the proviso
both of which we are called upon to do here. Contra, see
Ferguson v. Port Huron & Sarnia Ferry Co., 13 F. 2d
489, 492.
As to Sundays and holidays, we construe the statute to
require extra compensation for inspectors without regard
to the hours of the day or whether such services are
additional to a regular weekly tour of duty. Before § 5
there was no authority to pay extra compensation for
Sunday and holiday work. Revised Statutes, § 2871,
allowed extra pay for nighttime work only. Somewhat
indirectly the Act of February 13, 1911, gave Sunday
and holiday pay and the 1920 amendment made the
right to that extra compensation clear by saying extra
compensation shall be paid inspectors "who may be required to remain on duty between the hours of five o'clock
postmeridan and eight o'clock antemeridian, or on Sundays or holidays." This language and the Customs Regulations, note 18, supra, give an employee who works regular hours weekdays in daytime extra pay for Sunday and
holiday work. The statute covers also those who work
outside the statutory normal hours. Logically, if Sundays
and holidays were not to receive extra compensation, without regard to whether services on those days were over-

Opinion of the Court.

time, there would have been no occasion to add Sundays
and holidays to the overtime. Overtime would cover
every situation.
The proviso of § 5 does not give the Collector of Customs authority to make assignments which deprive inspectors of this Sunday and holiday pay. It authorizes
adjustments of hours but specifically forbids alteration
of overtime pay. It is silent as to Sundays and holidays
which leaves the earlier grant of extra compensation for
those days in effect. Overtime pay is also applicable to
Sundays and holidays when inspectors work longer than
nine hours with one hour for food and rest. The rate of
overtime extra compensation on Sundays and holidays
is the same as the rate for week days. The administrative
practice is uncertain. It does not support a contrary
conclusion. The Government cites excerpts from testimony on amendatory bills, not here directly involved,
which indicate the extra compensation is paid for Sundays and holidays.22 Findings 5 and 6 of the Court of
Claims, note 17, supra, show that extra compensation was
23
paid at times for Sunday and holiday services.
Two further contentions of the Government require
consideration. It is said that § 5 of the 1911 Act as

to a regular tour of duty at night or on a Sunday or holiday."
There are similar overtime acts in other services. They allow Sundays and holidays extra. Cf. 46 Stat. 1467, and U. S. Dept. of Labor,

OCTOBER TERM, 1943.

amended does not apply to services rendered at a bridge
or tunnel. This Court so held in 1922. International
Ry. Co. v. Davidson, 257 U. S. 506, 512. At that time,
the section's application was limited to "vessel or other
conveyance." Since then §§ 401, 450 and 451 of the
Tariff Act of 1922, 42 Stat. 858, 948, 954, and of the Tariff
Act of 1930, note 3, supra, have expanded the instrumentalities to include every contrivance capable of being used
as a means of transportation on land or water." The
difference in definition, we think, brings bridges and tunnels under the overtime pay requirements of § 5.
Finally the Government urges that in awarding compensation for "overtime" services credit should be allowed
to it for that part of the base pay received for such services. We think the Congressional intention to give extra
compensation precludes such a claim. The inspectors
in addition to their regular salaries for week days are entitled to the statutory additional pay for overtime, Sundays and holidays.
The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed and
the proceeding remanded to that Court for determination
of the claim of the inspectors in accordance with this
opinion.
Reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE is of the opinion that the
judgment should be reversed in its entirety and the suits
dismissed.
