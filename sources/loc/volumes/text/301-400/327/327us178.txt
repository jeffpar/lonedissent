of hours per week than were stipulated in the agreements.
It was not necessary for the circuit court of appeals to
consider the effect of this agreement because, in its view,
the Act did not apply to the respondent's employees.
However, under the view which we take, the respondent
is entitled to a decision on this further defense. We agree
with the district court that the agreements cannot supersede the Act and are not a bar to this action. Cf. Brooklyn
Bank v. O'Neil, 324 U. S. 697, 707, et seq.
For these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of
appeals is reversed and this case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.

MABEE ET AL. V. WHITE PLAINS PUBLISHING CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW YORK.

No. 57.

Argued December 5,1945.-Decided February 11, 1946.

1. The publisher of a daily newspaper with a circulation ranging from
9,000 to 11,000 copies, of which about one-half of one per cent regularly goes out of the State, is engaged in the production of goods
for interstate commerce within the meaning of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938. Pp. 180, 184.
(a) The maxim de minimis has no application here, because Congress made no distinction on the basis of volume of business, but,
by § 15 (a) (1) of the Act, outlawed the shipment in interstate
commerce of "any goods in the production of which any employee
was employed in violation of" the overtime and minimum wage
requirements of the Act. P. 181.
(b) Though it be assumed that sporadic or occasional shipments
of insubstantial amounts of goods were not intended to be included
in that prohibition, there is no warrant for assuming that regular
shipments are to be included or excluded dependent on their size.
P. 181.

Statement of the Case.

(c) These views are borne out by the legislative history of the
Act, by the express exemption by § 13 (a) (8) of any employee of
any weekly or semiweekly newspaper with a circulation of less than
3,000, the major part of which is within the county of publication,
and by the lack of any exemption for daily newspapers or on the
basis of volume of out-of-state circulation. P. 182.
2. The principles announced in Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297
U. S. 233, holding a state license tax on newspapers graduated in
accordance with the volume of circulation unconstitutional, are not
applicable here, notwithstanding the exemption of small weekly
and semiweekly newspapers by § 13 (a) (8) of the Fair Labor
Standards Act. P. 184.
(a) The Act does not lay a direct burden on the press in violation of the First Amendment, since the press has no special immunity from laws applicable to business in general. P. 184.
(b) The exemption of small weeklies and semiweeklies is not a
"deliberate and calculated device" to penalize a certain group of
newspapers but was inserted to put those papers more on a parity
with other small town enterprises. P. 184.
(c) The Fifth Amendment does not require full and uniform
exercise of the commerce power. Congress may weigh relative
needs and restrict the application of a legislative policy to less than
the entire field. P. 184.
3. The fact that the publisher of such a newspaper is engaged in the
production of goods for interstate commerce does not necessarily
mean that his employees are covered by the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938, since that is dependent on the character of their work.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Respondent publishes a daily newspaper at White
Plains, New York. During the period relevant here, its
daily circulation ranged from 9,000 to 11,000 copies. It
had no desire for and made no effort to secure out-of-state
circulation. Practically all of its circulation was local.
But about one-half of 1 per cent was regularly out-ofstate.' Petitioners are some of respondent's employees.
They brought this suit in the New York courts to recover
overtime compensation, liquidated damages and counsel
fees pursuant to § 16 (b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act
of 1938. 52 Stat. 1069, 29 U. S. C. § 216 (b). The supreme court gave judgment for the petitioners. 179
Misc. 832, 38 N. Y. S. 2d 231; 180 Misc. 8, 41 N. Y. S.
2d 534. The appellate division reversed and ordered the
complaint to be dismissed. 267 App. Div. 284, 45 N. Y. S.
2d 479. That judgment was affirmed by the court of
'About 45 copies daily. There appears to have been an out-ofstate circulation of 43, 46, and 40 for the years ending March 31, 1939,
1940, and 1941 respectively.

appeals without opinion. 293 N. Y. 781, 58 N. E. 2d 520;
294 N. Y. 701, 60 N. E. 2d 848. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of
the probable conflict between the decision below and those
from the federal courts.2
The appellate division applied the maxim de minimis
to exclude respondent from the provisions of the Act. We
think that was error. The Court indicated in Labor
Boardv. Fainblatt,306 U. S. 601, 607, that the operation of
the National Labor Relations Act (49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C.
§ 151) was not dependent on "any particular volume of
commerce affected more than that to which courts would
apply the maxim de minimis." That Act,' unlike the
present one (Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U. S.
564, 570-571), regulates labor disputes "affecting" commerce. 49 Stat. 450, 29 U. S. C. § 152. We need not stop
to consider what different scope, if any, the maxim de
minimis might have in -cases arising thereunder. Here
Congress has made no distinction on the basis of volume
of business. By § 15 (a) (1) it has made unlawful the
shipment in commerce of "any goods in the production of
which any employee was employed in violation of" the
overtime and minimum wage requirements of the Act.
Though we assume that sporadic or occasional shipments
of insubstantial amounts of goods were not intended to be
included in that prohibition, there is no warrant for assuming that regular shipments in commerce are to be included
Cf. Davis v. Goodman Lumber Co., 133 F. 2d 52, 53; Sun Publishing Co. v. Walling, 140 F. 2d 445, 448; New Mexico Public Service
Co. v. Engel, 145 F. 2d 636, 640.
3 See. 1 of that Act is a statement of the policy of Congress. It
states that the denial by employers of the right of the employees to
bargain collectively has the intent or effect of burdening or obstructing
commerce by "materially affecting" the flow of goods from or into the
channels of commerce or by "causing diminution of employment and
wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt" the market
for such goods.

or excluded dependent on their size. That has been the
consistent position of the Administrator. Interpretative
Bull. No. 5, par. 9 (1939), 1944-45 Wage Hour Man. 21.
His rulings and interpretations, "while not controlling
upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute
a body of experience and informed judgment to which
courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance."
Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140.
We stated in United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 123,
"Congress, to attain its objective in the suppression of
nationwide competition in interstate commerce by goods
produced under substandard labor conditions, has made
no distinction as to the volume or amount of shipments
in the commerce or of production for commerce by any
particular shipper or producer. It recognized that in
present-day industry, competition by a small part may
affect the whole and that the total effect of the competition
of many small producers may be great." And see WarrenBradshaw Co. v. Hall, 317 U. S. 88, 91. That view is
borne out by the legislative history of the Act. Earlier
drafts had embodied the "substantial" standard.4 These
4 See, for example, H. R. 7200, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., introduced
May 24, 1937. It provided for a Labor Standards Board to administer the Act. The Board was to be given the power to establish
minimum wages when it found, inter alia, that wages lower than a
minimum fair wage were paid to employees "engaged in the production
of goods which are sold or shipped to a substantial extent in interstate
commerce . . ." §5 (a).
The Confidential Committee Print of April 13, 1938, containing a
proposed amendment to S.2475, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., and embodied
in the Committee Print of April 15, 1938, S. 2475, 75th Cong., 3d
Sess., would have limited the applicability of the Act to employers
"engaged in commerce in any industry affecting commerce ..."
§§ 4, 5. It was further provided by § 6 of the draft that the Secretary of Labor should, after notice and hearing, determine the relation
of the various industries to commerce. Only if the Secretary found
that the industry was (a) "dependent for its existence upon substantial
purchases or sales of goods in commerce and upon transportation in

were omitted from the coverage provisions of the one
which became the law. Moreover, one of the exemptions
written into the Act extends to "any employee employed
in connection with the publication of any weekly or semiweekly newspaper with a circulation of less than three
thousand the major part of which circulation is within the
county where printed and published . . ." § 13 (a) (8).
Representative Creal of Kentucky proposed this exemption. He stated that "under this bill, because 1 or 2 percent of a paper's circulation goes outside to people who
want to get the home-town paper to see whether or not
Lucy got married, or whether Sally's baby has been born
yet, because that infinitesimal bit of their business is with
people outside the county, these publishers fall under the
provisions of this bill, when on each side of this little
printshop are the butcher and the baker, who are exempt
and who are financially better fixed than he is." 83 Cong.
Rec. p. 7445. No such exemption for daily newspapers
was granted.' No exemption on the basis of volume of
out-of-state circulation was written into the Act. Rather
the exemption of the small weeklies or semi-weeklies
seems to have been adopted on the assumption that without it a newspaper with a regular out-of-state circulation,
no matter how small, would be under the Act. The choice
Congress made was not the exemption of newspapers with
small out-of-state circulations but the exemption of certain types of small newspapers. We would change the
nature of the exemption which Congress saw fit to grant,
commerce," or (b) "Nation-wide in .. .scope," or (c) related to
commerce "in other respects close and substantial," could the Secretary issue an order declaring the industry to be one affecting commerce and thus within the purview of the Act.
5A number of bills have been introduced since the passage of the
Act to secure a similar exemption for daily newspapers, but none of
them has passed. See H. R. 7340, 76th Cong., 1st Sess.; S.4385, 76th
Cong., 3d Sess.; H. R. 64, H. R. 4208, S.1310, S.284, 77th Cong.,
1st Sess.

if we applied the maxim de minimis to this type of case.
We would also disregard the plain language of § 15 (a) (1)
prohibiting the shipment in commerce of "any goods" in,
the production of which "any employee" was employed
in violation of the overtime and minimum wage requirements of the Act.
Respondent argues that to bring it under the Act, while
the small weeklies or semi-weeklies are exempt by reason
of § 13 (a) (8), is to sanction a discrimination against the
daily papers in violation of the principles announced in
Grosjeanv. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233. Volume of
circulation, frequency of issue, and area of distribution are
said to be an improper basis of classification. Moreover,
it is said that the Act lays a direct burden on the press in
violation of the First Amendment. The Grosjean case
is not in point here. There the press was singled out for
special taxation and the tax was graduated in accordance
with volume of circulation. No such vice inheres in this
legislation. As the press has business aspects, it has no
special immunity from laws applicable to business in
general. Associated Press v. Labor Board, 301 U. S. 103,
132-133. And the exemption of small weeklies and
semi-weeklies is not a "deliberate and calculated device"
to penalize a certain group of newspapers. Grosjean v.
AmericanPress Co., supra,p. 250. As we have seen, it was
inserted to put those papers more on a parity with other
small town enterprises. 83 Cong. Rec. 7445. The Fifth
Amendment does not require full and uniform exercise of
the commerce power. Congress may weigh relative needs
and restrict the application of a legislative policy to less
than the entire field. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301
U. S. 548; Currinv. Wallace, 306 U. S. 1, 13-14.
We hold that respondent is engaged in the production of
goods for commerce. That, of course, does not mean that
these petitioners, its employees, are covered by the Act.
The applicability of the Act to them is dependent on the

U. S. 517, 524; Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., supra,
pp. 571-572. We express no opinion on that phase of the
case, as the New York appellate courts did notpass on it.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON took no part in the consideration

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY,

dissenting.

I agree that to print approximately 10,000 newspapers
a day and regularly to send 45 of them, or 1/2 of 1%, out
of the State is to produce goods for interstate commerce.
But I cannot agree that Congress meant to include a business of that nature within the ambit of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938.
This Court, in Labor Board v. Fainblatt,306 U. S. 601,
606, stated that "The amount of the commerce regulated
is of special significance only to the extent that Congress
may be taken to have excluded commerce of small volume
from the operation of its regulatory measure by express
provision or fair implication." Concededly, Congress has
not excluded commerce of small volume from the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act by "express provision." But certainly the "fair implication" is one of
exclusion. On numerous occasions we have pointed out
that Congress in this Act did not exercise the full scope
of its commerce power, Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316
U. S. 517, 522-523, and that Congress plainly indicated
its purpose to leave local business to the protection of
the States so far as wage and hour problems were concerned, Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U. S. 564,
570; Phillips Co. v. Walling, 324 U. S. 490, 497.

In my opinion, a company that produces 991/2% of its
products for local commerce is essentially and realistically
a local business. True, 1/2 of 1% of its production is for
interstate commerce, thus subjecting it to the constiiutional power of Congress when and if exercised. But that
fact does not make it any less a local business, which we
have said Congress plainly excluded from this Act.
I would therefore affirm the judgment below in this
respect.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE TENTH CIRCUIT.*

Argued October 17, 18, 1945.-Decided February 11, 1946.
1. The Fair Labor Standards Act, as applied to the business of publishing and distributing newspapers, does not violate the First or
Fifth Amendment or exceed the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. P. 192.
2. The provisions of § 11 (a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, authorizing the Administrator to investigate conditions and practices
of employment in any industry subject to the Act, and of § 9,
incorporating the provisions of § 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act authorizing the issuance and judicial enforcement of
subpoenas, do not violate the prohibitions of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures or any other
provision of the Constitution. Pp. 194, 208, 214.
3. A review of the cases applicable to the production of corporate
records and papers in response to a subpoena or order authorized
by law and safeguarded by judicial sanction discloses that they
hold, in effect, that:
(a) The Fifth Amendment affords no protection by virtue of
the self-incrimination provision, whether for the corporation or for
its officers. P. 208.
