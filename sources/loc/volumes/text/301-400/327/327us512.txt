COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v.
FISHER ET AL., EXECUTORS.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 452.

Argued February 27, 1946.-Decided March 11, 1946.

1. In computing under § 115 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1934 the
amount of "earnings or profits" distributed by a family investment
corporation with respect to securities which it had acquired by taxfree exchanges for its own stock, the basis is the transferor's cost
rather than the value of the securities at the time of their acquisition
by the corporation. Commissioner v. Wheeler, 324 U. S. 542.
P. 514.
2. Where a distribution of assets by a family investment corporation
to one of its stockholders in 1934 imposed a tax liability on him
under the Revenue Act of 1934, as interpreted in Commissioner v.
Wheeler, 324 U. S. 542, the taxpayer (whose liability was pending
before the Tax Court on September 20, 1940) was not exempted
from liability by the proviso of § 501 (c) of the Second Revenue
Act of 1940 to the effect that nothing therein "shall affect the tax
liability of any taxpayer for any year which, on September 20, 1940,
was pending before . . . the Board of Tax Appeals, or any court."
P. 514.
(a) That proviso does not grant a special tax exemption to taxpayers who happened to have tax litigation pending in September
1940. P. 514.
(b) It means that the enactment of the 1940 Act was not to
affect the tax liability of those who had cases pending before the
Board or courts, whatever that tax liability may have been under
the earlier revenue laws. P. 515.
150 F. 2d 198, reversed.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed an in-

come tax deficiency against respondents. The Tax Court
overruled the Commissioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 150 F. 2d 198. This Court granted certiorari. 326 U. S. 710. Reversed, p. 515.

JUSTICE

BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

In 1934 the Senior Investment Corporation, organized
in 1929 by one Fisher and his wife for family investment
purposes, distributed to Fisher 43,300 shares of General
Motors stock valued at $1,723,881.25. Fisher and his wife
made a joint tax return but did not report this amount as
income. The taxpayers contended that since the Senior
Investment Corporation showed a book deficit for 1934,
the distribution in question was a "capital distribution"
and not a corporate dividend from "earnings or profits,"
which latter was the type of distribution taxable under
§ 115 (a) of the then controlling tax law. 48 Stat. 680,
711. The Commissioner decided that the following circumstances justified a finding that the distribution was
taxable as a dividend from "earnings or profits": When
the Senior Investment Corporation was organized Fisher
and his wife paid for their shares of stock with securities
which had cost them $14,500,000 but had by the date
of organization acquired a market value of $88,000,000.
To show that the corporation had a deficit and that consequently the distribution of General Motors stock was
not from "earnings or profits," the taxpayers used the corporation's computation based on the $88,000,000 rather
than the $14,500,000 figure. The Commissioner decided
that the $14,500,000 cost to Fisher and his wife of the securities they transferred to the corporation in exchange for
shares of its stock was the proper base for ascertaining
whether the corporation could make a distribution from
profits; that the use of that figure would show a surplus
in 1934; and that the distribution of the General Motors

stock was therefore a taxable dividend from "earnings or
profits." On review the Tax Court following its prior
holdings rejected the Commissioner's argument and decided for the respondents. The Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed. 150 F. 2d 198.
Since § 112 of the Revenue Act of 1934 did not tax the
gain resulting from transfers of property to a corporation
in exchange for stock in that corporation, it is obvious that
rejection of the Commissioner's contention would result in
permitting the § 112 exemption to be used as a device for
evading taxes Congress intended to impose on many gains
actually realized from sales of property. But we upheld
the views urged by the Commissioner here, in Commissioner v. Wheeler, 324 U. S. 542, decided on the same day
that the Circuit Court of Appeals handed down its decision in this case. In that case we held that in the Second
Revenue Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 974, 1004-1005, Congress
clarified its original purpose in enacting the 1934 Act and
others to require that corporate earnings be computed on
a basis of cost of the property to transferors like Fisher.
That decision would have controlled the disposition of this
case were it not for the fact that on rehearing the Circuit
Court of Appeals held that a proviso in the Second Revenue Act of 1940 excepted taxpayers like Fisher from liability under the Revenue Act of 1934. That proviso
stated that the 1940 Act should not "affect the tax liability
of any taxpayer for any year which, on September 20, 1940,
was pending before, or was theretofore determined by, the
Board of Tax Appeals, or any court of the United States."
This case was pending before the Tax Court on September
20, 1940, and respondents here contend that the proviso
was intended to exempt Fisher from the tax liability to
which he weuld otherwise be subject.
In Other words, respondents assert that Congress intended by the proviso to pick out a small group of tax-

payers and award them special tax exemptions which the
whole Act was designed to deny all other taxpayers who
did not happen to have tax litigation pending in September 1940. The proviso indicates no such purpose.
The proviso means what it says, that the enactment of
the 1940 Act was not to affect the tax liability of those
who had cases before the Board or courts, whatever that
tax liability under the earlier revenue laws. Under those
earlier laws as interpreted by us in the Wheeler case, the
distribution of General Motors stock to Fisher imposed on
him a tax liability which remained unaffected by the enactment of the 1940 statute.
Reversed.

UNITED STATES ET AL. v. PIERCE AUTO FREIGHT
LINES, INC. ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON.
No. 74.

Argued January 28, 1946.-Decided March 11, 1946.

1. Each of two motor carriers made application to the Interstate
Commerce Commission under Part II of the Interstate Commerce
Act for a permit to operate between points A and C. One was
then operating between A and B; the other between B and C;
and they operated joint service between A and C by freight interchange. Each applicant opposed the other's application, and competing carriers opposed both. The applications were heard
separately by different joint boards but were dealt with by the Commission in a single report. Held that 'an order of the Commission
granting both applications was valid. Pp. 517, 523.
2. Neither the fact that the Commission dealt with both applications
in one report nor the fact that the Commission granted both applications invalidated its order. P. 523.
