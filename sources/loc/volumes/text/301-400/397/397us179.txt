CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 63.

Argued November 17, 1969-Decided March 3, 1970

Respondents owned commercial fishing boats, the fishing being done
through oral contractual arrangements with boat c7tains who
staffed and provisioned the boats and managed their day-to-day
operation. The captains, without an earnings guarantee if they
failed to catch fish, agreed to make fishing trips for the season
and to return the catches to plants designated by respondents.
The plants paid respondents according to the volume of the
catch and respondents paid the captains and crews on the same
basis according to previously negotiated terms. Respondents filed
tax returns as employers under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act
(FUTA), and paid the employer's share of the taxes due on the
earnings of the captains and crews. Those statutes define "employee" as any individual who has employee status under "the
usual common law rules" applicable to a determination of the
master-servant relationship. Respondents, after making refund
claims, sued for refunds in the District Court, which determined
that the captains and crews were not respondents' employees
under those statutes, holding that the statutes' prescription of
"common law rules" barred application of maritime, standards.
The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: The status of the captains
and crews under the FICA and FUTA must, in this instance,- be
determined under the standards of maritime law, which is the
common law of seafaring men. Pp. 182-194.
402 F. 2d 956, reversed and remanded.

Solicitor General Griswold argued the cause for the
United States. With him on the briefs were Assistant
Attorney General Walters, Harris Weinstein, Matthew J.
Zinn, Louis M. Kauder, and Robert I. Waxman.

Joseph J. Lyman argued the cause and filed a brief
for respondents.

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
Opinion of the Court

397 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The respondents in this case, which was consolidated
below, own boats that are. used in commercial fishing
in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Their
arrangements,
fishing is carried out through contractual
shaped by established custom, with boat captains, who
man the boats and manage their day-to-day operatiop.
The question before the Court is whether the captains
and crewmen of the boats are the "employees" of the
respondents within the provisions of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) 1 and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), which impose taxes on
employers to finance government benefits for employees.

I
During the taxable periods involved here," the respondents' vessels were engaged in fishing for menhaden,
a nonedible fish that is processed and used for various
industrial purposes. The owner of each vessel equipped
the vessel and secured the services of an experienced
fisherman to be captain. The captain then assembled
a crew. The captain customarily served on the same
vessel for a full season, and occasionally for several consecutive seasons, although the oral arrangements between
owners and captains permitted either to terminate the
relationship at the end of any fishing trip. The fishing
trips lasted from one to several days.
126 U. S. C. § 3101 et seq.
2 26 U. S. C. § 3301 et seq.

sThe District Court found that the periods were, for different
respondents, January 1, 1956, through December 31, 1956, and
July 1, 1957, through December 1, 1958.

UNITED STATES v. WEBB, INC.
179

Opinion of the Court

The vessels were operated from docking facilities
owned by fish-processing plants, and discharged their
catch at these plants upon the completion of each trip.
The plants paid respondents for the fish according to
the volume of the catch, and respondents paid the captains and crews on the same basis, following terms that
had been negotiated in advance. Neither captains nor
crews were guaranteed any earnings if they failed to
catch fish. While respondents determined the plant to
which the vessels would report and generally where and
when the fishing would, take place, the captains managed the details of the operation of the boats and the
manner of fishing.
Respondents filed tax returns as employers under the
FICA and the FUTA, and paid the employer's share of
the taxes due on the earnings of the captains and crews.
After making the appropriate claims for refunds, they
sued for refunds in the District Court for the Eastern
District of Louisiana. The District Court, sitting without a jury, determined after trial, that the captains and
crews were not respondents' employees fdr the purposes
of these tax statutes. The trial court noted that both
the FICA and the FUTA define "employee" as any individual who has employee status under "the usual common law rules" applicable to a determination of the
master-servant relationship. It found "without merit"
the Government's contention "that the common-law
governing the relationship of the taxpayer and the fishermen in pursuing fishing ventures in the Gulf of Mexico
and the Atlantic Ocean is the general maritime law."
271 F. Supp. 249, 257 (1967). The court found further
that the degree of control exercised by respondents over
these fishing activities was not sufficient, under the
common-law standards governing land-based occupa-

tions,.to create the relationship of employer and employee
between respondents and the captains and crews. Respondents were thus held entitled• to their refunds.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
affirmed. It reviewed the facts and observed that "it is
clear that under matitime law the captain is the agent
of the owner . . . and the crew hands-are employees,"
and that "[i]f we were free to apply maritime law as a
test of the employer-employee relationship, we would
reverse the decision of the district court." 402 F. 2d
956, 959 (1968).' However, the Court of Appeals agreed
with the District Court that the statutes' prescription
of "common law rules" barred application of maritime
standards.
This conclusion conflicts with the approach of the
Court of Claims in Cape Shore Fish Co. v. United States,
165 Ct. Cl. 630, 330 F. 2d 961.(1964). In that decision
the court found scallop fishermen, operating under arrangements similar to those here; to be employees of the
shipowner for the purposes of these statutes. It reached
this conclusion by applying to the facts the standards of
maritime law. We granted certiorari in this case, 394
U. S. 996 (1969), to resolve this conflict; and to clarify
the application to maritime workers of these important
federal statutes.
II
The parties agree that both the FICA and the FUTA
impose taxes on employers measured by the compensation paid to employees, and that in terms of this case
the two statutes define "employee" identically. In the
FICA "employee" is defined to include "any individual

the correctness of the Court of Appeals' statement on this score.

Opinion of the Court

who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the
status of an employee," and the language of the FUTA
is to the same effect.5 These definitions were not included in the original Social Security Act as it was
adopted in- 1935, which defined "employee" merely by
specifying that it "includes an officer of a corporation," '
but were added by amendment in 1948. We must consider the events that prompted the amendment.
In 1935 the draftsmen of the Social Security Act apparently thought it unnecessary to elucidate the meaning
of "employee" because they assumed that the term, as
it was applied to varying factual situations, would be
given the "usual" meaning it bore at common law. See
S. Rep. No. 1255, 80th Cong., 2d Sess:, 3-4 (1948).
However, over the years of applying the Act to a myriad
of work relationships, the lower federal courts developed
5 The definitions provide:
"For purposes of [the FICA], the term 'employee' means(1) any officer of a corporation; or (2) any individual who, under,
the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employeremployee relationship, has the status of an employee; or (3) [any
member of several specific occupations, not including fishing, when
certain conditions are satisfied]." 26 U. S. C. § 3121 (d).
"For purposes of [the FUTA], the term 'employee' includes an
officer of a corporation, but such term does not include-(1) any
individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in
determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of
an independent contractor, or (2) any individual (except an officer
of a corporation) who iA not an employee under such common law
rules." 26.U. S. C. § 3306 (i).
6 Social Security Act § 1101 (a) (6), 49 Stat. 647. The language
of § 1101 (a)(6) was carried over to §§ 1426 (c) and 1607 (h)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the predecessors of present
§§ 3121 (d) and 3306 (i)of Title 26, respectively. See 53 Stat.

somewhat varying approaches, -certain courts relying
more heavily on common-law precedents and others
attempting to discern a special meaning for the term
from the purposes of the legislation.! In addition, the
courts tended to look to local precedents to determine
the common-law standards, producing different results
for similar factual situations in various parts of the
country.' This divergence of views led this Court, in
1947, to render two decisions in an attempt to clarify
the governing standards. United States v. Silk, 331 U. S.
704; Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U. S. 126.
In Silk, the Court upheld the lower courts' determina-tion that certain truck drivers were, under the circumstances, independent contractors rather than employees,
but it upset a similar ruling with respect to a group of
men who unloaded coal from railroad cars. In Bartels
the Court, reversing the Court of Appeals, held that the
members of certain dance bands were not employees of
the owners of the dance halls at which they were engaged, despite contractual provisions characterizing them
as employees. While the Court's opinions in these cases
stressed many of the factors that had been important in
common-law determinations of employee status, they also
contained language that could be read to detach the ques7 Compare, e. g., Jones v. Goodson, 121 F. 2d 176 (C. A. 10th Cir.

tion of statutory coverage from the common-law tests.'
The Court stated, in Bartels, that "in the application of
social legislation employees are those who as a matter of
economic reality are dependent upon the business to
which they render service." 332 U. S., at 130.
Acting upon this language, the executive agencies set
about replacing their original regulation, which had defined the employment relation in terms of the incidents

of employment at common law, 10 with a new regulation
that would embody the test of "economic reality." "

However, the proposed new regulation never took effect.
9 In Silk, the Court said:
"As the federal social security legislation is an attack on recognized
evils in our national economy, a constricted interpretation of the
phrasing by the courts would not comport with its purpose ...
When [the problem of differentiating between employee and
independent contractor] arose in the administration of the National
Labor Relations Act, we pointed out that the legal standards to
fix responsibility for acts of servants, employees or agents had not
been reduced to such certainty that it could be said there was
'some simple, uniform and easily applicable test.' The word 'employee,' we said, was not there used as a word of art, and its
content in its context was a federal problem to be construed 'in
the light of the mischief to be corrected and the end to be attained.'
We concluded. that, since that end was the elimination of labor
disputes and industrial strife, 'employees' included workers who were
such as a matter of economic reality. . . . We rejected the test of
the 'technical concepts pertinent to an employer's legal respomsibility
to third persons for acts of his servants.'. .. Labor Board v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
Opinion of the Court

397 U. S.

Within two months of its announcement, a resolution
was introduced in both the House of Representatives
and the Senate calling for "a reassertion of congressional
intent regarding the application of the act." S. Rep.
No. 1255, supra, at 7. This resolution, which was finally
passed over the President's Veto, added to the statutes
the present definitions of "employee." 12
The report of the Senate Finance Committee on the
resolution makes clear a congressional purpose to disapprove the proposed regulation and to reaffirm that
determinations of employee status were to be based on
the traditional legal tests. The Committee seems to
have thought that the Silk and Bartels decisions had
applied traditional common-law standards, despite the
language in the opinions suggesting a less constrictive
approach. However, noting that the Treasury Department claimed support in those decisions for its contemplated new departure, the Committee declared: "But if
it be contended that the.Supreme Court has invented
new law for determining an 'employee' under the socialsecurity system in these cases, then the purpose of this
resolution is to reestablish the usual common-law rules,
realistically applied." Id., at 2.

UNITED STATES v. WEBB, INC.
179

Opinion of the Court'

The causes of congressional -dissatisfaction with the
proposed regulation were twofold. As a fiscal matter,
the Committee cited testimony that the new regulation
would extend social security benefits to between 500,000
and 750,000 new workers, who had not been covered
previously and had not contributed to the trust fund
from which benefits would be paid, thus endangering
the integrity of the fund. More generally, the Committee was fearful of -the uncertainty that would be
created by the new regulation, and the discretion it
wvould give to the executive agencies in determining the
applicability of the statutes. The report stated:
"In a word, by unbounded and shifting criteria,
[the proposed regulation] would confer in those
administering the Social Security Act full discretion
to include, or to exclude, from the coverage of the
act any person whom they might decide to be, or
might decide not to be, an 'employee'; and like discretion to fasten tax liabilities and the administrative duties and costs of compliance with the act
upon any person whom they might decide to be an
'employer.'
"The proposed regulation discards the commonlaw rules for distinguishing the employer-employee
relationship distilled -from many decisions by many
courts out of many insights of real situations, for a
new rule of nebulous character.
"Under the proposed regulation an 'employee' is
'an individual in a service relationship who is dependent as a matter of economic reality upon the
business to which he renders service and not upon
his own business as an independent contractor.'
"The rule, obviously, will not serve to make the
necessary distinctions. Who, in this whole world

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
Opinion of the Court

engaged in any sort of. service relationship, is not
dependent as a matter of economic reality on some
other person? ...
"IT]he proposed regulation concerns itself mainly,
as was stated to your committee by a witness
at, the hearings: '. . . with making it abundantly
clear that on virtually no state of facts may anyone
be certain whether or not he has a tax liability -until
the Commissioner has made up his mind about it.'"
Id., at 7, 10, 11.
The Committee stated that, in contrast to the proposed regulation, whose "basic principle ... is a dimensionless and amorphous abstraction," the existing regulation was "not devoid of uncertainty, but its basis is
in established standards of law which frame and limit
its application." Id., at 12. The conclusions stated in
the House Report were similar. H. R. Rep. No. 1319,
80th Cong., 2d Sess. (1948)." By the resolution, Congress unequivocally tied the coverage of these tax
provisions to the body of decisional law defining the
employer-employee relationship in various occupations.
is In a report published just two weeks before the enactment
of the resolution (commenting on H. R. 6777, a bill that contained
the same amendment ultimately accomplished by the resolution),
the House Committee on Ways and Means stated:
"Our failure to act may be further construed as conferring upon
the administrative agencies and the courts an unbridled license to
say, at will, whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor ....

"[T]he basic, controlling factor is whether the policy of the
Congress shall be to cover as employees only those who are employees under the common-law rule, or to cover a broader class of
individuals under some nebulous hypothesis with no bounds to its
application." H. R. Rep. No. 2168, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1948).

UNITED STATES v. WEBB, INC.
179

Opinion of the Court

In none of the discussions of the 1948 resolution was
there any discussion of maritime employees. The respondents argue that, by failing to make specific provision for the application of maritime law to seagoing
occupations, Congress impliedly decreed that those occupations should be gauged by the standards of the "common law" applicable to land-based activities. They
rely in part on the fact that the phrase "common law"
is sometimes used in contradistinction to the "maritime
law" traditionally applied in courts of admiralty, and they
also point to the fact that the Senate Report stressed
the degree of the employer's control over the employee's
work as central to the Committee's understanding of the
common-law tests of employment. The Senate Report
quoted with approval the then-existing regulation, substantially identical to the one now in effect, 14 which
stated:
"Every individual is an employee if the relationship between him and the person for whom he performs services is the legal relationship of employer
and employee.
"Generally such relationship exists when the person for whom services are performed has the right
to control and direct the individual who performs
the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and
means by which that result is accomplished. That
is, an employee is subject to the will and control
of the employer not only as to what shall be done
but how it shall be done." S. Rep. No. 1255, supra,
at 3.
Respondents argue that this language indicates a congressional intent that, where the maritime nature of a
1426 CFR § 31.3121 (d)-I-(c).

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
Opinion of the Court

397 U. S.

vocation makes impracticable the degree of control gen.erally exercised by land-based employers over their employees, the land-based standards must nevertheless be
applied, with the result that no "employment" exists for
the purposes of those statutes.
III
We do not think Congress intended the anomalous
result of having maritime activities subject to standards,
for social security tax purposes, other than those that
are relevant to seafaring enterprises. Such a result is
not necessary to accomplish the dual concerns underlying
the 1948 amendment. Application of maritime standards to determine the status of members of fishing ventures will not open brand new areas of social security
coverage. To the contrary, the employee status of
captains and crewmen engaged in fishing operations
similar to these is supported by a Treasury Department
interpretation, applying maritime standards, that was
issued in 1940, immediately after maritime employees
were first brought within the coverage of the Social
Security Act by amendment in 1939. S. S. T. 387,
1940-1 Cum.- Bull. 192; see Social Security Act Amendments of 1939, §§ 606, 614, 53 Stat. 1383, '1392, as
amended, 26 U. S. C. §§ 3121 (b), 3306 (c). This
-ruling, which the Social Security Administration has
accepted for purposes of paying benefits to claimants,
had existed for eight years before Congress added the
present definitions of "employee" to the statutes. It
was not mentioned at the time of the 1948 amendment. Since the ruling represented the accepted view
of both the taxing and ,paying agencies, Congress
could have had no concern that payment of benefits to

UNITED STATES v. WEBB, INC.
179

Opinion of the Court

maritime employees would constitute an uncompensated
drain on the social security fund.1"
More important, the chief concern behind the 1948
amendment-avoiding the uncertainty of the proposed
"economic reality" test-is wholly satisfied if seafaring work relationships are tested against the standards
of maritime, rather than land-based, decisional law.
Congress' fearfulness of the "nebulous" nature of the
proposed regulation indicates that it used the. phrase
"usual common law rules" in a generic sense, to mean
the standards developed by the courts through years of
adjudication, rather than in a technical sense to mean
those standards developed by "common law" courts as
opposed to courts of admiralty. Maritime law, the
common law of seafaring men, provides an established
network of rules and distinctions that are practically
suited to the necessities of the sea, just as land-based
decisional law provides a body of rules adapted to the
various forms of domestic employment. The goal of
minimizing uncertainty can be accomplished, in the maritime field, by resort to the "usual" rules of maritime
jurisprudence."6
Subsequent amendments to the social security laws make it
now even clearer that classification of some maritime workers as
employees will not threaten the social security fund.. The Social
Security Act Amendments of 1950 extended benefits coverage to
the self-employed for the first time. 64 Stat. 502, 540; see H. R.
Rep. No. 1300, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 9-10 (1949). Benefits
for the self-employed are financed by taxes paid by them under
the Self-Emplcyment' Contributions Act, 26 U. S. C. § 1401 et seq.;
see H. R. Rep. No. 1300, supra, at. 135-145; S. Rep. No. 1669,
81st Cong., 2d Sess., 153-166 (1950). Therefore, the captains
and crewmen are eligible for social security benefits whether they
are considered employees or self-employed.
1 A conclusion that maritime standards could not be applied
might frustrate Congress' evident expectation that the FICA and
15

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
Opinion of the Court

397 U. S.

This conclusion is not weakened by the emphasis given,
both in.the Senate Report and in the regulation, to the
factor of control. Control is probably the most important factor under maritime law,"7 just .as it is under
the tests of land-based employment. It may be true
that, in most maritime, relationships, the workers enjoy
discretion that is unusually broad if measured by landbased standards-a discretion dictated by the seafaring
nature of the activity. However, except where there
-is nearly total relinquishment of control through a bareboat, or demise, charter, the owner may nevertheless be
considered, under maritime law, to have sufficient control
to be charged with the duties of an employer. See, e. g.,
The Norland, 101 F. 2d 967 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1939); G. Gilmore & C. Black, The Law of Admiralty § 4-23 (1957).
Congress' stress on the importance of control reflects the
primacy of that factor in the rules governing the most
common, land-based vocations,"8 which were certainly
foremost in the congressional mind at the time of the
FUTA legislation would apply to seamen, and specifically to fishermen. As noted above, the 1939 amendments extended the statutes
to cover maritime employees. Additionally, 26 U. S. C. §3121 (b)(4)
provides an exemption for service by aliens on foreign vessels, and
§ 3306 (c) (17) exempts fishermen on vessels that do not exceed 10
tons in displacement. These provisions raise the inference that
fishermen on larger vessels were expected to be covered, under the
general "common law rules" provision. However# if shipowners
were relieved of the employers' tax liabilities unless their relationship with the captains and crews were of the sort that would
constitute an employer-employee relationship in a land-based activity, application of the statutes to fishermen might be seriously
limited.

e. g., Cape Shore Fish Co. v. United State8, 165 Ct. Cl.
630, 637-641, 330 F. 2d 961, 965-968 (1964); G. Gilmore & C.Black,

1948 amendment. It does not preclude the application,
in different areas, of decisional rules that vary, in the
precise degree of control that is required. Cf. Deecy
Products Co. v. Welch, 124 F. 2d 592, 598-599 (C. A.
1st Cir. 1941); McGuire v. United States, 349 F. 2d 644.
(C. A. 9th Cir. 1965)." +
The guidelines in the regulation also allow for such
flexibility, as is attested by the existence, for nearly 30
years, of the Treasury ruling, S. S. T. 387, confirming the
employee status of fishermen such as those involved here.
Now, as in 1948, the regulation proceeds, after the language already quoted, to elaborate some of the factors
other than control that may be important:
"The right to discharge is also an important factor
indicating that the person possessing that right is
an employer.
Other factors characteristic of an
employer, but not necessarily present in every ase,

are the furnishing of tools and the furnishing of a
place to work, to the individual who performs the
services." 26 CFR § 31.3121 (d)-1 (c) (2). 10
19 See H. R. Rep. No. 2168, supra, n. 13, at 9-10:
"Ample flexibility is possible under [the common-law] rule to
accommodate peculiar or unusual employment relationships so frequently found in our complex economic system.
"The common-law concept of master and .servant, of course, is
no more fixed and immutable than the common law itself. Hence
it will produce in practice varying results under varying circumstances and in different .jurisdictions. But such variations will not
offend the common-law rule itself....
"... There is nothing to fear from differences in the application
of the common-law tests, but there is much to fear from- the abandonment of recognized common-law principles in resolving such
questions of fact.' Such abandonment would simply amount to
reliance upon no recognized -body of legal principles."
20 Other factors that may have sigrjificance
are discussed in United
States v. Silk, 331 U. S. 704 (1947); Enochs v. Williams Packing Co.,

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
Opinion of the Court

397 U. S.

It is clear that this brief sketch of relevant factors cannot be intended to provide a workable test, complete in
itself, displacing the complex of common-law rules Congress so carefully tried to preserve. Rather, the regulation provides a summary of the principles of the
common law, intended as an initial guide for the determination, required by the first sentence of the regulation,
whether a relationship "is the legal relationship of employer and employee." The thrust of both statute and
regulation is that the standards that are to govern in
any field are those that the courts customarily apply
to define this "legal relationship." 21
We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in declining to judge the status of the captains and crewmen
against the standards of maritime law. Accordingly, the
judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to
that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
370 U. S. 1 (1962); Kirkconnell v. United States, 171 Ct. C1. 43,
347 F. 2d 260 (1965); Illinois Tri-Seal Products, Inc. v. United
States, 173 Ct. Cl. 499, 353 F. 2d 216 (1965).

1 We find no support for a contrary conclusion in the fact.that,
shortly after the District Court's decision in this case, the Treasury
Department unsuccessfully sought an amendment to § 3121 (d) (3)
defining "employee" to include the captains and crews of commercial fishing vessels without regard to their status under the
general' definition in § 3121 (d) (2), see n. 5, supra. See the bill that
became the Social Security Amendments of 1967, H. R. 12080,
§§ 504 (b) (1), (2) (as amended by the Senate); S. Rep. No. 744,
90th Cong., 1st Sess., 203-205, 320-324 (1967) ; H. R. Rep. No. 1030,
90th Cong., 1st Sess., 74 (1967) (Conference Report deleting the
amendment). That the Treasury also chose to proceed on the legislative front does not impair the argument put forth by the United
States here, and Congress' failure to adopt the amendment is a
dubious indication of the position of Congress in 1967 on the question
before us, let alone the position of a different Congress in 1948.
Cf. United States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 310-312 (1960); United
States v. Wise, 370 U. S. 405, 411 (1962).
