HYNES, REGIONAL DIRECTOR, FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, v. GRIMES PACKING CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 24.

Argued October 21, 1948.-Decided May 31, 1949.

Under § 2 of the Act of May 1, 1936, the Secretary of, the Interior
issued Public Land Order No. 128, designating as an. Indian reservation, for the use and benefit of the native inhabitants of Karluk,
Alaska, certain described lands and the waters adjacent thereto
extending "3,000 feet from the shore line at mean low tide."
Claiming authority under the White Act, 43 Stat. 464, which prescribed drastic penalties for violations, the Secretary promulgated
a regulation prohibiting commercial fishing in the waters of the
reservation except by natives or their licensees. Companies which
for years had engaged in canning fish, taken from these waters,
which depended on that source of supply for profitable operations,
and which had a substantial investment in their business, sued
in the District Court to enjoin permanently the exclusion of their
fishermen from the reservation, on the ground of the invalidity of
the Land Order and the regulation. Named as sole defendant was
the Regional Director for the Territory of Alaska of the Fish and
Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior. Held:
1. The Secretary of tlhe Interior is not an indispensable party
defendant to the suit, sinc6 a decree requiring the defendant and
his subordinates to cease their interference will afford all the relief
sought without the necessity of requiring the Secretary or any
of his subordinates to take any affirmative action. Pp. 96-97.
2. The District Court had equity jurisdiction of the suit. Pp.
97-100.
(a) The facts sufficiently show that the complainants are
without an adequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable
injury unless the enforcement of the regulation is restrained. Pp.
97-100.
(b) Although criminal prosecutions, even under an invalid
statute, will ordinarily not be restrained, a civil action will lie
in exceptional circumstances that make an injunction necessary
effectually to protect property rights. Pp. 98-99.

Syllabus.
3. The Secretary's inclusion in the Karluk Reservation of the
waters described in the Land Order was authorized by § 2 of the
Act of May 1, 1936. Pp. 100-116.
(a) The provision of § 2 of the Act of May 1, 1936, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to designate as a reservation
any "public lands which are actually occupied" by Indians in
Alaska, did not preclude the inclusion of coastal waters in the
Karluk Reservation. Pp. 110-116.
(b) The fact that tidelands are embraced within the area
designated as the Karluk Reservation is without significance. Pp.
114-115.
(c) A statute, which authorized permanent disposition of
federal property would be strictly construed to avoid inclusion
of fisheries by implication. P. 104.
(d) The Secretary of the Interior was without statutory
authority to convey to the Indians any permanent title or right
in the lands or waters of the Karluk Reservation. Pp. 101-106.
(e) Indian reservations in Alaska, established or enlarged
under § 2 of the Act of May 1, 1936, are subject to the unfettered
will of Congress' P. 106.
(f) Non-revocability in the case of the Karluk Reservation
can not be predicated on the language of the Act of June 18,
1934, which must be construed as effective only where there has
been specific recognition by the United States of Indian rights to
control absolutely tribal lands. Pp. 106-107.
(g) References to general legislation on public lands in Alaska,
appearing in a letter of the Secretary of the Interior printed in the
House and Senate Reports on the bill which became the Act of
May 1, 1936, can not be regarded as an adequate basis for adjudging power in the Secretary to dispose finally of such lands. Pp.
108-110.
4. The regulation prohibiting commercial fishing in the waters
of the Karluk Reservation except by natives or their licensees was
void as a whole, becaftse in violation of the proviso of the White
Act that "no exclusive or several right of fishery shall be granted."
Pp. 116-123.
(a) The general prohibition and the exception in the regulation are not separable,, and the regulation may not be upheld as
imposing a prohibition applicable to everyone. P. 118.
(b) The White Act, the purpose of which was to protect and
conserve the fisheries of Alaska on a non-monopolistic basis,

authorizes the establishment of preserves.or closed areas in reservations created under § 2 of the Act of May 1, 1936. Pp. 118-119.
(c) Section 8 of the White Act does not make exclusive the
power f the Territorial Legislature to license fishing. P. 121.
(d) Licenses for fishing may be required by the Secretary
of the Interior in areas regulated under the White Act; but such
licenses may be only regulatory in character and, within the discretion of the Secretary, must have their cost fixed so as not to
exceed the estimated cost of reasonable policing of the area. Pp.
121-122.
(e) The White Act uoes not empower the Secretary of the
Interior to raise general funds' for native welfare or general conservation purposes from White Act preserves. P. 122.
o (f) The proviso of §-1 of the White Act "that no exclusive
or several right of fishery shall be granted" applies to commercial
fishing by natives as well as by fishing companies, nonresidents
of Alaska or other American citizens, and so applies whether those
natives are or are not residents on a reservation. Pp. 122-123.
(g) The adoption of a corporate charter and a constitution
by the Natie Village of Karluk under §§ 16 and 17 of the
Wheeler-Howard Act can not expand the power of the Secretary
of the Interior under the White Act. P. 122.
(h) The sanctions of the White .Act may not be employed
to protect the Karluk Reservation against trespass. Pp. 122-123.
5. In view of the fact that the foregoing holdings establish a
new basis for administrative and judicial conclusions, the decrees
of the District Court ahd, the Court of Appeals, granting a permanent injunction on the ground of the invalidity of both the regulation and the Land Order, are vacated and the ease is remanded
to the District Court with directions as to further proceedings.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Secretary of the Interior on May 22, 1943, issued
Public Land Order 128. It is set out in full below.' In
this case the significaiit part of No. 128 is that the Secretary included in the reservation, by paragraph 2, adjacent tidelands and coastal waters along tht entire shore
line of the uplands that touched Shelikof Str, it between
Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula. The authority
of the Secretary to utilize presidential power in the designation of this reservation out of public lands in Alaska
flows from a delegation to the Secretary of presidential
power to withdraw or reserve public lands and revoke or

modify prior reservations. Executive Order No. 9146,
of April 24, 1942, 1 C. F. R., Cum. Supp. 1149. The
presidential power over reservations is made specific by
the Act of June 25, 1910.2 Another statutory provision,
however, is the principal basis for Order 128. This is
and pursuant to Executive Order No. 9146 of April 24, 1942:
It is ordered, As follows:
"1. Executive Order No. 8344 of February 10, 1940, withdrawing
Kodiak and other islands, Alaska, for classification and in aid of
legislation, is hereby modified to the extent necessary to permit the
designation as an Indian reservation of the following-described area:
"Beginning at the end of a point of land on the shore of Shelikof
Strait on Kodiak Island, said point being about one and one-quarter
miles east of Rocky Point and in approximate latitude 57o39'40" N.,
longitude 1540 12'20" W.;
"Thence south approximately eight miles to latitude 57*32'30" N.;
"Thence west approximately twelve and one-half miles to the
confluence of the north shore of Sturgeon River with the east shore
of Shelikof Strait;
"Thence northeasterly following the easterly shore of Shelikof Strait
to the place of beginning, containing approximately 35,200 acres.
"2. The area described above and the waters adjacent thereto
extending 3,000 feet from the shore line at mean low tide, are hereby
designated as an Indian reservation for the use and benefit of the
native inhabitants of the native village of Karluk, Alaska, and
vicinity: Provided, That such designation shall be effective only upon
its approval by the vote of the Indian and Eskimo residents of the
area involved in accordance with section 2 of the act of May 1,
1936, supra: And provided further, That nothing herein contained
shall affect any valid existing claim or right under the laws of the
United States within the purview of that section."
2 The first section reads as follows, 36 Stat. 847:
"That the President may, at any time in his discretion, temporarily withdraw from settlement, location, sale, or entry any of the
public lands of the United States including the District of Alaska
and reserve the same for water-power sites, irrigation, classification
of lands, or other public purposes to be specified in the orders of
withdrawals, and such withdrawals or reservations shall remain in
force until revoked by him or by an Act of Congress."
There is a second section designed to keep the reservations free
for mineral exploration and utilization.

Opinion of the Court.

§ 2 of the Act of May 1, 1936, 49 Stat. 1250. This act
was passed to extend to Alaska the benefits of the
Wheeler-Howard Act of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 984,
and to provide for the designation of Indian reservations
in Alaska. As § 2 is important in our discussion, the pertinent provisions are set out in full:
"SEC. 2. That the Secretary of the Interior is
hereby authorized to designate as an Indian reservation any area of land which has been reserved
for the use and occupancy of Indians or Eskimos
by section 8 of the Act of May 17, 1884 (23 Stat.
26), or by section 14 or section 15 of the Act of
March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1101), or which has been
heretofore reserved under any executive order and
placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of
the Interior or any bureau thereof, together with
additional public lands adjacent thereto, within the
Territory of Alaska, or any other public lands which
are actually occupied by Indians or Eskimos within
said Territory: Provided, That the designation by
the Secretary of the Interior of any such area of
land as a reservation shall be effective only upon
its approval by the vote, by secret ballot, of a majority of the Indian or Eskimo residents thereof who
vote at a special election duly called by the Secretary
of the Interior upon thirty days' notice:- . . . ."
The Native Village of Karluk held a meeting on May 23,
1944, and accepted ".the proposed Indian Reservation for
this village. The adoption of said Reservation passed by
a vote of 46 for and 0 against. 11 of the eligible voters
were absent." See note 26, infra. Under § 19 of the
Wheeler-Howard Act the Alaskan aborigines are classified
as Indians.
On March 22 and August 27, 1946, the Secretary of
the Interior amended the Alaska Fisheries General Regu-

lations, 50 C. F. R., 1946 Supp., § 208.23, that related
to the commercial fishing for salmon in the Kodiak Area
Fisheries by the addition of a subsection (r), reading as
follows:
"(r) All waters within 3,000 feet of the shores of
Karluk Reservation (Public Land Order No. 128,
May 22, 1943), beginning at a point on the east
shore of Shelikof Strait,-on Kodiak Island, latitude
57°32'30" ' N., thence northeasterly along said shore
to a point 57°39'40" .
"The foregoing prohibition shall not apply to fishing by natives in possession of said reservation, nor
to fishing by other persons under authority granted
by said natives (49 Stat. 1250; 48 U. S..C. 358a).
Such authority shall be granted only by or pursuant to ordinance of the Native Village of Karluk,
approved by the Secretary of the Interior or his
duly authorized representative." 11 Fed. Reg. 3105,
9528.

The authority for the regulation is given as 34 Stat. 263
and 478, as amended by the Act of June 6, 1924, 43 Stat.
464, an Act for the protection of the fisheries of Alaska,
known -as the White Act.' As the controlling section of
this statute also is important, it is set out here,4 44 Stat.
752:
"SECTION 1. That for the purpose of protecting
and conserving the fisheries of the United States in
all waters of Alaska the Secretary of Commerce from
time to time may set apart and reserve fishing areas

States has jurisdiction, and within, such areas may
establish closed seasons during which fishing may
be limited or prohibited as he may prescribe. Under
this authority to limit fishing in any area so set
apart and reserved the Secretary may (a) fix the
size and character of nets, boats, traps, or other gear
and appliances to be used therein; (b) limit the
catch of fish to be taken from any area; (c) make
such regulations as to time, means, methods, and
extent of fishing as he may deem advisable. From
and after the creation of any such fishing area and
during the time fishing is prohibited therein it shall
be unlawful to fish therein or to operate therein any
boat, seine, trap, or other gear or apparatus for the
purpose of taking fish; and from and after the creation of any such fishing area in which limited fishing
is permitted such fishing shall be carried on only
during the time, in the manner, to the extent, and
in conformity with such rules and regulations as the
Secretary prescribes under the authority herein
given: Provided,That every such regulation made by
the Secretary of Commerce shall be of general application within the particular area to which it applies,
and that no exclusive or several right of fishery shall
be granted therein, nor shall any citizqn of the United

These are the statutes and orders that created the situation that led to this litigation.
The. issuance of the White Act regulation of March
22, 1946, brought concern to the commercial fishing
interests of Alaska. This wbs because of its drastic penalties. See note 49, infra. The native iillage of Karluk

spoken of in Order No. 128 establishing the reservation is
situated on the Karluk River, long recognized as one of
the most important salmon spawning streams of Alaska.
The natives live at its mouth on Shelikof Strait. There
the salmon must congregate from the Strait to enter
the channel of the river leading to their spawning grounds
in the interior of Kodiak Island. The waters included
in the reservation are those stretching eight miles along
the coast north and south of the mouth, 3,000 feet into
the .Strait. Thus the best of the Karluk salmon fishery
is liut into the reservation by Order No. 128.1 For an
understanding of the locality, a sketch map is appended.
The importance of the Karluk fishery will be appreciated by reference to a few of the facts in connection with
" . When Russia ceded Alaska to the United States in
1867, 15 Stat. 539, Karluk was already well known as
an abundant salmon fishery. 6 By 1885 the salmon canneries were flourishing and Bancroft reports the Karluk

prolific. There were variations in the catch but it was

to make a true statement concerning them seem incredible. In

red salmon to the case, or more than 2,500,000 fish. In 1889 the
number of fish put up was still larger, reaching probably 250,000
cases, containing more than 3,000,000 salmon. As the number of
fish arriving at Karluk Bay for a long period of years has been
known to be far greater than in any of the other bays of southern

always valuable.' In later years, the fluctuations continued and other varieties increased relatively. °
None of the respondent companies have packing plants
at Karluk. All are, however, on Kodiak Island, which
is around 100 miles long and 50 broad, and Within fishing
distance of the reservation waters. There is a fish refrigeration plant on the river. These canners- have
canned fish from these waters for from seven to twentyfour years. The percentage of each canner's packC that
comes from the reserved waters is so large that-the trial'
court found irreparable injury to the packers if they could
not obtain the catch of the reservation. ". . . no other
replacement source of such salmon for -their canneries
Alaska, it is probable that most of these salmon were present at
Karluk for the purpose of ascending the river to spawn. Now the
number of spawning fish seen in the river, the lakes, and their connecting. rivers was-comparatively very small, indeed out of all proporion to the number taken on the beach."
9 The highest reported by the Statistical Review of the Alaska
Salmon .Fisheries, June 13, 1930, Bureau of Fisheries Bulletin, vol.
XLVI, p. &f66,was nearly 4,000,000 fish in 1901 and the lowest about
400,000 in i927. The report said:
"Many investigations of the Karluk red-salmon fishery have been
made, much has been written about it, commercial interests have
battled for exclusive control and domination of it, and dire prophecies
have-been- heard concerning its ultimate destruction. Because of
thlek things, Karluk has undoubtedly been given more close attention
tha n any other fishery in Alaska ..

on Kodiak Island is available to them." The canners'
investment is substantial, running from two to five hundred thousand dollars respectively. The fishing is done
by men who own their own three- to four-man boats,
use similar company boats or operate under boat-buying
contracts. Prices for the catch vary for these classifications. These packers employ over four hundred fishermen, chiefly residents of Alaska, and over six hundred
cannery employees, chiefly nonresidents.
The fishing season at Karluk begins around June 1 and
continues intermittently, depending upon the run of fish,
until Sept. 30. After the issuance of § 208.23 (r) restricting the fishery at Karluk Reservation to Karluk natives
and licensees, respondents brought this action against the
Regional Director for the Territory of Alaska of the Fish
and Wildlife Service to permanently enjoin the exclusion
of their fishermen from the reservation on the ground
that neither regulation § 208.23 (r) nor Public Land
Order No. 128 legally closed the fishery of the coastal
waters to respondents. The District Court granted the
permanent injunction and held invalid both the regulation and the land order. 67 F. Supp. 43. On the same
grounds the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed the order for permanent injunction. 165 F. 2d

(a) At the outset the United States-contends that the
Secretary of the Interior is an indispensable party who
must be joined as a party defendant in order to give the
District Court jurisdiction of this suit. In Williams v.
Fanning, 332 U. S. 490, the test as to whether a superior
official can be dispensed with as a party was stated to
be whether "the decree which is entered will effectively,
grant the relief desired by expending itself-on the subordina* official who is before the court.,' P. 494. Such

HYNES v. GRIMES PACKING CO.

Opinion of the Court.

is the precise situation here. Nothing is required of the
Secretary; he does not have to perform any act,. either
directly or indirectly. Respondents merely seek an injunction restraining petitioner from interfering with their
fishing. No affirmative action is required of petitioner,
and if he and his subordinates cease their interference,
respondents have been accorded all the relief which they
seek. The issues of the instant suit can be settled by
a decree between these parties without having the Secretary of the Interior as a party to the litigation.
(b) Petitioner, Regional Director for the Territory of
Alaska of the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Interior
Department, is charged with the duty of enforcing the
acts of Congress relating to the fisheries of Alaska and
regulations issued thereunder. The District Court found
that since March 22, 1946, the effective date of § 208.23
(r) of the Alaska Fisheries General Regulations, petitioner has continually threatened the seizure of all boats
and equipment used to fish in the waters covered by this
regulation to respondents' substantial and irreparable
loss, and that the seasonal run of salmon in the reservation
waters was essential for respondents' profitable operation.
From the following facts it will be seen that there is
sufficient evidence to support these findings.
After the promulgation of the fishery regulation,
§ 208.23 (r), the Warden for the Fish and Wildlife Service
on Kodiak Island, one of petitioner's subordinate agents,
repeatedly informed officials of the canneries that the
regulation would be enforced and that the necessary steps
would be taken to prosecute any violations. He communicated to the representatives of the canneries the
contents of a telegram in which petitioner directed that
a case to test the regulation be arranged for the opening
day of the fishing season. The contents of this telegram
were relayed to the headquarters in Seattle of the Alaska
Salmon Industry, Inc., a trade association of the canned

salmon packers of which all but one of respondents are
members. Thence the information was distributed to all
interested parties. The Kodiak warden then reiterated
to the cannery operators on that island his intention to
enforce the regulation even though his force and equipment were inadequate for the purpose.
Thereafter two officers of the Indian Service were appointed special agents for the Fish and Wildlife Service
to assist in the enforcement of the fishing regulations
issued by the Interior Department. They arrived at
Karluk June 24, 1946. These two deputies were armed
and maintained a boat patrol in the waters of the reservation. They checked the names of boats fishing in
the waters of the reservation against the permits issued
by the village of Karluk. No boats were allowed inside
the area which had been restricted for beach seining
by vote of the Indian meeting of May 23, 1944,11 and
which was marked -off by buoys.
If respondents show that they are without an adequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable injury
unless the enforcement of the alleged invalid regulation
is restrained, a civil court will enjoin. 2 While ordinarily

"A meeting was called by the president and the same evening
with Mr. Peters Mr. Watrous of Juneau and Mr. Leraas present.

or buoys 500 yd. out from mean low water mark be the restricted

council."

criminal prosecutions will not be restrained even under
an invalid statute," a civil action will lie in exceptional
circumstances that make an injunction necessary to effectually protect property rights."
The facts heretofore detailed as to the investments of
respondents in canneries and fishing equipment and their
established activities in the waters of the reservation
make clear the serious effect on them of exclusion from
the reservation. It is not a threat of a single prosecution,
as in the Spielman case, but an ousting of respondents
and their employees from the fishing grounds unless
each individual person takes a fishing license. Under the
findings the respondents could not operate profitably if
prohibited from fishing in the reservation area. Many
fishermen may stay away from, the grounds for fear of
punishment. In the pursuit of their otherwise lawful
business respondents are threatened with criminal prosecution should they fish in the waters of the Karluk Reservation without a permit from the native village. For the
violation of the applicable regulation under the White
Act, severe penalties are imposed, including fine, imprisonment, the summary seizure of boats, haul, gear, equipment, and their forfeiture to the United States.' These
sanctions deny to respondents an adequate remedy at
law, for to challenge the regulation in an ordinary criminal
proceeding is to hazard a loss against the payment of a
license fee and compliance with the fishing rules of the
natives. Yet to stay out of the reservation prevents the
profitable operation of the canneries. In such a situa'3

:II.
Respondents sought this injunction forbidding criminal
proceedings ,aimed" at excluding them from fishing in the.
coastal waters of Karluk Reservtioin on .the ground that
Public Land Order 'No. 128, note 1, supra, was invalid
as a whole and particularly because of the inclusion of
tidelands and coastal waters by § 2 of the order.
Respondents attack in their complaint the validity of
the entire order because "no part 'of the land area involved
had been withdrawn by Executive Order and placed
under the jurisdiction of the Department o-the Interior
prior to May 1, 1936, as required by the Act of May 1,
1936." This position has not been pressed or'decided.'7
The final order for an injunction against petitioner does
not include any ruling on that point.
Nor do we think the authority of the Secretary of the
Interior to establish the Karluk Reservation, Public Land

by the natives under § 8 of the Act of May 17, 1884,

complaint; no such point was raised by the assignments
of error; the question was specifically pretermitted by the

certiorari and is not relied upon by the respondents to
require affirmance of the Court of Appeals decree.,
(a). The validity of Public Land Order 128 depends in
this case on the scope of the power granted to the Secretary to establish this reservation by the language of § 2. of
the Act of May 1, 1936, supra, authorizing the Secretary
of the Interior to designate as a reservation "any other
public lands which are actually occupied by Indians or
Eskimos within said Territory." An administrative order is presumptively valid.18
In this instance, the Secretary acted under a statute,
§ 2, Act, of May 1, 1936, and through delegation of
presidential authority.19 This' delegation in turn rested
on the Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 847.20 This chain
of delegated authority for the allocation of public lands
in Alaska retains for future congressional"action. the power
for the ultimate disposition of the-property, land and
water, within the boundaries of the reservation. Withdrawals under the Act of June 25, 1910, are "temporary"
and "until revoked by him or by an Act of,Congress."
The Wheeler-Howard Act of June 18, 1934, "To conserve and develop Indian lands and resources," which
was, extended to the Territory of Alaska by

of May 1, 1936' authorized the Secretary of the Interior

to restore to tribal ownership only the remaining surplus
lands of any Indian reservation theretofore opened for
sale or other disposition.!1 It did not authorize the creation of reservations of any kind. Its only reference to
acquisition of lands by or for Indians is in § 5 where
appropriations are authorized for that purpose. This
section is inapplicable here.
'Section 2 of the extending act, set out at the beginning
of this opinion, page 91, supra, gives no power to the Secretary to dispose finally of federal lands. By the new
section he ishauthorized simply "to designate as an Indian
reservation" any other public lands which are actually
occupied 'by Indians or Eskimos within said Territory.
There is no language in the various acts, in their legislative
history, or in Land Order 128, from which an inference
pan be drawn that the Secretary has or has claimed power
to convey any permanent title or right to the Indians in
the lands or waters of Karluk Reservation. Rather the
contrary is true. In the Act of May 14,1898,30 Stat. 409,
48 U. S. G. § 411, "Extending the homestead laws and
providing for right of way,for railroads in the District
of Alaska,' and for other purposes," there is the express
'proviso that nothing contained in the Act "'shall be construed as impairing in any degree the title of any State
that may hereafter be erected out of' the Territory of
Alaska, or any part thereof, to tide lands' and beds of
any of its navigable waters, or the right of such State
21

It

is unnecessary to appraise the effect of such restoration.

Tribal ownership may vary from an unrecognized Indian title, see
Northwestern Bands of Shoshone Indians v. United States, 324 U. S.
335, 338, 340, to' land so set apart to an Indian tribe by definitive
treaty as to require compensation to the tribe, if the United States

thereafter appropriated lands within the aret. See Shoshone Tribe
v. United t.ates, 299 U. S. 476, 486; 44 Stat. 1349. The effect
of restoratiop uinder the 'Wheeler-Howard Act will depend upon the.
provisions of law under which the'separate reservations exist. Compare Cohen, Handbook -of Federal Indian Law, c. 5, § 5A, p. 94.

to regulate the use thereof, nor the right of the United
States to resume possession of such lands, it being declared that all such rights shall continue to be held by
the United States in trust for the people of any State
or States which may hereafter be erected out of said
Territory. The term 'navigable waters,' as herein used,
shall be held to include all tidal waters up to the line
of ordinary high tide and all nontidal waters navigable
in fact up to the line of ordinary high-water mark."
Indeed the United States affirms in its brief that Karluk
Reservation is merely a reservation "for a particular governmental use," not a disposal of the' area. The Government says it is like Sioux Tribe v. United States, 316 U. S.
317, not like United States v. Holt Bank, 270.U. S.49.
An Indian reservation created by Executive Order of
the President conveys no right of use or occupancy to the
beneficiaries beyond the pleasure of Congress or the President. Such rights may be terminated by the unilateral
action of the United States without legal liability for compensation in any form even though Congress has permitted
suit on the claim. Sioux Tribe v. United States, 316 U. S.

U. S. 339 at '347.1 When a reservation is established by

fee simple, as in its judgment is just. Shoshone Indians
v. United States,-324 U. S.-335, 339, 340. When Congress intends to delegate power to turn over lands to the
Indians permanently, one would expect to and doubtless
would find definite indications of such a purpose. '
In the- present case a determination' of the power delegated to the Secretary of the Interior by the WheelerHoward Act of June 18,1934, and § 2 of the Act of May
1, 1936, is important. It is-important for the reason that
a statute that authorizes permanent disposition of federal
property would be most strictly construed to avoid inclusion of fisheries by implication. Petitioner argues for a
holding that, be power granted covers water as well as
land. If that power were broad enough to enable the
Secretary to designate nonrevocable or permanent reservations of all Alaska fishing grounds for the sole benefit
of natives living in- villages adjacent to the fisheries, it
might place in his hands the power to grant the natives

the right to exclude -all other fishermen from the fisheries.
In this present case, for example, it might mean that the
native residents of the Karluk Reservation would have the
perpetual use and enjoyment of this valuable Karluk fishery for themselves and their licensees." On May 23,1944,
a year after Public Land Order 128, the petitioner shows
that there were 57 residents eligible to vote for approval
of the designation of the reservation." As indicated by
the cases hereinbefore cited, a recognition of such ownership in Indians might require just compensation to them
of the fair value of the fishery, if the United States should
desire hereafter to reopen the ares to the public under its
regulations. There is much less reason to read such power
of permanent disposition by the Secretary into § 2 than
there was to read it into the President's "implied grant of
power" to create reservations. United States v. Midwest
Oil Co., 236 U. S.459, 475. It would take specific and

Opinion of the Court.

1934, § 16, applicable to Alaska, see § 13, an Indian tribe
was authorized to adopt a constitution and by-laws for
its government. This was done by the Karluk Reservation Indians. There is a phrase in the section that has
color of recognition of ownership of tribal lands in the
Indians. It reads as follows:
"In addition to all powers vested in any Indian
tribe or tribal council by existing law, the constitution adopted by said tribe 'shall also vest in such
tribe or its tribal council the following rights and
powers: . . . to prevent the sale,. disposition, lease,
or encumbrance of tribal lands, interests in lands,
or other tribal assets without the consent of-the
tribe;

"

48 Stat. 987. - 9

We think, however, in view of the breadth of the coverage of the Wheeler-Howard Act that this language
would be effective only where there has been specific
recognition by the United States of Indian rights.to control absolutely tribal lands.
29 In hearings before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, 73d
Cong., 2d Sess., on S. 3645, the bill which became the Act of June 18,

of these words:

in the air.

OCTOBER TERM, 1948.
Opinion of the Court.

337 U. S.

Persuasive of this conclusion is that the bill when
originally proposed by Interior provided in § 7 of Title
III that "Title to any land acquired pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be taken in the name of the
United States in trust for the Indian tribe or community
for whom the land is acquired, but title may be transferred
by the Secretary to such community under the conditions
set forth in this Act." The italicized words were omitted
when this section was incorporated into § 5 of the,
Wheeler-Howard Act. See Hearings before House Committee on Indian Affairs, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., on H. R.
7902, p.. 9.
Turning to § 2 of the Act of May 1, 1936, the strongest
argument for the nonrevocability of a r~servation created
under § 2 of that Act comes from a letter of the Secretary
of the Interior printed in the House and Senate Reports
on the bill which became the Act in question.' The
reports, speaking of § 2, said:
"This provision in reality carries out the promise
of this Government contained in its act approved
on May 17, 1884 (23 Stat. 26), as follows:
'Provided, That the Indians or other persons in
said district shall not be disturbed in the possession
of any lands actually: in their use or occupation or
now claimed by them but the terms under which
such persons may acquire title to such lands is reserved for future legislation by Congress.' " H. R.

shadowed in the statutes referred to in the letter. Such
references to general legislation on public lands in the
huge Territory of Alaska, hovever, cannot be treated as
an adequate basis for courts to declare that power was.
given the Secretary, of the Interior to dispose finally of
Alaska lands. The first section of the Act of May 1
was a mere amendment of the Wheeler-Howard Act to
bring Alaska under its coverage. The Wheeler-Howard
Act did not-authorize the creation of Indian reservations.
Section 2 of the act extending the Wheeler-Howard Act
to Alaska was intended to permit the organization, of
the Alaska natives so that they could avail themselves
tection of the economic rights of the Alaska natives.' In at least,
two acts of Congress this. obligation is specifically acknowledged.
The act approved on May 17, 1884 (23 Stat. 26), contains the
following language: 'Provided, That the Indians or other persons
in said district shall not be disturbed in the possession-of any lands
actually in their use or occupatiqn or now' claimed by them but the
terms under which such persons may acquire title to such .lands
is reserved for future legislafion by Congress.'
"The act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1100), contains similar language: 'That none of the provisions of the last two preceding sections
of this Act shall be so construed as to warrant the sale of any lands
belonging to the United States which shall contain coal or the precious
metals, or any townsite, or which' shall be occupied by the United
States for public' purposes, or which shall be reserved for such
purposes, or to which the natives of Alaska have prior rights by
virtue of actual occupation.' Lands which should have been, by
,virtue of these acts, segregated for natives of Alaska have not been
so segregated. The provisions of section 2 of H. R. 9866 will aid
the Federal Government in rectifying this condition, and in protecting the interests of .the natives in the future. Section 2 of the
bill which gives to the Secretary of the Interior power to designate
certain lands as Indian reservations is, therefore, a logical sequence
of the legislative history regarding Indian lanids in Alaska and provides a" method by Which the financial aid provisions of the'Indian
Reorganization Act may be extended to those" Indians and Eskimos
of Alaska who occupy established villages."

of the earlier Act.32

337 U. S.

It cannot be said, we think, that

such reservations may be permanent or nonrevocable. A
reading of § 2 will show that there are no words with
the connotation of recognition or conveyance of title.
There are no words, such as appear in other statutes,3
reserving the right of exploration, discovery and claim
for precious, metals and valuable minerals. There is no
discussion in the reports or the debates that show a definite intention of anyone to part with public property
to establish an Alaskan Indian communal system. Under
such circumstances, we think the land and water reservations created under § 2 are reservations at will.
(c) We are convinced that § 2 of the Act of May 1,
1936, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to include
in the Karluk Reservation the waters described in § 2
of Public Land Order No. 128. To interpret the clause
"or any othe .public lands which are actually occupied
by Indians or Eskimos within said Territory" to describe only land above mean low tide is too restrictive
in view of the history and habits of Alaska natives
This appears from the following excerpt frojm. the Secretary's
letter:
"Indian tribes do not exist in Alaska in the same sense as in continental United, States. Section 19 of the Indian Reorganization
Act defines 1he word 'tribe' as referring to 'Any Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation.'
With a few exceptions the lands occupied by natives of Alaska
have not been designated as reservations. In order, therefore, to
define an Alaskan tribe it is necessary to identify it with the land
it occupies and in terms of the language of the act, 'reservation.'
In addition, if native communities of Alaska are to set up systems
of local government, it will be necessary to stipulate the geographical
limits of their jurisdictions. Reservations set up by the Secretary
of the Interior will accomplish this." This, with the proviso of
the, first section, was deemed sufficient to enable- the lands to be
identified and to permit the •Wheeler-Howard benefits to be available
to the Alaska.batives.

them. The fisheries occupied by them before the advent of the

pelled to decide that the fisheries were included in the language of the statute by the purpose to assist the Indians
to train themselves. Fishing was said to give value to
the islands. "The use of the adjacent fishing grounds was
equally essential. Without this the colony could not
prosper in that location." Alaska Pacific Fisheries v.
United States, 248 U. S. 78, 89.
The conditions as to the waters around the Annette
Islands closely parallel those of other Alaska areas actually occupied by natives. The Annette Islands case was
relied upon by the Secretary of the Interior for his authority to include the fisheries under § 2 of the Act of May 1,
1936. 56 Int. Dept. 110. The Alaska aborigines, like
the Metlakahtlans, are fishermen. They, too, depend
upon the waters for a large part of their support. For
them the adjacent fisheries are as important as, perhaps
more important than, the forests, the fur-bearing animals
or )the minerals.
Respondents urge upon us the cases in this and other
courts which have held that the phrase "public lands," the
ierm now under consideration, used in § 2 of the Act of
May 1, 1936, does not include any area extending below
mean high tide.3" As the respondents state, this case
turns not on tidelands, the area between mean high and
mean low tides, but on whether the Secretary could include coastal waters in the reservation, i. e., the area
39Borax, Ltd. v. Log Angeles, 296-U. S. 10, 17, 22. This case
turned on'the bower of the United States to convey tideland seaward
of the line of mean high tide after California's admission, to the
Union. Public lands there could not include' tidelands as they
passed to California when she became a state. The cases. cited in
the Borax case to support the statement as to public lands are
case's that have nothing to do with tidelands or coastal iwaters but
depend upop whether the lands in question. were subject to disposal
ds proper ty of the United States, i. e., public lands. See Newhall v.
Sanger, 92 U. S. 761, 763; Barker v>,Harvey, 181 U. S. 481,490;

"3,000 feet from the shore line at mean low tide." As
we understand respondents' argument and as we see this
case, the question of tidelands is not significant. Reference to Mann v. Tacoma Land Co., 153 U. S. 273,
283, will make clear respondents' position. Before the
admission of Washington to statehood, November 11,
1889, 26 Stat. 1552, the United States issued land scrip
to Mann for location on "unoccupied and unappropriated public lands" and the holder made location on
tidelands and received the register's certificate therefor.
When Mann sought to restrain trespass on the land so
obtained, this Court held: "It is settled that the general
legislation of Congress in respect to public lands does not
extend to tide lands. There is nothing in the act authorizing the Valentine scrip, or in the circumstances which
gave occasion for its passage, to make an exception to the
general rule." P. 284. Respondents assert that the reference to public lands in § 2 should be construed in the
same manner, since the federal land laws apply to Alaska 4
as do the reasons for excluding waters seaward of mean
high tide.4
The Government points out that 'the cases relating
to the limits of "public lands" are cases where final disposition, not temporary use, of the lands appeared.
When one deals with a statute so large in purpose as
to justify the above-quoted comment of the Secretary
of the Interior that it "provides a method by which the
financial aid provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act
may be extended to those Indians and Eskimos of Alaska
who occupy established villages," one may not fully comof May 14, 1898, c. 299, 30 Stat. 409, 48 U. S. C. § 371

prehend the statute's scope by extracting from it a single
phrase, such as "public lands," and getting the phrase's
meaning from the dictionary or even from dissimilar statutes. Section 2 of'the Act of May 1, 1936, is but one
of a series of enactments relating to Alaska natives, lands
and fisheries. It must "be taken as intended to fit into
the existing system" and interpreted in that aspect.4'
There is nothing that we have found in the statute or the
legislative history to justify the significance put upon the
use of the words "public lands" in the clause of § 2 under
discussion instead of "lands" used in the preceding clauses.
if a differentiation was intended, surely it would have
been more definitely expressed.
Taking into consideration the importance of the fisheries to the Alaska natives, the temporary character of the
reservation, the Annette Islands case, the administrative determination, the purpose of Congress to assist the
natives by the Alaska amendment to the Wheeler-Howard
Act, we have concluded that the Secretary of the Interior
was authorized to include the waters in the reservation.
No injunction therefore may be obtained because of the
invalidity of Order No. 128.
III.
Subdivision II of this opinion has been directed toward
the determination of the scope of § 2 of the Act of May. 1,
1936, extending the Wheeler-Howard Act to Alaska.
We were led to hold that Order 128, set out in full in
note 1, supra, validly included in the reservation the
waters to a distance of 3,000 feet from its shores. In
his handling of the problems of the Karluk natives as
affected by their need for a reservation and fishing
rights, the Secretary of the Interior took another step
under the authority of § 1 of another act, the White

Cf. United States v. Jefferson Electric Co., 291 U. S. 386, 397.

NES v. GRIMES PACKING CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Act. The section is set out at length in the text beginning on page 92of this opinion. The Act was for the
protection of the fisheries of Alaska. Section 1 authorized the Secretary to set apart fishing areas in any of
the waters of Alaska and establish in those preserves
closed seasons "during which fishing may be limited or
prohibited."
Pursuant to this statute detailed regulations were issued by the Secretary of Commerce and they have been
continued by the Secretary of the Interior since Reorganization Plan No. II, note 4, supra."3 One area established Was the Kodiak Area which included the waters
here in questioii.". Among the waters atfirst closed to
commercial salmon fishing were the Karluk River spawning waters and those within 100 yards of its mouth.5
Later the Secretary of the Interior, still acting solely
under § 1 of the White Act, added the waters of the
Karluk Reservation to the prohibited areas." An exception was made in the regulation to the prohibition
against fishing in the reservation waters. The precise
language of the entire subsection (r) of the regulation,
§ 208.23, is on page 92 of this opinion. We repeat here
the exception:
"The foregoing prohibition shall not apply to fishing by natives in possession of .aid reservation, nor.
to fishing by other persons under authority granted
by said natives (49 Stat. 1250; 48 U. S. C. 358a).
Such authority shall be granted only by or .pursuant
to ordinance of the Native Village of Karluk, approved by the Secretary of the Interior or his-duly
autlhorized representative."

Opinion of the Court.

337 U. S.

The citation to 49 Stat. 1250 is to the Act of May 1, 1936,

authorizing the creation of the reservation. Perhaps it
was thought that the creation of the reservation justified
this exception in the White Act regulation but we do not
understand that any support from that Act is claimed
for the establishment of the White Act preserve.
The validity of the exception permitting fishing by
natives in possession of the reservation and their licensees
is challenged by respondents because of a proviso in § 1
of the White Act, reading:
"Provided, That every such regulation made by the
Secretary of Commerce shall be of general application within the particular area to which it applies,
and that no exclusive or several right of fishery shall
be granted therein, nor shall any citizen of the United
States be denied the right to take, prepare, cure,
or preserve fish or shellfish in any area of the waters
of Alaska where fishing is permitted by the Secretary
of Commerce .

Respondents alleged that the exception for fishing by
natives and their licensees made § 208.23 (r) wholly illegal because it was inconsistent with the proviso of § 1
of the White Act as to exclusive or several right of fishery.
The District and Circuit Courts agreed with this argument and the District Court said that the regulation
must be viewed in its entirety, 67 F. Supp. 43, 49. We
-agree that it is not possible to separate the closing of
the area from the exception and thus hold the closing
applicable to everyone. A right to fish locally is too
important to the natives in Alaska for us to conclude
from this record that the Secretary would have promulgated the prohibition to fish for salmon in reservation
waters without the exception in favor -Qf the natives.
We have no doubt, however, that the 'White Act authorizes the establishment of White Act preserves or

HYNES v. GRIMES PACKING CO.

Opinion of the Court:

closed areas in reservations created, as the Karluk Reservation, under § 2 of the Act extending the WheelerHoward Act to Alaska. No implications can be drawn
from the broad and clear language of the White Act that
reservation waters, however valuable for fishing or fish
propagation, must be left unprotected from ruthless
exploitation.
What we have said heretofore in this opinion as to
the importance of fisheries and their conservation to
Alaska natives with reference to the Karluk River area
in particular need not be repeated. The quoted section
of the, White Act gives power to the Secretary so
that he may "(c) make such regulations as to time,
means, methods, and extent of fishing as he may
deem advisable.". Then follows the proviso that every
such regulation shall be of general application and
that no, exclusive or several right of fishing shall be
granted therein. This section was enacted to correct
alleged abuses that arose in the administration of the
Act "For the protection and regulation of the fisheries
of Alaska," approved June 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 478. By § 6
of the earlier act, streams or lakes could be set aside as
permanent preserves but not coastal waters. Although
the 1906 Act did not delegate regulatory powers in the
amplitude of the White Act, fishing reservations in territorial waters were created by Executive Order and regulations were issued thereunder." The policy behind these
regulations and their administration was to restrict the
right to fish commercially to those 'who had formerly
fished in these areas. See Fisheries Service Bulletin No.

Opinion of the Court.

For the conservation of the fisheries, it was recognized
that administrative flexibility must be permitted.
"The- waters of Alaska are so vast and the local
conditions so varied that it is utterly impossible to
prescribe by legislation in detail the provisions necessary to meet each situation. To attempt to do
so would be to defeat the purposes sought. This
can be done by placing broad powers and a wide
discretion in the administrative branch having charge
of the subject." S. Rep. No. 449 on H. R. 8143

Although § 8 of the White Act left a power in the Territorial Legislature of Alaska to impose taxes or licenses
for fishing, we do not read § 8 as limiting the power to
license fishing to the Territorial Legislature. The section does not make the legislative power exclusive.. Since
§ 1 of the White Act not only authorizes the establishment of fishing preserves but also requires that the fishing
be -carried on. "in conformity with such rules and regulations as the Secretary prescribes under the authority
herein given," " we are of the opinion that licenses for
fishing may be required in areas regulated under the
White Act. We think, however, these licenses may be
only regulatory in character and, within the discretion
of the Secretary, must have their cost fixed so as not

to exceed the estimated approximate cost of reasonable
policing of the area. We do not read the White Act
as empowering the Secretary to raise general funds for
native welfare or general conservation purposes from
White Act preserves.
As § 208.23 (r) with its exception in favor of the natives
in possession of Karluk Reservation and their licensees
is based upon § 1 of the White Act, we think it clear
that its proviso, "that no exclusive or several right of
fishery shall be granted therein," applies to commercial
fishing by natives equally with fishing companies, nonresidents of IAlaska or other American citizens, and so
applies whether those natives are or ,are not residents
on a reservation. We find nothing in the White Act that
authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant reservation occupants the privilege of exclusive commercial fishing rights. It seems also clear to us that the adoption of
a corporate charter and'a constitution by the Native Village of Karluk under §§ 16 and 17 of the Wheeler-Howard
Act, discussed at pp. 106-107, supra, can add nothing to
the power of the Secretary under the White Act. "Exclusive," as used in§ 1 of the White Act, forbids not only a
grant to a single person or corporation but to' any special
group or number of people. The legislative history set
out above shows this. The offending regulations which
brought about the enactment of the proviso in § 1 of the
White Act were administered so as to limit fishing to those
who had been using the fisheries before the regulations.
The White Act fishing preserves were not intended to furnish a monopoly to a favored few. Whatever may be the
powers of the Department of the Interior or the natives as
to regulating the entrance of persons other than natives in
possession of Karluk Reservation into or on the area of
land and water in that reservation," they are not broad

enough to allow the use of the White Act sanctions to
protect the reservation against trespass. White Act sanctions are for White Act violations. The Department of
the Interior by § 208.23 (r) has decided upon the conservation of fisheries in the described waters of the Karluk
Reservation in accordance with the White Act, with an
exception in favor of the natives that seems to rest on the
fact that the natives are on a reservation that includes
the White Act conservation area. This cannot be done.
The welfare of the 57 electors of Karluk Reservation and
their families is important. The Secretary of the Interior,
however, cannot give them such preferences as are here
given under the authority of the White Act. Other
American citizens are equally entitled to the' benefits
from White Act preserves.' We hold that the regulation
§ 208.23 (r) is void as a whole because it violates the
proviso of the White Act. See p. 93.
IV.
There are problems connected with the administration
of the Karluk Reservation and the protection of the fishing preserves that have not been determined by the courts
or the Department of the Interior. Our holding that
coastal waters may be included in the reservation waters
and that the White Act cannot be used to create a monopoly in the Indiaris establishes a different basis for administrative and judicial conclusions. The 1945 ordinance

must be considered; it appears in the margin.' It states
that Public Land Order 128 restricts the right to fish
commercially in the reservation waters to Karluk inihabitants. This ordinance antedates the regulation. See

the creation of the reservation gave exclusive fishing

U. S. 510. So far as appears, after once approving an
ordinance the Department's only direct control over the
ordinance is by approval or disapproval of amendments."
This is an equitable proceeding in which the respondents seek protection against unlawful action by petitioner,
the Regional Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service
of the Department of the Interior. The interests of
respondents, the Indians of Karluk Reservation, and the
efforts of the Department of the Interior to administer
its responsibilities fairly to fishermen and Indians are
involved. 8 These are questions of public policy which
equity is alert to protect. 9 This Court is far removed
from the locality and cannot have the understanding of

With our conclusion on the law as to the establishment
of the reservation and the invalidity of the regulation
before them, the Department and the parties should have
a reasonable time, subject to the action of the District
Court on the new proposals, to adjust their affairs so
as to comply with our determinations.
We therefore vacate the decrees of the District Court
and the Court of Appeals and remand this proceeding
to the District Court with directions to allow thirty days
from the issuance of our mandate for the Secretary of
the Interior to give consideration to the effect of our
decision. Unless stes are taken in this proceeding the
District Court, on the expiration of thirty days, shall
enter a decree enjoining the defendant Hynes and all
acting in concert with him, substantially as ordered in
the permanent injunction entered November 6, 1946.0
If timely steps are taken, the District Court will, of course,
be free to enter such orders as it may deem proper and
not inconsistent with, the present decision. Pending the
entry of further orders by the District Court, the preliminary injunction entered July 18, 1946, shall apply
to protect the rights of the respondents.
It is so ordered.

dians the tidelands and coastal waters therein described.
This action was taken pursuant to the statutory authorizations recited in the order and particularly the Act of
May 1, 1936, 49 Stat. 1250, 48 U. S. C. § 358a. When
approved by the Indians in accordance with the proviso
of the latter Act, Order 128 withdrew the area covered
from any general or public right of access for fishing or
other purposes inconsistent with those of the reservation
and set aside that area for the exclusive benefit of the
Indian occupants and inhabitants. Cf. Alaska Pacific
Fisheries v. United States, 248 U. S.78. The necessary
effect was to forbid others to enter the area for purposes
inconsistent with the reservation's objects, thus making
persons so entering trespassers and subject to such remedies as the law may afford to prevent or redress their
wrongful entry.
By his 1946 amendments to .the Alaska Fisheries General Regulations, 50 C. F. R., 1946 Supp., § 208.23 (r), the
Secretary of the Interior reinforced his prior action in
setting aside the Karluk Reservation, prohibiting fishing
within the coastal waters included in Public Land Order
128, except "by natives in possession of said reservation"
and "by other persons under authority granted by said
natives . . . by or pursuant to ordinance of the Native

Village of Karluk" approved by the Secretary or his duly
authorized representative.2 This action'was taken pursuant to 34 Stat. 263, 478, as amended by the White Act
of June 6, 1924, 43 Stat. 464, as amended June 18, 1926,
44 Stat. 752.
That Act, in the interest of "protecting and conserving
the fisheries of the United States in all waters of Alaska,"
conferred upon the Secretary of Commerce (now Interior), broad powers to "set apart and reserve fishing areas

in any of the waters of Alaska over which the United
States has jurisdiction" and within such areas to "establish closed seasons during which fishing may be limited
or prohibited as he may prescribe." See Dow v. Ickes,
74 App. D. C. 319. Effective penal provisions by way of
criminal sanctions and for seizure and forfeiture of offending boats, gear and appliances were enacted to prevent or redress violation of the regulations made pursuant to the statute's authorization.'
The promulgation of Amended Regulations § 208.23 (r),
pursuant to the White Act's provisions, reinforced the
effect of Public Land Order 128 in withdrawing the area
covered by the latter from public or common right of
entry for fishing and other purposes. But it had also
the further effect of rotifying the public that trespass
upon the reserved area by persons not entitled to enter
and use it would be met with the White Act sanctions'
for enforcement of the order and the amended regulations.
Although holding Public Land Order 128 valid and
effective to establish the reservation for the Indians' exclusive benefit, the Court finds Amended Regulations
§ 208.23 (r) "void as a whole." The chief consequence
held to follow is that the White Act sanctions cannot be
applied to enforce the regulations or to prevent or redress
trespass upon the reservation by others than the Indians
in possession or their licensees.
With this conclusion I cannot agree. The amended
regulations' invalidity is said to follow solely because
of the exception permitting natives and their licensees
to fish in reservation waters. This is said to violate the
White Act proviso, which forbids any "exclusive or sev3 Reference is made to the Court's opinion at pp. 92-93 for the pertinent language of the statute and at note 49 for the Act's penal

eral right of fishery" and denial to any citizen of the
right to fish in any waters where fishing is permitted by
the Secretary's regulations. In other words, because the
Secretary allows the Indians to fish in the reservation
waters he must allow all others to do so on equal terms,
otherwise his regulations become totally void and the
White Act sanctions unavailable for protection. of the
reservations and the Indians' rights.
This view, it seems to me, rests upon two fallacies.
One is that the two statutes, of 1936 and 1924, are in
irreconcilable collision and the Secretary cannot exercise
the powers given to him by the 1936 Act and by the. White
Act consistently and simultaneously with reference to the
same waters. The other fallacy is a corollary, namely,
that the White Act proviso applies wherever the White
Act prohibitions and sanctions may be made applicable,
even though the area is a valid Indian reservation.
I do not think the two statutes are in such inescapable'
inconsistency as forbids their simultaneous and harmonious application in setting aside and protecting reservations for the exclusive use and benefit of the native Indian
population. Indeed their legislative history and purposes
demonstrate that they were intended to serve common
objects in the conservation and protection of Alaskan
fisheries.
The White Act was adopted in 1924. Its primary object was to preserve the fisheries of Alaska from the destructive private exploitation then taking place. That
evil did not arise from any previous, existing, or anticipated policy of setting aside reservations for the exclusive
benefit of the natives. It arose exclusively from quite the
contrary policy of permitting widespread commercial exploitation by specially favored groups, not of Indian' but
of others who sought and secured monopolistic privileges
and favors in fishing. There were therefore twin evils at

HYNES v. GRIMES PACKING CO.

J., dissenting in part.

which the White Act struck. One was the rapid ahd virtually unrestrained depletion and destruction of the fisheries; the other, the expanding creation of commercial
monopolies fostered by' preexisting policy in regulating
the industry. 65 Cong. Rec. 9520-9521; see also 65
Cong. Rec. 9680-9682; H. R. Rep. No. 357, 68th Cong.,
1st Sess. 2; S. Rep. No. 449, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. 5; Hearings before the House Committee on Merchant Marine
and Fisheries on H. R. 2714, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.
The White Act, accordingly, was not merely and exclusively an antimonopoly statute. It was both a conservation measure and one to outlaw private, commercial
monopoly. The conservation features were contained in
the basic general provisions giving the Secretary his broad
powers of control over fishing. The more specific antimonopoly features were included in the proviso. The
latter were important. But they did not override or minimize the more general provisions, apart from the proviso,
giving the Secretary power to regulate the industry in the
interest of "protecting and conserving the fisheries of the
United States in all waters of Alaska." The proviso
merely limited the manner in which his power was to be
exercised in the situations to which the prov-iso was
applicable.
So the questions arise whether the proviso was intended
to have any effect in,.waters validly set aside by Congress,
executive order, or the Secretary as reservations for the
exclusive benefit of the .native population and, correlatively, whether the policy. of the proviso was meant to
forbid the application of other provisions of the White
Act, including its prohibitions and sanctions, in the protection and conservation of such reservations. In other
words, was the general policy of the White Act in co'nffict
with the policy existing at its enactment concerning
Alaskan Indian reservations or later under the. 1936 Act,

so as to require that the two policies or statutes be kept
entirely separate and distinct in their application and
administration and to forbid them to be applied co6ijointly in executing their common conserving and
protecting objects?
Certainly, the White Act proviso had no purpose to
throw open validly created Indian reservations to fishing
by all comers. Its aim was not to destroy such reservations or 'to open them to general, common rights of fishing.
In view of the legislative history cited above, which is
consistently supported by subsequent administrative construction',5 the proviso Cannot be construed as expressing.
any policy hostile to creating such reservations with
*exclusive rights of fishing for the native population and
protecting them against wrongful invasion. On the contrary, the 'statute, including the proviso, was strongly
supported by the delegates in Congress from Alaska and
others representing the native interests 'as against those
of commercial exploitation toward which the Act was
aimed. There were numerous Indian reservations in existence at the time of the legislation, cf. Alaska Pacific
Fisheries v. United States, supra, affording the natives
exclusive fishing rights. But the extensive legislative
history discloses no prqtest, complaint or concern arising
,on account of them. Indeed it gives strong reason for
believing that the native interests joined with others in
opposing continuance of the. policy of monopolistic commercial exploitation and in support of the White Act,
including the proviso, as a necessary method of preventing
the imminent destruction of the 'natives' historic means

of livelihood by that form of exploitation, and not at
all by reason of any evils arising out of exclusive fishing
rights granted to the native population in reservations
validly created for its benefit.
Consequently, far from representing an attitude or purpose of hostility toward a policy of Indian reservations
with exclusive native rights of fishing, the White Act
constituted an effective step toward conserving the Alaskan fisheries, under the Secretary's broad regulatory powers, for such purposes as well as for the prevention of
monopoly in open fishing areas where no reservations
existed.
It follows, in my view, that the White Act proviso
has, and was intended to have, no application to validly
created Indian reservations, either to forbid the Secretary
to exclude others than natives from fishing in the reservation waters or to compel him, if he allows the natives
to fish, to permit all other citizens to do so on equal terms.
The proviso had no purpose so to restrict his powers
in relation to reservation areas. It was directed solely
against abuses by other than native interests in waters
not included within areas set aside for the natives' exclusive benefit.
But it does not follow, in my opinion, that because the
proviso is inapplicable the Secretary is forbidden to
exercise his regulatory and enforcing powers under the
White Act in protection of reservations and the natives'
exclusive rights in them or that he cannot utilize those
powers and the White Act sanctions conjointly with his
authority under the 1936 Act to create reservations and
protect them against unlawful invasion. The White Act
proviso aside as inapplicable in purpose and intent to the
specific situation, i. e., one involving a validly created
reservation, nothing in either statute forbids his doing
so. Each is in terins a conservation measure,*hav.ing the.

common object of preserving and protecting the Alaskan
fisheries from unrestricted exploitation and destruction
by commercial interests. That community of 'purpose is
not affected by the fact that the one Act secures this
protection for the public generally, the other for the
special benefit of the native population. That difference
merely, means that two interests require and are given
protection against a third, not that the latter acquires
immunity against protection afforded either or both of
the other two.
Accordingly, in my opinion, the White Act proviso
being inapplicable to waters included in a valid Indian
reservation, the two statutes may be applied to serve
their basic common objects of conserving and protecting
fisheries in all Alaskan waters, including those set apart
as valid Indian reservations, as against the private, commercial exploitation and monopoly which the White Act
and the Act of 1936 were intended to prevent. The
.statutes should be construed, and Congress, I think, intended them to be construed, so as to work together
harmoniously, not irreconcilably, to achieve this object.
I therefore cannot regard Amended Regulations
§ 208.23 (r) as "void as a whole." The 'regulations are
valid, in my judgment, and enforceable by application of
the White Act sanctions, except possibly in one respect.
This is the feature by which the Secretary has delegated
to, the Village of Karluk the authority by ordinance to
license others than natives of the village to fish on terms
fixed by the ordinance subject to the Secretary's approval.
Conceivably that power might be exercised by the village,
through licensing others than' native inhabitants, in a
manner which would violate the spirit bf the White Act
proviso, i. e., by licensing favored commercial interests
so a& to create essentially the type or types of monopoly
or favoritism the proviso intended to forbid.

It is one thing of course for the Secretary to give the
natives exclusive rights of fishing in the reservation's
waters. It may be entirely another for him to delegate
to them the licensing of others, even retaining the power
to approve the licensing ordinance as Amended Regulations § 208.23 (r) does.
II.
Whether or not the authority conferred by the regulations upon the village to license others is valid is a
question, however, which I think it neither necessary
nor appropriate to answer in this proceeding, for reasons
affecting the existence and propriety of exercising equity
jurisdiction in this cause, now to be stated.
I seriously doubt the existence of equity jurisdiction
on the showing made by this record. But in any event
I do not think it should be exercised to afford respondents
the relief they have sought. The Secretary of the Interior, whose regulations and authority are at stake, has
not been made a party to the suit. Nor has the Village
of Karluk, which obviously is vitally interested. Moreover, the allegations concerning threatened enforcement
of the regulations* by White Act sanctions seem questionably sufficient to establish the basis for equitable
intervention, in view. of circumstances appearing in the
record and asserted in briefs filed here questioning their
sufficiency.
But, if, all these factors are put to one side, one other
remains which in my opinion precludes granting the
equitable- relief respondents seek. Their claim was
founded in the complaint, as I think :it had to be, not
only upon the alleged invalidity of Amended Regulations
§ 208.23 (r), but also upon the asserted invalidity of Public Land Order 128. However, they have not been successful in the latter attack, for the Court holds that Public

Land Order 128 is valid and was effective to create the
Karluk Reservation according to that order's terms.
This ruling cuts all valid ground from beneath respondents'. claim to aid from a court of equity. With it, they
come not as persons entitled of right to enter the reservation and fish, but solely as trespassers having no right
of entry, but seeking only to avert the incidence of possible remedies for threatened wrongful entry. In effect
the Court's decision is that respondents, although 'they
have not put forward their case in this light, are entitled
to. have it so determined and to have equitable relief
which prevents possible application of White Act sanctions against them. I cannot agree that persons so situated have standing to invoke the assistance of a court
of equity. Accordingly I think the judgment should be
reversed and the cause should be remanded with instruetions to dismiss it.
