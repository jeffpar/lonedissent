CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS kOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 558.

Argued April 22, 1949.-Decided June 20, 1949.

A natural-gas company which is subject to the Natural Gas Act may
sell the leases covering an estimated 12% of its total gas reserves
without the approval and contrary to, an order of the Federal
Power. Commission. Pp. 499-507.
1. Section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act, excluding "the production or gathering of natural gas" from the Commission's jurisdiction, left the transfer of gas leases to state regulation and outside
the scope of the Commission's regulatory powers. Pp. 502-505.
2. Sections 5 (b), 6 (a) and (b), 8 (a), 9 (a), 10 (a) and 14 (b),
empowering the Commission to make investigations, to prescribe
rules for the keeping of accounts and records:by natural-gas companies, and to require Aem to file such reports as are deemed
necessary by the Commission in the proper administration of the
Act, do not require a different result. Pp. 505-507.
3. Nor is a different result ' required by §§ 7 (c), 4, 5 and 16,
authorizing the Commission to issue certificates of convenience
and necessity for the interstate transportation and sale of natural
gas, to determine reasonable rates for such transportation and
sa#e, and to do the things appropriate to carry out the provisions
of the Act--even when the leases involved were used to justify
the issuance of certificates of convenience and fiecessity. Pp.
507-508.
4. Nor is a different result required by § 7 (b), which forbids
any natural-gas company, to abandon any of its facilities subject
to the jurisdiction of the, Commission without the prior approval
.of the Commission. Pp. 508-513.
5. The conclusion here reached is supported by the undisputed
finding by the District Court that it has been the practice for
natural-gas companies to trade freely in gas leases and that the
Commission has never before asserted the right to regulate the
transfer of such leases. Pp. 513-514.
6. Since the Commission could not stop the transfer of a gas
lease, it was not entitled to an injunction delaying such a transfer
until it could complete an investigation and determine its own
power and the necessity for using it. Pp. 514-516.

Opinion of the Court.

A Federal District Court denied an injunction sought
by the Federal Power Commission to bar the sale of certain gas leases by a natural-gas company subject to the
Natural Gas Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 172
F. 2d 57. This Court granted certiorari. 336 U. S. 935.
Affirmed, p. 516.
Bradford Ross argued the cause for petitioner. With
him on the brief were Solicitor General Perlman, Assistant Attorney General Morison, Philip Elman, Paul A.
Sweeney, Melvin Richter, Morton Hollander. B-nard A.
Foster, Jr. and Howell Purdue.
Robert P: Patterson and Jeff A. Robertson argued the
cause for respondents. With Mr. Patterson on the brief
for the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. were E. Ennalls
Berl, John S. L. Yost and Francis J. Sypher. With Mr.
Robertson on the brief for the State Corporation Commission of Kansas 'were Jay Kyle and Douglas Gleason.
Arthur G.. Connolly, Kevin McInerney, Gerard C.
Smith and Peter H. Kaminer filed a brief for, certain
stockholders, respondents. Charles S. Layton was also
of counsel.
MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.

Stated broadly this certiorari brings before us for review-a problem involving the scope of the.power over
the gas reserves of a. natural-gas company given to the
Federal Power Commission by the Natural Gas Act. 52
Stat. 821, as amended, 56 Stat. 83. Specifically the question to be decided is whether a natural-gas company,
subject to the Act, may sell the leases' covering an estimated twelve per cent. of its total gas reserves without
the approval and contrary to an order of the Commission.
The issue is made very sharply because the District
Court',and the Court of Appeals -have refused an injunction, sought by the Commission, to hold theconsumma-

tion of the sale in abeyance until the Commission, through
an admittedly permissible investigation, can determine
whether the disposal of these reserves will impair the
ability of Panhandle to supply its present and prospective
customers, in'the area which it has undertaken to serve
as a public utility. The Commission may find that public interest will best be served by requiring Panhandle
to retain these reserves. The public interest has strong
appeal to a couit of equity for its remedies once a legal
right is fairly in controversy.'
Respondent, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company
(herein called Panhandle), a Delaware corporation, transports and markets natural gas in interstate commerce
by means of its pipe-line system which runs from Texas
into Michigan. In addition it owns or controls gasproducing properties in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.
In September, 1948, Panhandle organized Hugoton
Production Company (hereinafter called Hugoton), also a
Delaware corporation. On October 11, 1948, pursuant to
a written agreement between the two companies Panhandle transferred to Hugoton gas leases on approximately 97,000 acres of land in Kansas and $675,000 in
cash. In return Panhandle received all the outstanding
capital stock of Hugoton and the option to purchase on
or after January 1, 1965, all or part of the gas produced
from this land, which is at present undeveloped and not
connected with any pipe-line system. The gas reserves
under this acreage are estimated at approximately 700
billion cubic feet. Hugoton thereafter contracted to sell
to the Kansas Power and Light Company for a period
of fifteen years from November 1, 1949, to November 1,
1964, the gas produced from these leases, which, according

to the contract, was to be consumed wholly within the
State of Kansas.
On the same date as the transaction between Panhandle and Hugoton, Panhandle declared a dividend of
the Hugoton stock to the holders of its common stock
at the rate of one-half share of Hugoton stock for each
share of common stock of Panhandle. The dividend was
to be paid November 17, 1948, to Panhandle's stockholders of record on October 29, 1948. Nothing called
to our attention indicates any control retained by Panhandle over the Hugoton stock.
On October 26, 1948, the Federal Power Commission
(hereinafter called the Commission) ordered an investigation "pursuant to the provisions of Section 14 of the
Natural Gas Act, of the facts and circumstances involved
in the formation and proposed operation of the Hugoton
Production Company and the transfer to said company
by Panhandle Eastern of the natural-gas reserves .... "
By a supplementary order of November 10, 1948, Hugoton was joined as a party, a date for a public hearing
was fixed, and Hugoton and Panhandle ordered to show
cause why they should not be directed to cancel the
contract, and why Panhandle should not be prohibited
from transferring the leases without the consent of the
Commission and from distributing the Hugoton stock to
its stockholders. Pending a final determination, the Commission ordered that the status quo be maintained by
Panhandle and Hugoton.
Upon the apparent refusal of Panhandle to comply
with this order, the Commission on November 13, 1948,
instituted the instant suit in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, seeking a preliminary
injunction and a temporary restraining order to compel
Panhandle to proceed no further with the stock distribution and to maintain the status quo pending the final
determination of the questions for which the hearing

issued the temporary 'estraining order which has been
kept in effect by successive orders and which enjoined
Panhandle from issuing to its stockholders the dividend
of Hugoton stock. Panhandle was ordered to cause Hugoton to refrain from transferring any of the gas leases
and from issuing or transferring any of its capital stock.
After a hearing, the District Court refused to grant the
preliminary injunction, On the grouind that' there had-not
been shown any basis for the relief sought by the

'On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit

production or gathering of natural gas" from the Commission's jurisdiction, left the transfer of gas leases to
state regulation and outside the scope of the Commission's regulatory powers. 172 F. 2d 57. The State Corporation Commission of Kansas had been granted leave

templated the exercise of federal power as specified in
the .Act,:. particularly in that interstate segment which
the'states were powerless to regulate because of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.' The jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission was to complement that of the state regulatory bodies." Accordingly,
Congress in § 1 (b) of the Act not -only prescribed the
intended reach of the Commission's power, but also specifid..the areas into which this power was not to extend.
Section 1 (b) provides as follows:
'.(b - The provisions of this Act shall apply to the
transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce,
to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas
for resale for ultimate public consumption for domest.ic, commercial, industrial, or any other use, and

portation or sale of natural gas or to the.local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities used for
such distribution or to the production or gathering'
of natural. gas."
"This section determines the Act's coverage and does so
in the light of the situation existing at the time. Three
-things and three only Congress drew within its own
regulatory power,' delegated by the Act to its agent, the
Federal Power Commission. These were: (1) the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce; (2)its
sale in interstate commerce for 'resale; and (3) natural

mission of Indiana, 332 U. S. 507, 516. The Act, moreover, expressly exempts from its coverage ' (1) any other
transportation or sale of natural gas; (2) the local distribution of natural gas; (3) the facilities used for local
distribution; and (4) the production and gathering of
natural gas.
The Commission seeks to distinguish between the activities of production and gathering, such as drilling,
spacing wells,, or collecting gas, and the facilities, such
as reserves and gas leases, used therefor and argues that
only the former were excluded from the coverage of the
Act. In support of this position it is pointed out that
the section specifically exempts both the local distribution
and the facilities used therefor, while it makes no mention
of the facilities used for production or gathering.P In
the face of the unambiguous language of the Act and
its legislative background, we cannot ascribe such, a
narrow meaning to the words, "the production or gathering of natural gas." In Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v.
Fedetal Power Commission, 324 U. S. 581, 603, we said

covered by the language affirmatively stating the jurisdiction of the
Commission, but similar language was in previous bills, and, rather
than invite the contention, however unfounded, that the elimination
of the negative language would broaden the scope of the act, the
committee has included it in this bill." H. R. Rep. No. 709, 75th

that this phrase comprehended the producing properties
and gathering facilities of a natural-gas company. We
now adhere to this natural and clear meaning of the
words and their obvious expression of congressional intent.7 Of course leases'are an essential part of production.
The Commission cites §§ 5 (b), 6 (a) and (b), 8 (a),
9 (a), 10 (a), and 14 (b) to show that Congress intended
"to confer a certain measure of authority upon the Commission" over the production and gathering of gas.
These sections empower the Commission to make investigations, to prescribe rules for the keeping of accounts
and records by the natural-gas companies, and to require
that the companies file such reports as are deemed necessary by the Commission in the proper administration
of the Act. These powers are inquisitorial in nature and
were designed to aid the Commission in exercising its
powers and "to serve as a basis for recommending further
legislation to the Congress." Section 14 (b), quoted below, comes closest to supporting the Commission's argu7 In a brief. prepared by the Solicitor of the Federal Power Com-.
mission for the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on the constitutionality of H. R. 11662, an earlier bill substantially. similar to the Natural Gas Act, the following 'appears as
part of the analysis of the bill: "The bill makes no attempt to regulate the production or gathering facilities of a natural-gas company,
this function being purely local in character, nor is any attempt made
to exercise control over distribution facilities." Hearings before a
subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce on H. R. 11662, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 17.
The Solicitor of the Federal Power Commission in testifying at the
same hearing also answered the following question:
"Mr. COLE (Member of Committee]. Does this-bill give anywhere
the Commission power over the source of natural gas in the different
fields in a manner which we might call comparable to that which your
Commission now has over hydroelectric generating plants?
"Mr. DEVANE [Solicitor of theF. P. C.]. It does not; no. It does
not attempt to regulate the gathering rates or the gathering business.

ment but that confers only power to obtain information.'
Although these sections bear evidence of congressional
consideration of the relationship of production properties
to other elements of the natural-gas business, they do
not even by implication suggest to us an extension of
the regulatory provisions of the Act to cover incidents
connected with the production or gathering of gas.
In Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Federal Power Commission, aupra, at 602, the Court in considering the more
important of these sections said that they described
powers which were aids to the "normal conventions" of
rate making. We held that the Commission in exercising
its rate-making authority could include the fair value
of the producing and gathering facilities in the rate base
of a natural-gas company. The primary duty of the
Commission is to fix just and reasonable rates for. the
transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce for resale. For this purpose the Court permitted
the Commission to examine and consider the cost of
production and gathering. The use of such data for
rate making is not a precedent for regulation of any
part of production or marketing. Before the Colorado
Interstate decision, it was apparent that the value of
producing facilities and the cost of gas bought by a
S"(b) The Commission may,.after hearing, determine the adez
quacy or inadequacy of the.gas reserves held or controlled by any
natural-gas company, or by anyone on its behalf, including its
owned or leased properties or royalty contracts; and may also, after
hearing, determine the propriety and reasonableness of the inclusion
in operating expenses, capital, or surplus of all delay rentals or other
-forms of rental or compensation for unoperated lands and leases. For
the purpose of such determinations, the Commission may require
any natural-gas company to file with the Commission true copies
of all its lease and royalty agreements with respect to such gas
-reserves."

Opinion of the Court.

natural-gas company from producers would be weighty
factors in rate making whether a rate-base method or
other method for fixing rates was used. Low valuation
by the Commission of producing properties or low-cost
allowance for purchased gas discourages exploration for
gas or its sale in interstate commerce.' Congress knew
this necessary relationship between production and distribution but-excluded the Commission from exercising
any direct control or regulation over the actual production and gathering of natural gas.
The Commission urges it has jurisdiction over the
transaction between Panhandle and Hugoton from the
powers granted to it by § 7 (c) of the Act which authorizes
it to issue certificates of convenience and necessity for
the interstate transportation-and sale of natural gas and
those granted to it by §§ 4 and 5 to determine reasonable
rates for such- transportation and sale.. It is pointed out
that Panhandle in thrqe applications for'certificates of
convenience and necessity to construct additional pipeline facilities had included the, acreage here involved as
part of its gas reserves, and certificates were issued, upon
the finding by the Commission that Panhandle had adequate reserves to warrant its. expansion."0 Moreover
Panhandle had been permitted to include these reserves
in its rate base as "used and useful property." The
Commission, therefore, argues that these gas leases which
Panhandle proposes to. grant to Hugoton have been
dedicated to the. discharge of Panhandle's public-utility
obligation to render adequate service at reasonable and
nondiscriminatory rates. From these circumstances, the

Commission concludes that these leases cannot be relinquished by Panhandle without the consent of the Commission, which has the implied power to protect its ratemaking function and to insure the maintenance of
adequate service by a natural-gas company. Sections 4,
5 and 7 do not concern the producing or gathering of
natural gas; rather they have reference to the interstate
sale and transportation of gag and are so limited by their
express terms. Thus §§ 4 (a), (b), (c), 5 (a) and 7 (c)
speak of "transportation or sale of natural gas subject
to the jurisdiction of the Commission" while § 7 (a) and
(b) refer respectively to "transportation facilities" and
"facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission."" Nothing in the sections indicates that the power
given to the Commission over natural-gas companies by
§ 1 (b) could have been intended to swallow all the exceptions of the same section and thus extend the power
of the Commission to the constitutional limit of congressional authority. ov.er commerce. The repetition of
the words "subject to the jurisdiction" makes clear to
us the intent to keep the Commission's hands out of
the excepted local matters. The same answer applies to
petitioner's argument that § 16 gives it authority to stop
sales of leases." The power to do the things appropriate
to carry out the provisions of the Act can hardly be
taken to rescind a prohibition against certain actions.
'The Federal Power -Commission leans heavily upon

of the Commission without the prior approval of the
Commission.13 The argument here is that since natural
gas is the "lifeblood" of a pipe-line system, a company
by disposing of its gas reserves, unhampered by Commission control, may render itself unable to continue
service; consequently abandonment of facilities and service without the consent of the Commission will result.
The argument begs the question. The section, like those
above, covers only 'facilities subject to the jurisdiction
of the Commission."
To accept these arguments springing from power to
allow interstate service, fix rates, and control abandonment would establish wide control by the Federal Power
Commission over the production and gathering of gas.
It would invite expansion of power into other phases
of the forbidden area."4 It would be an assumption of
powers specifically denied the Commission by the words
of the Act as explained in the report and on the floor.
of both Houses of Congress. 5 The legislative history

its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any
service rendered by means of such facilities, without the.permission
and approval of the Commission first had and obtained, after due
hearing, and a finding by the Commission that the available supply
of natural gas is depleted to the extent that the continuance of
service is unwarranted, or that the present or future
public convenience or necessity permit such abandonment."'
.14 Would it soon be contended that' statutory power to require.
extension of service, § 7 (a), included power to require exploration or
acquisition of leases or allocation of production to interstate pipe
lines in order to serve the public interest?
15 The report of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce on H. R. 6586, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., which became the.
Natural Gas Act, was adopted without change by the Senate Committee Qn Interstate Commerce as its report on the same bill. See
note 3, supra. The. following excerpts are taken from the report as
particularly pertinent:
"The bill is substantially identical with H. R. 12680 which, as

amended, was reported by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce of the Seventy-fou'th Congress, second session, with a
recommendation that it pass. If enacted, the present bill would for
the first.time provide for the regulation of natural-gas companies
transporting and selling natural gas in interstate commerce. It
confers jurisdiction upon the Federal Power Comniission over the
transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the sale
in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public
consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use.
The States have, of course, for many years regulated sales of natural
gas to consumers in intrastate transactions. The States have also
been able to regulatq sales to consumers even though such sales are
in interstate commerce, such sales being considered, local in character and in the absence of congressional prohibition subject to State
regulation. (See Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service. Commission "(1920), 252 U. S. 23.) There is no intention in enacting the
present legislation to disturb the States in their exercise of such
jurisdiction. However, in the case of sales for resale, or. so-caled
wholesale sales, in interstate commerce (for example, sales by producing companies. to distributing companies) the legal situation is
different. Such, transactions have been considered to be not local in
character and, even in the absence of Congressional action, not
subject to State regulation. (See Missouriv. Kansas Gas Co..(1924),
265 U. S. 298, and Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro Steam &
Electric Co. (1927), 273 U. S. 83.) The basic purpose of the present
legislation is to occupy this field in which the Supreme Court has held
that the States may not act.
The bill takes no authority from State commissions, and is
so drawn as to*complement and in no manner usurp State regulatoiy
authority, and contains provisions for cooperative action with State
regulatory bodies.

Likewise on the floor of the Senate, Chairman Wheeler of the

to the Act:
'iMr.AUSTIN. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Montana [Mr. Wheeler] a question concerning this bill? Does the bill
undettake'to regulate the production of natural gas, or does it undertake to regulate the pioducers of natural gas?

of this Act is replete with evidence of the care taken by
Congress to keep the power over the production and gathering of gas within the states."e This probably occurred
because the state legislatures, in the interests of conservation, had delegated broad and elaborate power to their
their responsibility? If we turn this over to the Interstate Commerce Commission, essentially what they do will be reflected all
over the country, because the interstate rates will be superimposed

on the State commissions and they must necessarily be governed by
them. Did not that happen to the railroads?
"Mr. WHEELER. There is no doubt about that, but this is an
entirely differbnt situation.
"Mr. CONNALLY. Yes; one involves the railroads and the other
involves gas.
"Mr. WHEELER. No. There is no attempt and can be no attempt under the provisions of the bill to regulate anything in the field
except" where it is not regulated at the present time. It applies only
as to interstate commerce .and only to the wholesale price of gas."

While Congress was considering the passage of the Natural Gas
Act, a bill (H. R. 5711 and S. 1919, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.) was introduced in both houses of Congress on Maich 17, 1937, which provided
that "this Act shall apply to the procurement of natural gas for the
purpose of its transmission through pipe lines and its sale, exchange,
transmission, or distribution in interstate -commerce

....

"

The

jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission was defined as follows:
"The [Federal Power] Commission shall have jurisdiction over all
facilities for the procurement of natural gas for its transmission
through pipe lines and its sale, or for exchange, or distribution in
interstate commerce, and over the ttansmission of natural gas in
pipe lines in interstate commerce and over the sale, or exchange of
natural gas in interstate commerce,Iaud over all facilities eonnected

regulatory bodies over all aspects of producing gas." The
Natural Gas Act was designed to supplement state power
and to produce a harmonious and comprehensive regulation of the industry." Neither state nor federal regulatory body was td encroach upon the jurisdiction of the
other." Congress enacted this Act after full consideration
of the problems of production and distribution. It considered the state interests as well as the national interest.
It had both producers and consumers in mind. Legislative adjustments were made to reconcile the conflicting
views.
The District Court found as a fact, and the finding is
undisputed by the Commission, that, "It has been the
practice in the natural gas industry for companies to trade
freely in gas leases, and the Commission has never heretofore asserted the right to regulate transfers of such
leases." Thus for over ten years the Commission has
never claimed the right to regulate dealings in gas acreage. Failure to use such an important power for so long
a time indicates to Us that the Commission did riot believe
the power existed.'0 In the light of that history we should
therewith as parts of a system of natural-gas transmission operated
in more than one State."
The provisions of this bill, -however, failed of adoption; instead
Congress enacted § 1 (b) with its specific exemptions from the coverage of the Act.

in the Act when that body has endeavored to be precise

of undeveloped gas leases is an activity related to the
production and gathering of natural gas and beyond the

cannot reach the sales. A proposed transfer cannot be

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS
and MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE concur, dissenting.

The Court's judgment and opinion in this case go far
toward scuttling the Natural Gas Act. 52 Stat. 821, as
amended, 56 Stat. 83. In that Act Congress declared
it "necessary in the public interest" for the Federal Government to regulate natural-gas companies engaged in
In an analogous situation before the institution of this litigation,
there had been uncertainty of opinion in the Commission as to the
reach of the Act toward sales by independent producers and gatherers
to natural-gas companies for transportation in interstate commerce.
See reports of the Federal Power Commission on its Natural Gas
Investigation (Docket No. G-580), transmitted to Congress on April
28, 1948. In Part IV of the report subscribed to by Commissioners
Smith and Wimberly, it is concluded at pp. 38 and 40:
"No reasonable basis is found in the Act or its legislative history
for a conclusion that, although the 'activities' of production and
gathering are exempt under Section 1 (b), sales of natural gas which
are made at arm's length by producers and gatherers who do not
thereafter transport it in interstate commerce may be regulated.
Unless such a distinction is specifically disclaimed, doubts and uncertairnties will continue to be felt and expressed regarding the possible
jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act of those who only produce
and gather natural gas and then sell it to others transporting such
gas in interstate commerce." Pp. 38-39.
"In view of the present unsettled state of this matter, it is desirable, as the Commission has heretofore recommended, that the Congress should adopt- appropriate amendatory legislation to make it
clear that.independent producers or gatherers of natural gas, and their
sales thereof to interstate pipe lines, are not subject to the provisions
of the Natural Gas Act. .Such.action will confirm what clearly an25

the interstate transportation and sale of natural gas.
.Many sections of the Act detailed the authority, granted
the Federal Power Commission to regulate such companies and in addition § 16 granted broad congressional
authority to the Commission "to. perform any and all
acts, and to prescribe, issue, make, amend, and rescind
such orders, rules, and -regulations as . . . necessary or

appropriate to carry out the provisions" of the Act.
Today's opinion interprets this Act as denying the Commission all authority to perform any action or issue any
order to regulate an interstate company's interest in
natural-gas properties. This interpretation deprives the
Commission of the power to discharge its congressionally
imposed duty to protect the public interest.
The •Court's sterilizing interpretation rests on an exception to Commission authority appearing in § 1 (b) of
the Act.1 That exception provides that the Act shall not
pears to have been the original intent of Congress when it enacted
the Natural Gas Act in 1938." Pp. 40-41.
See also the report subscribed to by Commissioners Olds and
Draper, pp. 12-14.
Congress is now giving consideration to this problem. See H. Hi

1 Today's opinion also relies on a "finding of fact" by the District
Court that the Commission had never heretofore "asserted the right
to regulate transfers of such leases." The majority opinion views
this "finding" as an evidence that for ten years "the. Commission did
not believe the power existed." But this "finding" of fact rests
only on affidavits offered in respect to a motion for a preliminary
injunction and should not be utilized as a prop to support the Court's
interpretation of the Act. Moreover, the Commission points out
that until the present time no such trading as is involved here had
taken place. The Commission states in its brief that the finding
,of fact "does not reflect the full picture. Until this time, such
trading has taken place with the view of blocking in reserves and
improving service, and so far as the Commission is presently aware,
not to achieve results which would derogate froni the Commission's
iurisdiction"

apply to "the production or gathering of natural gas." I
agree with the Court that this language is "unambiguous"
and that this Court should give the language its "natural and clear meaning." "Production" of gas would thus
mean the act of bringing forth gas from the earth, and
"gathering" would mean-the act of collecting gas after
it has been brought forth. Such are the "natural and
clear" meanings we had heretofore attributed to these
word symbols. Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Comm'n,
324 U. S. 581, 597-604; Interstate Gas Co. v. Power
Comm'n, 331 U. S. 682, 689-691. It was the physical
acts incident to the "production and gathering" of gaslocal activities-that our prior decisions emphasized Congress intended to leave states free to regulate. Today
the Court reads this congressionally granted privilege of
states to regulate the act of "production" as an absolute
bar to ithe Federal Power Commission's regulation of the
ownership 'of gas-reserve properties. Gas reserves are.
indispensable to proper service of interstate customers of
an interstate natural-gas company. And in thus limiting
the Commission's jurisdiction the Court leaves the Commission impotent to protect th public's interest in having
interstate companies maintain adequate gas reserves.
This disabling interpretation reads the Federal Act as
though it contemplated "ineffective regulation," an interpretation directly opposed to that we gave the Act
.inPanhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Public Service
Comm'n, 332 U. S. 507;520.
Section 7 (e) of the Act requires the Commission to
issue certificates of convenience and necessity only if an
interstate company is "able and willing properly to do the
acts and to perform the service proposed and to conform
to the provisions of the Act and the requirements, rules,
and regulations of the Commission thereunder ....
As authorized by § 7 (d), the Commission requires appli-

cants for certificates to show "the gas reserves which are
to supply the market which is proposeq to be served." '
And § 7 (b) denies a company power to "abandon all or
any portion of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of
the Commission . . . ." If evidence were needed to show
the importance Congress attributed to the gas reserve
facilities of a company, that evidence appears in §§ 7 (b),
7 (c) and 7 (e). Jurisdiction to regulate a natural-gas
company without jurisdiction to regulate its gas reserves
would be like granting jurisdiction to regulate railroads
without power to regulate the tracks, routes, rights-ofway, etc. And we have held that the Commission has
jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act to consider the
gas-producing properties. in fixing rates. Colorado Interstate Co. v. Federal Power Commnission, 324 U. S. 581;
PanhandleCo. v. Power Comm'n, 324 U. S. 635, 648-649.
The respondent company had its rate base fixed and its
ability to serve the public determined on its claim to ownership of the very gas reserve properties the Court now
permits it to sell to an affiliate over the protest of the
Commission. According to allegations in the Commission's complaint the respondent gas company has already
received from its customers large sums of money from
rates which reflected expenses incurred in maintaining
these reserves and for exploration and development costs
in relation to them. But under the Court's holding today,
these properties, increased in value by consumer contributions, can be given away by the respondent company
to its newly formed affiliate. Congress could not have
intended to render the Commission powerless to protect
gas reserves necessary to continued consumer service and
paid for by rates fixed to allow development of the
reserves.

Furthermore the reserves, costing only $160,000, have
now apparently been capitalized by the respondent's affiliated "purchaser" at $10,000,000. If the gas reserves
continue to be held bythe respondent company the rates
will be fixed on the basis-of the original $160,000 cost.
Panhandle Co.*v. Power Comm'n; 324 U. S. 635, 648. It
is at least doubtful whether after today's holding the
company can be prevented from hereafter charging rates
based on the $10,000,000 inflated valuation. Thus the
unwholesome practices that the Natural Gas Act was primarily designed to prevent are given a new lease on life.
For a purpose of the Act was to protect, consumers and
one of the evils it was aimed to prevent Was the holding
company technique of transfers and retransfers between
parent corporations, their offsprings and affiliates. Federal Power Comm'n v. Hope Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591, 610.
It seems inconceivable that Congress would have passed
an Act to regulate natural-gas companies with a wholly
neutralizing exception to bar regulation of the gas reserves
upon which the whole gas business depended. I cannot
attribute such a meaningless and deceptive action to the
Congress, While the Act itself grants broad Commission powers effectively to regulate gas companies, the
Court's interpretation deprives the Commission of power
essential to fixing fair rates and to protecting continued
services during the life of a company's gas 'reserves.
Today's opinion regards Congress' action like that of
a parent who ordered his offspring to go swimming with
a stern admonition not to go near the water.
I would reverse.
