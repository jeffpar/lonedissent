UNITED STATES ET AL. v. CAROLINA FREIGHT
CARRIERS CORP.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA.

No. 197.

Argued January 16, 1942.-Dcided March 2, 1942.

1. Under the "grandfather clause" of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935,
the Interstate Commerce Commission's authorization of operation
as a common carrier by motor vehicle within a specified "territory" may permit service to all points in part of the area and to
designated points in other parts. P. 480.
2. The precise delineation of the area or the specification of localities which may be served is for the Commission; and only where
error is patent may its determination be set aside. P. 480.
came committed to insure the bank-not later when, as a step to working its way out of loss, it took assets already equitably its own as a
pledge and put up money for a plan to continue banking facilities to the
community. To say that the note had been charged off is to stress
the irrelevant. This was, admittedly, long after the Corporation had
become bound as the bank's insurer. It also attributes to the "chargeoff" an unwarranted significance. The clamification of this paper as
inadmissible for a commercial bank would have been justified by its
obvious "slow" character, or may have been due to mere lack of information as to the ability of a nonresident debtor to meet it. It is
no acknowledgment or notice of a legal defect in the paper.

3. A holding out to serve a specified area does not in itself constitute
"bona fide operation" within the meaning of the Act; actual and
substantial service is required. P. 480.
4. In the authorization of operation as a common carrier under the
"grandfather clause," there is no statutory warrant for applying
to irregular route carriers a different or stricter test as to commodities which may be carried than is applied to regular route
carriers. P. 484.
5. In authorizing operation as a common carrier under the "grandfather clause" by an irregular route' carrier in this case, the
Interstate Commerce Commission determined that only certain
commodities could be carried and that some could be transported
only between designated points in the territory. Held, that the
basic or essential findings required to support the Commission's
order were lacking. P. 488.
(a) If an applicant for common carrier rights under the "grandfather clause" has, during the critical period, carried a wide variety
of general commodities, he can not necessarily be denied the right
to carry others of the same class merely because he has never
carried them before; nor can he necessarily be restricted to those
commodities which he carried with more frequency and in greater
quantities than he did others. P. 483.
(b) Nor does the fact that some of the articles were carried
before June 1, 1935, but not since, necessarily mean that they
should be excluded from the permit. P. 484.
(c) The questions are whether the applicant's service within
the territory was sufficiently regular and whether his coverage of
commodities was sufficiently representative to support a finding
that he was in "bona fide operation" as a "common carrier" of
the group of commodities or of the class or classes of property
during the critical period. P. 484.
(d) If the applicant establishes that he was a "common carrier"
of a group of commodities. or of an entire class or classes of property
and was in "bona fide operation" during the critical period in a
specified territory, restrictions as to commodities within such classes
which may be moved in any one direction or between designated
points are not justified. P. 486.
(e) Once the applicant has established his common carrier status
as respects particular commodities, shipments to any parts of the
authorized territory, or to any of the authorized points therein,
should be permitted, in the absence of evidence that the applicant

This is an appeal under § 210 (28 U. S. C. § 47a) and
§ 238 of the Judicial Code as amended (28 U. S. C. § 345),
to review a final decree of a district court of three judges
(28 U. S. C. § 47) which set aside (38 F. Supp. 549) an
order of the Interstate Commerce Commission (24
M. C. C. 305) granting appellee a certificate of public
convenience and necessity as a common carrier by motor
vehicle under the so-called "grandfather clause" (§ 206

south of Albany; and between Cherryville (N. C.) and
Boston, Mass., through Henderson, N. C., Richmond, Va.,
Baltimore, Md., Philadelphia, Pa., and New York, over
irregular routes." The Commission authorized the issuance of a certificate but restricted its scope in three ways.
(1) It cut down the geographical area which could be
served by appellee, and in parts of that area limited the
service to designated points. (2) It allowed appellee to
haul only certain specified commodities out of a larger
list previously hauled. (3) It did not permit appellee to
haul all of those specified commodities between all of the
points in the authorized territory, but allowed it to haul
only certain commodities between given points. Its finding containing those restrictions (24 M. C. C., p. 309-310)
reads as follows:

Carolina, all over irregular routes; that applicant is entitled to a certificate authorizing cofitinuation of such
operation; and that the application in all other respects
should be denied."
The District Court held that such restrictions were
not authorized by the statute. It said:
"It is. of course, reasonable to limit the certificate to
the type of service rendered by the carrier during the
grandfather period, and to limit the territory to that
within which substantial service of that type has been
rendered; but it is unreasonable to limit the certificate of
one who has functioned as a general carrier to the specific
commodities carried and the specific points served. The
law cannot reasonably be construed as authorizing such
limitation."
It further noted that such restrictions have not been
imposed on regular route carriers and that Congress has

made no such distinction between them and irregular
route carriers like appellee.
I. We think the Commission was justified in the restrictions which it placed on the geographical scope of
appellee's operations. Sec. 206 (a) of the Act authorizes
the Commission to issue a certificate without a showing of
public convenience and necessity if the carrier or its predecessor in interest was "in bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle on June 1, 1935, over the
route or routes or within the territory for which applica;.
tion is made and has so operated since that time." Sec.
208 (a) requires that the certificate specify "the'routes
over which, the fixed termini, if any, between which, and
the intermediate and off-route points, if any, at which,
and in case of operations not over specified routes or between fixed termini, the territory within which, the motor
carrier is authorized to operate." It is clear from these
provisions that the power of the Commission to authorize
future operations within a designated "territory," rather
than over specified routes or between fixed termini, fits
the peculiar requirements of irregular route operators
such as appellee. Authority to operate within a specified
"territory" may include permission to service all points in
that area. On the other hand it may be restricted to
designated points therein. Or as in the instant case, it
may extend to all points in a part of that area and to
selected localities in another part. The precise delineation of the area or the specification of localities which
may be serviced has been entrusted by the Congress to
the Commission. Alton R. Co. v. United States, ante,
p. 15. The Act provides the test of "bona fide operation."
That standard carries the connotation of substantiality.
It also makes clear that a holding out to serve a specified
area is not alone sufficient. It is "actual rather than
potential or simulated service" which is required. McDonald v. Thompson, 305 U. S. 263, 266. Substantial, as

475

481

Opinion of the Court.

distinguished from incidental, sporadic, or infrequent,
service is required. Substantial service actually rendered
may have been confined to narrow limits. Loving v.
United States, 32 F. Supp. 464, aff'd310 U. S. 609. Ability
to render the service throughout the wide reaches of the
territory, which the applicant professed to be willing to
serve, may not have existed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the transportation service rendered are relevant
to the territorial scope of the operations which the Commission may authorize. Alton R. Co. v. United States,
supra. In addition, the Commission, in determining the
precise territory which may be served by a particular carrier, cannot be unmindful of its responsibility to co6rdinate
the various transportation agencies which constitute our
national transportation system. S. Rep. No. 482, 74th
Cong., 1st Sess.; H. Rep. No. 1645, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.
This does not mean that the right to the statutory grant
may be withheld or cut down because the Commission
disapproves of the competitive conditions which may be
created if the application is granted. But its responsibility to bring greater order and stability to the transportation system than had earlier obtained (S. Doc. No.
152, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.) is an additional reason for its
insistence upon a showing of substantial service in that
territory which is sought to be covered by a certificate
under the "grandfather clause."
As we indicated in Alton R. Co. v. United States, supra,the purpose of the "grandfather clause" was to assure
those to whom Congress had extended its benefits a "substantial parity between future operations and prior bona
fide operations." We cannot say that that was denied
in this case, if the limitations on the territorial scope of
the operations are alone considered. While service to
and from all points in the States included in the application was not allowed, the reduction was determined by
the standard of substantiality of service. And considera-

tion was given to the characteristics of irregular route
carriers and their role in the national transportation system. That involved a weighing of specific evidence in
light of the complexities of this transportation service.
The judgment required is highly expert. Only where
the. error is patent may we say that the Commission
transgressed. That is not this case.
II. We have doubts, however, as to the restrictions
which the Commission has placed on the articles which
appellee may carry. Sec. 203 (a) (14) defined' the term
"common carrier by motor vehicle" as one who "undertakes . . . to transport passengers or property, or any
class or classes of property, for the general public in interstate or foreign commerce by motor vehicle for compensation, whether over regular or irregular routes."
The Commission ruled that since a "common carrier" may
transport only a "class or classes of property," the authority granted under the "grandfather clause" of § 206
(a) "should reflect any limitation in the undertaking" of
the common carrier "as indicated by the service actually
rendered on and since the statutory dates." It accordingly proceeded to eliminate commodities which, though
of the same general class as the others, had been carried
before but not after June 1, 1935. It further restricted
future operations to those commodities which prior and
subsequent to June 1, 1935, had been carried in substantial amounts and with a degree of regularity. We
'In 1940 Congress amended § 203 (a) (14) to read: "The term
'common carrier by motor vehicle' means any person which holds
itself out to the general public to engage in the transportation by
motor vehicle in interstate or foreign commerce of passengers or
property or any class or classes thereof for compensation, whether
over regular or irregular routes, . . ." Act of Sept. 18, 1940, c. 722,
§ 18 (a), 54 Stat. 920. The earlier definition of "common carrier"
was in force at the time of the hearing of this case before the

Commission.

U. S. v. CAROLINA CARRIERS CORP.

483

Opinion of the Court.

would not disturb those conclusions if only a question as
to the weight of the evidence was involved. But we are
not satisfied that the Commission applied the proper criterion in reaching its conclusion that only specified commodities could be carried in the future.
Sec. 206 (a) requires a showing that the applicant,
or its predecessor, was "in bona fide operation as a common carrier" on June 1, 1935, and "since that time." By
§ 208 (a) the certificate must specify "the service to be
rendered" by the carrier. As we have noted, a "common
carrier by motor vehicle" was defined in § 203 (a) (14) as
one who "undertakes" to transport "passengers or property, or any class or classes of property, for the general
public." That definition is the same for irregular and
regular route carriers. It is plain that a carrier's holding
out and actual performance may be limited to s. few
articles only. That is to say, he may be a common carrier only of a restricted number of commodities. See
Galveston Truck Line Corp., 22 M. C. C. 451,467. Or the
service actually rendered may have been confined to such
a few commodities that his holding out or willingness to
carry a much larger class may be disregarded. Loving v.
United States, supra,was such a case. On the other hand,
if the applicant has carried a wide variety of general commodities, he cannot necessarily be denied the right to carry
others of the same class merely because he never carried
them before. And where he has carried a wide variety of
general commodities, he cannot necessarily be restricted
to those which he carried with more frequency and in
greater quantities than the others. See H. B. Church
Truck Service Co., 27 M. C. C. 191, 197; Highway Motor
Freight Lines, Inc., 23 M. C. C. 621, 636. The Commission may not atomize his prior service, product by product,
so as to restrict the scope of his operations, where there is
substantial evidence in addition to his holding out that he

315 U. S.

was in "bona fide operation" as a "common carrier" of a
large group of commodities or of a whole class or classes of
property. There might be substantial evidence of such an
undertaking though the evidence as to any one article was
not substantial. The broad sweep of his prior service may
indeed have made the carriage of any one commodity
irregular and infrequent. Yet, viewed as a whole
rather than as a group of separate and unrelated items,
his prior activities may satisfy the test of "bona fide operation" as a "common carrier" within the scope of his holding out. The fact that some of the articles may have
been carried before but not after June 1, 1935, may of
course indicate an abandonment of the prior undertaking.
See United States v. Maher, 307 U. S. 148. But it does
not necessarily mean that they should be stricken from the
certificate, since the natural and normal course of his business may reveal a continuous undertaking to transport any
or all commodities embraced within the group or the
class. That is to say, he may have been a common carrier
of a large group of general commodities or of an entire
class of property both before and after the critical date
though the specific commodities carried varied considerably. The questions are whether his service within the
territory in question was sufficiently regular, and whether
his coverage of commodities was sufficiently representative, to support a finding that he was in "bona fide operation" as a "common carrier" of the group of commodities,
or of the class or classes of property, during the periods
in question.
The Commission in this case authorized the carriage
of about a dozen kinds of commodities, though in prior
operations about three times that number had been carried. It is not our function to weigh the evidence.
Hence we intimate no opinion as to whether more commodities should have been included had the proper criterion been employed. But we conclude that there is no

475

Opinion of the Court.

statutory warrant for applying to irregular route carriers
a different or stricter test as to commodities which may
be carried than is applied to regular route carriers. The
difference between those types of carriers may well justify
a sharp delimitation of the far flung territory which an
irregular route carrier may profess to serve. But, once
the territory has been defined, the statutory test of
whether an applicant was a "common carrier" by motor
vehicle in "bona fide operation" during the critical periods
is the same for the irregular and the regular route carrier.
We are not confident that the Commission has approached
the problem in that way. For it has repeatcdly stated,
beginning with Powell Brothers Truck Lines, 9 M. C. C.
785, 791-792, that:
"Authority to transport general commodities throughout a wide territory over irregular and unspecified routes
pursuant to the 'grandfather' clause of the act should be
granted to a carrier only when such carrier's right thereto
has been proved by substantial evidence. To do otherwise would create the very ills which regulation is designed
to alleviate, namely, congestion of highways, destructive
rate practices, and unbridled competition. Common carriers which are expected to maintain regular service for
the movement of freight in whatever quantities offered
to and from all points on specified routes cannot operate
economically and efficiently if other carriers are permitted
to invade such routes for the sole purpose of handling
the cream of the traffic available thereon in so-called
irregular-route service."
And see Merchants Parcel Delivery Co., 21 M. C. C. 93;
Langer Transport Corp., 23 M.. C. C. 302; Lett & Co. of
Indiana, 26 M. C. C. 159.
Insofar as that view establishes a different test for
commodities which may be carried by irregular route
operators than for commodities which may be carried by

486

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

315 U. S.

regular route operators, it is erroneous as a matter of
law. For facts sufficient to establish that a person is a
"common carrier" by motor vehicle in "bona fide operation" in the one case are sufficient in the other. The statutory differences lie only in the territorial scope and
pattern of the operation.
III. It follows from what has been said that a restriction
on commodities which may be carried between specified
points may not always be justified. If the applicant had
established that it was a "common carrier" for a group of
commodities or for an entire class or classes of property
and was in "bona fide operation" during the critical periods
in a specified territory, restrictions on commodities which
could be moved in any one direction or between designated
points would not be justified. The fact that a particular
commodity had never been transported between certain
points in that territory would not mean that authority to
haul it between them should be withheld. Likewise, if
the applicant could establish that it was a "common carrier" only of a limited number of commodities, there
would normally be no statutory sanction for limiting the
carriage of particular commodities in that group to specified points in the authorized area. Presumptively, one
who had established his status of "common carrier" would
be entitled to carry all of the commodities embraced in
his undertaking to all points to which any shipments of
any articles were authorized. On the other hand, an applicant's status may vary from one part of the territory
to another or be different in northbound shipments than
in southbound shipments. Thus in this case the Commission found that practically all of appellee's northbound
shipments consisted of cotton yarn, though a few shipments of other commodities such as tires and tubes, asbestos textile products, spools and empty boxes were also
made northbound. With the exception of tires and tubes,

U. S. v. CAROLINA CARRIERS CORP.
475

487

Opinion of the Court.

the Commission authorized the shipments of those products on northbound trips. Assuming that finding to be
justified under the tests which we have described, it does
not necessarily follow that the northbound destinations
of those particular commodities should be restricted to
the localities designated by the Commission. Once the
common carrier status of appellee had been established
as respects those commodities, shipments to any parts of
the authorized territory, or to any of the authorized points
therein, should have been permitted, in absence of evidence that the appellee as respects carriage between specified points had restricted its undertaking to particular
commodities. That problem is clearer in this 'case as
respects southbound shipments. The record is plain that
appellee held itself out as being willing and able to carry
a wide variety of commodities on its return trips to its
home base in North Carolina. And the record shows that.
it carried many different kinds of articles on those southbound journeys. But the Commission drastically limited
its rights in that regard. Thus it was permitted to carry
beer from Newark, N. J. to two points in North Carolina,
but not from Baltimore, Md. In absence of evidence that
it had thus limited its undertaking as respects beer, the
mere fact that it previously had not carried beer from
Baltimore would be immaterial. If it had established by
substantial evidence that it was a "common carrier" of
beer on southbound trips, it would be entitled to carry it
from any of the northern points to any of the southern
destinations. For there was no evidence in this case that
it had restricted its undertaking as respects beer to shipments from Newark, unless the fact that it had carried
beer only from that point is to be conclusive. But to say
that that was conclusive or controlling would be to disregard the natural and normal course of business shown
by this record. So far as southbound shipments are con-

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

315 U. S.

cerned, it is plain that a wide variety of articles was transported consistently with appellee's holding out that it
would carry any of the articles from any of the points.
Appellee's "bona fiae operation" may possibly be limited
only to those articles actually carried. But where it was
actively soliciting whatever it could get at any of the
points, it does violence to its common carrier status to
make the origin or destination of future shipments conform to the precise pattern of the old. Such a pulverization of the prior course of conduct changes its basic
characteristics. There is no statutory sanction for such
a procedure.
IV. To appellee such matters involve life or death.
Empty or partially loaded trucks on return trips may well
drive the enterprise to the wall. A restriction in this case
of the commodities which may be carried from any one
point on southbound trips is a patent denial to appellee
of that "substantial parity between future operations and
prior bona fide operations" which the Act contemplates.
Alton R. Co. v. United States, supra Its prior opportunity should not be restricted beyond the clear requirements of the statute. For this Act should be liberally construed to preserve the position which those like appellee
have struggled to obtain in our national transportation
system. To freeze them into the precise pattern of their
prior activities, as was done here, not only may alter materially the basic characteristics of their service, it also may
well be tantamount to a denial of their statutory rights.
The precise grounds for the Commission's determination
that only certain commodities could be carried and that
only a few could be transported between designated points
are not clear. It is impossible to say that the standards
which we have set forth were applied to the facts in this
record. Hence, as in Floridav. United States, 282 U. S.
194, 215, the defect is not merely one of the absence of a
"suitably complete statement" of the reasons for the deci-

U. S. v. CAROLINA CARRIERS CORP.
475

Opinion of the. Court.

sion; it is the "lack of the basic or essential findings required to support the Commission's order." And see
United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 293 U. S. 454,
464; United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., 294
U. S. 499, 510-511. Congress has made a grant of rights
to carriers- such as appellee. Congress has prescribed
statutory standards pursuant to which those rights are to
be determined. Neither the Court nor the Commission is
warranted in departing from those standards because of
any doubts which may exist as to the wisdom of following
the course which Congress has chosen. Congress has also
provided for judicial review as an additional assurance
that its policies be executed. That review certainly entails
an inquiry as to whether the Commission has employed
those statutory standards. If that inquiry is halted at
the threshold by reason of the fact that it is impossible
to say whether or not those standards have been applied,
then that review has indeed become a perfunctory process.
If, as seems likely here, an erroneous statutory construction lies hidden in vague findings, then statutory rights will
be whittled away. An insistence upon the findings which
Congress has made basic and essential to the Commission's
action is no intrusion into the administrative domain. It
is no more and no less than an insistence upon the observance of those standards which Congress has made "prerequisite to the operation of its statutory command." Opp
Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Administrator, 312 U. S. 126, 144.
Hence that requirement is not a mere formal one. Only
when the statutory standards have been applied can the
question be reached as to whether the findings are supported by evidence. That is why we cannot say that the
Commission would be justified in placing the same restrictions on the certificate in this case had a correct construction of the Act been taken.
We express no opinion on the scope of the certificate
which should be granted in this case. That entails not

dissenting:

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and I are unable to agree
with this disposition of the case.
It overturns the exercise of a discretion which Congress
has delegated to the Interstate Commerce Commission
upon grounds which seem to u's so unsubstantial as really
to be a reversal on suspicion. The function of determining
"grandfather" rights delegated in this case is not unlike
the function dealt with in Gray v. Powell, 314 U. S. 402,
in which we said that Congress could have legislated specifically as to individual exemptions but "found it more
efficient to delegate that function to those whose experience
in a particular field gave promise of a better informed.,
more equitable adjustment of the conflicting interests"
(p. 412). We held that this delegation will be respected
and that, .unless we can say that a set of circumstances
deemed by the Commission to bring a particular applicant
within the concept of the statute "is so unrelated to the
tasks entrusted by Congress to the Commission as in effect
to deny a sensible exercise of judgment, it is the Court's
duty to leave the Commission's judgment undisturbed"
(p. 413). While the Court pays lip service to this principle, the Commission's decision is upset because, as the
opinion states, 'We have doubts"; 'We are not confident"; and 'We are not satisfied." The opinion proceeds
as it might do with a burden upon the Commission, although we supposed the burden to be upon those who

that the decision is wrong-particularly one dealing with
an exemption from a general duty.
We do not agree that a remand to the Commission
to make specific findings of the kind required in Florida
v. United States, 282 U. S. 194, 215, is appropriate. In
the Florida case, the Commission undertook to revise
intrastate railroad rates under control of the state and
over which, as Chief Justice Hughes said, "the Commission has no general authority." 282 U. S. at 212. It
was required to support its jurisdiction to revise rates
not within its general control by specific findings as to
whether those rates in any way constituted a burden on
interstate commerce. The Court had earlier established
the rule that an order of the Commission should not be
given precedence over a state rate statute otherwise valid
"unless, and except so far as, it conforms to a high standard of certainty." Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 245 U. S. 493, 510. And in this connection the Court-pointed out that even an act of Congress
is not to be construed to supersede or suspend the exercise
of the reserved powers of the state, even where the Constitution permits, "except so far as its purpose to do so
is clearly manifested." It is one thing to require the
Interstate Commerce Commission to be explicit in finding jurisdictional facts before it invades conceded state
power. It is a wholly different thing to read with a hostile
eye the Commission's findings that a claim for exemption
from conceded federal regulatory authority has not been
sustained.
Furthermore, if after this case is returned to the Commission, the Commission should leave no room for doubt
that in making the challenged order it acted upon correct
notions of law, it may yet be upset because the Court
says its findings are not sustained by the evidence, it

had better be said now. We have here a small record
and simple facts, which are all before us, giving adequate
basis for concluding whether these facts as found by the
Commission warranted the order. On this record it is
plain what the Commission has done. The only question is-Can it do what it has done? To send the case
back to the Commission to be reconsidered or to say
that it has already been considered in the light of the
legal views which the Court expresses, and then, perhaps,
to say that in any event the order is not warranted on
the record before us, is really to invite the Commission
to express abstract views on law. What this amounts to
is that the Court refuses to tell the Commission what it
thinks about the evidence until the Commission tells what
it thinks about the law.. We cannot regard this as the
most helpful use of the power of judicial review.
Congress by the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 cast upon
the Commission the task of regulating the motor carrier
industry. By the enactment, Congress asserted that the
public interest in the motor carrier enterprise had become
paramount to private interests. The highly individualistic nature of the business and the easy terms upon which
equipment could be obtained had promoted a quick
growth accompanied by intense and uneconomic competition, both within itself and with other transportatifn
systems. It was not expected that a sprawling, chaotic,
and cutthroat industry that had developed entirely in
the private interest would be reduced to an orderly and
regularized system of transportation in the public interest without stepping on a good many individual toes. 1

In trying to limit the injury caused by transition from
a purely private enterprise to a regulated public service industry, the general plan was to preserve to private
owners the transportation values evidenced by actual
conditions of operation on June 1, 1935, and to exempt
them from meeting the requirements of "public convenience and necessity" as to such operation. Those who
obtained such "grandfather" rights are not, however,
limited to them. They may expand their territory or
extend their service by proving that public convenience
and necessity will be served thereby. Thus, the scramble
for "grandfather" rights represents the effort to pre-empt
territory and service privileges without submitting to the
test of the public interest. Public regulation would be
defeated at its very outset if the Commission permitted
the bulk of the industry to escape the public interest test
by inflated claims under the "grandfather" clause. The
nature of the general task of reducing the claims of "grandfather" rights to defined and reasonable limits consistent
with the plan of public regulation is disclosed by the
record in this case.
The motor carrier here asked as a matter of right that
the Commission certify its "grandfather" privileges to
include the carriage of general commodities in a territory
comprising substantially the Atlantic seaboard from
South Carolina to Massachusetts. That there was some
disparity between its hopes and its experience was indicated by the fact that on June 1, 1935, it was operating
eighf trucks, and by 1936, the number of usable vehicles
had fallen to four. After a change of ownership the number was increased, and at the time of hearing the applicant was operating seventeen carrying units.
This carrier did not operate at stated times or over
regular routes, but was an irregular route carrier. The
backbone of its business consisted of carriage of cotton

yarn from points of origin in the South to points of distribution in the North. Incidental to this carriage it was
ready to accept cargo of almost any kind to complete its
loads and particularly to provide earnings on return trips.
If satisfactory terms could be arrived at, it was willing
to carry almost anything almost any place. On the basis
of such general holdings-out, this carrier sought certificates
that would entitle it as a matter of right to carry nearly
everything within the territory described.
The Commission cut down the claims of the applicant
by the use of the standard which the Act prescribes:
namely, bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor
vehicle. The Commission reduced the territorial claim
to that which the carrier actually served with some regularity, and lopped off territory which had been served
only occasionally or by isolated trips. It limited the commodities, to be carried to those carried in substantial
volume during the period before and after June 1, 1935.
We find no basisupon which we can say as matter of law
that these general methods of reducing nebulous and
extravagant claims to a compass which the Commission
could properly certify as representing bona fide operation
are improper or other than those contemplated by the
statute.
The Court is "not confident" that the Commission applied to this irregular route carrier the same test as to
commodities that is applied to regular route carriers. We
cannot be so confidently unconfident. The Commission
seems to have made only the distinction between irregular
and the regular route carriers that results from the differences inherent in the two types of enterprise. The
Commission has tested both by the regularity and substantiality of their actual operations. It is a test with which
they may have unequal ability to comply, but to reach
different results on such different facts does not imply

either the use of different legal standards or discriminatory administration.
The administrators of the Motor Carrier Act must be
aware, as the framers of it were, that "the grandfather
clause as of June 1, 1935, has been fixed in fairness to bona
fide motor carriers now operating on the highway and
limited so as to prevent speculation which is highly important." Report of the Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce, H. R. Rep. No. 1645, 74th Cong., 1st
Sess., p. 4. When a carrier claims grandfather rights to
serve the entire Atlantic seaboard as a general common
carrier with equipment consisting on the critical date, of
eight trucks, the Commission is obviously forewarned
that it must guard against granting franchise privileges
that will result in their having a speculative value to the
carrier rather than a service value to the public. The
Commission was quite right to take the measure of the
territory and service of such a claimant and to give him
a certificate covering his actual substantial operations.
We should not substitute our own wisdom or unwisdom
for that of administrative officers who have kept within
the bounds of their administrative powers. A. T. & T.
