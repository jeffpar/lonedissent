Opinion of the Court.

STONITE PRODUCTS CO. v. MELVIN LLOYD CO.
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 321.

Argued February 10, 1942.-Decided March 9, 1942.

1. Venue in patent infringement suits is governed exclusively by Jud.
Code § 48, which provides that, in such suits, the District Courts
shall have jurisdiction in the district of which the defendant is an
inhabitant, or in any district in which the defendant shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established
place of business. P. 563.
In a suit for patent infringement brought in one of two districts
in the same State, an individual who has no regular and established
placde of business in that district and who is an inhabitant of the
other district can not properly be joined as a defendant.
2. The provision of Jud. Code § 52 permitting suits, not of a local nature, against two or more defendants residing in different judicial
districts within the same State to be brought in either district, is
inapplicable to patent infringement suits. P. 566.
119 F. 2d 883, reversed.
CERTIORARI,

314 U. S. 594, to review a decree which re-

versed the action of the District Court in dismissing, as to
one of two defendants, a bill alleging infringement of a
patent. 36 F. Supp. 29. The other defendant defaulted.
Messrs. A. D. Caesar and Charles W. Rivise for petitioner.
Mr. IsaacJ. Silin for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The- only question presented for our determination is
whether § 48 of the Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. § 109) is
the sole provision governing the venue of patent infringement litigation, or whether that section is supplemented

by § 52 of the Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. § 113). Section
48 gives jurisdiction of suits for patent infringement to
the United States district courts in the district of which
the defendant is an inhabitant, or in any district in which
the defendant shall have committed acts of infringement
and have a regular and established place of business.
Section 52 permits suits, not of a local nature, against
two or more defendants, residing in different judicial
districts within the same state, to be brought in either
district.'
Petitioner, Stonite Products Company, an inhabitant
of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania without a regular
1 Section

48 provides:

"In suits brought for the infringement of letters patent the district
courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, in law or in equity,
in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in any district in which the defendant, whether a person, partnership, or corporation, shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business. If such suit is brought in a
district of which the defendant is not an inhabitant, but in which such
defendant has a regular and established place of business, service of
process, summons, or subpoena upon the defendant may be made
by service upon the agent or agents engaged in conducting such
business in the district in which suit is brought."
Section 52 provides:
"When a State contains more than bne district, every suit not of a
local nature, in the district court thereof, against a single defendant,
inhabitant of such State, must be brought in the district where he
resides; but if there are two or more defendants, residing in different
districts of the State, it may be brought in either district, and a
duplicate writ may be issued against the defendants, directed to the
marshal of any other district in which any defendant resides. The
clerk issuing the duplicate writ shall indorse thereon that it is a true
copy of a writ sued out of the court of the proper district; and such
original and duplicate writs, when executed and returned into the
office from which they issue, shall constitute and be proceeded on as
one suit; and upon any judgment or decree rendered therein, execution
may be issued, directed to the marshal of any district in the same
State."

and established place of business in the Western District
of that State, was sued jointly with Lowe Supply Company, an inhabitant of the Western District, in the Western District for infringement of Patent No. 1,777,759 for
a boiler stand. Petitioner was served with process inthe
Eastern District, entered a special appearance in the action in the Western District, and moved to dismiss or quash
the return of service because venue was laid in the wrong
district. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the cause as to petitioner.2 36 F. Supp. 29 The
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 119 F. 2d 883. We
granted certiorari because of an asserted conflict with
Motoshaver,Inc. v. Schick Dry Shaver,Inc., 100 F. 2d 236
(C.C.A. 9).
We hold that § 48 is the exclusive provision controlling
venue in patent infringement proceedings.
Section 48 is derived from the Act of March 3, 1897, c.
395, 29 Stat. 695, and its scopd can best be determined
from an examination of the reasons for its enactment.
Section 11 of the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789,
c. 20, 1 Stat. 79, permitted civil suits to be brought in the
federal courts against a person only in the district of which
he was an inhabitant or in which he was found at the time
of serving the writ. That section applied to suits for
patent infringement. Chaffee v. Hayward, 20 How. 208,
216; Allen v. Blunt, 1 Blatchf. 408, Fed. Cas. No. 215.
The Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, retained
the provision allowing suit wherever the defendant could
be found. The abuses engendered by this extensive venue
prompted the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, 24 Stat. 552,
which, as amended by the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25
Stat. 433, permitted civil suits to be instituted only in the
district of which the defendant was an inhabitant, except

Lowe Supply Company defaulted and the suit proceeded to judgment against it.

that in diversity jurisdiction cases suit could be started in
the district of the plaintiff's or the defendant's residence.
The substance of those provisions was reenacted as § 51
of the Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. § 112).
After the holding of in re Hohorst, 150 U. S. 653, that
the Act of 1887 as amended did not apply to a suit against
an alien or a foreign corporation, "especially in a suit for
the infringement of a patent right," the lower federal
courts became uncertain as to the applicability of the Act
of 1887 to patent infringement proceedings.' In explanation of Hohorst's case, it was said in In re Keasbey
& Mattison Co., 160 U. S. 221, 230, that "It was a suit
for infringement of a patent right, exclusive jurisdiction
of which had been granted1 to the Circuit Courts of the
United States . . .;and was therefore not affected by
general provisions regulating the jurisdiction of the courts
of the United States, concurrent with that of the several
States." Thereafter the lower federal courts, for the most
part, took the position that the Act of 1887 as amended did
'Prior to the Hohorst case the lower federal courts seem to have
been unanimous in assuming that the Act of 1887 as amended governed patent infringement litigation. See Reinstadler v. Reeves, 33
F. 308; Miller-Magee Co. v. Carpenter, 34 F. 433; Halstead v.
Manning, Bowman & Co., 34 F. 565; Gormully & Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v.

exact
The Act of 1897 was adopted to define
diction of the federal courts in actions to enforce patent
rights, and thus eliminate the uncertainty produced by the
conflicting decisions on the applicability of the Act of 1887,
as amended, to such litigation.5 That purpose indicates
'National Button Works v. Wade, 72 F. 298; Noonan v. Chester
Park Athletic Club Co., 75 F. 334; Earl v. Southern Pacific Co., 75 F.
609; Westinghouse Air-Brake Co. v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 88 F.

'See H. Rept. No. 2905, 54th Cong., 2d Sess.
The remarks of Mr. Mitchell who reported the bill for the House
Committee on Patents are significant (29 Cong. Rec. 1900-1901):
"Mr. Speaker, the necessity for this law grows out of the acts of 1887
and 1888 which amended the judiciary act. Conflicting decisions
have even arisen in the different districts in the same States as to the
construction of these acts of 1887 and 1888, and there is great uncertainty throughout the country as to whether or not the act of 1887
as amended by the act of 1888 applied to patent cases at all.
"The bill is intended to remove this uncertainty and to define the
exact jurisdiction of the circuit courts in these matters.
"The committee have been extremely careful in the investigation
of the matter before reporting the bill.
"As the bill was referred to me, I wrote to a great many patent
lawyers in different parts of the country, in order to get their views
and objections, if any, and I find that theyr are all unanimously in favor
of the bill as it is now reported, and state that it would tend not only
to define the jurisdiction of the circuit courts not now defined, but
also limit that jurisdiction and so clearly define it that in the future
there will be no question with regard to the application of the acts of
1887 and 1888.
The trouble has arisen in this matter that under the act of
1888 some of the courts were uncertain whether or not the law did
or did not apply to patent cases, and therefore this special bill relating
to patents solely has been brought up because of the indefiniteness and
uncertainty arising from different constrictions of the act of 1888
as applied to patent cases."

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

315 U.S.

that Congress did not intend the Act of 1897 to dovetail
with the general provisions relating to the venue of civil
suits, but rather that it alone should control venue in
patent infringement proceedings.
Section 52 is derived from R. S. § 740, which in turn
stems from the Act of May 4, 1858, c. 27, 11 Stat. 272, a
general act intended to do away with the insertion of
special provisions preserving statewide venue in acts dividing a state into two or more judicial districts,6 and the
Act of.February 24, 1863, c. 54 § 9, 12 Stat. 662. Respondents insist that § 52 applies to patent infringement
suits because it antedates § 48, excludes from its purview
.only suits of a local nature, and is consistent with and
complementary to § 48, since it deals with the problem
of venue in the geographical sense rather than in terms of
.specified classes of litigation. We cannot agree.
Even assuming that R. S. § 740 covered patent litigation
prior to the Act of 1897, we do not think that its application survived that act, which was intended to define the,
exact limits of venue in patent infringement suits.'
Furthermore, the Act of 1897 was a restrictive measure,
limiting a prior, broader venue. Gerleral Electric Co. v.
'See the remarks of Senator Pugh who reported the bill for the
Senate Judiciary Committee. 36 Cong. Globe 936, 35th Cong., 1st

Sess.
'As a matter of fact there was some uncertainty as to whether
R. S. § 740 survived the general venue provisions of the Acts of 1875
and 1887. See Greeley v. Lowe, 155 U. S.58, 72; Petri v. Creelman
Lumber Co., 199 U. S. 487, 497; Camp v. Gress, 250 U. S. 308, 315.
It was held that it did in East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. v. Atlanta &
F. R. Co., 49 F. 608; Goddard v. Mailler, 80 F. 422; and Doscher v.
United States Pipe Line Co., 185 F. 959. But compare New Jersey
Steel & Iron Co. v. Chormann, 105 F. 532, and Seybert v. Shamokin &
Mt. C. Electric Ry. Co., 110F.810.

Opinion of the Court.

Marvel Co., 287 U. S. 430, 434-435; Bowers v. Atlantic,
G. & P. Co., 104 F. 887; CheathamElectric Switching Co.
v. Transit Co., 191 F. 727.8 Thus there is little reason to

assume that Congress intended to authorize suits in districts other than those mentioned in that Act.
The reenactment of the Act of 1897 as § 48, and of R. S.
§ 740 as § 52 of the Judicial Code, by the Act of March 3,
1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1100-1101, is not indicative of any
Congressional understanding that the two sections are
complementary. Quite the contrary, for § 52 appears
in the Judicial Code as an exception to § 51, the general

venue provision derived from the Act of 1887, as amended.
See Camp v. Gress, 250 U. S. 308, 315. Section 51 is, of
course, not applicable to patent infringement proceedings.
General Electric Co. v. Marvel Co., supra' Since § -48
is wholly independent of § 51, there is an element of incongruity in attempting to supplement § 48 by resort to § 52,
an exception to the provisions of § 51. Cf. Connecticut
Fire Ins. Co. v. Lake Transfer Corp., 74 F. 2d 258.

Zell v. Erie Bronze Co., 273 F. 8.33, is to the contrary, but apparently overlooks the trend of the lower federal courts after In re Keasbey
& Mattison, 160 U. S. 221, was decided. See note 4, ante.
'This is apparent from the legis. ative history of the Act of 1897
from which § 48 is derived. See note 5, ante.
Section 51 is likewise inapplicable to suits for copyright infringement. Lumiere v. Wilder, Inc., 261 U. S. 174.
