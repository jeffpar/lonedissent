CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH

No. 149.

CIRCUIT.

Argued January 13, 14, 1942.-Decided February 2, 1942.

1. The Right of Way Act of March 3, 1875, granting to railroads the
right of way through public lands of the United States, grants an
easement only, not a fee, and confers no right to oil and minerals
underlying the right of way. Pp. 271, 279.
2. This construction of the Act is supported by its language, its legislative history, its early administrative interpretation, and the construction placed upon it by Congress in subsequent enactments.
P. 277.
3. The general rule of construction that any ambiguity in a grant
is to be resolved in favor of the sovereign grantor-nothing passes
but what is conveyed in clear and explicit language--is applicable
in the construction of the Act. P. 272.
4. The history of the times in which a statute was enacted may properly be considered in determining its meaning. P. 273.
5. Rio GrandeRy. v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44, discussed and regarded
as not controlling. P. 279.
6. Upon the record in this case, and in view of the state of the pleadings, the United States is entitled to judgment only as to the limited areas in respect of which it is shown by stipulation to have
had title. P. 280.
119 F. 2d 821, modified and affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 314 U. S. 596, to review the affirmance of
a decree, 32 F. Supp. 651, enjoining the railroad from
drilling or removing oil, gas or minerals underlying its
right of way.

Mr. F. G. Dorety for petitioner.

During and prior to the period of the grants, the term
"railroad right of way" had only one accepted meaning
in legislative enactments.

It was never used as desig-

nating an easement, but rather to describe the narrow

GREAT NORTHERN RY. CO. v. U. S.
262

Argument for Petitioner.

strip of land owned by a railroad in fee, and upon which
the tracks were constructed.
Judicial decisions support the same usage. In Chicago
& M. R. Co. v. Patchin, 16 Ill. 198 (1854), the court
indicated that the estate of the railroad was an absolute
ownership in fee, and similar statements were made in
Prather v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 89 Ind. 501
(1883); Yates v. Van De Bogert, 56 N. Y. 526 (1874);
Buffalo Pipe Line Co. v. N. Y., L. E. & W. R. Co., 10
Abb. N. C. 107 (1882); Ballard v. L. & N. R. Co., 9 Ky.
523 (1887). The only cases prior to 1875 which do not
support the fee simple view are Quinby v. Vermont Central R. Co., 23 Vt. 387, and Blake v. Rich, 34 N. H. 282,
and there the courts implied that they stood alone and
that other cases supported the fee simple estate.
The grants themselves indicate that Congress used the
term "right of way" in the sense of strip of land. See
Leavenworth City R. Grant, 14 Stat. 212; Green Bay &
Lake Pepin Grant, 16 Stat. 588; Portland, Dalles & Salt
Lake Grant, 17 Stat. 52; Central Pacific Grant, 18 Stat.
306; Hot Springs R: Grant, 19 Stat. 108; Western R. of
Minnesota Grant, 21 Stat. 69.
The facts that the earlier grants were to the grantee
and its "successors and assigns"; that the grant of right
of way was "through" the public lands and not "over"
them; that there were provisions to extinguish the Indian
title where the grants passed through Indian lands; that
the grants recite that they are made for the "public advantage and welfare," and provide for free transportation
of troops and munitions, and give the Government the
right of "preferred" transportation, all afford additional
indications that Congress had no intention of reducing
the granted estate to the minimum.
Use of the term "right of way" to designate the strip
of land itself is still general in statutes and railroad conveyances, is common in private deeds, and is supported
by dictionaries.

264

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Argument for Petitioner.

315 U. S.

Statutes requiring fencing of the right of way strip,
removing weeds therefrom, or providing for crossings for
highways, canals, irrigation ditches, etc., seldom, if ever,
use the term "strip of land occupied by tracks," but invariably use the term "right of way," although referring
to the land itself and not an easement. See, for example,
Revised Codes of Montana, 1935, §§ 6551, 6552, 7110.
Congress, as well as state legislatures, has used in the
same statute "strip of land" and "right of way" referring to the same land. E. g., 18 Stat. 306; Statutes of
Indiana, 1863, p. 33, § 5.
A deed to a railroad of a strip of land designated as
a right of way has often been regarded by the courts
as a grant of the land in fee. Ballard v. L. & . R. Co.,
9 Ky. 523 (1887); Stevens v. Galveston R. Co., 212 S. W.
639; Radetsky v. Jorgensen, 70 Colo. 423; Arkansas
Improvement Co. v. Kansas City Southern Ry., 189 La.
921;, Johnson v. Valdosta R. Co., 169 Ga. 559; Midstate
Oil Co. v. Ocean Shore R. Co., 93 Cal. App. 704; Marland v. Gillespie, 168 Okla. 376.

To regard the grant as an easement would benefit
no one; if the railroad can not remove minerals, no one
else can. Ric Grande Western Ry. v. Stringham, 239
U. S. 44.
The rule that gratuitous public grants are to be strictly
construed against the grantee and in favor of the sovereign,
does not apply to grants of the right of way. GreatNorthern Ry. v. Steinke, 261 U. S. 119, 124; Nadeau v. Union
PacificR. Co., 253 U. S. 442, 444.
The purpose of the grant was to get railroads built,
by providing sites or locations for their construction
across public lands. This purpose could be accomplished at least as well by grant of a strip in fee as by
an easement.
If Congress had been seeking that form of grant which
would give the absolute minimum estate to the railroads

Argument for Petitioner.

and still make it possible for the roads to be built, it
might have selected an easement. But from 1850 to 1870,
while it was making right of way grants, it was also making
lavish gifts of adjoining sections, including coal and iron
lands. No disposition was shown to whittle down any
part of the grant. The generous width of 200 feet, and 400
feet in the Northern Pacific grant, when 50 feet would
have been sufficient at most points, proves this.
It was never the practice or policy of Congress to
grant surface rights and reserve underlying minerals.
The only purpose of reserving mineral lands was to make
them available to mineral claimants, but there could be
no such object in reserving minerals under the right of
way, because mineral claimants could not enter the right
of way to conduct mining operations.
Debates in the House of Representatives did not refer
to the character of estate granted.
Twelve decisions of this Court and every decision of a
state or lower federal court construing the right of way
grants, except this decision below, over a period of more
than 50 years, have held that the estate granted was a
fee title, conditioned only upon continued railroad operation. Joy v. St. Louis, 138 U. S. 1; New Mexico v.

Subsequent rulings of the Land Department and acts
of Congress supporting the easement theory are selfserving declarations, and are in conflict with Supreme
Court decisions, with the intent of the grants, and with
admissions by the Government in this case.
The owner of a conditional fee estate is entitled to
the underlying oil and minerals.
A grant, even though not in fee and limited to railroad
purposes, would include the right to use materials or
fuel within the bounds of the grant; and the injunction
should be denied as to removal of oil for railroad fuel.
Mr. Vernon L. Wilkinson, with whom Solicitor General

Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Littell, and Mr. Richard S. Salant were on the brief, for the United States.
The language of the 1875 Act shows that only an easement was granted. Section 1 refers to "the" right of way;
§2 refers to "use and occupancy"; and § 4 requires the

GREAT NORTHERN RY. CO. v. U. S.
262

Argument for the United States.

location of each right of way to be noted on the plats in
the local land office, and provides that "thereafter all
such lands over which such right of way shall pass shall
be disposed of subject to such right of way." As the
court below remarked, "Apter words to indicate the intent to convey an easement would be difficult to find."
Since "nothing passes but what is conveyed in clear and
explicit language-inferences being resolved not against
but for the Government," it seems patent that the 1875
Act did not convey to the railroads the underlying minerals for fuel or other purposes. Caldwel v. United
States, 250 U. S. 14, 20-21.
The policy of granting land subsidies to the railroads
was discontinued in 1871. Thereafter, the grants were
restricted to a mere. right of passage across the public
domain,-a right which could be acquired in no other way
while large blocks of land were held by a sovereign
immune from suit. This shift in policy was formally
crystallized by Congressional resolution in 1872. House
Resolution of March 11, 1872, Cong. Globe, 42d Cong.,
2d sess., 1585. And the debates preceding the enactment of the 1875 Act show clearly that the grant in the
Act was consonant with the new policy of strict limitation and of granting easements rather than fees. Cf.,
3 Cong. Rec. pt. 1, p. 407 (1875).
The subsequent administrative and legislative construction of the 1875 Act reinforce the conclusion that
only an easement was granted.
Until this Court uttered a contrary dictum in Rio
Grande Ry. v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44 (1915), the administrative officers of the Government consistently, construed the 1875 Act as granting an easement rather than
a fee. The contemporaneous decisions of the Land Department likewise refer to the 1875 grant as a "mere
easement" (19 L. D. 588, 590), as "an incorporeal here-

ditament, an easement and not the land" (20 L. D. 131,
132), as "in the nature of a mere easement" (32 L. D.
33, 34). Such contemporaneous construction of a
statute should not be overturned except for cogent reasons, and unless clearly erroneous. United States v.
Johnston, 124 U. S.236, 253; United States v. Moore, 95
U. S. 760, 763; Brewster v. Gage, 290 U. S. 327, 336.
Departmental circulars and regulations are especially
persuasive. Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, 282
U. S.375, 378; Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States,
288 U. S.294, 315; Swendig v. Washington Co., 265 U. S.
322, 331; McFadden v. Mountain View Co., 97 F. 670,
677; Taggartv. Great Northern Ry. Co., 208 F. 455, 460,
aff'd 211 F. 288.
Congress, too, has construed the 1875 Act as granting
an easement rather than a fee. For example, the Acts of
June 26, 1906, c. 3550, 34 Stat. 482, and February 25,
1909, c. 191, 35 Stat. 647, declaring a forfeiture of unused
rights of way, state that the lands covered thereby shall
be "freed and discharged from such easement." Such
clear-cut legislative pronouncements on the meaning of
the 1875 Act are aids to the construction of that Act.
Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 309;
United States v. Freeman,3 How. 556, 564-565; McFadden v. Mountain View Co., supra, 677; Northern Pacific
Ry. v. Soderberg, i88 U. S.526, 533, 534.
Cases construing grants made prior to 1871 as vesting
a fee in the railroads are therefore without force. These
important differences between the 1875 Act and the
earlier land grant acts were not called to this Court's
attention in Rio Grande Ry. v. Stringham, 239 U. S.44,
a case in which the Government and private owners were
not represented. Hence, the statement there made, by
way of dictum, that the railroads have a "limited fee" in
rights of way acquired under the 1875 Act should be
reexamined.

GREAT NORTHERN RY. CO. v. U. S.
262

269

Argument for the United States.

Administrative construction after 1915 can not be
deemed binding upon the Department of the Interior,
since it was impelled by the apparent compulsion of the
Stringham case. Hartley v. Commissioner, 295 U. S.
216, 220; Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 121. And
in any event, earlier decisions, being more nearly contemporaneous with the 1875 statute and evidencing a
long-continued and uniform construction until 1915, are
a more reliable index of the legislative intent and are
accordingly more persuasive. Fawcus Machine Co. v.
United States, 282 U. S. 375, 378; Norwegian Nitrogen
Co. v. United States, 288 U. S. 294, 315.
A repudiation of the dictum in the Stringham case by
a decision holding that the 1875 Act grants the railroads
an easement rather than a fee will not disturb land titles;
it will merely restore a rule of property which existed
between 1875 and 1915, the period during which most of
these rights of way were acquired.
But even if it be determined that the railroad has a
"limited fee" in its right of way, it does not necessarily
follow that such a "fee" includes the right to extract
oil and other minerals. The purposes of Congress are
accomplished if the grant is held to be a "fee" in the
surface and so much of the subsurface as is necessary
for support-a "fee" for a railroad thoroughfare exclusively. Cf. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Pennsylvania
R. Co., 195 U. S. 540, 570. Since such an interest would
accomplish the purposes of Congress, this is the largest
interest which the applicable rules of construction will
permit to pass under the Act. Caldwell v. United States,
250 U. S. 14, 20-21. Under such a construction the railroad is restricted in the use of the land except as a railroad thoroughfare. The right to use and extract minerals is a use of the land not permitted to the railroad.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
We are asked to decide whether petitioner has any right
to the oil and minerals underlying its right of way acquired
under the general right of way statute, Act of March 3,
1875, c. 152, 18 Stat. 482.
The United States instituted this suit to enjoin petitioner from drilling for or removing gas, oil and other
minerals so situated, and alleged in its complaint substantially that petitioner, in 1907, acquired from the St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway all of the latter's
property, including rights of way granted it under the Act
of March 3, 1875, a portion of which crosses Glacier
County, Montana; that petitioner acquired neither the
right to use any portion of such right of way for the purpose of drilling for or removing subsurface oil and minerals, nor any right, title or interest in or to the deposits
underlying the right of way, but that the oil and minerals
remained the property of the United States; and, that although no lease had been issued to petitioner under the
Act of May 21, 1930, 46 Stat. 373, petitioner claimed ownership of the oil and minerals underlying its right of way
and threatened to use the right of way to drill for and remove subsurface oil.
Petitioner admitted certain allegations of fact, denied
the allegation that title to the oil and minerals was in the
United States, and asserted that it proposed to drill three
separate oil wells-the oil from the first to be sold commercially, that from the second to be refined, the more
volatile parts to be sold and the residue to be used on
petitioner's locomotives, and that from the third to be
used in its entirety by petitioner as fuel.
Pursuant to a motion therefor by the United States,
judgment was rendered on the pleadings and petitioner
was enjoined from "using the right of way granted under

the Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 482, for the purpose of

drilling for or removing oil, gas and minerals underlying
the right of way." The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.
119 F. 2d 821. The importance of the question and an asserted conflict with Rio Grande Western Ry. Co. v.
Stringham,239 U. S. 44, moved us to grant certiorari. 314
U. S. 596.
The Act of March 3, 1875, from which petitioner's rights
stem, clearly grants only an easement, and not a fee. Section 1 indicates that the right is one of passage since it
grants "the," not a, "right of way through the public lands
of the United States." Section 2 adds to the conclusion
that the right granted is one of use and occupancy only,
rather than the land itself, for it declares that any railroad
whose right of way passes through a canyon, pass or defile
"shall not prevent any other railroad company from the
use and occupancy of the said canyon, pass, or defile, for
the purposes of its road, in common with the road first
located." 1

Section 4 is especially persuasive. It requires the location of each right of way to be noted on the plats in the
local land office, and "thereafter all such lands over which
such right of way shall pass shall be disposed of subject to
such right of way." 2 This reserved right to dispose of the
lands subject to the right of way is wholly inconsistent with
the grant of a fee. As the court below pointed out, "Apter
words to indicate the intent to convey an easement would
be difficult to find." That this was the precise intent of
§ 4 is clear from its legislative history.8 While § 4 pro1

vides a method for securing the benefits of the Act in advance of construction,' no adequate reason is advanced for
believing that it does not illumine the nature of the right
granted. The Act is to be interpreted as a harmonious
whole.
The Act is to be liberally construed to carry out its
purposes. United States.v. Denver & R. G. Ry. Co., 150
U. S. 1, 14; Nadeau v. Union PacificR. Co.,.253 U. S. 442;
Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Steinke, 261 U. S. 119. But
the Act is also subject to the general rule of construction
-that any ambiguity in a grant is to be resolved favorably
to a sovereign grantor--"nothing passes but what is conveyed in clear and explicit language"--Caldwellv. United
States, 250 U. S. 14, 20-21, and cases cited. Cf. Great
Northern Ry. Co. v. Steinke, supra. Plainly, there is
nothing in the Act which may be characterized as a "clear
and explicit" conveyance of the underlying oil and minerals. The Act was designed to permit the construction
of railroads through the public lands and thus enhance
their value and hasten their settlement. The achievement of that purpose does not compel a construction of
the right of way grant as conveying a fee title to the land
and the underlying minerals; a railroad may be operated
though its right of way be but an easement
of way. It simply provides that this right of way shall be an incumbrance upon the land for one hundred feet upon each side of the line
of the road; that those who may afterward make locations for settlement shall not interfere with this right of way.

other corporations ought to be discontinued, and that
every consideration of public policy and equal justice to
the whole people requires that the public lands should be
held for the purpose of securing homesteads to actual
settlers, and for educational purposes, as may be provided
by law." Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 1585 (1872).
After 1871 outright grants of public lands to private railroad companies seem to have been discontinued.8 But, to
encourage development of the Western vastnesses, Congress had to grant rights to lay track across the public domain, rights which could not be secured against the sovereign by eminent domain proceedings or adverse user.
.or a time special acts were passed granting to designated
railroads simply "the right of way" through the'public
lands of the United States.' That those acts were not
intended to convey any land is inferable.from 'remarks in
Congress by those sponsoring the measures. For example,
in reporting a bill granting a right of way to the Dakota
Grand Trunk Railway (17 Stat. 202), the committee chairman said: "This is merely a grant of the right of way."."
Likewise, in reporting a right of way bill. for the New
Mexico and Gulf Railway Company (17 Stat. 343), Mr.
Townsend of Pennsylvania, the same Congressman who
sponsored the Act of 1875, observed: "It is nothing but a

Opinion of the Court.

The burden of this special legislation moved Congress
to adopt the general right of way statute now before this
Court. Since it was a product of the sharp change in
Congressional policy with respect to railroad grants after
1871, it is improbable that Congress intended by it to grant
more than a right of passage, let alone mineral riches.
The presence in the Act of § 4, which, as has been pointed
out above, is so inconsistent with the grant of a fee,
strongly indicates that Congress was carrying into effect its
changed policy regarding railroad grants. 2
Also pertinent to the construction of the Act is the contemporaneous administrative interpretation placed on it
by those charged with its execution. Cf. United States v.
Johnston, 124 U. S. 236, 253; United States v. Moore, 95
U. S.760, 763; Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States,
288 U. S. 294, 315. The first such interpretation, the general right of way circular of January 13, 1888, was that the
Act granted an easement, not a fee.' The same position
was taken in the regulations of March 21, 1892, 14 L. D.
338, and those of November 4,1898, 27 L. D. 663. While
the first of these circulars followed the Act by 13 years, the
weight to be accorded them is not dependent on strict contemporaneity. Cf. Swendig v. Washington Co., 265 U.,S.
322. This early administrative gloss received indirect
Congressional approval when Congress repeated the language of the Act in granting canal and reservoir companies
rights of way by the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat.
See note 3, ante.
"The act of March 3, 1875, is not in the nature of a grant of lands;
it does not convey an estate in fee, either in the 'right of way' or the
grounds selected for depot purposes. It is a right of use only, the
title still remaining in the United States....
"All persons settling on public lands to which a railroad right of way
has attached, take the same subject to such right of way and must pay
for the full area of the subdivision entered, there being no authority
to make deductions in such cases." 12 L. D. 423, 428.

1101, and when Congress made the Act of 1875 partially
applicable to the Colville Indian Reservation by Act of
March 6,1896, c. 42, 29 Stat. 44. Cf. National Lead Co. v.
United States, 252 U. S. 140, 146.
The circular of February 11, 1904, 32 L. D. 481, described the right as a "base or qualified fee." This shift
in interpretation was probably due to the description in
NorthernPacific Ry. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271,
of a right of way conveyed in a land-grant act (13 Stat.
365) as a "limited fee, made on an implied condition of reverter." 14 But the earlier view was reasserted in the departmental regulations of May 21, 1909, 37 L. D. 787.15
After 1915, administrative construction bowed to the case
of Rio Grande Western Ry. Co. v. Stringham, 239 U. S.
44, which applied the language of the Townsend case to a
right of way acquired under the Act of 1875. We do not
regard this subsequent interpretation as binding on the
Department of the Interior since it was impelled by what
we regard as inaccurate statements in the Stringham case.
Cf. Helvering v. Hallock; 309 U. S. 106, 121.
Congress itself in later legislation has interpreted the
Act of 1875 as conveying but an easement. The Act
of June 26, 1906, c. 3550, 34 Stat. 482, declaring a forfeiture
of unused rights of way, provides in part that: "the.
United States hereby resumes the full title to the lands
covered thereby [by the right of way] freed and discharged
from such easement." This language is repeated in the
forfeiture act of February 25, 1909, c. 191, 35 Stat. 647..
Also on June 26, 1906, an act1 ' was passed confirming the
rights of way which certain railroads had acquired under
"Bee note 6, ante.

the 1875 Act in the Territories of Oklahoma and Arizona.
The House committee report on this bill said: "The right.
as originally conferred and as proposed to be protected
by this bill simply grants an easement or use for railroad purposes. Under the present law wherever the railroad passes through a tract of public land the entire tract
is patented to the settler or entryman, subject only to this
easement." 17 It is settled that "subsequent legislation
may be considered to assist in the interpretation of prior
legislation upon the same subject." Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 309. See also Cope v. Cope,
137 U. S. 682; United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556.
These statutes were approximately contemporaneous with
petitioner's acquisition of the rights of way of the St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway.
That petitioner has only an easement in its rights of
way acquired under the Act of 1875 is therefore clear
from the language of the Act, its legislative history, its
early administrative interpretation and the construction
placed upon it by Congress in subsequent enactments.
Petitioner, seeking to obviate this result, relies on several cases in this Court stating that railroads have a "limited," "base," or "qualified" fee in their rights of way."8

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

315 U. S.

U. S. 481, deal with rights of way conveyed by land-grant
acts before the shift in Congressional policy occurred in
1871. For that reason they are not controlling here."9
When Congress made outright grants to a railroad of
alternate sections of public lands along the right of way,
there is little reason to suppose that it intended to give
only an easement in the right of way granted in the same
act. And, in none of those acts was there any provision
comparable to that of § 4 of the 1875 Act that "lands
over which such right of way shall pass shall be disposed
of subject to such right of way." None of the cases
involved the problem of rights to subsurface oil and
minerals.
In the Stringham case, it was said that a right of way
under the Act of 1875 is "neither a mere easement, nor a
fee simple absolute, but a limited fee, made on an implied
condition of reverter in the event that the company ceases
to use or retain the land for the purposes for which it is
granted, and carries with it the incidents and remedies
usually attending the fee." The railroad had brought
suit to quiet title to a portion of its right of way. Stringham asserted title to that portion by virtue of a purported
purchase of surface rights from a placer mine claimant.
The Supreme Court of Utah reversed the judgment of
the trial court and remanded the case, directing the entry
of "a judgment awarding to the plaintiff title to a right
of way over the lands in question." 38 Utah 113, 110
P. 868. The railroad again appealed, asserting that it
should have been adjudged "owner in fee simple of the
right of way over the premises." The Supreme Court of
Utah affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the
ground that the railroad's proper remedy was by petition
for rehearing of the first appeal. 39 Utah 236, 115 P. 967.
Both judgments were brought to this Court by writ of

Opinion of the Court.

error. It was held that the second judgment presented
nothing reviewable. The first judgment was affirmed
since it "describes the right of way in the exact terms of
the right-of-way act, and evidently uses those terms with
the same meaning they have in the act."
The conclusion that the railroad was the owner of a
"limited fee" was based on cases arising under the landgrant acts passed prior to 1871, and it does not appear that
Congress' change of policy after 1871 was brought to the
Court's attention." That conclusion is inconsistent with
the language of the Act, its legislative history, its early
administrative interpretation and the construction placed
on it by Congress in subsequent legislation. We therefore
do not regard it as controlling. Statements in. Choctaw,
0. & G. R. Co. v. Mackey, 256 U. S. 531, and Noble v.
Oklahoma City, 297 U. S. 481, that the 1875 Act conveyed
a limited fee are dicta based on the Stringham case, and
entitled to no more weight than the statements in that
case. Far more persuasive are two cases involving special acts granting rights of way, passed after 1871 and
rather similar to the general act of 1875.' Railway Co. v.
Alling, 99 U. S. 463, characterized the right so granted
as "a present beneficial easement," and Smith v. Town,
send, 148 U. S. 490, referred to it as "simply as an easement, not a fee." We think that the Act of 1875 is to be
similarly construed.
Since petitioner's right of way is but an easement, it has
no right to the underlying oil and minerals. This result
does not freeze the oil and minerals in place. Petitioner
is free to develop them under a lease executed pursuant to
the Act of May 21, 1930, 46 Stat. 373.
During the argument before this Court, it was fully
developed that the judgment was rendered on the pleadNo brief was filed by the defendant or the United States.

ings, in which petitioner denied the allegation of title
in the United States, and there was no proof or stipulation
that the United States had any title. On this state of the
record, the United States was not entitled to any judgment
below. However, we permitted the parties to cure this
defect by a stipulation showing that the United States has
retained title to certain tracts of land over which petitioner's right of way passes, in a limited area,22 and that
petitioner intended to drill for and remove the oil underlying its right of way over each of those tracts. Accordingly, the judgment will be modified and limited to the
areas*described in the stipulation. As so modified, it is
