OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

315 U. S.

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v. AUTOMOTIVE MAINTENANCE MACHINERY CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 188. Argued February 3, 1942.-Decided February 16, 1942.
Findings of the Labor Board sustained as supported by substantial
evidence. P. 282.
116 F. 2d 350, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 314 U. S. 596, to review a judgment setting aside an order of the National Labor Relations
Board, 13 N. L. R. B. 338, ordering the company to cease
and desist from unfair labor practices; to cease giving
effect to a contract with an "inside" union; to withdraw
recognition from, and to disestablish, that union; to reinstate with back-pay three discharged employees; and to
post notices, etc. A provision of the order for reimbursement of certain Government relief agencies was
abandoned by the Board.

Mr. Ernest A. Gross, with whom Solicitor General
Fahy and Messrs. Archibald Cox, Robert B. Watts, and
Morris P. Glushien were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. John Harrinatonfor respondent.
PER CURIAM.

Upon examination of the record, the Court concludes

evidence. Labor Board v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U. S. 584;
Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Labor Board, 312
U. S. 660. The judgment is therefore reversed with directions to enforce the Board's order in full, but with the
modification proposed by the Board to conform to the decision in Republic Steel Corp. v. Labor Board, 311 U. S.

or decision of this case.
