CO., ADMINISTRATOR,

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF DELAWARE.

No. 81. Argued December 16, 1941.-Decided February 16, 1942.
1. Consistently with the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal
Constitution, when a state court in probating a will and issuing letters
testamentary, in a proceeding to which all distributees were parties,
expressly finds that the domicile of the testator at the time of his
death was in that State, the adjudication of domicile does not bind
one who is subsequently appointed as domiciliary administrator
c. t. a. in a second State in which he will be called upon to deal with
the claims of local creditors, including the claim of the State itself for
taxes, and who was not a party to the proceeding in the first State;
and in this situation, the courts of a third State, when disposing
of local assets claimed by both the personal representatives, are
free to determine the question of domicile in accordance with
their own law. Pp. 348 et seq.
2. In the absence of a contrary ruling by the courts of Delaware, held
that, by the law of that State, cases cited and relied on in an opinion
of the highest court of another State-which opinion is properly in
the record-may be considered as evidence of the law of such other
State. P. 351.
16 A. 2d 772, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 313 U. S. 555, to review a decree determining the disposition of property belonging to an estate,
which was claimed by each of two personal representatives
appointed in other States.

Mr. Dan Macbougald, with whom Messrs. James A.
Branch, Robert S. Sams, and Aaron Finger were on the
brief, for petitioners.

In re Willett's Appeal, 50 Conn. 330.
The Georgia courts had before them all possible distributees of the decedent's estate, and hence it was
possible to have a single controlling decision upon the
succession. See Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., supra.
The Georgia judgment was binding upon the New York
administrator. When decedent's husband, himself a party
to the Georgia litigation, and during the progress of the
Georgia litigation, had the administrator appointed in New
York in ex parteproceedings, he could not thereby in effect
nullify, in other States, the decision of the Georgia courts
upon the factual question of domicile that was in issue
and upon which the jurisdiction of the Georgia courts
depended. The administrator acquired no interest in the
succession above and unrelated to the interest of any
possible distributee. A creditor or tax claimant is not
entitled to be heard on the probate of a will; and hence,
after the succession has been determined, can not dispute
the title or right of possession of the personal representative whose title has been established in the probate proceeding. Hooks v. Brown, 125 Ga. 122; Dunsmuirv. Scott,
217 F. 200; Tilt v. Kelsey, 207 U. S. 43; Schouler on
Wills, Vol. 2, p. 846, § 746.
Since the Georgia judgment is binding upon all possible
distributees, including Hungerford, because he was a
party to and participated in the Georgia litigation, it is
also binding upon the New York administrator, the
same person in law as Hungerford. See Chicago, Rock
Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Schendel, 270 U. S. 611.
The Georgia judgment determined that the Georgia administration was domiciliary and general and not ancillary
or local. Such a judgment is conclusive where all persons
interested in the distribution of the estate are parties.

The effect of the Delaware decision is that a dissatisfied
litigant in such a proceeding may go into another State,
have an administrator appointed in ex parte proceedings,
and, ignoring the previous adjudication, have the question
of domicile litigated all over again in a contest between the
two sets of representatives in a third State where property
of the decedent is located.

Mr. MortimerM. Kassell for the State Tax Commission
of New York, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.
MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
Coca-Cola International Corporation, incorporated in
Delaware, filed a bill of interpleader in a Delaware Court
of Chancery against Julian Riley and Hughes Spalding,
petitioners here, the Executors of Mrs. Julia M. Hungerford, with letters testamentary issued by the Court of
Ordinary of Fulton County, Georgia, and against The New
York Trust Company, the respondent, a New York corporation, as temporary administrator (afterward administrator c. t. a.) of the same decedent, appointed by the
Surrogate's Court for New York County, New York.
The Georgia executors and the New York administrator each claim the right to have transferred to them, in
their representative capacity, stock in the Coca-Cola Corporation now on its books in the name of the decedent.
The outstanding certificates are in Georgia, in the hands
of the Geoigia executors. The parties are agreed, and it

is therefore assumed, that Delaware is the situs of the
stock. In accordance with the prayer of the bill, the Delaware court directed the adversary claimants to interplead
between themselves as to their respective claims.
The Georgia executors assert that original domiciliary
probate of Mrs. Hungerford's will in solemn form was obtained by them in Georgia, with all beneficiaries and heirs
at law of testatrix, including her husband, Robert Hungerford, actual parties by personal service. These, it is conceded, were all the parties under the law of Georgia entitled
to be heard on the probate of the will. The respondent
administrator c. t. a. was not a party. The record of probate includes a determination by special finding, over the
objection of the caveator, the husband, that the testatrix
was domiciled in Georgia. The special finding was specifically approved as an essential fact to determine the jurisdiction of the Court of Ordinary by the highest court of
Georgia in its affirmance of the probate. Hungerford v.
Spalding, 183 Ga. 547, 189 S. E. 2.
These facts were alleged by petitioners in their statement of claim to the stock filed below in response to the
decree of interpleader. Exemplified copies of the probate record of the several Georgia courts were pleaded and
proven, as were the applicable Georgia statutes governing
domiciliary probate. From the facts alleged, petitioners
inferred the conclusive establishment of the place for
domiciliary distribution against "all persons," and prayed
the issue to them of new certificates. An offer was made
to pay all Delaware taxes or charges on the stock. At
the trial, petitioners relied upon Article IV, § 1, of the
Federal Constitution,' the full faith and credit clause, as
determinative of their right to the new certificates. The
"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public
Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the
Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such
Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof."

pleading and trial contention adequately raised the Constitutional question. Tilt v. Kelsey, 207 U. S. 43, 50.
Respondent admitted that all parties entitled under the
law of Georgia to be heard in opposition to probate were
actually before the Georgia courts. It denied that Mrs.
Hungerford was domiciled in Georgia or that the Georgia
judgment of domicile and probate was binding on it, and
averred testatrix's domicile at death was New York. It
further averred that there were New York creditors of
the estate interested in the proper and lawful administration of the estate, and that New York had certain claims
for inheritance and estate taxes. Its own subsequent appointment by the Surrogate's Court of New York County,
New York, on the suggestion of testatrix's husband and
the State Tax Commission, was pleaded with applicable
provisions of New York probate and estate tax law. By
stipulation it was established that petitioners and the heirs
and beneficiaries of testatrix, except her husband, who
was an actual party, were notified of the New York proceedings for probate only by publication or substituted
service of the citation in Georgia, and did not appear. As
a domiciliary administrator c. t. a., the respondent prayed
the issue to it of new certificates for the stock in controversk.
The trial court concluded from the evidence adduced
at the hearings that the testatrix was domiciled in Georgia.
It was therefore, as the court stated, unnecessary for it to
2
consider the binding effect of the Georgia judgment.
The Supreme Court of Delaware reversed this finding of
fact, determined that New York was testatrix's domicile
and denied petitioners' contention that Article IV, § 1,
of the Constitution required the award of the certificates of stock to the Georgia executors. The Coca-Cola

Corporation was directed to issue its stock certificate to
the respondent, the New York administrator c. t. a. New
York Trust Co. v. Riley, 16 A. 2d 772. Because of the importance of issues previously undecided by this' Court,
certiorari was granted to review the alleged error, to wit,
the asserted denial of full faith and credit to the Georgia
judgment. 313 U. S. 555.
The constitutional effect of the Georgia decree on a
claim in his own name in another state by a party to the
Georgia proceedings is not here involved.' The question
we are to decide is whether this Georgia judgment on
domicile conclusively establishes the right of the Georgia
executors to demand delivery to them of personal assets
of their testatrix which another state is willing to surrender
to the domiciliary personal representative, 4 when another
representative, appointed by a third state, asserts a similar domiciliary right. For the purpose of this review, the
conclusion ofDelaware that the testatrix was in fact domiciled in New York is accepted. The answer to the question lies in the extent to which Article IV, § 1, of the
Constitution, as made applicable by R. S. § 905,' nevertheless controls Delaware's action.
This clause of the Constitution brings to our Union a
useful means for ending litigation. Matters once decided
between adverse parties in any state or territory are at
rest. Were it not for this full faith and credit provision,
'The Supreme Court of Delaware was of this opinion. It said: We
are not "called upon to consider the operation of a judgment in a probate proceeding in one jurisdiction as an estoppel against one who,
although a party to that proceeding, undertakes, in a proceeding in
another jurisdiction affecting the same decedent's estate, to raise
again the question of the decedent's domicile." 16 A. 2d 772, 788.
'Cf. Page, Wills (3d Ed.) § 727.
'"And the said records and judicial proceedings, so authenticated,
shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the
United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State
from which they are taken." 28 U. S. C. § 687.

Opinion of the Court.

so far as the Constitution controls the matter, adversaries
could wage again their legal battles whenever they met in
other jurisdictions. Each state could control its own
courts but itself could not project the effect of its decisions beyond its own boundaries. Cf. Pennoyer v. Neff,
95 U. S. 714, 722. That clause compels that controversies
be stilled, so that, where a state court has jurisdiction of
the parties and subject matter, its judgment controls in
other states to the same exent as it does in the state where
rendered. Roche v. McDonald, 275 U. S. 449, 451. This
is true even though the cause of action merged in the judgment could not have been enforced in the state wherein
the enforcement of the judgment is sought. Christmas
v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290, 302; Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U. S.
230, 23 6 By the Constitutional provision for full faith
and credit, the local doctrines of res judicata, speaking
generally, become a part of national jurisprudence, and
therefore federal questions cognizable here.
The Constitution does not require, M'Elmoyle v. Cohen,
13 Peters 312, 328; Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296
U. S. 268, 276, nor does Delaware provide, that the judgments of Georgia have the force of those of her own courts.
A suit in Delaware must precede any local remedy on the
Georgia judgment. Subject to the Constitutional requirements, Delaware's decisions are based on Delaware
jurisprudence. Her sovereignty determines personal and
property rights within her territory. Subject to Constitutional limitations, it was her prerogative to distribute
the property located in Delaware or to direct its transmission to the domiciliary representative of the deceased.

credit clause allows Delaware, in disposing of local assets,
to determine the question of domicile anew for any inter"There are limitations on the generality of the statement. Pacific

ested party who is not bound by participation in the
Georgia proceeding. Thormann v. Frame, 176 U. S. 350,
356; Overby v. Gordon, 177 U. S. 214, 227; Burbank v.
Ernst, 232 U. S. 162; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242
U. S. 394, 400. It must be admitted that this reexamination may result in conflicting decisions upon domicile, but
that is an inevitable consequence of the existing federal
system, which endows its citizens with the freedom to
choose the state or states within which they desire to carry
on business, enjoy their leisure or establish their residences. Worcester County Co. v. Riley, 302 U. S. 292,
299." But, while allowing Delaware to determine domicile for itself, where any interested party is not bound by
the Georgia proceedings, the full faith and credit clause
and R. S. § 905, note 5, supra, do require that Delaware
shall give Georgia judgments such faith and credit "as they
have by law or usage" in Georgia.
We note, but need not discuss at length, the respondent's contention that our application of Georgia law is
limited to the statutes, decisions and usages of that state
pleaded or proven in the Delaware proceedings,8 and that

for such further rules of law, as may be needed to reach a
conclusion here, we must necessarily, in reviewing a Delaware judgment, rely upon the law which, in the absence of
proof of other Georgia law, properly guided the state
courts, that is, the Delaware law.9 At any rate, the cases
relied upon by petitioners to establish the Georgia law,
Tant v. Wigfall, 65 Ga. 412, and Wash v. Dickson, 147 Ga.
540, 94 S.E. 1009, are cited in the opinion of the Supreme
Court of Georgia pleaded in these proceedings. We think
they may be considered by us under the Delaware law. No
objection below was made by respondent to the citations.
The opinion of the Georgia Supreme Court was properly
in the record and, in the absence of a contrary ruling by
Delaware, we are of the view that they may be properly
considered here."
In 1899 the Superior Court clearly stated the rule: "It is a general
rule of law that whenever a foreign statute ig relied upon it must be
pleaded, and this court will not take judicial notice of the laws of our
sister states or of a foreign countly." Thomas v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.,
1 Pennewill 593, 596, 42 A. 987, 988. This rule has been quite strictly
applied in subsequent cases. Wolf v. Keagy, 3 W. W. Harr. 362, 136 A.

We find nothing in either of these cases, however, which
would lead to the conclu'sion that, in Georgia, the New
York administrator c. t. a. was in privity, so faf as the
sequestration of assets for the payment of death taxes or
indebtedness of decedent or her estate is concerned, with
any parties before the Georgia court, or that the New York
representative could not take steps in Georgia courts which
might result in its getting possession of any assets which
under the Georgia law of administration would be properly deliverable to a foreign domiciliary administrator.
In the Tant case, Georgia refused to permit a collateral
attack on a judgment of probate allegedly entered without
jurisdiction of the subject matter. It was held that such
attack must be made in the court where judgment was
rendered. The effect of a judgment entered without jurisdiction of the persons whose rights were purportedly
affected was not discussed. In the Wash case, there was
simply a ruling that a judgment of the Court of Ordinary
could not be collaterally attacked by parties or privies,
unless the record negatived the existence of necessary
"jurisdictional facts." Whom the court would classify as
"privies" to a judgment in personam does not appear, and
the opinion of the court below makes it amply plain that
there was no piivity under Delaware law. Hence, if the
Georgia judgment is to bind the New York administrator,
it can be considered to do so only in rem.
By § 113-602, Georgia Code of 1933, set up by petitioner as a basis for his contention as to the finality of the
Georgia judgment in Delaware, it is provided that the
Court of Ordinary is given exclusive jurisdiction over the
probate of wills and that "such probate is conclusive upon

I shall assume then

that the quotations in the brief filed in behalf of the State of New

York are correct extracts from the New York statute and that by tacit
agreement they may be considered as though they were properly in the.

Opinion of the Court.

all the parties notified, and all the legatees under the will
who are represented in the executor." All the parties entitled to be heard in opposition to the probate, including
Mr. Hungerford, were actually before the Court of Ordinary. It may be assumed that the judgment of probate
and domicile is a judgment in rem and therefore, as "an act
of the sovereign power," "its effects cannot be disputed"
within the jurisdiction." But this does not bar litigation
anew by a stranger, of facts upon which the decree in rem
is based." Hence it cannot be said, we think, that because
respondent would have no standing in Georgia to contest
the probate of a will and, we assume, the preliminary determination of domicile, held necessary in Hungerford v.
Spalding, 183 Ga. 547, 550, 189 S. E. 2, 3, thereafter respondent could not file a claim in Delaware, dependent
upon domiciliary representation of testatrix, for assets in
the latter state. While the Georgia judgment is to have
the same faith and credit in Delaware as it does in Georgia,
that requirement does not give the Georgia judgment
extra-territorial effect upon assets in other states. So far as
the assets in Georgia are concerned, the Georgia judgment
of probate is in rem; so far as it affects personalty beyond
the state, it is in personam and can bind only parties
thereto or their privies. This is the result of the ruling in
Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 U. S. 394,400.1" Phrased
" See Brigham v. Fayerweather,140 Mass. 411, 413, 5 N. E. 265, 266.
The Georgia Supreme Court intimated in one of the other eases cited
in the Hungerford opinion, that if a person was not heard in probate
because of a supposed lack of interest, but was in fact interested, he
would not be bound by the probate decree. Wetter v. Habersham, 60

somewhat differently, if the effect of a probate decree in
Georgia in personam was to bar a stranger to the decree
from later asserting his rights, such a holding would deny
procedural due process.
It seems quite obvious that the administrator c. t. a.
appears in Delaware as an agency of the State of New'
York, and not as the alter ego of the beneficiaries of the
Hungerford estate. In its answer to the petitioners'
statement of claim, it established its status by alleging
domiciliary determination of A. At that point a beneficiary, a stranger
to the proceeding in A, appears and asserts that the decedent was domiciled in B. The determination of domicile by state A will not be recognized by state B, but state B will take evidence and redetermine the
issue of domicile. Estate of Clark, 148 Cal. 108, 82 P. 760; Holyoke v.

that not merely the beneficiaries but creditors residing in
New York and the State of New York were interested
in the estate, that its appointment as temporary administrator had been sought by the New York Tax Commissioner "to protect the claim of the State of New York to
inheritance and succession taxes," that the State of New
York was asserting such claims in substantial amount on
the theory that the domicile was New York, and that,
under New York law, as evidenced by statutes likewise
pleaded, an administrator was "vested by law with the
right to possession and control over and to exercise all
manner of dominion over all of the goods and chattels
and personal property of every kind and description of
the estate of a decedent."
A state is interested primarily not in the payment of
particular creditors, nor in the succession of heirs or beneficiaries, as such, but in the administration of the property of its citizens, wherever located, and that of strangers
within its boundaries. In a society where inheritance is
an important social concept, the managing of decedents'
property is a sovereign right which may not be.readily
frustrated.
Georgia and New York might each assert its right to
administer the estates of its domiciliaries to protect its
sovereign interests, and Delaware was free to decide for
itself which claimant is entitled to receive the portion
of Mrs. Hungerford's personalty within Delaware's
borders.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE:

I concur upon the single ground that the New York
administrator was not bound by the Georgia judgment.
He was not a party to the Georgia proceedings, nor was
he represented by any of those who were parties. As administrator appointed under the New York statutes, he

was charged with the duty of administering the estate of
the decedent and paying inheritance taxes upon it. His
interest so far as he owes duties to the state is therefore
adverse to that of the husband and the next of kin, who
alone were parties to the Georgia proceeding. To have
bound him by representation of those so adverse in interest would have been a denial of due process. Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U. S. 32. A judgment so obtained is not
entitled to full faith and credit with respect to those not
parties. Pink v. A. A. A. Highway Express, 314 U. S.
201; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 U. S. 394;
Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U. S. 1, 18. Any other conclusion would foreclose New York from litigating its
right to collect taxes lawfully due, by the simple expedient of a probate by the next of kin of the will of the
decedent as the domiciled resident of another state, without notice to any representative of New York or opportunity to be heard.
It is unnecessary to consider the other questions discussed by the opinion.
