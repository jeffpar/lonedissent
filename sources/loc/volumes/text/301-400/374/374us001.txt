CASES ADJUDGED
IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1962.

SHENKER v. BALTIMORE & OHIO RAILROAD CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 414.

Argued April 17, 1963.-Decided June 10, 1963.

1. The Federal District Court awarded petitioner a judgment for
damages. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.
Petitioner moved for a rehearing en banc under 28 IT. S. C. § 46 (c).
There were then eight active judgees on the Court of Appeals. Four
voted to grant the rehearing, two voted to deny it, two abstained,
and a rehearing was denied. Under the uniform practice of that
Court, ever) petition for rehearing is submitted to every active
member of the Court, a judge is not required to enter a formal vote
on the petition, and a rehearing is not granted unless a majority
of the active members of the Court vote for it. Held: Such a
procedure is clearly within the scope of the discretion of the Court
of Appeals under 28 U. S. C. § 46 (c), as interpreted in WVestern
Pac. R. Corp. v. Western Pac. R. Co.. 345 U. S. 247. Pp. 4-5.
2. Petitioner, an employee of respondent railroad, who was paid by it
and acted solely under the supervision of its employees, sued
res)ondent under the Federal Employers' Liability Act to recover

damages for injuries sustained ,bile loading mail onto a mail car
of another railroad at a station of the latter which was managed
and operated solely by respondent. The injury resulted from a
defective door on the mail car in a train of the other railroad
which had just arrived at the station. Under instructions that
it was respondent's duty to exercise ordinary care to furnish its

employees with cars on which they work equipped with reasonably safe doors, even if the cars are owned by another railroad, the

jury awarded damages to petitioner. The District Court denied a
motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and entered
judgment for petitioner. Held: The case was submitted to the jury
under proper instructions; there was reasonable basis in the evidence for the jury's verdict; and the judgment for petitioner should
have been sustained. Pp. 5-11.
(a) On the evidence, petitioner was clearly an employee of
respondent, even under the common law loaned-servant doctrine,
and it is not necessary to consider the extent to which that doctrine
applies to cases under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Pp.
5-7.
(b) Although the mail car with the defective door was on a train
of the other railroad which had just arrived at the station, it was
respondent's duty to inspect the car before permitting its employees
to work with it. Pp. 7-11.303 F. 2d 596, reversed.

Charles Alan Wright argued the cause for petitioner.
With him on the brief were John Ruffalo and James E.
McLaughlin.
Alexander H. Hadden argued the cause and filed a brief
for respondent.

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The petitioner brought an action under the Federal
Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.. S. C. §§ 51-60, in the
Federal District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to recover for injuries caused by the alleged negligence of the respondent Baltimore & Ohio Railroad
(B&O) and the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE).
At the close of the evidence, the District Court directed a
verdict in favor of the P&LE on the ground that the
evidence failed to establish that the petitioner was an
employee of that company as required by § 1 of the Act
(45 U. S. C. § 51). The case against the B&O, however,
was submitted to the jury which returned a verdict of
$40,000 for the petitioner. The District Court denied a

motion for judgment n. o. v. and entered judgment as
found by the jury. On appeal, the Third Circuit Court of
Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed, holding that the
petitioner failed to establish negligence on the part of the
B&O. 303 F. 2d 596. A rehearing en banc was denied.
We granted certiorari. 371 U. S. 908.
The petitioner was employed by the B&O at its
Mahoningtown station in New Castle, Pennsylvania.
The railroad complex at Mahoningtown consisted of four
sets of tracks, two owned and operated by the B&O and
two by the P&LE. On the B&O side, the B&O maintained a station and station facilities. Although the
P&LE maintained a station, it kept no employees, all
necessary services for the two stations being provided by
B&O employees. The B&O ticket agent issued tickets
in the B&O station for the P&LE trains. The petitioner
provided janitor work for both stations and assisted the
loading and unloading of mail cars for the trains of both
railroads. The petitioner was paid by the B&O and was
under the sole supervision of the B&O ticket agent.
On the date of the accident, October 15, 1956, the petitioner handled the mail for the P&LE train scheduled to

loaded 20 to 25 bags of mail on a B&O wagon at the B&O
station. He crossed the B&O and P&LE tracks to the
P&LE platform and, when the P&LE train pulled up,
brought the wagon alongside the mail car door. On this
occasion, in spite of the efforts of the petitioner and the
P&LE baggageman, one Beck, the sliding door on the
P&LE car would not open more than 18 or 20 inches.
According to the petitioner, Beck commented that he had
reported the defective door to the P&LE which had yet to
fix it and that they would have to get the mail on and
off as best they could. The petitioner, standing on the
wagon, had no difficulty throwing the smaller bags in the
restricted opening. The larger ones, however, weighing

from 80 to 100 pounds, required the petitioner "to twist
around," and "to keep pushing and forcing them" to get
them in the opening. In the process of this unusual
exertion, the petitioner felt something snap in his back.
He reported the injury immediately to the B&O ticket
agent. Treatment of the injury eventually required the
removal of a ruptured intervertebral disc and resulted in
the petitioner's permanent disability. On the basis of
this evidence, the jury found for the petitioner.
Before considering the merits of the decision below, the
petitioner raises a procedural point, claiming that he was
denied a rehearing en banc in the Third Circuit Court of
Appeals in violation of his rights under 28 U. S. C.
§ 46 (c). At the time the petitioner filed his motion for
rehearing en banc there were eight active judges serving
on the Third Circuit. Four judges voted to grant the
rehearing, two voted to deny, and two abstained. The
rehearing was denied. The petitioner claims that to grant
a rehearing en banc, the statute requires only a majority
of those present. The Third Circuit requires an absolute
majority of the active members of the court. Section
46 (c) provides:
"Cases and controversies shall be heard and determined by a court or division of not more than three
judges, unless a hearing or rehearing before the court
in banc is ordered by a majority of the circuit judges
of the circuit who are in active service. A court in
banc shall consist of all active circuit judges of the
circuit."
The Court had occasion to consider this section at length
in Western Pac. R. Corp. v. Western Pac. R. Co., 345 U. S.
247. It there said:
"In our view, § 46 (c) is not addressed to litigants.
It is addressed to the Court of Appeals. It is a grant
of power. It vests in the court the power to order

hearings en banc. It goes no further. It neither
forbids nor requires each active member of a Court
of Appeals to entertain each petition for a hearing or
rehearing en banc. The court is left free to devise
its own administrative machinery to provide the
means whereby a majority may order such a hearing."
Id., at 250.
The Court went on to say that the rights of the litigant go
no further than the right to know the administrative machinery that will be followed and the right to suggest that
the en banc procedure be set in motion in his case. The
practice of the Third Circuit has been fully revealed by
Judge Maris in Hearing and Rehearing Cases In Banc,
14 F. R. D. 91, which was referred to with approval by
this Court in United States v. American-Foreign S. S.
Corp., 363 U. S. 685, 688, n. 5. Although every petition
for rehearing is submitted to every member of the court,
a judge is not required to enter a formal vote on the petition. Such a procedure is clearly within the scope of the
court's discretion as we spoke of it in Western Pacific.
For this Court to hold otherwise would involve it unnecessarily in the internal administration of the Courts of
Appeals.
Turning to the merits, there can be no question that
the petitioner is an employee of the B&O as required by
§ 1 of the F. E. L. A. Although the B&O suggests that
the petitioner may have been the employee of the P&LE
within the meaning of the common law loaned-servant
doctrine, Standard Oil Co. v. Aniderson, 212 U. S. 215;
Linstead v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 276 U. S. 28. 3234, there is no evidence in the record to support such a
conclusion. In describing the loaned-servant doctrine,
the Court in Anderson stated that when the nominal
employer furnishes a third party "with men to do the
work and places them under his exclusive control in the
performance of it, [then] those men become pro hac vice

the servants of him to whom they are furnished." 212
U. S., at 221. The Court concluded that under the common law loaned-servant doctrine immediate control and
supervision is critical in determining for whom the servants are performing services. In the present case, the
undisputed facts show that the petitioner was at all times
paid by the B&O and under the sole supervision of B&O
employees.' The intimations of the B&O that the petitioner might have been given directions by the P&LE
baggageman is at most an example of the minimum cooperation necessary to carry out a coordinated undertaking,
and, as noted in Anderson, cannot amount to control or
supervision. 212 U. S., at 226. The whole tenor of the
services the B&O provides for the P&LE speaks of an
agreement by the B&O to manage and operate the P&LE
station at Mahoningtown. On such evidence, the petitioner is clearly an employee of the B&O even under the
common law loaned-servant doctrine, and we therefore
need not consider the extent to which that doctrine

the petitioner's injury stands undisputed in the record:

connected with that operation there.

applies to cases under the F. E. L. A. See Linstead v.
Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., supra; compare Sinkler v.
Missouri Pac. R. Co., 356 U. S. 326, 329-330.
The only remaining issue is the negligence, if any, of
the respondent B&O. The trial judge instructed the jury
that
a railroad is under a duty to exercise ordinary
prudence, caution and care to inspect and to furnish
its employees with cars on which they work equipped
with reasonably safe doors, even though the cars are
owned by another railroad. A failure of the B&O
Railroad to do so is negligence, providing that the
railroad can foresee that one of its employees may be
injured in performing his work in connection with
that car and its equipment which are not reasonably
safe."
No exception was taken to this charge. In his opinion denying the B&O's motion for judgment n. o. v., the
trial judge relied on a series of court of appeals decisions
standing for the more broad proposition that a railroad
has the nondelegable duty to provide its employees with
a safe place to work even when they are required to go
onto the premises of a third party over which the railroad
has no control. See Kooker v. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie
R. Co., 258 F. 2d 876; Chicago Great Western R. Co. v.
Casura,234 F. 2d 441; Beattie v. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co., 217
F. 2d 863. These decisions are in accord with the opinions
of this Court in Bailey v. Central Vermont R. Co.,
319 U. S. 350; Ellis v. Union Pac. R. Co., 329 U. S. 649;
Harris v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 361 U. S. 15, reversing
168 Ohio St. 582, 156 N. E. 2d 822. The present case has
been argued to us on the basis of these same decisions and
the safe-place-to-work doctrine. The respondent admits
the general statements of the doctrine in these cases. It
bases its defense solely on the proposition that because the
P&LE train had just pulled into the station, the B&O

did not have sufficient opportunity to obtain actual or
constructive notice of the defective mail car door. The
respondent relies on two lower court cases holding that
where the defect in the premises of the third party arose
within minutes or hours of the accident, there was insufficient time as a matter of law for the railroad to be held
to have notice. Kaminski v. Chicago R. & I. R. Co., 200
F. 2d 1; Wetherbee v. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co., 191 F. 2d 302,
subsequent appeal reported in 204 F. 2d 755, cert. denied,
346 U. S. 867.
Whatever the validity of these last two cases, they do
not have relevance here. We hold that the B&O had a
duty to inspect P&LE cars before permitting its employees to work with them. The standard of care applicable to the use of cars belonging to a foreign railroad was
settled long before the accident in this case. In Baltimore & Potomac R. Co. v. Mackey, 157 U. S. 72, an
employee of the Baltimore & Potomac was killed when a
defective brake did not hold on a freight car hauled by the
Baltimore & Potomac, but belonging to another railroad.
Relying on the language of an earlier New York decision,
Gottlieb v. New York & Lake Erie R. Co., 100 N. Y. 462,
467, 3 N. E. 344, 345, the Court concluded that a railroad
"... is bound to inspect foreign cars just as it
would inspect its own cars. It owes the duty of
inspection as master . . . . When cars cone to it
which have defects visible or discoverable by ordinary inspection, it must either remedy such defects
or refuse to take such cars; so much at least is due
from it to its employds." 157 U. S., at p. 90.
The Court did not have to look far for the "sound reason
and public policy" behind this principle. Relying on the
language of the lower court, the Court said:
"It would be most unreasonable and cruel to declare,
that, while the faithful workman may obtain com-

pensation from a company for defective arrangement
of its own cars, he would be without redress against
the same company if the damaged dar that occasioned
the injury happened to belong to another company."
157 U. S., at p. 89.
This decision was reaffirmed and extended a short time
later in Texas & Pac. R. Co. v. Archibald, 170 U. S. 665.
In that case, the Texas & Pacific accepted a car of the
Cotton Belt Railway for loading at a cottonseed oil mill
on a spur off the Texas & Pacific track. In the process
of switching, an employee of the Texas & Pacific was
seriously injured due to a defective coupling on the foreign
car. The Texas & Pacific attempted to distinguish the
Baltimore & Potomac case on the ground that the duty
to inspect did not apply when a railroad accepted a foreign
car only for loading rather than for hauling over its line
in one of its trains. The Court dismissed the argument
summarily:
"The argument wants foundation in reason and is
unsupported by any authority. In reason, because,
as the duty of the company to use reasonable diligence to furnish safe appliances is ever present, and
applies to its entire business, it is beyond reason to
attempt by a purely arbitrary distinction to take a
particular part of the business of the company out
of the operation of the general rule, and thereby to
exempt it, as to the business so separated, from any
obligation to observe reasonable precautions to furnish appliances which are in good condition." 170
U. S., at p. 670.2
2 The Court in Texas & Pacific went on to hold that the railroad
will not be held to its duty to inspect where the employee himself
becomes aware of the defect yet continues to work with the car
with knowledge of its defect. This exception to the rule was based
on the belief that the employee assumes the risk of handling appli-

See generally, Annotation, 41 L. R. A. 101. The rules
adopted in these two cases are unavoidably applicable to
the present case. The B&O required the petitioner to
work with cars belonging to the P&LE, taking no precautions whatsoever to protect him from possible defects in
these cars, defects for which it would be liable should
they appear in its own cars. As Texas & Pacific makes
abundantly clear, there is no de minimis rule called into
play on account of the brevity of the sojourn of the P&LE
train in Mahoningtown station, since the length of the
sojourn is irrelevant to the duty owed to the employee
working with the car. Nor is it an answer to claim that
the B&O lacked control or supervision over the P&LE car.
Such arguments have never supported an exception to
the employer's duty to provide a safe place to work, Chicago Great Western R. Co. v. Casura,supra, p. 447; Beattie v. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co., supra, p. 865; Terminal R.
Assn. of St. Louis v. Fitzjohn, 165 F. 2d 473, 476-477, and
have no greater relevance here with respect to the duty to
provide reasonably safe cars, see Annotation, 41 L. R. A.
101. The B&O may adequately protect itself by refusing
to permit its employees to service the car. Since the instructions to the jury adequately reflect the holdings in
these cases and since the B&O's failure to inspect is uncontested, the jury verdict should have been affirmed.
Although recovery in this case is supported by the
common law, it is also required by any reasonable construction of the Federal Employers' Liability Act itself.
As we stated in Sinkler v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 356 U. S.
ances which are known to be defective. 170 U. S., at pp. 672-673.
This exception, of course, is no longer relevant under the F. E. L. A.,
since § 4 of the Act expressly eliminates assumption of risk as
a defense to negligence on the part of the employer. In its place,
the railroad may raise contributory negligence on the part of the
employee in mitigation of damages, a defense that was raised in this
case and on which the jury was properly charged.

326, 330: "it was the conception of this legislation that
the railroad was a unitary enterprise, its economic resources obligated to bear the burden of all injuries befalling those engaged in the enterprise arising out of the
fault of any other member engaged in the common endeavor." If recovery were denied in this case, the railroads, by the simple expedient of doing each other's work,
could tie their employees up in legal technicalities over
the proper railroad to sue for injuries and perhaps remove
from coverage of the Act a significant area of railroad
activity. It would subject the employee once more to the
stricter negligence standards of the common law and
such debilitating doctrines as assumption of risk. Cf.
Texas & Pac. R. Co. v. Archibald, 170 U. S. 665, 673.
In our opinion the case was submitted to the jury under
proper instructions, and there was a reasonable basis in
the evidence for the verdict which the jury returned.

MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE
HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.
With all deference, I must respectfully dissent. We
are not here dealing with a situation in which a lower
court has so disregarded applicable law as to require correction here. This is simply a case in which the evidence
is insufficient to sustain liability of the respondent B&O
and in which a perhaps more substantial claim against the
P&LE was abandoned by the petitioner below. Any
hiatus in protection of the petitioner exists not because
of inadequacies in the law, but solely because of inadequacies in the evidence.
Normally, in a case such as this in which the defendant's own negligence did not create the hazardous condition, actual or constructive notice to the defendant of
the injury-producing defect is a prerequisite to negli-

gence and, therefore, to liability. See, e. g., Sano v.
PennsylvaniaR. Co., 282 F. 2d 936, 938; Dobson v. Grand
Trunk W. R. Co., 248 F. 2d 545, 548; Atlantic C. L. R.
Co. v. Collins, 235 F. 2d 805, 808, cert. denied 352 U. S.
942; Kaminski v. Chicago R. & I. R. Co., 200 F. 2d 1, 4.
See also Ringhiser v. Chesapeake & 0. R. Co., 354 U. S.
901; Wetherbee v. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co., 191 F. 2d 302,
subsequent appeal reported in 204 F. 2d 755, cert. denied,
346 U. S. 867. Thus, given the failure of the petitioner
to introduce evidence tending to show that the respondent
B&O knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should
have known, of the defective door, the judgment entered
below in favor of the B&O should be sustained.'
The Court seeks to avoid the application of these ordinarily controlling principles by invoking several cases,

decided prior to enactment of the F. E. L. A., which, it
holds, require that, in order to discharge its duty "to use
reasonable care in furnishing [the petitioner] . . . with
a safe place to . . . work," Bailey v. Central Vermont

R. Co., 319 U. S. 350, 352, the B&O must inspect the
P&LE cars before B&O employees are allowed or directed
to work on them. Even accepting, arguendo, the gen-

eral applicability here of the principle imposing on
B&O the duty to inspect the cars which it services
the P&LE, the result reached by the Court does
follow. Such a duty may exist, to be sure, but the

'The petitioner does not here argue that notice of the defect to
the P&LE was also sufficient notice to respondent B&O.
2 Although language in its opinion suggests the contrary, see pp.
7, 10, ante, I do not understand the Court today to be directly declaring an absolute duty to provide a safe place to work without regard
to negligence, since the very cases cited by the Court indicate that
the duty is to exercise reasonable care with respect thereto. Instead,
the Court ignores the statutory concept of negligence in setting out
the duty of inspection it imposes, a result which, for the reasons
stated infIra, is erroneous and violates the clear language of the
governing statute.

SHENKER v. BALTIMORE & OHIO R. CO.

J., dissenting.

ligation can be no more than to conduct reasonable,
nonnegligent inspections, and the liability which would
accrue from breach of such a duty would be responsibility
for damages occurring as a result of the negligent performance or the nonperformance of that duty. In a
meaningful sense, then, imposition of a duty to inspect is
no more than a specific application of the concept of constructive knowledge, since it is implicit in the principle
that one is chargeable with knowledge of that which in
the exercise of reasonable care he should have known.
Here, that would mean that in the exercise of reasonable
care the B&O should have inspected the P&LE cars and
is chargeable with knowledge of that which a reasonable
inspection would have shown.
The Court, however, says merely that the B&O had a
duty to inspect and that, having failed to inspect, it is
liable to the petitioner for the defect which apparently
caused his injury. I find this reasoning unconvincing.
While the Court declares that it is undisputed that
the B&O did not inspect, there is simply no evidence
in the record with regard to inspection. Moreover, even
if an inference of failure to inspect were supportable.
there is no basis for assuming, as the Court does and must
do to sustain its result, that a reasonable, nonnegligent
inspection procedure would, in fact, have disclosed the
defect which is the basis of the petitioner's claim. Even
when there does exist a duty of inspection, the mere
existence of a defect does not itself create liability; it
must also be shown that reasonable, nonnegligent inspection procedures would have disclosed the defect.3
3 This, in fact, is the apparent rule of the very cases relied upon
by the Court to subject the B&O to liability here. In Baltimore &
Potomac R. Co. v. Mackey, 157 U. S. 72, cited by the majority at
p. 8, ante, the Court based liability on the operative "principle that
a railroad company is under a legal duty not to expose its employes
to dangers arising from such defects in foreign cars as may be dis-

Evidence of this liability-producing factor was not
introduced by the petitioner. The record is devoid of
evidence as to the length of time the defect existed prior
to the petitioner's injury,4 and as to whether, even under
an extremely careful and nonnegligent inspection procedure, the defect would have been discovered prior to
the time of petitioner's injury.
Under the rationale and result of this case, a railroad
would be liable for a defect which first appeared immediately prior to the injury for which recovery is sought
and which even the most scrupulous kind of inspection
procedure could neither have avoided nor detected.
What the Court appears to have done is to create not
simply a duty of inspection, but an absolute duty of discovery of all defects; in short, it has made the B&O the
insurer of the condition of all premises and equipment,
whether its own or others, upon which its employees may
work. This is the wholly salutary principle of compensation for industrial injury incorporated by workmen's
covered by reasonable inspection before such cars are admitted into
its train." 157 U. S., at 91 (emphasis supplied). The second case
upon which the majority bases its result here, see pp. 8-9, ante,
simply applies this same principle to a somewhat different set of facts,
again declaring liability for injury-producing defects "discoverable
by proper inspection." Texas & Pac. R. Co. v. Archibald, 170 U. S.
665, 672 (emphasis supplied). The nature and timing of the required
inspection-but probably not, as the Court here declares, the duty
of inspection itself-presumably depend, as a function of its reason-

ableness, on a number of factors, including the duration of the time
the car is available to the defendant for inspection and the manner
in which it is received. In both of the cited cases, the "foreign" car
was in the possession and on the tracks of the named defendant upon
which liability was imposed.
4The statement attributed to the P&LE baggageman by the petitioner that the defective door had been reported to the P&LE does
not, of course, shed any light on the length of time the defect had
continued to exist. The report may well have been made only
shortly before the petitioner was injured.

compensation statutes, but it is not the one created by
the F. E. L. A., which premises liability upon negligence
of the employing railroad. It is my view that, as a matter
of policy, employees such as the petitioner, who are
injured in the course of their employment, should be
entitled to prompt and adequate compensation regardless
of the employer's negligence and free from traditional
common-law rules limiting recovery. But Congress has
elected a different test of liability which, until changed,
courts are obligated to apply.
