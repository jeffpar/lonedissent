OCTOBER TERM, 1963.
Per Curiam.

377 U. S.

that triable issues of fact exist. To examine this large
record without any illumination by the court below
would place an intolerable burden on this Court.
In these circumstances I believe that the proper course
is to vacate the judgment below and remand the case to
the District Court, with leave to the defendant to renew
its motion for summary judgment before another district
judge. The Court's action, which deprives the defendant
of that opportunity, seems to me unwarranted. If summary judgment were again granted, the District Court
would be expected to furnish a statement of its reasons,
including such findings of fact and conclusions of law as
might be appropriate. Cf. United States v. El Paso
Natural Gas Co., 376 U. S. 651, 662 (concurring-dissenting
opinion of HARLAN, J.).
