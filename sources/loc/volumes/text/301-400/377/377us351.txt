UNITED STATES v. VERMONT

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND

No. 509.

CIRCUIT.

Argued April 21, 1964.-Decided June 1, 1964.

A State assessed a solvent taxpayer for unpaid state taxes under a
law providing that the amount owed shall be a lien in favor of the
State upon the taxpayer's property and that the lien arises at the
time the assessment is made. Later, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, proceeding under 26 U. S. C. §§ 6321 and 6322, provisions virtually identical with the state law, assessed the taxpayer
for federal taxes. The State thereafter sued and secured a judgment in the state court against the taxpayer and a bank which
held sums owing to the taxpayer. The United States then sued
in federal court to foreclose the federal lien; the District Court
upheld the State's contention that its original assessment gave its
lien priority; and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: The state
lien had priority over the later federal lien. Pp. 354-359.
(a) The State's lien was choate since the identity of the lienor,
the property subject to the lien and the amount of the lien were
established. United States v. New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, followed.
Pp. 354-355, 358.
(b) Where in a case involving a solvent debtor a federal tax lien
arises under §§ 6321 and 6322 subsequent to a state tax lien, it is
not necessary that property be reduced to the possession of the
state tax lienor to defeat the federal claim, as would have been
the case under R. S. § 3466, which accords the United States
priority with respect to a claim against an insolvent debtor.
United States v. Gilbert Associates, 345 U. S. 361, distinguished.
Pp. 356-359.
317 F. 2d 446, affirmed.

Daniel M. Friedman argued the cause for the United
States. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General
Cox, Assistant Attorney General Oberdorfer and Joseph
Kovner.

Charles E. Gibson, Jr., Attorney General of Vermont,
argued the cause and filed a brief for respondents.

OCTOBER TERM, 1963.
Opinion of the Court.

377 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case involves a conflict between two liens upon
the property of a solvent Vermont taxpayer-a federal
tax lien arising under the provisions of 26 U. S. C. §§ 6321
and 6322' and an antecedent state tax lien based on a
Vermont law worded in terms virtually identical to the
provisions of those federal statutes.
On October 21, 1958, the State of Vermont made an
assessment and demand on Cutting & Trimming, Inc., for
withheld state income taxes of $1,628.15. The applicable
Vermont statute, modeled on the comparable federal
enactments, provides that if an employer required to
withhold a tax fails to pay the same after demand, "the
amount, including interest after such demand, together
witl4 any costs that may accrue in addition thereto, shall
be a lien in favor of the state of Vermont upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such employer," and that "[s]uch lien shall
arise at the time the assessment and demand is made by
the commissioner of taxes and shall continue until the liability for such sum, with interest and costs, is satisfied or
becomes unenforceable." 2
U. S. C. § 6321 provides:
"If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the
same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional
amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with any
costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor
of the United States upon all property and rights to property,
whether real or personal, belonging to such person."
26 U. S. C. § 6322 provides:
"Unless another date is specifically fixed by law, the lien imposed
by section 6321 shall arise at the time the assessment is made and
shall continue until the liability for the amount so assessed is satisfied
or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time."

Opinion of the Court.

More than three months later, on February 9, 1959,
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made an assessment against Cutting & Trimming of $5,365.96 for taxes
due under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. Under
§§ 6321 and 6322, this amount became "a lien in favor of
the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person,"
which arose "at the time the assessment is made and shall
continue until the liability for the amount so assessed is
satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of
time." I
On May 21, 1959, the State instituted suit in a state
court against Cutting & Trimming, joining as a defendant
Chittenden Trust Company, a Burlington bank which,
as the result of a writ served on May 25, disclosed that it
had in hand sums owing to Cutting & Trimming. On
October 23, 1959, judgment was entered against Cutting
& Trimming and against Chittenden Trust Company.
In 1961, the United States brought the present action
in the Federal District Court for Vermont to foreclose the
federal lien against the property of Cutting & Trimming
3 See note 1, supra. Notice of the federal lien was filed on June
2,
1959, pursuant to 26 U. S. C. § 6323, which provides:
"(a) Invalidity of lien without notice. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the lien imposed by section 6321 shall not be
valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment
creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the Secretary or his
delegate- . .. ."
No claim is made here that Vermont's lien comes within any of
the four classifications to which § 6323 accords priority until notice
of the federal tax lien has been filed. Consequently, we put to one
side such cases as United States v. Pioneer American Ins. Co., 374
U. S. 84, United States v. Ball Construction Co., 355 U. S. 587, and
United States v. Scovil, 348 U. S. 218, which are concerned with the
federal standards to be applied in determining whether the security
interests envisaged in that provision have in fact been created. See
also United States v. Gilbert Associates, 345 U. S. 361, 363-365.

held by the Trust Company. Vermont's answer alleged
that the state assessment of October 21, 1958, gave its
lien priority over the federal lien. On cross-motions for
judgment on the pleadings, the District Court held that
the state lien had priority, and directed the Trust Company to apply the moneys which it held first to the payment of principal and interest on that lien, and to pay any
balance to the United States. 206 F. Supp. 951.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, reasoning that, under
this Court's decision in United States v. New Britain,
347 U. S. 81, "[i]t would seem that if the general federal
tax lien under §§ 6321 and 6322 is thus sufficiently 'choate'
to prevail over a later specific local tax lien, a general
state tax lien under an almost identically worded statute
must also be 'choate' enough to prime a later and equally
general federal tax lien," 317 F. 2d 446, 452. Accordingly, the appellate court applied "the 'cardinal rule' laid
down by Chief Justice Marshall in Rankin & Schatzell v.
Scott, 12 Wheat. (25 U. S.) 177, 179 (1827): 'The principle is believed to be universal that a prior lien gives a
prior claim, which is entitled to prior satisfaction, out of
the subject it binds . . . .' " Id., at 450. Because of the
importance of the question in the administration of the
state and federal revenue laws, we granted certiorari.
375 U. S.940. For the reasons which follow, we affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
Both parties urge that decision here is governed by
United States v. New Britain,347 U. S.81. In that case,
involving conflicting municipal and federal statutory
liens, the Court held that "the priority of each statutory
lien contested here must depend on the time it attached
to the property in question and became choate." Id., at
86. In determining the choateness of the liens involved,
the Court "accept[ed] the [state court's] holding as to
the specificity of the City's liens since they attached to
specific pieces of real property for the taxes assessed and

water rent due," but it went on to stress that "liens may
also be perfected in the sense that there is nothing more
to be done to have a choate lien-when the identity of
the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the
amount of the lien are established. The federal tax liens
are general and, in the sense above indicated, perfected."
Id., at 84. Vermont's claim for the priority of its lien
over the later federal lien is based on the fact that its lien
is as completely "perfected" as was the federal lien in
New Britain. Opposing this claim, the United States
urges that different standards of choateness apply to federal and state liens, even where, as here, they are based
on statutes identical in every material respect. The
argument, in short, is that an antecedent state lien, in
order to obtain priority over a federal lien based on
§§ 6321 and 6322, cannot, like the federal lien, attach to
all of the taxpayer's property, but must rather, like the
municipal liens in New Britain, attach to specifically
identified portions of that property.
The requirement that a competing lien must be choate
in order to take priority over a later federal tax lien stems
from the decision in United States v. Security Trust &
Savings Bank, 340 U. S. 47. There, an attachment lien
which gave no right to proceed against the attached property unless judgment was obtained within three years or
within an extension provided by the statute was held
junior to a federal tax lien which had arisen after the
date of the attachment but prior to the date of judgment
on the ground that "[n]umerous contingencies might
arise that would prevent the attachment lien from ever
becoming perfected by a judgment awarded and recorded.
Thus the attachment lien is contingent or inchoatemerely a lis pendens notice that a right to perfect a lien
exists." Id., at 50. The Security Trust rationale has
since been applied in a case where a federal tax lien arose
prior to judgment on a garnishment lien, United States v.

377 U. S.

Liverpool & London Ins. Co., 348 U. S. 215," and comparable defects have been held to require the according of
priority to the federal lien in a series of cases involving
competing mechanics' liens.'
In addition to setting out the specific ground of decision, however, the Security Trust opinion went on to
state:
"In cases involving a kindred matter, i. e.,
the
federal priority under R. S. § 3466, it has never been
held sufficient to defeat the federal priority merely
to show a lien effective to protect the lienor against
others than the Government, but contingent upon
taking subsequent steps for enforcing it. . . . If
the purpose of the federal tax lien statute to insure
prompt and certain collection of taxes due the United
States from tax delinquents is to be fulfilled, a
similar rule must prevail here." 340 U. S., at 51.
Relying on this statement, the United States urges us to
read Security Trust as establishing the proposition that
federal tax liens are entitled to priority, not only over
"a lis pendens notice that a right to perfect a lien exists,"
but over any antecedent lien which is not sufficiently perfected to prevail against the explicit priority which R. S.
§ 3466 gives to claims of the United States in situations
involving insolvency.6 More particularly, it is suggested

6 Revised Statutes § 3466 provides:
"Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent,
or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the
executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due
from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first
satisfied; and the priority hereby established shall extend as well to
cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his

that the state liens at issue here did not meet the standards of "specificity" until Vermont attached the funds
held by the Chittenden Trust Company, at which time
the federal tax lien had already come into existence. This
argument fails to discriminate between the standards
applicable under the federal tax lien provisions and those
applicable to an insolvent debtor under R. S. § 3466.
Section 3466 on its face permits no exception whatsoever from the statutory command that "[w]henever any
person indebted to the United States is insolvent . . .
debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied."
The statute applies to all the insolvent's debts to the Government, whether or not arising from taxes, and whether
or not secured by a lien. In United States v. Gilbert
Associates, 345 U. S. 361, without questioning that the
lienor was identified, the amount of the lien certain or the
property subject to the lien definite, this Court accorded
priority to subsequently arising claims of the United
States against an insolvent debtor on the ground that:
"In claims of this type, 'specificity' requires that
the lien be attached to certain property by reducing
it to possession, on the theory that the United States
has no claim against property no longer in the possession of the debtor. . . . The taxpayer had not
been divested by the Town of either title or possession. The Town, therefore, had only a general,
unperfected lien." Id., at 366.'
The state tax commissioner's assessment and demand
in the present case clearly did not meet that standard,
debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or in which the estate
and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached
by process of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is
committed."

States v. Waddill Co., 323 U. S.353, 359-360.

nor, so far as that goes, did the writ of attachment served
on the Chittenden Trust Company.' But the New
Britain case, 347 U. S. 81, in which "[t]he taxpayer had
not been divested by the Town of either title or possession," makes quite clear that different standards apply
where the United States' claim is based on a tax lien arising under §§ 6321 and 6322.1 "When the debtor is insolvent, Congress has expressly given priority to the payment of indebtedness owing the United States, whether
secured by liens or otherwise, by § 3466 of the Revised
Statutes, 31 U. S. C. .

.

. § 191.

In that circumstance,

where all the property of the debtor is involved, Congress
has protected the federal revenues by imposing an absolute priority [citing United States v. Gilbert Associates,
345 U. S. 361; United States v. Waddill, Holland& Flinn,
323 U. S. 353]. Where the debtor is not insolvent,
Congress has failed to expressly provide for federal priority . . . although the United States is free to pursue

the whole of the debtor's property wherever situated."
United States v. New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, 85.
It is undisputed that the State's lien here meets the test
laid down in New Britain that "the identity of the lienor,
the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the
lien are established." 347 U. S., at 84. Moreover, unlike
those cases in which the Security Trust rationale was
applied to subordinate liens on the ground that judgment
had not been obtained prior to the time the federal lien
8 Indeed, this Court has repeatedly reserved the question whether
the priority given the United States by R. S. § 3466 can be overcome
even by a prior specific and perfected lien. United States v. Gilbert
Associates, 345 U. S. 361, 365; Illinois v. Campbell, 329 U. S. 362,
370; United States v. Waddill Co., 323 U. S. 353, 355-356; United
States v. Texas, 314 U. S. 480, 484-486; New York v. Maclay, 288
U. S. 290, 294; Spokane County v. United States, 279 U. S. 80, 95.

arose,"° it is as true of Vermont's lien here 11 as it was of
the federal lien in New Britain that "The assessment is
given the force of a judgment, and if the amount assessed
is not paid when due, administrative officials may seize the
debtor's property to satisfy the debt." Bull v. United
States, 295 U. S. 247, 260.12
For these reasons, we hold that this antecedent state
lien arising under a statute modeled after §§ 6321 and
6322 is sufficiently choate to obtain priority over the later
federal lien arising under those provisions. Accordingly,
the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
