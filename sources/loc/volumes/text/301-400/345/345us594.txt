APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.*
Argued March 11, 1953.-Decided May 25, 1953.

A publishing company owns and publishes in New Orleans a morning
and an evening newspaper. Its sole competitor in the daily newspaper field is an independent evening newspaper. Classified and
general display advertisers in the company's publications may purchase only combined insertions appearing in both its morning and
evening papers, not in either separately. The United States brought
a civil suit against the company under the Sherman Act, challenging the use of these "unit" contracts as an unreasonable restraint
of trade in'violation of § 1, and as an attempt to monopolize trade
in violation of § 2. Held: The record in this case does not establish
the charged violations of § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act. Pp.
596-628.
(a) The challenged activities of the company constitute interstate commerce within the meaning of the Sherman Act. P. 602,
n. 11.
(b) A "tying" arrangement violates § 1 of the Sherman Act when
a seller enjoys a monopolistic position in the market for the "tying"
product and a substantial volume of commerce in the "tied"
product is restrained. InternationalSalt Co. v. United States, 332
U. S.392. Pp. 608-609.
(c) Since the charge against the company was not of tying
sales to its readers but only to buyers of general and classified
space in its papers, dominance in the New Orleans newspaper
advertising market, not in the readership, is the decisive factor in
determining the legality of the company's unit plan. P. 610.
(d) Section 2 of the Sherman Act outlaws monopolization of
any ''appreciable part" of interstate commerce, and § 1 bans unreasonable restraints irrespective of the amount of commerce involved.
P. 611.
(e) The essence of illegality in tying agreements is the wielding
of monopolistic leverage; a seller exploits his dominant position

in one market to expand into another. Solely for testing the
strength of that lever, the whole and not part of a relevant market
must be assigned controlling weight. P. 611.
(f) The company's morning newspaper did not enjoy in the
newspaper advertising market in New Orleans that position of
"dominance" which, together with a "not insubstantial" volume of
trade in the "tied" product, would result in a Sherman Act offense
under the rule of InternationalSalt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S.
392. Pp. 608-613.
(g) The common core of the adjudicated unlawful tying arrangements is the forced purchase of a second distinct commodity with
the desired purchase of a dominant "tying" product, resulting in
economic harm to competition in the "tied" market. Pp. 613-614.
(h) In the absence of evidence demonstrating two distinct commodities sold by the publishing company, neither the rationale nor
the doctrines of the "tying" cases can dispose of the company's
advertising contracts challenged here. they must therefore be
tested under the Sherman Act's general prohibition on unreasonable
restraints of trade. Pp. 613-615.
(i) The inquiry to determine reasonableness under § 1 in this
case must focus on the percentage of business controlled, the
strength of the competition, and whether the challenged activity
springs from business requirements or from purpose to monopolize.
P. 615.
(j) The factual data in the record in this case do not demonstrate
that the company's advertising contracts unduly handicapped the
existing competing newspaper. Pp. 615-622.
(k) The Government has proved in this case neither actual
unlawful effects nor facts which radiate a potential for future
harm. P. 622.
(1) While even otherwise reasonable trade arrangements must
fall if conceived to achieve forbidden ends, the company's adoption
of the unit plan in this case was predominantly motivated by
legitimate business aims. P. 622.
(m) Although emulation of a comiipetitor's, illegal plan does not
justify an unlawful trade practice, that factor is relevant in determining intent, particularly when planned injury to that competitor
is the crux of the charge of Sherman Act violation. P. 623.
(n) Although long-tolerated trade arrangements acquire no
vested immunity under the Sherman Act, that consideration is
relevant when monopolistic purpose rather than effect is to be
gauged. Pp. 623-624.

OCTOBER TERM, 1952.

(o) The record in this case shows neither unlawful effects nor
aims. Pp. 615-624.
(p) The company's refusal to sell advertising space except
en bloc, viewed alone, in the circumstances of this case, does not
constitute a violation of the Sherman Act. Pp. 624-626.
(q) A specific intent to destroy competition or to build monopoly is essential to guilt of an attempt to monopolize in violation
of § 2 of the Sherman Act, and such intent is not established by
the record in this case. Pp. 626-627.

advertising in its publications may purchase only combined insertions appearing in both the morning and evening papers, and not in either separately.1 The United
States filed a civil suit under the Sherman Act, challenging these "unit" or "forced combination" contracts as
unreasonable restraints of interstate trade, banned by § 1,
and as tools in an attempt to monopolize a segment of
interstate commerce, in violation of § 2.2 After intensive
trial of the facts, the District Court found violations of

general display advertisers alternatively may insert in a combination
of either daily paper with the Su-Nlay paper. Additionally, the Company's unit plan for classified advertising excludes some advertising,
known as "over-the-river" classified, placed from a small local area.
As neither the parties nor' the District Court attached any significance to these exceptions to the challenged unit rates for general
display and classified advertising space in the Publishing Company's
daily papers, we mention them solely for completeness.

both sections of the law and entered a decree enjoining
the Publishing Company's use of these unit contracts and
related arrangements for the marketing of advertising
space.' In No. 374, the Publishing Company appeals
the merits of the District Court's holding under the Sherman Act; the Government, in No. 375, seeks relief broader
than the District Court's decree. Both appeals come
directly here under the Expediting Act.4
Testimony in a voluminous record retraces a history
of over twenty-five years.5 Prior to 1933, four daily
newspapers served New Orleans. The Item Company,
Ltd., published the Morning Tribune and the evening
Item. The morning Times-Picayune was published by
its present owners, and the Daily States Publishing Company, Ltd., an independent organization, distributed the
evening States. in 1933, the Times-Picayune Publishing Company purchased the name, good will, circulation,
and advertising contracts of the States, and continued
to publish it evenings. The Morning Tribune of the
Item Co., Ltd., suspended publication in 1941. Today
the Times-Picayune, Item, and States remain the sole
significant newspaper media for the dissemination of news
and advertising to the residents of New Orleans.
The Times-Picayune Publishing Company distributes
the leading newspaper in the area, the Times-Picayune.
The 1933 acquisition of the States did not include its
plant and other physical assets; since the States' absorption the Publishing Company has utilized facilities at a
single plant for printing and distributing the TimesPicayune and the States. Unified financial, purchasing,

segment of personnel servicing both publications, results
in further joint operation. Although both publications
adhere to a single general editorial policy, distinct features
and format differentiate the morning Times-Picayune
from the evening States. 1950 data reveal a daily average circulation of 188,402 for the Times-Picayune, 114,660
for the Item, and 105,235 for the States. The TimesPicayune thus sold nearly as many copies as the
circulation of the Item and States together.
Each of these New Orleans publications sells advertising in various forms. Three principal classes of advertising space are sold: classified, general, and local
display. Classified advertising, known as "want ads,"
includes individual insertions under various headings;
general, also called national, advertising typically comprises displays by national manufacturers. or wholesale
distributors of brand-name goods; local, or retail, display
generally publicizes bargains by local merchants 'selling
directly to the public. From 1924 until the Morning
Tribune's demise in 1941, the Item Company sold classified advertising space solely on the unit plan by which advertisers paid a single rate for identical insertions appearing in both the morning and evening papers and could not
purchase space in either alone. After the Times-Picayune
Publishing Company acquired the States in 1933, it
offered general advertisers an optional plan by which
space combined in both publications could be bought for
less than the sum of the separate rates for each. Two
years later it adopted the unit plan of its competitor, the
Item Co., Ltd., in selling space for classified ads. General
advertisers in the Publishing Company's newspapers
were also availed volume discounts since 1940, but had
to combine insertions in both publications in order to
qualify for the substantial discounts on purchases of more
than 10,000 lines per year. Local display ads as early
as 1935 were marketed Under a still effective volume

discount system which for determining the discount
bracket in the States permitted cumulation of linage
placed in the Times-Picayune as well. In 1950, however, the Publishing Company eliminated all optional
plans for general advertisers, and instituted the unit
plan theretofore applied solely to classified ads. As a
result, since 1950 general and classified advertisers cannot buy space in either the Times-Picayune or the States
alone, but must insert identical copy in both or none.
Against that practice the Government levels its attack
grounded on §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.
After the District Court at the outset denied the Government's motion for partial summary judgment holding
the unit contracts per se violations of § 1, the case went to
trial and eventuated in comprehensive and detailed
findings of fact: ' The Times-Picayune and the States,
though published by a single publisher, were two distinct
newspapers with individual format, news and feature content, reaching separate reader groups in New Orleans.
The Times-Picayune, the sole local morning daily which
for twenty years outdistanced the States and Item in circulation, published pages, and advertising linage, was
the "dominant" newspaper in New Orleans; insertions
in that paper were deemed essential by advertisers desiring to cover the local market. Although the local
publishing field permits entry by additional competitors,
the Item today is the sole effective daily competition
which the Times-Picayune Publishing Company's two
newspapers must meet. -On the other hand, their quest
for advertising linage encounters the competition of
other media, such as radio, television, and magazines.
Nevertheless, the District Court determined, the adoption of unit selling caused a substantial rise in classified and general advertising linage placed in the States,

Opinion of the Court.

enabling it to enhance its comparative position toward
the Item. The District Court found, moreover, that the
defendants had instituted the unit system, economically
enforceable against buyers solely because of the TimesPicayune's "dominant" or "monopoly position," in order
to "restrain general and classified advertisers from making an untrammeled choice between the States and the
Item in purchasing advertising space, and also to substantially diminish the competitive vigor of the Item."'
On the basis of these findings, the District Judge held
the unit contracts in violation of the Sherman Act. The
contracts were viewed as tying arrangements which the
Publishing Company because of the Times-Picayune's
"monopoly position" could force upon advertisers
Postulating that contracts foreclosing competitors from
a substantial part of the market restrain trade within the
meaning of § 1 of the Act, and that effect on competition
tests the reasonableness of a restraint, the court deemed
a substantial percentage of advertising accounts in the
New Orleans papers unlawfully "restrained." I Further,
a violation of § 2 was found: defendants by use of the
unit plan "attempted to monopolize that segment of the
afternoon newspaper general and classified advertising
field which was represented by those advertisers who also
required morning newspaper space and who could not
because of budgetary limitations or financial inability
purchase space in both afternoon newspapers." 10
Injunctive relief was accordingly decreed. The District Court enjoined the Times-Picayune Publishing
Company from (A) selling advertising space in any newspaper published by it "upon the condition, expressed or
implied, that the purchaser of such space will contract for

or purchase advertising space in any other newspaper
published by it"; (B) refusing to sell advertising space
separately in each newspaper which it publishes; (C)
using its "dominant position" in the morning field "to
sell any newspaper advertising at rates lower than those
approximating either (1) the cost of producing and selling such advertising or (2) comparable newspaper advertising rates in New Orleans." Hence these appeals."
The daily newspaper, though essential to the effective
functioning of our political system, has in recent years
suffered drastic economic decline. A vigorous and
dauntless press is a chief source feeding the flow of democratic expression and controversy which maintains the
institutions of a free society. Associated Press v. United
States, 326 U. S. 1, 20 (1945); cf. Wieman v. Updegrafl,
344 U. S. 183, 191 (1952); Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343
U. S. 495, 501 (1952). By interpreting to the citizen the
policies of his government and vigilantly scrutinizing the
official conduct of those who administer the state, an
independent press stimulates free discussion and focuses
public opinion on issues and officials as a potent check
on arbitrary action or abuse. Cf. Grosjean v. American
Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, 250 (1936); Near v. Minnesota,
283 U. S. 697, 716-718 (1931). The press, in fact, "serves
one of the most vital of all general interests: the dissemination of news from as many different sources, and with

in this case are sufficiently "trade or commerce" relating to the interstate economy to fall under the wide sweep of the Sherman Act. Cf.,

States v. National Assn. of Real Estate Boards, 339 U. S. 485 (1950);

as many different facets and colors as is possible. That
interest is closely akin to, if indeed it is not the same as,
the interest protected by the First Amendment; it presupposes that right conclusions are more likely to be
gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any
kind of authoritative selection. To many this is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all." 12
Yet today, despite the vital task that in our society the
press performs, the number of daily newspapers in the
United States is at its lowest point since the century's
turn: in 1951, 1,773 daily newspapers served 1,443 American cities, compared with 2,600 dailies published in 1,207
Moreover, while 598 new dailies
cities in the year 1909.'
braved the field between 1929 and 1950, 373 of these suspended publication during that period-less than half of
the new entrants survived.' 4 Concurrently, daily newspaper competition within individual cities has grown
nearly extinct: in 1951, 81% of all daily newspaper cities
had only one daily paper; 11% more had two or more
publications, but a single publisher controlled both or
all. 1 In that year, therefore, only 8% of daily newspaper
cities enjoyed the clash of opinion Which competition
among publishers of their daily press could provide.

OCTOBER TERM, 1952.
Opinion of the Court.

345 U. S.

Advertising is the economic mainstay of the newspaper
business. Generally, more than two-thirds of a newspaper's total revenues flow from the sale of advertising
space. Local display advertising brings in about 44% of
revenues; general-14%; classified-13% ; circulation, almost the rest.'" Obviously, newspapers must sell advertising to survive. And while newspapers in 1929 garnered
79% of total national advertising expenditures, by 1951
other mass media had cut newspapers' share down to
34.7%." When the Times-Picayune Publishing Company in 1949 announced its forthcoming institution of
unit selling to general advertisers, about 180 other publishers of morning-evening newspapers had previously
adopted the unit plan.'8 Of the 598 daily newspapers
which broke into publication between 1929 and 1950,
38% still published when that period closed. Forty-six
of these entering dailies, however, encountered the competition of established dailies which utilized unit rates;
significantly, by 1950, of these 46, 41 had collapsed.'"
Thus a newcomer in the daily newspaper business could
calculate his chances of survival as 11% in cities where
unit plans had taken hold. Viewed against the background of rapidly declining competition in the daily
newspaper business, such a trade practice becomes suspect
under the Sherman Act.

Id., at 977. Some small dailies also derive income from miscel-

laneous sources Such as job printing.

In this case the District Court

found that advertising and circulation accounted for approximately

Opinion of the Court.

Tying arrangements, we may readily agree, flout the
Sherman Act's policy that competition rule the marts of
trade. Basic to the faith that a free economy best promotes the public weal is that goods must stand the cold
test of competition; that the public, acting through the
market's impersonal judgment, shall allocate the Nation's
resources and thus direct the course its economic development will take. Yet "[t]ying agreements serve hardly
any purpose beyond the suppression of competition."
StandardOil Go. of Californiav. United.States,337 U. S.
293, 305 (1949).20 By conditioning his sale of one commodity on the purchase of another, a seller coerces the
abdication of buyers' independent judgment as to the
"tied" product's merits and insulates it from the competitive stresses of the open market. But any intrinsic superiority of the "tied" product would convince freely
choosing buyers to select it over others, anyway. Thus
"[iln the usual case only the prospect of reducing competition would persuade a seller to adopt such a contract
and only his control of the supply of the tying device,
whether conferred by patent monopoly or otherwise obtained, could induce a buyer to enter one." Id., at 306.
Conversely, the effect on competing sellers attempting to
rival the "tied" product is drastic: to the extent the
enforcer of the tying arrangement enjoys market control,
other existing or potential sellers are foreclosed from offering up their goods to a free competitive judgment; they
are effectively excluded from the marketplace.

Opinion of the Court.

345 U. S.

For that reason, tying agreements fare harshly under
the laws forbidding restraints of trade. Federal Trade
Commission v. Gratz, 253 U. S. 421 (1920), decided that
a complaint which charged a seller with conditioning his
sale of steel ties on purchases of jute bagging did not, because it failed to allege his monopolistic purpose or market
control, state an actionable "unfair method of competition" within the meaning of § 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act. 2' United Shoe Machinery Corp. v.
United States, 258 U. S. 451 (1922), - held, however, that
a seller occupying a "dominant position" in the shoe
machinery industry, without more, violated § 3 of the
Clayton Act by contracts tying to the lease of his machines the purchase of other types of machinery and
incidental supplies. 3 Potential lessening of competition,
requisite to illegality under § 3, was automatically inferred from the seller's "dominating position." Id., at
21

"Unfair

methods of competition in commerce

are hereby

declared unlawful." 15 U. S. C. § 45. In the Gratz case, decided
on a point of pleading, the Court observed that the "complaint

contains no intimation that Warren, Jones & Gratz did not properly
obtain their ties and bagging as merchants usually do; the amount
controlled by them is not stated; nor is it alleged that they held a
monopoly of either ties or bagging or had ability, purpose or intent
to acquire one." 253 U. S., at 428. "All question of monopoly or
combination," therefore, was "out of the way." Ibid.

other commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor

Opinion of the Court.

457-458.- Federal Trade Commission v. Sinclair Refining Co., 261 U. S. 463 (1923), extended the principles
of Gratz to the Clayton Act; purchases of gasoline were
tied to the lease of pumps at nominal rates, but neither
monopolistic purpose or power nor potential harm to

competition was shown. And, in any event, the "tie"
was voluntary since buyers could take the gasoline
without taking the pumps. Id., at 474-475. Indeed, the
arrangement merely prevented lessees from dispensing

other types of gasoline through the lessor's brand pumps
and was thus viewed as a means of protecting the good-

will of the lessor's branded gas.

See also Pick Mfg. Co. v.

General Motors Corp., 299 U. S. 3 (1936)."4
The bounds
of th-t doctrine were drawn by International Business
Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U. S. 131 (1936).

When competing sellers could meet the specifications of
the "tied" product, in that case tabulating cards hitched
by contract to the sale of computing machines, § 3 of the

Clayton Act outlawed the tying arrangement because the
''substantial" amount of commerce in the "tied" product
or seller, where th effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or
such condition, agreement, or understanding may be to substantially
lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce." 15 U. S. C. § 14.
That section relates to simple exclusive dealing arrangements, cf.,
e. g., Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, 337 U S. 293
(1949), not involved in this case, as well as to tying sales. For purposes of the Clayton Act, the requisite condition not to deal in the
goods of another may be inferred from the practical effects of
the tying arrangement. International Business Machines Corp. v.

indicated potential lessening of competition as a result.
Id., at 136, 139.25
With its decision in International Salt Co. v. United
States, 332 U. S.392 (1947), this Court wove the strands
of past cases into the law's present pattern. There
leases of patented machines for dispensing industrial salt
were conditioned on the lessees' purchase of the lessor's
salt. A unanimous Court affirmed summary judgment
adjudicating the arrangement unlawful under § 3 of the
Clayton Act and § 1 of the Sherman Act as well. The
patents on their face conferred monopolistic, albeit lawful, market control, and the volume of salt affected by the
tying practice was not "insignificant or insubstantial."
Id., at 396. Clayton Act violation followed as a matter
of course from the doctrines evolved in prior "tying"
cases. See also Standard Oil Co. of Californiav. United
States, 337 U. S.293, 304-306, 305, nn. 7-8. And since
the Court deemed it "unreasonable, per se, to foreclose
competitors from any substantial market," neither could
the tying arrangement survive § 1 of the Sherman Act.
332 U. S., at 396. That principle underpinned the decisions in the.Movie cases, holding unlawful the "blockbooking" of copyrighted films by lessors, United States v.
Paramount Pictures, 334 U. S. 131, 156-159 (1948), as
well as a buyer's wielding of lawful monopoly power in
one market to coerce concessions that handicapped competition facing him in another. United States v. Griffith,
334 U. S. 100, 106-108 (1948). From the "tying" cases a
perceptible pattern of illegality emerges: When the seller
enjoys a monopolistic position in the market for the
"tying" product, or if a substantial volume of commerce
in the "tied" product is restrained, a tying arrangement violates the narrower standards expressed in § 3 of

the Clayton Act because from either factor the requisite
potential lessening of competition is inferred. And because for even a lawful monopolist it is "unreasonable,
per se, to foreclose competitors from any substantial market," a tying arrangement is banned by § 1 of the Sherman Act whenever both conditions are met.2-1 In either
case, the arrangement transgresses § 5 of the Federal
Trade Commission Act, since minimally that section registers violations of the Clayton and Sherman Acts. Federal Trade Commission v. Motion Picture Advertising
Service Co., 344 U. S. 392, 395 (1953); Federal Trade
Commission v. Cement Institute, 333 U. S.683, 690-694
(1948); Fashion Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade
Commission, 312 U. S. 457, 463 (1941).
In this case, the rule of International Salt can apply
only if both its ingredients are met. The Government
at the outset elected to proceed not under the Clayton
but the Sherman Act.2' While the Clayton Act's more
specific standards illuminate the public policy which the
Sherman Act was designed to subserve, e. g., United States
26 Dealing with a monopolization offense under Sherman Act § 2,
a charge not raised- or considered here, the Court in United States v.
Griffith, 334 U. S.100, 106-108 (1948), pointedly observed: "Anyone
who owns and operates the single theatre in a town, or who acquires
the exclusive right to exhibit a film, has a monopoly in the popular
sense. But he usually does not violate § 2 of the Sherman Act
unless he has acquired or maintained his strategic position, or sought
to expand his monopoly, or expanded it by means of those restraints
of trade which are cognizable under § 1.. . . [T]he use of monopoly
power, however lawfully acquired, to foreclose competition, to gain
a competitive advantage, or to destroy a competitor, is unlawful. . . . If monopoly power can be used to beget monopoly, the
Act becomes a feeble instrument indeed." See also Levi, A Two
Level Anti-Monopoly Law, 47 Northwestern U. L. Rev. 567, 580-585
.(1952).
27 On oral argument here, the Government explanatorily referred
to an early informal Federal Trade Commission opinion to the effect
that advertising space was not a "commodity" within the meaning

Once granted that the volume of commerce affected was
not "insignificant or insubstantial," 8 the Times-Picayune's market position becomes critical to the case. The
District Court found that the Times-Picayune occupied a
"dominant position" in New Orleans; the sole morning
daily in the area, it led its competitors in circulation,
number of -pages and advertising linage. But every
newspaper is a dual trader in separate though interdependent markets; it sells the paper's news and advertising
content to its readers; in effect that readership is in turn
sold to the buyers of advertising space. This case concerns solely one of these markets. The Publishing Company stands accused not of tying sales to its readers but
only to buyers of general and classified space in its papers.
For this reason, dominance in the advertising market, not
in readership, must be decisive in gauging the legality of
the Company's unit plan. Cf. Lorain Journal v. United
States, 342 U. S. 143, 149-150, 152-153 (1951); United
of § 2 of the Clayton Act (cf. note 23, supra). 81 Cong. Ree. App.

Co., 72 F. 2d 761 (1934); United States v. Investors Diversified
Services, 102 F. Supp. 645 (1951). We express no views on that
statutory interpretation. Compare note 11, supra.
28 The District Court in this case did not find the volume of
commerce affected by the restraint, but determined solely that a
substantial percentage of advertising accounts in New Orleans papers
was restrained by the Publishing Company's unit 'plan. Fdg. 30;
cf. Fdg. 22. In view of our disposition of this case we may assume,
though not deciding, that the Sherman Act's substantiality test was
met.

U. S. 268, 278-279 (1934).
The "market," as most concepts in law or economics,
cannot be measured by metes and bounds. Nor does the
substance of Sherman Act violations typically depend on
so flexible a guide. Section 2 outlaws monopolization
of any "appreciable part" of interstate commerce, and
by § 1 unreasonable restraints are banned irrespective of
the amount of commerce involved. Lorain Journal v.
United States, supra, at 151, n. 6; United Slates v. Paramount Pictures, supra, at 173; United States v. Yellow
Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218, 225-226 (1947)." 9 But the essence of illegality in tying agreements is the wielding of
monopolistic leverage; a seller exploits his dominant position in one market to expand his empire into the next.
Solely for testing the strength of that lever, the whole
and not part of a relevant market must be assigned controlling weight. Cf. United States v. ColumbiaSteel Co.,
supra, at 524.
We do not think that the Times-Picayune occupied a
"dominant" position in the newspaper advertising miarket
in New Orleans. Unlike other "tying" cases where patents or copyrights supplied the requisite market control,
any equivalent market "dominance" in this case must
rest on comparative marketing data. 0 Excluding ad20 See also United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.. 310 U. S. 150,

vertising placed through other communications media
and including general and classified linage inserted in
all New Orleans dailies, as we must since the record
contains no evidence which could circumscribe a broader
or'narrower "market" defined by buyers' habits or mobility of demand," the Times-Picayune's sales of both
general and classified linage over the years hovered
around 40%." Obviously no magic inheres in numbers;
"the relative effect of-percentage command of a market
varies with the setting in which that factor is placed."
United States v. Columbia Steel Co., supra, at 528; cf.
United States v. National Lead Co., 332 U. S. 319, 352353 (1947).

If each of the New Orleans publications

shared equally in the total volume of linage, the TimesPicayune would have sold 33%3%; in the absence of patent
or copyright control, the small existing increment in the
circumstances here disclosed "scannot confer that market
31For every product, substitutes exist. But a relevant market
cannot meaningfully encompass that infinite range. The circle must
be drawn narrowly to exclude any other product to which, within
reasonable variations in price, only a limited number of buyers will
turn; in technical terms, products whose "cross-elasticities of demand" are small. Useful to that determination is, among other things,
the trade's own characterization of the products involved. The
advertising industry and its customers, for example, markedly differentiate between advertising in newspapers and in other mass
media. See, e. g., Frey, Advertising (2d ed. 1953), cc. 12, 15; Duffy,
Advertising Media and Markets (2d ed. 1951), cc. 3, 4; Hepner,
Effective Advertising, c. 20 (1949); Borden, Taylor and Hovde,

"dominance" which, in conjunction with a "not insubstantial" volume of trade in the "tied" product, would
result in a Sherman Act offense under the rule of
International Salt.
Yet another consideration vitiates the applicability of
International Salt. The District Court determined that
the Times-Picayune and the States were separate and
distinct newspapers, though published under single
ownership and cdntrol. But that readers consciously dis-tinguished between these two publications does not necessarily imply that adver':sers bought separate and distinct
products when insertions were placed in the Times-Picayune and the States. So to conclude here would involve
speculation that advertisers bought space motivated by
considerations other than customer coverage; that their
media selections, in effect, rested on generic qualities differentiating morning from evening readers in New Orleans. Although advertising space in the Times-Picayune, as the sole morning daily, was doubtless essential
to blanket coverage of the local newspaper readership,
nothing in the record suggests that advertisers viewed
the city's newspaper readers, morning or evening, as
other than fungible customer potential."
We must
assume, therefore, that the readership "bought" by advertisers in the Times-Picayune was the selfsame "product" sold by the States and, for that matter, the Item.
lesser share than here is ringed by numerous smaller satellites together
accounting for the rest, his mastery of the market is greater than were
he facing fierce rivalry of other large sellers. Cf. United States v.
National Lead Co., 332 U. S. 319, 346-348, 352-353 (1947); United
States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U. S. 495, 527-528 (1948). Fewness
of sellers, on the other hand, may facilitate concerted action. See
Fellner, Competition Among the Few (1949), passim; Stigler, The
Theory of Price, 228 et seq. (Rev. ed. 1952).
-" In fact, a survey (R. 1484) in 1940 disclosed that 27.6% of
States home carrier subscribers subscribed to the Times-Picayune by
home carrier as well.

The factual departure from the "tying" cases then becomes manifest. The common core of the adjudicated
unlawful tying arrangements is the forced purchase of
a second distinct commodity with the desired purchase oi
a'dominant "tying" product, resulting in economic harm
to competition in the "tied" market. Here, however, two
newspapers under single ownership at the same place,
time, and terms sell indistinguishable products to advertisers; no dominant "tying" product exists (in fact, since
space in neither the Times-Picayune nor the States can
be bought alone, one may be viewed as "tying" as the.
other); no leverage in one market excludes sellers in
the second, because for present purposes the products
are identical and'the market the same. Cf. Standard
Oil Co. (Indiana) v. United States, 283 U. S. 163, 176178 (1931); United States v. Aluminum Co. of America,
148 F. 2d 416, 424 (1945); compare Indiana Farmer's
Guide Pub. Co. v. Prairie Farmer Pub. Co., 293 U. S.
268, 278-280 (1934). In short, neither the rationale nor
the doctrines evolved by the "tying" cases can dispose of
the Publishing Company's arrangements challenged here.
The Publishing Company's advertising contracts must
thus be tested under the Sherman Act's general prohibition on unreasonable restraints of trade. For purposes of § 1, "[a] restraint may be unreasonable either because a restraint otherwise reasonable is accompanied
with a specific intent to accomplish a forbidden restraint
or because it falls within the class of restraints that are
illegal per se." United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334
U. S. 495, 522 (1948). Since the requisite intent is inferred whenever unlawful effects are found, United States
v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100, 105, 108 (1948); United States
v. Patten, 226 U. S. 525, 543 (1913), and the rule of InternationalSalt is out of the way, the contracts may yet
be banned by § 1 if unreasonable restraint was either their
object or effect. Although these unit contracts do not in

express terms preclude buyers from purchasing additional
space in competing newspapers, the Act deals with competitive realities, not words. United States v. Masonite
Corp., 316 U. S. 265, 280 (1942). Thus, while we "do not
think this concession relieves the contract of being a restraint of trade, albeit a less harsh one" than otherwise,
InternationalSalt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392, 397
(1947); see United States v. Paramount Pictures, 334
U. S. 131, 156--18 (1948)," the "open end" feature of the
contracts here minimizes the restraint. For our inquiry to
determine reasonableness under § 1 must focus on "the
percentage of business controlled, the strength of the
remaining competition [and] whether the action springs
from business requirements or purpose to monopolize."
334 U. S., at 527; compare Standard Oil Co. of California
v. United States, 337 U. S. 293, 312-313 (1949).
The record is replete with relevant statistical data.
The volume discounts available to local display buyers
were not held unlawful by the District Court, and the
Government does not assail the practice here. That segment of advertising linage, by far the largest revenue
producer of the three linage. classes sold by all New Orleans newspapers," is thus eliminated from consideration.
15 In InternationalSalt, the lessor's tying arrangement permitted
the lessee's purchase of the "tied" product in the open market when.
ever the lessor declined to match the going market price. That, this
Cofirt thought, "does not avoid the stifling effect of the agreement
on competition. The [lessor] had at all times a priority on the
business at equal prices." 332 U. S., at 397. And the "blockbooking" found unlawful in the Pararnountcase did not, of course,
impose any express restrictions on licensees desiring to acquire additional films elsewhere. In fact, by specifying that a particular
amount of the "tied" product he taken and that. amount eovers the
buyer's total requirements, a tying arrangement may achieve a result
equivalbnt to total exclusion of other sellers without the formality
of expressly saying so. See also note 23, supra.

evenly matched, the Times-Picayune over the years
steadily increased its lead. That Company sold 3.52
million lines in 1938, and 3.76 in 1939; the Item Company
totaled 2.23 and 2.18, respectively. In fact, the TimesPicayune Publishing Company in every year but 1938
advanced its linage total; .since 1936 the Item Company's totals declined yearly, solely excepting 1940.
At the end of that year the Item Company's Morning
Tribune suspended publication, "' a new local competitive
structure took form. In that firstyear the Item, as sole
competitor of the Times-Picayune Company's two dailies,
sold 1.23 million lines of classified linage, compared with
2.09 million for the Times-Picayune and 2.08 for the
States; the Item's share thus accounted for roughly 23%
of the total. Ten years later the Item's share had declined to approximately 20%: in 1950 it sold 2.17 million
lines, compared with the Times-Picayune Publishing
Company's total linage of 8.91 million, comprising 4.36
million for the Times-Picayune and 4.55 for the States.
Measured against the evening States alone, the Item's
percentage attrition is comparable. In 1941 it sold 37%
of the two evening papers' total linage; by 1950 that
share had declined to 32%. Thus, over a period of ten
years' competition while facing its morning-evening rival's
compulsory unit rate the New Orleans Item's share of
the New Orleans classified linage market declined 3%;
viewed solely in relation to its evening competitor, its
percentage loss amounted to 5%.

general display linage was instituted to become effective

general display advertising showed a New Orleans
total volume of 7.37 million lines, roughly apportioned
as 2.96 million in the Times-Picayune, 2.55 million in the
States, and 1.85 million in the Item; the Publishing Company's share had risen to 75%. Compared with the
States alone, the Item in 1949 accounted for 49% of the
two evening papers' total; in 1950, that had declined
to 42%.
In that year, a reallocation of advertising accounts also
took place."
In 1949, 23.7% of general display advertisers utilized the Times-Picayune Publishing Company's
publications exclusively; one year later that percentage
had risen to 41%. Concurrently, however, accounts advertising solely in the Times-Picayune declined from
22.7% to 5.8%, and sole advertisers in the States dropped
from 2% to .4%. On the other hand, in 1950 10.6%,
compared with 9.6% the year before, of general display
accounts inserted solely in the Item; and the segment of
advertising accounts inserting in all three publications
rose from 30.4% in 1949 to 39% in the following year.
In fact, while in 1949 only 51.6% of general display accounts utilized the Item either exclusively or in conjunction with other New Orleans dailies, one year later 52.8%
of the accounts so patronized the Item.
The record's factual data, in sum, do not demonstrate
that the Publishing Company's advertising contracts unduly handicapped its extant competitor, the Item. In
the early years when four-cornered newspaper competition for classified linage prevailed in New Orleans, the
ascendancy of the Publishing Company's papers over
their morning-evening competitor soon became manifest.

from the Times-Picayune Company's rise and the Item
Company's decline. With the Morning Tribune's demise
in 1940, the market shrank but the pattern remained.
The Item continued its gradually declining share of the
market, though in fact the Times-Picayune's unit rate
for "classified" between 1940 and 1950 coincided with a
reversal of the trend marking the Item's absolute volume
decline. Even less competitive hurt is discernible from
the Publishing Company's unit rate for general display
linage. True, in the single recorded year of its existence
the combination plan did diminish by 7% the Item's
share of linage if measured solely against the States.
Versus the linage sold by the Publishing Company in
its two newspapers, however, the Item's share of the total
market declined but 2%. That apparent incongruity is
simply explained: Compared with 1949 monthly volume
data, the unit rate in each of the 11 months of its operation in 1950 drew linage away from the Times-Picayune
and toward the States." In effect, the Publishing Company's unit plan merely reallocated the linage sold by
its two constituent papers. And not only did the unit
plan take from the Times-Picayune and give to the
States. Apparently it also led more advertisers to insert
in the Item, which sold general display space to a proportionately greater number of accounts in 1950 than in
1949.
Meanwhile the Item flourishes. The ten years preceding thistrial marked its more than 75% growth in classified linage. Between 1946 and 1950 its general display
volume increased almost 25%. The Item's local display
linage is twice the equivalent linage in the States."
And 1950, the Item's peak year for total linage comprising all three classes of advertising, marked its greatest

circulation in history as well. In fact, since in newspapers of the Item's circulation bracket general display
and classified linage typically provide no more than
32% of total revenues, the demonstrated diminution of
its New Orleans market shares in these advertising classes
might well not have resulted in revenue losses exceeding
17." Moreover, between 1943 and 1949 the Item earned
over $1.4 million net before taxes, enabling its then publisher in the latter year to transfer his equity at a net
profit of $600,000. The Item, the alleged victim of the
Times-Picayune Company's challenged trade practices,
appeared, in short, to be doing well.
The record in this case thus does not disclose evidence
from which demonstrably deleterious effects on competition may be inferred. To be sure, economic statistics are easily susceptible to legerdemain, and only the
organized context of all relevant factors can validly translate raw data into logical cause and effect. But we must
take the record as we find it, and hack through the jungle
as best we can. It may well be that any enhancement
of the Times-Picayune's market position during the
period of the assailed arrangements resulted from better
For the average daily newspaper of greater than 100,000 circulation, a 1951 industry survey revealed the following typical percentage
sources of total revenues (Editor & Publisher, April 12, 1952, p. 74):

37.24%

A 3% decline in classified advertising, accounting for 14.6% of total
revenues, and a 2% loss in general display, responsible for 16.98%
of revenues, would amount to a total revenue loss of .78%. Compare Federal Trade Commission v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U. S. 37

initiative or managerial skills; 44conversely, it is equally
possible that but for the adoption of the unit contracts
its market position might have turned for the worse.
Nor can we be certain that the challenged practice,
though not destructive of existing competition, did not
abort yet unborn competitors equally within the concern
of the Sherman Act. See United States v. Griffith, 334
U. S. 100, 107 (1948); American Tobacco Co. v. United
States, 328 U. S. 781, 814 (1946); Associated Press v.
United States, 326 U. S. 1, 13 (1945). But this suit was
not brought to adjudicate a trade practice as banned by
specific statutory prohibitions which by a clearly defined
public policy dispense with difficult standards of economic
proof. Compare Standard Oil Co. of Californiav. United
States, 337 U. S. 293, 311-313 (1949). Arid the case
has not met the per se criteria of Sherman Act § 1 from
which proscribed effect automatically must be inferred.
Cf. InternationalSalt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392

against unreasonable trade restraints, guilt cannot rest
on speculation; the Government here has proved neither
actual unlawful effects nor facts which radiate a potential

Times-Picayune Publishing Company's milline rates (cost to advertisers of one agate line per million circulation) ranged roughly from
$2.14 to $1.96, compared to the Item's corresponding rates from $2.96
to $2.58. R. 296, 1115. Moreover, though no inference necessarily
flows from that fact, the Item changed ownership at least twice in
the past twenty years.

plished restraints of trade, monopolistic designs as well
as results are reached by the prohibitions of the Sherman
Act. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S.
150, 224, n. 59 (1940); United States v. Trenton Potteries
Co., 273 U. S.392, 402 (1927). The unit rate for classified advertising, however, was adopted in 1935 obviously
to counteract the competition of the Item and Morning
Tribune which confronted the Times-Picayune Publishing Company with an established unit rate. To be sure,
an unlawful trade practice may not be justified as an emulation of another's illegal plan. Cf. Federal Trade Commission v. Staley Mfg. Co., 324 U. S.746, 753-754 (1945).
But that factor is certainly relevant to illuminate ambiguous intent, particularly when planned injury to that
other competitor is the crux of the charge. In any event,
uncontradicted testimony suggests that unit insertions of
classified ads substantially reduce the publisher's overhead costs."5 Approximately thirty separate operations
are necessary to translate an advertiser's order into a
published line of print. A reasonable price for a classified ad is necessarily low. And the Publishing Company
processed about 2,300 classified ads for publication each
day. Certainly a publisher's steps to rationalize that
operation do not bespeak a purposive quest for monopoly or restraint of trade.
Similarly, competitive business considerations apparently actuated the adoption of the unit rate for general
display linage in 1950. At that time about 180 other
publishers, the vast majority of morning-evening owners,
had previously instituted similar unit plans. Doubtless,
long-tolerated trade arrangements acquire no vested immunity under the Sherman Act; no prescriptive rights

accrue by the prosecutor's delay. Cf. United States v.
Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra, at 225-228. That consideration, however, is not wholly irrelevant when monopolistic purpose rather than effect remains to be gauged.
Ibid. By adopting the unit plan for general display
linage at the time it did, the Publishing Company devised not a novel restrictive scheme but aligned itself with
the industry's guide, legal or illegal in particular cases
that is found to be. Moreover, the unit rate was viewed
as a competitive weapon in the rivalry for national advertising accounts. Lower milline rates visualized as a consequence of unit insertions might attract national linage
from advertisers utilizing newspapers in other cities, as
well as counteract a national advertisers' trend away from
*newspapers toward other mass communications media. 8
In summary, neither unlawful effects nor aims are shown
by the record."7
Consequently, no Sherman Act violation has occurred
unless the Publishing Company's refusal to sell advertis46But cf. id., at 461-464; Nixon, Concentration and Absenteeism

for advertisers' reactions to unit rates.
41 The Go ,ernment places much emphasis on a memorandum prepared by the Publishing Company's advertising representatives,
referring to the Company's adoption of the unit plan as one way "to
eliminate to a great extent the deleterious selling on the part of our
evening contemporary which in the long run is not to the best interests of the manufacturer." As pointed out by the District Court,
however, the author of the memorandum explained that "in a number
of cases . . . the advertising agencies favored the, compulsory or
unit rate, because once an agency had made its selection or its recommendation of media to the advertiser, the agency could resist any
pressure brought to make a change in media by pointing to the unit
rate as making such change impossible." 105 F. Supp., at 675-676.
That explanation accords with prevailing agency practices and attitudes. See Borden, Taylor and Hovde, National Advertising in
Newspapers, 207-212 (1946).

ing space except en bloc, viewed alone, constitutes a
violation of the Act. Refusals to sell, without more, do
not violate the law." Though group boycotts, or concerted refusals to deal, clearly run afoul of § 1, KieferStewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, 340 U. S. 211, 214 (1951) ;

the rights of an individual seller. Beginning with United

decisions have recognized individual refusals to sell as a
general right, though "neither absolute nor exempt from
regulation." Lorain Journal v. United States, 342 U. S.

or agreement, or conceived in monopolistic purpose or
market control, even individual sellers' refusals to deal

Still, although much hedged about by later cases, Colgate's
principle protects the Times-Picayune Publishing Company's simple refusal to sell advertising -space in the
Times-Picayune or States separately unless other factors
destroy the limited dispensation which that case confers.
In our view, however, no additional circumstances
bring this case within § 1. Though operating two con.stituent newspapers, the Times-Picayune is a single corporation, and the Government in the District Court
abandoned a charge of unlawful concert among the corporate officers.'0 With the advertising contracts in this
proceeding viewed as in themselves lawful and no further
elements of combination apparent in the case, § 2 criteria
must become dispositive here.
An insufficient" showing of specific intent vitiates this
part of the Government's case. While the completed offense of monopolization under § 2 demands only a general
intent to do the act, "for no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing," a specific intent to destroy
competition or 'build monopoly is essential to guilt
for the mere attempt now charged. United States v.
Aluminum Co. of America, 148. F. 2d 416, 431-432
(1945); United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100, 105

781, 814 (1946) ; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S.
375, 396 (1905). This case does not demonstrate an
attempt by a monopolist established in one area to nose
into a second market, so that past monopolistic success
both enhances the probability of future harm and supplies
a motivation for further forays. Cf. United States v.
Griffith, supra; Swift & Co. v. United States, supra.

Opinion of the Court.

And unlike Lorain Journal v. United States, 342 U. S.
143 (1951), where a single newspaper's refusal to sell
space to advertisers unless they forewent advertising
over a competing local radio station manifested "bold,
relentless, and predatory commercial behavior," id., at
149, no remotely comparable charge is borne out here.
This branch of the Government's case comprised allegations that the Publishing Company's acquisition
of the States in 1933 was one element in a cool and
calculated quest for monopoly control; that the Company deliberately operated the evening States at a financial loss to the detriment of -the competing Item; and that
it interfered with the Item's distribution on the streets of
New Orleans. The District Court,. and much evidence
supports its conclusions, determined that the 1933 purchase of the States then seemed a legitimate means of
business expansion; assumed that the Company's cost
and revenue allocations between its two publications were
mere bookkeeping transactions without economic significance; and concluded that the Company rather than
obstruct street sales of the Item merely sought to assure
equal treatment by news vendors of the Item and States.5 1
Because these pillars of the Government's § 2 case thus
collapsed in the District Court, only the adoption of the
unit rates remains to support the alleged violation of § 2
of the Sherman Act. Since we have viewed that step as
predominantly motivated by legitimate business aims,
this record cannot bear out the specific intent essential to
sustain an attempt to monopolize under § 2.
We conclude, therefore, that this record does not
establish the charged violations of § 1 and § 2 of the
Sherman Act. We do not determine that unit advertising arrangements are lawful in other circumstances or
in other proceedings. Our decision adjudicates solely

judgment must be
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BURTON,
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK,
and MR. JUSTICE MINTON join,

dissenting.
The majority opinion seeks to avoid the effect of
United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100, and of InternationalSalt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392, by taking
the position that the Times-Picayune does not enjoy a
"dominant position" in the general newspaper advertising market of New Orleans, including all three papers,
as a single market. The complaint, however, is not and
need not be dependent upon the relation of the TimesPicayune to that entire market.
The complaint is that the Times-Picayune enjoys a
distinct, conceded and complete monopoly of access to
the morning newspaper readers in the New Orleans area
and that it uses that monopoly to restrain unreasonably
the competition between its evening newspaper, the New
Orleans States, and the independent New Orleans Item,
in the competitive field of evening newspaper advertising.
Insistence by the Times-Picayune upon acceptance of its
compulsory combination advertising contracts makes
payment for, and publication of, classified and general
advertising in its own evening paper an inescapable part
of the price of access to the all-important columns of the
single morning paper. I agree with the District Court
that such conduct violates the Sherman Act under the
circumstances here presented. See also, Fed. Rules Civ.
Proc., 52 (a), "Findings of fact shall not be set aside
unless clearly erroneous . . ." and Lorain Journal Co.
v. United States, 342 U. S. 143. In view of the disposition
made of this case by the majority, it is not necessary to
discuss the terms of the decree.
