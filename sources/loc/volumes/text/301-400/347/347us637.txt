OCTOBER TERM, 1953.
Opinion of the Court.

347 U. S.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of
the Court.
Respondent was born in the Philippine Islands in 1913
and came therefrom to the continental United States in
1930. He has lived here ever since. In 1941, he was
convicted'in the State of California of assault with a
deadly weapon and was sentenced to imprisonment for
one year in the Alameda County jail. In 1950, he was
convicted in the State of Washington of second degree
burglary and was sentenced under the indeterminate sentence law of that State to a minimum term of two years in
the state penitentiary. In 1951, after an administrative
hea ring, he was ordered deported to the Philippine Islands
under § 19 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1917 as an alien
who "after entry" had been sentenced more than once
to imprisonment for terms of one year or more for crimes
involving moral turpitude. 39 Stat. 889, as amended,
formerly 8.U. S. C. § 155 (a).
After respondent was taken into custody, he filed a
petition for a writ of. habeas corpus in the United Statel
District Court for the Northern District of California.
The petition attacked the *validity of the deportation
order on the ground, among others, that he was not subject to deportation under § 19 (a) since he had not made
an "entry" within the meaning of that section. The
District Court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, witfh one judge
dissenting, reversed the District Court's judgment anrd
remanded the case with directions to order respondent's
release from custody. 207 F. 2d 398. We granted certiorari. 346 U. S. 914.
The sole question presented is whether respondentwho was born a national of the United States in the Philippine Islands, who came to the continental United States
as a national prior to the Philippine Independence Act of
1934, and who was sentenced to imprisonment in 1941

and 1950 for crimes involving moral turpitude-may now
be deported under § 19 (a) of the Immigration Act. of
1917.
It is conceded that respondent was born a national of
the United States; that as such he owed permanent
allegiance to the United States, including the obligation
of military service; that he retained this status when he
came to the continental United States in 1930 and hence
was not then subject to the Immigration Act of 1917 or
any other federal statute relating to the exclusion or deportation of aliens.' The Government, however, contends that respondent's status as a national was changed
by the Philippine Independence Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 456,
which provided for the eventual independence of the
Philippines, subsequently achieved in 1946, 60 Stat.
1352. Section 8 (a) (1) of the 1934 Act provides:
"For the purposes of the Immigration Act of

1917, . . . this section, and all other laws of the
United States relating to the immigration, exclusion,
or expulsion of aliens, citizens of the Philippine Islands who are not citizens of the United States shall
be considered as if they were aliens. For such purposes the Philippine Islands shall be considered as
a separate country and shall have for each fiscal year
a quota of fifty."
From the Spanish cession in 1898 until final independence in
1946, the Philippine Islands were American territory subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States. See Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt,
324 U. S. 652, 674-676. Persons born in the Philippines during this
period were American nationals entitled to the protection of the
United States and conversely owing permanent allegiance to the
United States. They could not be excluded from this country under
a general statute relating to the exclusion of "aliens." See Gonzales
v. Williams, 192 U. S. 1, 12-13; Toyota v. United States, 268 U. S.
•402, 411. But, until 1946, neither could they become United States
citizens. See Toyota v. United States, s-:.pra; 60 Stat. 416.

OCTOBER TERM, 1953.
Opinion of the Court.

347 U. S.

The Government urges that the reference in § 8 (a) (1)
to "citizens of the Philippine Islands" includes Filipinos
then residing in the United States; that by virtue of this
provision the respondent was assimilated to the status of
an alien for purposes of "immigration, exclusion, or expulsion"; and that, having been twice convicted thereafter
of crimes involving moral turpitude, he is deportable
under § 19 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1917.
The Government's argument is premised on the assumption that respondent made an "entry" within the
meaning of § 19 (a). If he did not make such an "entry,"
then he is not deportable under that section, even
assuming that the Government is correct in its broad
construction of the 1934 Philippine Independence Act.
Section 19 (a) provides:
". .. except as hereinafter provided, any alien who
is hereafter sentenced to imprisonment for a term of
one year or more because of conviction in this country
of a crime involving moral turpitude, committed
within five years after the entry of the alien to the
United States, or who is hereafter sentenced more
than once to such a term of imprisonment because of
conviction in this country of any crime involving
moral turpitude, committed at any time after
entry . . . shall, upon the warrant of the Attorney
General, be taken into custody and deported ..
(Italics added.)
The Court of Appeals sustained respondent's contention
that he had never made the requisite "entry." With this
conclusion, we agree.
The Government would have us interpret "entry" in
§ 19 (a) in its "ordinary, everyday sei~se" of a "coming
into the United States." Under this view, respondent's
"coming into the United States" from the Philippinre

BARBER v. GONZALES.

Opinion of the Court.

Islands in 1930 would satisfy the "entry" requirement.
While it is true that statutory language should be interpreted whenever possible according to common usage,
some terms acquire a special technical meaning by a
process of judicial construction. So it is with the word
"entry" in § 19 (a). E. g., Delgadillo v. Carmichael,332
U. S. 388; United States ex rel. Claussen v. Day, 279 U. S.
398; Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 158 F. 2d 878; Del Guercio
v. Gabot, 161 F. 2d 559. Cf. United States ex tel. Volpe
v. Smith, 289 U. S. 422, 425.2 In United States ex rel.
Claussen v. Day, supra, at 401, this Court stated the
applicable rule:
"The word 'entry' [in § 19 (a)] by its own force
implies a coming from outside. The context shows
that in order that there be an entry within the meaning of the Act there must be an arrival from some
foreign port or place. There is no such entry where
one goes to sea on board an American vessel from a
2 1n

the Volpe case, the Court stated:

"We accept the view that the word 'entry'

. . .

[in § 19 (a)] ...

includes any coming of an alien from a foreign country into the United

States whether such coming be the first or any subsequent one. And

this requires affirmance of the challenged judgment ....
That the
second coming of an alien from a foreign country into the United
States is an entry within the usual acceptation of that word is clear
enough from Lewisv. Frick, 233 U. S. 291; Claussen v. Day, 279

U. S. 398. An examination of the Immigration Act of 1917, we
think, reveals nothing sufficient to indicate that Congress did not
intend the word 'entry' in § 19 should have its ordinary meaning."

(Italics added.)
The context of the latter sentence mfakes it clear that the Court
regarded the word's "ordinary meaning" as being "any coming of an
alien from a foreign country." In the Delgadillo case, 8upra, the
Court narrowed this definition even further by holding that a resident alien does not make an "entry" from a foreign country if his
arrival in the foreign country was unintentional.

port of the United States and returns to the same or
another port of this country without having been in
any foreign port or place." (Italics added.)
See also United States ex rel. Stapf v. Corsi, 287 U. S.
129, 132; Carmichaelv. Delaney, 170 F. 2d 239, 242-243.
This concept of "entry" was codified by Congress in the
Immigration and Nationality Act 'of 1952.1
At the time respondent came to the continental United
States, he was not arriving "from some foreign port or
place." On the contrary, he was a United States national
moving from one of our insular possessions to the mainland. It was not until the 1934 Philippine Independence
Act that the Philippines could be regardedas "foreign" for
immigration purposes. Having made no "entry," respondent is not deportable under § 19 (a) as an alien who
"after entry" committed crimes involving moral turpitude. The Government warns that this conclusion is
inconsistent with a broad congressional purpose to terminate the United States residence of alien criminals. But
we believe a different conclusion would not be permissible
in view of the well-settled meaning of "entry" in § 19 (a).
Although not penal in character, deportation statutes as a
practical matter may inflict "the equivalent of banishment or exile," Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U. S.6, 10,
SSection 101 (a) (13) of the 1952 Act, 66 Stat. 167, 8 U. S. C.
§ 1101 (a) (13), provides in pertinent part:
"The term 'entry' means any coming of an alien into the United
States, from a foreign port or place or from an outlying
possession ....
Section 101 (a)(29), 66 Stat. 170, 8 U. S. C. § 1101 (a) (29), defines
"outlying possessions" as American Samoa and Swains Island. By a
special provision in the 1952 Act, the exclusion process is made applicable to any alien coming to the continental United States from
Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands. 66 Stat.
188, 8 U. S. C. § 1182 (d)(7).

and should be strictly construed. See Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U. S. 388, 391. In the absence of explicit
language showing a contrary congressional intent, we
must give technical words in deportation statutes their
usual technical meaning.'
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MINTON, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED

and MR. JUSTIcE BURTON join, dissenting.
But for this Court's holding that § 19 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1917 must be construed strictly and the
word "entry" given a special meaning, I would be content
with the excellent dissent of Judge Bone in the court
below. 207 F. 2d 398, 402.
The effect of the Court's opinion is to construe the Act
strictly in favor of the convicted criminal sought to be
deported for his criminal acts, rather than in favor of the
United States in protection of its citizens. I know of
no good reason why we should by strained construction of
an Act compel the United States to cling onto alien
criminals. It is not the public policy of this country to
construe its statutes strictly in favor of alien criminals
whose convictions have already been established of record.
Why should we give a strained construction to the word
"entry" in the instant case? The least we should do
is to give the word "entry" its ordinary meaning.
4 The respondent also attacks the validity of the deportation order
on the grounds: (1) that he made no "entry" because he was not
an alien when he came to this country; (2) that §8 (a)(1) of the
1934 Philippine Independence Act did not apply to Filipinos already
residing here and that hence he was not an alien in 1941 when he
was sentenced for one of the two crimes involved in this proceeding;
(3) that he is not an alien today because Congress lacked the power
to deprive him of his status as a national. Our disposition of the
case makes it unnecessary to consider these contentions.

OCTOBER TERM, 1953.
MINTON,

J., dissenting.

347 U. S.

In construing this very statute, this Court said in
United States ex rel. Volpe v. Smith, 289 U. S.422, 425:
"An examination of the Immigration Act of 1917,
we think, reveals nothing sufficient to indicate that
Congress did not intend the word 'entry' in § 19
should have iAs ordinary meaning." Cf. Eichenlaub v. Shaughnessy, 338 U. S.521.
The case of Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U. S. 388,
lends no authority to this case. In that case, the alien
had never voluntarily left the United States for foreign
land. His ship was torpedoed. He was blown into the
sea. ' He was rescued and taken to Cuba, from whence he
came back to the United States by way of Miami, Florida.
This Court said:
"In this case petitioner, of course, chose to return
to this country, knowing he was in a foreign place.
But the exigencies of war, not his voluntary act, put
him on foreign soil. It would indeed be harsh to
read the statute so as to add the peril of deportation
to such perils of. the sea. We might as" well hold
that if he had been kidnapped and taken to Cuba, he
made a statutory 'entry' on his voluntary return.
Respect for law does not thrive on captious interpretations." P..391.
There is nothing captious or fortuitous about this petitioner's "entry" into the United States. He came to
this country from outside, as all aliens do. No case by
thi Court supports the special construction given by the
Court to the word "entry."
Because of the Court's strict construction of this statute,'which has the effect of putting a liberal construction
on the statute in favor of the alien criminal, which I
believe to be contrary to the public policy of this country,
I dissent.
