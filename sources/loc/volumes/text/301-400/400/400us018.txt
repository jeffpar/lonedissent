ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 412.

Decided November 9, 1970

A bankrupt wage earner's vacation pay, accrued but unpaid at the
time of filing of his petition, does not pass to the trustee in bankruptcy as "property" under § 70a (5) of the Bankruptcy Act.
Certiorari granted; 425 F. 2d 215, affirmed.
PER CURIAM.

This case presents the question of whether a bankrupt
wage earner's vacation pay, accrued but unpaid at the
time of the filing of his petition, passes to the trustee
in bankruptcy as "property" under § 70a (5) of the
Bankruptcy Act, 30 Stat. 565, as amended, 11 U. S. C.
§ 110 (a) (5). The facts are not in dispute. Respondent
Frederick, employed by a large manufacturing company,
had accrued vacation pay of $137.28 at the time he
filed his petition. He could collect this sum either during the annual period when his employer shut down the
plant in which he worked, or on final termination of his
employment. Respondent Harris had accrued vacation pay of $144.14, which he could draw either on termination or under a conventional voluntary vacation plan
of his employer. In each case, the referee in bankruptcy
made a "turnover order" requiring the bankrupt to pay
to the trustee on receipt all of his accrued vacation pay,
less one-half of that part accrued during the 30 days
prior to the filing of the petition (the deducted sum being
exempt under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 690.11 (Supp.
1970)).
The District Court affirmed the referee in both cases,
but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed,
holding that accrued but unpaid vacation pay is not
"property" under the statute, and therefore finding it

unnecessary to decide whether such accrued pay meets
the further statutory requirement of being "transferable." As the Court of Appeals noted, its decision was
squarely in conflict with that of the Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit in Kolb v. Berlin, 356 F. 2d 269.
In Segal v. Rochelle, 382 U. S. 375, 379, we said that
"[t]he main thrust of § 70a (5) is to secure for creditors
everything of value the bankrupt may possess in alienable or leviable form when he files his petition. To
this end the term 'property' has been construed most
generously and an interest is not outside its reach because it is novel or contingent or because enjoyment
must be postponed." But we pointed out that "'[ilt is
impossible to give any categorical definition to the word
"property," nor can we attach to it in certain relations
the limitations which would be attached to it in others.'"
The most important consideration limiting the
breadth of the definition of "property" lies in the
basic purpose of the Bankiuptcy Act to give the debtor
a "new opportunity in life and a clear field for future
effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt. The various provisions of
the bankruptcy act were adopted in the light of that
view and are to be construed when reasonably possible
in harmony with it so as to effectuate the general
purpose and policy of the act." Local Loan Co. v.
Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 244-245 (citations omitted).
In Segal v. Rochelle, supra, the question was whether.
loss-carryback tax refunds arising out of business losses
immediately prior to bankruptcy but not collected until
the end of the calendar year were property subject to a
turnover order in favor of the trustee. In that case, as
in this one, the problem of classification for purposes of
the Bankruptcy Act could not be resolved simply by
reference to the time when the right to the payment
"vested," or to definitions of property drawn from other

areas of the law. The Court looked to the purposes of
the Act and concluded that the tax refund claim was
"sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past and so
little entangled with the bankrupt's ability to make an
unencumbered fresh start that it should be regarded as
'property' under §70a (5)." 382 U. S., at 380.
Applied to the set of facts before us here, the principles reflected in the earlier cases compel a- decision for
the bankrupt. In Segal, a business had ceased to operate
and the task of the trustees in bankruptcy was to marshal
whatever assets were left for distribution to the creditors. The tax refund claim, arising out of the operations
of the business and specifically out of the losses that
had precipitated its failure, was such an asset. By contrast, the respondents here are wage earners whose sole
.source of income, before and after bankruptcy, is their
weekly. earnings. The function of their accrued vacation pay is to support the basic requirements .of life for
them and their families during brief vacation periods or
in the event of layoff. Since it is a part of their wages,
the vacation pay is "a specialized type of 'property presenting distinct problems in our economic system."
Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U. S. 337, 340,
Where the minimal requirements for the economic survival of the debtor are at stake, legislatures have recognized that protection that might be unnecessary or unwise
for other kinds of property may be required. See, e. g.,
the Consumer Credit Protection Act, § 301, 82 Stat. 163,
15 U. S. C. § 1671 (1964 ed., Supp. V).
The wage-earning bankrupt who must take a vacation
without pay or forgo a vacation altogether cannot be
said to have achieved the "new opportunity in life and
[the] clear field for future effort, unhampered by the
pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt," Local
Loan Co. v. Hunt, supra, which it was the purpose of
the statute to provide.

HAuAN, J., dissenting

The motion of respondent Harris to proceed in forma
pauperis is granted. The motion of respondent Frederick to dispense with printing his brief in opposition
is granted. The petition for certiorari is granted and
the judgment is affirmed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE is of the opinion that the petition
for writ of certiorari should be denied.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.

In my view this case is another instance in which
the pressure of an overcrowded docket has led the Court
to deal summarily with an issue which, if deserving4
e
our attention at all, is deserving of full-dress treatment.
Cf. United States v. Maryiand Savings-Share Insurance
Corp., ante, p. 4; United States v. Chicago, ante, p.
8. Moreover, the Court disposes of the case despite
the- opaqueness of the record and the uncertainty with
regard to relevant California law.
Under the terms of respondent Frederick's employment, his employer credited him with one day's vacation pay for each month's work.' From September 15,
the date of bankruptcy, to December 23, the beginning
of the shutdown and the enforced "vacation," Mr. Frederick presumably became entitled to a little over three
days' pay. The same amount would have accrued to a
person starting work on the date of bankruptcy with no
debts or assets, the paradigm of "an unencumbered fresh'
start." Indeed, the order not only permitted Mr. Frederick a fresh start; it gave him a head start, to the extent
While neither the stipulated facts nor the opinions below reveal
the rate of accrual of vacation pay, I take as-true the uncon'tested representation in Mr. Frederick's petition for review of the
referee's order.

of half a day's pay.' Segal v. Rochelle, 382 U. S. 375
(1966), and Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234 (1934),
therefore tend to support the position of the trustee
rather than "compel a decision for the bankrupt." Ante,
p. 20. However, respondents can muster forceful arguments in their support, even on the assumption that the
accrued vacation pay was subject to the claims of creditors-a point of California law which the court below
found it unnecessary to decide.
Since the question tendered for review is close and
has split the courts of appeals, I would set the case for
argument.

2 The case of respondent Harris is similar, but it is complicated
by the fact that he could have chosen to forgo his vacation. As
he observed in his petition to review the turnover order, the record
is silent on whether such a choice would have wiped out his accrued
vacation time and left nothing for him to turn over.
