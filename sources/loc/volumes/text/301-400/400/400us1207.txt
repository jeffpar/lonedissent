Circuit Justice.
Under Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, applicants make out a strong case for federal protection of
their First Amendment rights. But Dombrowski, a fiveto-two decision rendered in 1965, is up for re-examinaMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

tion in cases set for reargument this fall.

If the pres-

ent case were before the Conference of this Court, I am
confident it would be held pending the cases to be reargued. Hence, as Circuit Justice, I do not feel warranted in taking action contrary to what I feel the
Conference would do. Accordingly, I deny the restraining order requested.
