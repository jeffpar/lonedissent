COLORADO ANTI-DISCRIMINATION COMMISSION ET AL. v. CONTINENTAL
AIR LINES, INC.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO.

No. 146. Argued March 28, 1963.-Decided April 22, 1963.*
After administrative hearings, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination
Commission found that respondent, an interstate air carrier with
headquarters in Colorado, had, within that State, rejected the
application of a Negro for a job as a pilot solely because of his
race and that this was an unfair employment practice prohibited
by the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act of 1957, and it ordered
respondent to cease and desist from such discriminatory practices
and to give the complainant the first opportunity to enroll in
its training school in its next course. On review, a state court
held that the Act could not constitutionally be applied to the flight
crew of an interstate air carrier, and it set aside the Commission's
findings and dismissed the complaint. The Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed. Held: The judgment is reversed and the cause is
remanded for further proceedings. Pp. 716-725.
(a) The judgment below does not rest upon an independent and
adequate state ground but upon the State Supreme Court's application and interpretation of the Federal Constitution, federal
statutes and Executive Orders, and this Court has jurisdiction
on certiorari. P. 718.
(b) Colorado's requirement that respondent refrain from racial
discrimination in its hiring of pilots in that State does not unduly
burden interstate commerce. Hall v. DeCuir, 95 U. S. 485, and
Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U. S. 373, distinguished. Pp. 718-722.
(c) This field has not been so pervasively covered or preempted
by the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, now the Federal Aviation Act
of 1958, the Railway Labor Act or Executive Orders as to prevent
Colorado from applying its Anti-Discrimination Act to respondent,
as it did here. Pp. 722-725.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner Marlon D. Green, a Negro, applied for a job
as a pilot with respondent Continental Air Lines, Inc., an
interstate air carrier. His application was submitted at
Continental's headquarters in Denver, Colorado, and was
later considered and rejected there. Green then made
complaint to the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission that Continental had refused to hire him because he
was a Negro. The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act of
1957 provides that it is an unfair employment practice for
an employer "to refuse to hire, to discharge, to promote or
demote, or to discriminate in matters of compensation
against, any person otherwise qualified, because of race,
creed, color, national origin or ancestry." ' After investigation and efforts at conciliation, the Commission held

extensive hearings and found as a fact "that the only reason that the Complainant was not selected for the training
school was because of his race." I The Commission
ordered Continental to cease and desist from such discriminatory practices and to "give to the Complainant
the first opportunity to enroll in its training school in
its next course . . . ." On review the District Court in
and for the City and County of Denver set aside the Commission's findings and dismissed Green's complaint. It
held that the Anti-Discrimination Act could not "ionstitutionally be extended to cover the flight crew personnel of
an interstate air carrier" because it would impose an
undue burden upon commerce in violation of Art. I, § 8,
cl. 3, of the United States Constitution, which gives Congress power "To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . . " and because the field of law concerning
racial discrimination in the interstate operation of carriers
is preempted by the Railway Labor Act,3 the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, 4 and Federal Executive Orders. The
Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed the judgment of dismissal, but discussed only the question of whethei the Act
as applied placed an undue burden on commerce, concluding that it did. 149 Colo. 259, 368 P. 2d 970 (1962). The
obvious importance of even partial invalidation of a state
law designed to preventthe discriminatory denial of job
opportunities prompted us to grant certiorari. 371 U. S.
809 (1962).
2 The Commission also found that Continental was "guilty of a
discriminatory and unfair employment practice in requiring on its

application form, the racial identity of the applicant and the require-

ment of a photo to be attached to the application," contrary to the
Commission's regulation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1962.
Opinion of the Court.

372 U. S.

First. Continental argues that the State Supreme
Court decision rested on an independent and adequate
nonfederal ground. For that argument, it relies on the
trial court's statement "that the Colorado legislature was
not attempting to legislate concerning problems involving
interstate commerce" and the statement of the Supreme
Court of Colorado that:
"The only question resolved was that of jurisdiction.
The trial court determined that the Act was inapplicable to employees of those engaged in interstate
commerce, and the judgment was based exclusively
on that ground." 149 Colo., at 265, 368 P. 2d, at 973.
We reject this contention. The trial court itself did not
rest on this ground. Instead, it clearly and unequivocally
stated that the case presented a constitutional question
of whether the Act could legally be applied to interstate
operations. Nor did the Supreme Court of Colorado rely
on this ground. It interpreted the trial court's opinion
as having held that the Act was invalid insofar as it regulated interstate air carriers. The Court further stated
that the question was whether the Act could be applied to
interstate carriers, which it answered by concluding that
under the Federal Constitution the State. Legislature had
no power to deal with such matters. We are satisfied that
the courts below rested their judgments on their interpretation of the United States Constitution and the preemptive effect of federal statutes and Executive Orders.
Second. In holding that the Colorado statute imposed
an undue burden on commerce, the State Supreme Court
relied on the principle, first stated in Cooley v. Board of
Wardens of the Port of Philadelphia,12 How. 299, that
States have no power to act in those areas of interstate
commerce which by their nature require uniformity of regulation, even though Congress has not legislated on the

Opinion of the Court.

subject.5 The State Court read two prior decisions of this
Court, Hall v. DeCuir,95 U. S. 485 (1878), and Morgan v.
Virginia, 328 U. S. 373 (1946), as having established that
the field of racial discrimination by an interstate carrier
must be free from diverse state regulation and governed
uniformly, if at all, by Congress. We do not believe those
cases stated so encompassing a rule. The line separating
the powers of a State from the exclusive power of Congress is not always distinctly marked; courts must examine closely the facts of each case to determine whether
the dangers and hardships of diverse regulation justify
foreclosing a State from the exercise of its traditional
powers. This was emphatically pointed out in Hall v.
DeCuir, supra, the very case upon which Continental
chiefly relies:
"Judges not unfrequently differ -in their reasons for
a decision in which they concur. Under such circumstances it would be a useless task to undertake to
fix an arbitrary rule by which the line must in all
cases be located. It is far better to leave a matter of
such delicacy to be settled in each case upon a view
of the particular rights involved." 95 U. S., at 488.
The circumstances in Hall v. DeCuir were that a Louisiana law forbidding carriers to discriminate on account
of race or color had been applied so as to hold a steamboat
owner liable for damages for assigning a colored passenger
to one cabin rather. than another. This was held to
violate the Commerce Clause, but only after a careful
analysis of the effects of the law on that carrier and its
It is not claimed in this case that the Colorado Act discriminated
against interstate commerce, see, e. g., Best & Co. v. Maxwell, 311
U. S. 454 (1940), or that it places a substantial economic burden on
Continental, see, e. g., Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, 359 U. S. 520
(1959).

passengers. Among other things, the Court pointed out
that if each of the 10 States bordering the Mississippi
River were free to regulate the carrier and to provide for
its own passengers and freight, the resulting confusion
would produce great inconvenience and unnecessary hardships. The Court concluded that:
"Commerce cannot flourish in the midst of such.
embarrassments. No carrier of passengers can conduct his business with satisfaction to himself, or confort to those employing him, if on one side of a State
line his passengers, both white and colored, must be
permitted to occupy the same cabin, and on the other
be kept separate. Uniformity in the regulations by
which he is to be governed from one end to the other
95
of his route is a necessity in his business ......
U. S., at 489.
After the same kind of analysis, the Court in Morgan v.
Virginia, supra, held that a Virginia law requiring segregation of motor carrier passengers, including those on interstate journeys, infringed the Commerce Clause because
uniform regulation was essential. The Court emphasized
the restriction on the passengers' freedom to choose accommodations and the inconvenience of constantly requiring passengers to shift seats. As in Hall v. DeCuir,
the Court explicitly recognized the absence of any one,
sure test for deciding these burden-on-commerce cases.
It concluded, however, that the circumstances before it
showed that there would be a practical interference with
carrier transportation if diverse state laws were permitted
to stand. The importance of a particularized inquiry into
the existence of a burden on commerce is again illustrated
by Bob-Lo Excursion Co. v. Michigan,333 U. S.28 (1948),
where the Court had before it a state statute requiring
common carriers to serve all people alike regardless of
color. The Court upheld the law as applied to steamships

Opinion of the Court.

transporting patrons between Michigan and Canada.
Following the rule that each case must be adjudged on its
particular facts, the Court concluded that neither Hall nor
Morgan was "comparable in its facts, whether in the degree of localization of the commerce- involved; in the
attenuating effects, if any, upon the commerce . . . ; or
in any actual probability of conflicting regulations by different sovereignties." 333 U. S., at 39.
. We are not convinced that commerce will be unduly
burdened if Continental is required by Colorado to refrain from racial discrimination in its hiring of pilots in
that State, Not only is the hiring within a State of an
employee, even for an interstate job, a much more localized matter than the transporting of passengers from
State to State 6 but more significantly the threat of diverse and conflicting regulation of hiring practices is
virtually nonexistent. In Hall and in Morgan the Court
assumed the validity both of state laws requiring segregation and of state laws forbidding segregation. Were
there a possibility that a pilot hired in Colorado could
be barred solely because of his color from serving a carrier
in another State, then this case might well be controlled
by our prior holdings. But under our more recent decisions " any state or federal law requiring applicants for
any job to be turned away because of their color would be
invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment. The kind of burden that
was thought possible in the Hall and Morgan cases, therefore, simply cannot exist here. It is, of course, possible
that States could impose such onerous, harassing, and con6

flicting conditions on an interstate carrier's hiring of
employees that the burden would hamper the carrier's
satisfactory performance of its functions. But that is not
this case. We hold that the Colorado statute as applied
here to prevent discrimination in hiring on account of race
does not impose a constitutionally prohibited burden upon
interstate commerce.
Third. Continental argues that federal law has so pervasively covered the field of protecting people in interstate commerce from racial discrimination that the States
are barred from enacting legislation in this field. It is not
contended, however, that the Colorado statute is in direct
conflict with federal law,8 that it denies rights granted by
Congress,9 or that it stands-as an obstacle to the full effectiveness of a federal statute. ° Rather Continental argues
that:
"When Congress has taken the particular subjectmatter in hand coincidence is as ineffective as opposition, and a state law is not to be declared a help
because it attempts to go farther than Congress has
seen fit to go." 11
But this Court has also said that the mere "fact of identity does not mean the automatic invalidity of state measures." 12 To hold that a state statute identical in purpose
with a federal statute is invalid under the Supremacy
Clause; we must be Atble to conclude that the purpose of
the federal statute would to some extent be frustrated by
the state statute. We can reach no such conclusion here.

Opinion of the Court.

Continental relies first on the Civil Aeronautics Act of
1938,1 now the Federal Aviation Act of 1958," and its
broad general provisions forbidding air carriers to subject
any particular person to "any unjust discrimination or ahy
undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any
respect whatsoever" 1'and requiring "The promotion of
adequate, economical, and efficient service by air carriers
at reasonable charges, without unjust discriminations, undue preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive
competitive practices .... ,16 This is a familiar type
of regulation, aimed primarily at rate discrimination injurious to shippers, competitors, and localities.
But we
may assume, for present purposes, that these provisions
prohibit racial discrimination against passengers and
other customers 18 and that they protect job applicants
or employees from discrimination on account of race.
The Civil Aeronautics Board and the Administrator of
the Federal Aviation Agency have indeed broad authority
over flight crews of air carriers,"9 much of which has been
exercised by regulations." Notwithstanding this broad
authority, we are satisfied that Congress in the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 and its successor had no express or

the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 72 Stat. 731, 49 U. S. C. §§ 13011542. Some of the powers and duties of the Civil Aeronautics Board
were transferred to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency.

implied intent to bar state legislation in this field and that
the Colorado statute, at least so long as any power the
Civil Aeronautics Board may have remains "dormant and
unexercised," 21 will not frustrate any part of the purpose
of the federal legislation."
There is even less reason to say that Congress, in passing the Railway Labor Act 22 and making certain of its provisions applicable to air carriers, intended to bar States
from protecting employees against racial discrimination.
No provision in the Act even mentions discrimination in
hiring. It is true that in several cases we have held that
the exclusive bargaining agents authorized by the Act
must not use their powers to discriminate against minority groups whom they are supposed to represent. 4 And
we have held that employers too may be enjoined from
carrying out provisions of a discriminatory bargaining
agreement.25 But the duty the Act imposes is one of fair
representation and it is imposed upon the union. The
employer is merely prohibited from aiding the union in
breaching its duty. Nothing in the Railway Labor Act
or in our cases suggests that the Act places upon an air
carrier a duty to engage only in fair nondiscriminatory
hiring practices. The Act has never been used for that
purpose, and we cannot hold it bars Colorado's AntiDiscrimination Act.

Opinion of the Court.

Finally, we reject the argument that Colorado's AntiDiscrimination Act cannot constitutionally be enforced
because of Executive Orders requiring government contracting agencies to include in their contracts clauses by
which contractors agree not to discriminate against
employees or applicants because of their race, religion,
color, or national origin.26 The District Court purported
to take judicial notice that "a certificated commercial carrier by air [such as respondent] is obligated to and in fact
does transport United States mail under contract with the
United States Government." The Government answers
that in fact it has no contract with Continental and that,
while 49 U. S. C. § 1375 requires air lines to carry mail, it
does not forbid discrimination on account of race or compel the execution of a contract subject to Executive Orders.
We do not rest on this ground alone, however, nor do we
reach the question of whether an Executive Order can
foreclose state legislation. It is impossible for us to
believe that the Executive intended for its orders to regulate air carrier discrimination among employees so pervasively as to preempt state legislation intended to
accomplish the same purpose.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is
reversed and' the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
