Appellee applied in the court below for a writ of
quo warranto. The petition asked that appellant be
ousted "from the office he presently holds as Member
of the State Board of Public Welfare of the State of
Arizona, and [that] his office [be declared] vacant so that

a successor may be qualified as provided by law." Appellee referred in its petition and brief to Ariz. Rev. Stat.
ยง 38-447, which provides that any official who violates
the statutory prohibition against having an interest in
contracts made by him in his official capacity "shall
be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand
dollars or by imprisonment in the state prison for not
more than five years, and is forever disqualified from
holding any office in this state." Appellee, however,
asked the court below only to require appellant "to
show cause why his position as a Member of the State
Board of Public Welfare should not be declared vacant
and why he should not be found to unlawfully hold said
office, so that a successor may be qualified as provided
by law."
Appellant filed a motion to quash the application on
the ground that under the statutory scheme removal
from office could be imposed only upon one who had
been found guilty in a criminal proceeding of violating
the statutory provisions. That motion was denied.
Appellant then answered the application, acknowledging
that certain mortgage transactions between the Arizona
Retirement Board and the Associated Mortgage and Investment Company took place while he was a member
of the former and president and director of the latter.
Oral argument was denied, the case being decided on
the briefs.
Up to that point, therefore, the matter was presented
as a question of state law-it was contended that the
state statutes did not permit removal from office prior
to a criminal conviction. The court, however, not only
ruled that appellant should be excluded from his office
as a Member of the State Board of Public Welfare
but also "forever disqualified from holding any public
office in the State of Arizona." To reach this conclu-

sion, the court construed the Arizona statutes to require
a criminal conviction if a fine or imprisonment were to
be imposed on the public official, but only a "judicial
determination of the fact upon which the disqualification rests," if disqualification were the sanction to be
imposed. The quo warranto proceeding before the court
was held to offer a sufficient "judicial determination of
the fact" to exclude appellant from the office he held
and to bar him permanently from public office.
In his petition for rehearing appellant challenged on
federal constitutional grounds the court's use of the
civil quo warranto proceeding to disqualify him permanently from public office. He asserted that the statute, as
construed by the court, permitted the permanent barring
of a person from public office in a civil proceeding lacking vital elements of due process. Appellant also contended that the statute, as construed, constituted a bill
of attainder since it operated to inflict punishment without the constitutional safeguards of a judicial trial.
It seems obvious that until the court had interpreted
the statute in appellant's case to allow permanent disqualification in a quo warranto proceeding in which the
petition asked only for a show-cause order and that appellant be discharged from his present office, appellant had,
as a practical matter, no reason to raise the federal claims
he presents to this Court. Appellee did not ask for a
declaration of permanent disqualification in its petition
for quo warranto. The Arizona statute that expressly
provides for the judgment to be entered in a quo warranto
case, Ariz. Rev. Stat. ยง 12-2045, does not mention permanent disqualification from office. That section provides only that "when a defendant is adjudged guilty
of usurping or intruding into or unlawfully holding an
office, franchise or privilege, judgment shall be given
that the defendant be excluded from the office, franchise

or privilege. The court may also impose upon defendant
a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars, which, when
collected, shall be paid into the state treasury."
If a federal question arises because of an unexpected
construction of a state statute by the highest state court,
the question is timely raised for purposes of review by
this Court if it is presented in the petition for rehearing.
Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings Co. v. Hill, 281 U. S.
673.
A declaration that a person is permanently barred
from any future public office raises constitutional issues
that simple removal from office does not. Such a declaration sweeps broadly and may destroy the individual's
right to a livelihood in the field of his greatest competence. The serious nature of any such holding demands
that the rules of procedural due process be complied with
strictly. I believe that the issues raised are substantial
and were properly presented below. Probable jurisdiction should be noted, or at the very least we should take
the case and hear it argued, postponing the question of
jurisdiction to the merits.
