APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 500.

Reported below: 185 F. Supp. 306.

PER CURIAM.

The motion to dismiss is granted. The case does not
arise under 28 U. S. C. ยง 2282, requiring the convening of
a three-judge court. See I. L. G. W. U. v. Donnelly Garment Co., 304 U. S. 243. Therefore it cannot be directly
brought here for review under 28 U. S. C. ยง 1253, and the
appeal must be dismissed. Appellant is free to pursue
his perfected appeal in the Court of Appeals.
