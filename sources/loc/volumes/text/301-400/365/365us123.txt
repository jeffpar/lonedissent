NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v.
MATTISON MACHINE WORKS.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 74.

Argued January 9, 1961.-Decided January 23, 1961.

The Court of Appeals erred in refusing to enforce an order of the
National Labor Relations Board in a representation election solely
because its notices of election contained a minor and unconfusing
mistake in the employer's corporate name. Pp. 123-124.
274 F. 2d 347, reversed and cause remanded.

Norton J. Come argued the cause for petitioner. With
him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Stuart
Rothman, Dominick L. Manoli and Allan I. Mendelsohn.
J. Warren McCaffrey argued the cause for respondent.
With him on the brief was CharlesB. Cannon.
Harold A. Katz and Irving M. Friedman filed a brief
for the United Automobile, Aircraft & Agricultural Implement Workers of America, as amicus curiae, urging
reversal.
PER CURIAM.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and
the case remanded to that court for the entry of a decree

of Appeals to enforce that order because the Board's
notices of election contained a minor and unconfusing
mistake in the employer's corporate name, was plain
error. It was well within the Board's province to find,
as it did, upon the record before it that this occurrence
had not affected the fairness of the representation election, particularly in the absence of any contrary showing

by the employer, upon whom the burden of proof rested
in this respect. That finding should have been accepted
by the Court of Appeals. In the absence of proof by the
employer that there has been prejudice to the fairness of
the election such trivial irregularities of administrative
procedure do not afford a basis for denying enforcement
to an otherwise valid Board order.
