CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 432.

Argued February 13, 1947.-Decided March 10, 1947.

1. The action of a circuit court of appeals in directing a remand to
a state court is reviewable here; and the jurisdiction of this Court
is not defeated by the fact that the mandate of the circuit court
of appeals has issued. Pp. 466-467.
2. A suit for death benefits in the amount of $5,000 under the Workmen's Compensation Law of Tennessee, held to involve the sum
of $3,000 requisite to the jurisdiction of a federal district court
on the ground of diversity of citizenship, notwithstanding tl.at
under the state law an award would be payable in installments
and, by operation of ccnditions subsequent, the payments might
be terminated before totaling $3,000. Pp. 467-468.
3. Since the other grounds relied on by the respondent to sustain
the judgment of the circuit court of appeals were not passed
upon by that court nor adequately presented here, the case is
remanded to the circuit court of appeals for consideration of
those questions. P. 468.
154 F. 2d 881, reversed.

to recover death benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Lawof Tennessee, wasremoved to a federal district

Opinion -of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This action for death benefits under the Workmen's
Compensation Law of Tennessee (Tenn. Code Ann. 1934,
§ 6851 et seq.) was commenced in 1945 by plaintiff-respondent in the Chancery Court of Hawkins County,
Tennessee. The defendants-petitioners are the former
employer of her deceased husband and the employer's
insurance carrier. Service was had on the insurance' carrier in Hawkins County, and on the employer in Knox
County. Respondent is a citizen of Tennessee, the employer is a North Carolina corporation, and the insurance
carrier is a Connecticut corporation. The complaint alleged that respondent's husband died as the result of an
accident occurring in the course of his employment.
Burial expenses plus benefits in the amount of $5,000, the
maximum under the Tennessee statute,1 were sought on
behalf of respondent and her two minor children, aged
twelve and fifteen.
On May 28, 1945, petitioners mailed a notice of intention to file a petition for removal to a federal District
Court which was received by respondent's attorney on
the morning of May 29. The petition for removal was
filed in the Chancery Court the same day, and on June 5
the removal order issued. In the federal court the petitioners moved 'for dismissal on the ground that venue was
not properly laid in the Hawkins County Court, so that
1 Death benefits are provided in the amount of 60% of the average
weekly wages of the employee (as computed in accordance with Tenn.
Code § 6852 (c)), but payments may not exceed $18 per week, nor
continue for more than 400 weeks. § 6880; § 6883 (17). In addition there is a ceiling of $5,000 on total benefits exclusive of burial
and certain other expenses. § 6881. See Haynes v. Columbia Pictures Corp., 178 Tenn. 648, 162 S. W. 2d 383. The complaint alleged
that 60% of the average weekly wages for the statutory period would
exceed $5,000.

under Tennessee law that court had lacked jurisdiction.
Respondent sought a remand of the case to the state court,
contending that the requisites of diversity jurisdiction had
not been met either as to jurisdictional amount or as to
proper notice of filing of the removal petition, and that the
suit was not removable because not one of a civil nature
in law or equity. The District Court concluded that
Hawkins County was not the proper venue. It thereupon
dismissed the action without reaching the questions raised
by respondent's motion for a remand.
The judgment was reversed on appeal. 154 F. 2d 881.
The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the jurisdictional
minimum of $3,000 in controversy (Judicial Code § 24,
28 U. S. C. § 41 (1)) was not present, and therefore ordered the case remanded to the state court. In this disposition the Circuit Court of Appeals reached neither the
state venue question raised by petitioners, nor respondent's contention that the required notice of the filing of
the removal petition was lacking. We granted certiorari
because of an apparent conflict with Brotherhoodof Locomotive Firemenv. Pinkston, 293 U, S. 96, as to the jurisdictional minimum requirement.
First. It is suggested that a decision of a Circuit Court
of Appeals ordering remand of a case to a state court is
not reviewable. And it is also said that we lack power to
review the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals, since,the
mandate of that court has issued and the District Court
has remanded the cause to the state court.
An order of a District Court remanding a cause to-the
state court from whence it came is not appealable, and
hence may not be reviewed either in the Circuit Court

2The contention was that proper venue lay only in Roane County
where, it was alleged, the accident occurred and the business of the employer is conducted. It was argued that service on the insurer in
Hawkins County did not give the Hawkins County Court jurisdiction

of the case.

of Appeals or here. Judicial Code § 28, 28 U. S. C. § 71;
Kloeb v. Armour & Co., 311 U. S. 199; Metropolitan
Casualty Ins. Co. v. Stevens, 312 U. S. 563; United States
v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742. But no such limitation affects
our authority to review an action of the Circuit Court of
Appeals, directing a remand to a state court. Gay v. Ruff,
292 U. S. 25. Nor does the fact that the mandate of the
Circuit Court of Appeals has issued defeat this Court's
jurisdiction. Carr v. Zaja, 283 U. S. 52, and cases cited.
Second. We think that the jurisdictional amount of
$3,000 was involved in this suit. The contrary conclusion
of the Circuit Court of Appeals was based on the nature
of the award under the Tennessee statute. The award
may be paid in installments at regular intervals by the
employer or by a trustee with whom the amount of the
award, reduced to present value, has been deposited.
Tenn. Code § 6893. Moreover, the death or remarriage
of respondent, plus the death or attainment of the age
of eighteen by the children, would terminate all payments.
Tenn. Code § 6883. Since an award to respondent would
be payable in installments, and by operation of conditions
subsequent the total payments might never reach $3,000,
the Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the jurisdictional amount was lacking.
If this case were one where judgment could be entered
only for the installments due at the commencement of
the suit (cf. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Viglas, 297 U. S.
672, 678), future installments could not be considered in
determining whether the jurisdictional amount was involved, even though the judgment would be determinative
of liability for future installments as they accrued.
Wright v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 19 F. 2d 117, aff'd. 276
U. S. 602. Cf. Button v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 48 F. Supp.
168. But this is not that type of case. For the Tennessee statute which creates liability for the award contemplates a single action for the determination of claimant's

right to benefits and a single judgment for the award
granted. See Tenn. Code §§ 6880, 6881, 6890, 6891,
6893; Shockley v. Morristown Produce & Ice Co., 171
Tenn. 591,106 S. W. 2d 562.
Nor does the fact that it cannot be known as a matter of
absolute certainty that the amount which may ultimately
be paid, if respondent prevails, will exceed $3,000, mean
that the jurisdictional amount is lacking. This Court
has rejected such a restrictive interpretation of the statute
creating diversity jurisdiction. It has held that a possibility that payments will terminate before the total
reaches the jurisdictional minimum is immaterial if the
right to all the payments is in issue. Brotherhoodof LQcomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra; Thompson v.
Thompson, 226 U. S. 551. Future payments arenot in
any proper sense contingent, although they may be decreased or cut off altogether by the operation of conditions
subsequent. Thompson v. Thompson, supra, p. 560.
And there is no suggestion that by reason of life expectancy
or law of averages the maximum amount recoverable can
be expected to fall below the jurisdictional minimum. Cf.
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra,
p. 101. Moreover, the computation of the maximum
amount recoverable is not complicated by the necessity
of determining the life expectancy of respondent
Cf.
Thompson v. Thompson, supra, p. 559; Brotherhood of
Locomotive Firemen v. Pinkston, supra, p. 100.
Third. Respondent, as is her right, United States v.
Ballard, 322 "U. S. 78, 88, and cases cited, seeks to support
the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals on other
grounds. But those questions were not passed ufmn by
that court nor adequately presented here. So we uem
it more appropriate to remand the case to the Circuit
Court of Appeals so it may consider those questions.
United States v. Ballard,supra.
Reversed.
