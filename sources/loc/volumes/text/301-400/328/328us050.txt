THOMAS PAPER STOCK CO. ET AL. V. PORTER;
PRICE ADMINISTRATOR.
CERTIORARI TO THE EMERGENCY COURT OF APPEALS.

Nos. 67 and 578.

Argued February 25, 26, 1946.-Decided April 22,
1946.

1. The Taft Amendment to the Emergency Price Control Act nullified
price schedules based on standards, and no such schedules could be
valid after that Amendment unless and until the Price Administrator "determined" that no other method of price control was
practicable. P. 53.
2. Sales of wastepaper between July 16, 1943, the effective date of
the Taft Amendment, and September 11, 1943, the date when the
Price Administrator determined that other than by standardization
no method of effective price control of such commodity was practicable, did not subject the sellers to the penalties of the Emergency
Price Control Act, even though such sales were at prices in excess
of a pre-Taft Amendment maximum price based on a standard.
Pp. 51-52, 56.
3. The accommodation of the various interests involved in asystem
of price control is for Congress, not the courts; and the legislation
is to be so construed as to give effect to the will of Congress. P. 55.
151 F. 2d 345, reversed.

No. 578. By leave of the District Court in which a
prosecution of the petitioners for violation of a regulation
under the Emergency Price Control Act was pending,
petitioners sought in the Emergency Court of Appeals a
declaration of the invalidity of the regulation. The
Emergency Court of Appeals sustained the validity of the
regulation. 151 F. 2d 345. This Court granted certiorari. 326 U. S. 715. Reversed, p. 56.
No. 67. Petitioners filed a protest with the Price Administrator under the Emergency Price Control Act. The
Price Administrator denied the protest. The -Emergency

Jack H. Oppenheim argued the cause for petitioners.
With him on the briefs was Claude A. Roth.
Jacob D. Hyman argued the cause in No. 578, and
Richard H. Field argued the cause in No. 67, for respondent. With them on the briefs were Solicitor General
McGrath, Ralph F. Fuchs and Josephine H. Klein.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Having been charged with violations of a price regulation, petitioners challenged its validity before the Emergency Court of Appeals by two different modes in two
separate actions. The claim of invalidity in both proceedings was based on the Taft Amendment to the Price
Control Act. Adjudication of this claim will dispose of
both cases without consideration of procedural issues
raised before the Emergency Court.
Thomas Paper Stock Company, a dealer in paper scrap,
and its president were indicted under § 205 (b) of the
Emergency Price Control Act, 56 Stat. 23, 33; 50 U. S. C.
App. § 925 (b), for the sale of wastepaper in violation of
Maximum Price Regulation No. 30, 7 Fed. Reg. 9732 (Nov.
24, 1942). Section 1347.14 (d) of that regulation fixed
the maximum price for unsorted wastepaper in terms of a
specification or standard. Id. at 9735. On similar allegations, the Administrator later began an action against
petitioners for treble damages. § 205 (e), 56 Stat. 23, 34;
50 U. S. C. App. § 925 (e). Both proceedings involved
sales of wastepaper between July 16, 1943 and September

11, 1943. The dates are crucial. July 16, 1943 is the
effective date of the Taft Amendment, the proper construction of which is the controlling issue. OnSeptember
11, 1943, the Administrator, by an amendment to the
Maximum Price Regulation No. 30, "determined" that
"no practicable alternative exists for securing effective
price control" with respect to such wastepaper except
through the standardization defined in the pre-Taft
Amendment Maximum Price Regulation No. 30. 8 Fed.
Reg. 12554 (Sept. 14, 1943). The problem before us is
whether, after the Taft Amendment, sales of wastepaper
were governed by a maximum price based on a standard,
prior to the determination by the Administrator on September 11, 1943 that there was no practicable alternative
to such standardization.
And so we turn to the Taft Amendment. It added subsection (j) to § 2 of the Emergency Price Control Act.
The relevant provisions of the Taft Amendment are
these:
"(j) Nothing in this Act shall be construed ...
(3) as authorizing the Admirfistrator to standardize
any commodity, unless the Administrator shall 'determine, with respect to such standardization, that
no practicable alternative exists for securing effective
price control with respect to such commodity; or (4)
as authorizing any order of the Administrator fixing
maximum prices for different kinds, classes, or types
of a commodity which are described in terms of specifications or standards, unless such specifications or
standards were, prior to such order, in general use in
the trade or industry affected, or have previously
been promulgated and their use lawfully required by
another Government agency." 57 Stat. 566; 50
U. S. C. App. § 902 (j).
We agree with the Emergency Court that Congress thus
provided "three alternative situations in any one of which

Opinion of the Court.

[the Administrator] is authorized to employ specifications or standards in connection with price control."
Thomas Paper Stock Co. v. Bowles, 148 F. 2d 831, 835.
Thus, in the case of wastepaper, standardization is permitted under Clause (3) of the Amendment although the
Administrator may define a standard which "had not previously been used by the wastepaper industry or required
by another Government agency." Id. at 837. But we are
also of opinion that beginning with July 16, 1943, the day
the Taft Amendment came into force, it precluded standardized commodity prices unless and until the Administrator "determined" that no other method of price
control was practicable. The terms of the Amendment, in
the circumstances of its setting, see., e. g., H. R. Rep. No.
697, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943), bring us to this conclusion, but we need add little to the full discussion the Taft
Amendment received in the opinion of the court and that
of the dissent below. Thomas PaperStock Co. v. Bowles,
151 F. 2d 345. For us the decisive consideration is that the
Amendment was a rigorous limitation upon the powers of
the Administrator based upon the Congressional view that
standardizations outstanding at the time the Taft Amendment was passed had not been authorized by the more
general language of the original Act. § 2.(h), 56 Stat. 23,
27; 50 U. S. C. App. § 902 (h).1 Accordingly, Congress
laid down a specific requirement for the validity of prices
based on standards, and a fair reading of the Amendment
in the light of its history requires that the Administrator
must indicate that he has fulfilled this requirement. See
United States v. B. & 0. R. Co., 293 U. S.454. It would
hardly satisfy the restriction which the Taft Amendment
'"The powers granted in this section shall not be used or made to
operate to compel changes in the business practices, cost practices
or methods, or means or aids to distribution, established in any indus.
try, except to prevent circumvention or evasion of any regulation,
order, price schedule, or requirement under this Act."

placed upon the Administrator's power to standardize to
allow him to continue situations which, as Congress
thought, needed correction.
In signing the joint resolution containing the Taft
Amendment, the President did so with the understanding
that it "preserved power in the Administrator to 'standardize' a commodity in any case on which this was absolutely essential to an effective system of fixing prices."
See Statement of Price Administrator's Reasons Involved
in the Issuance of Supplementary Order No. 64 (Sept. 11,
1943). Congress thus gave power to standardize; it did
not sereotype past standardizations. With entire candor the Administrator conceded here that he "had many
regulations outstanding which required re-examination in
the light of the terms of the Taft Amendment." But
although the Amendment apparently had the acquiescence of the Administrator, it contains no saving clause
that all outstanding standardizing regulations were to be
deemed continuingly valid, nor is there any intimation
warranting such an implied limitation. The court below
seemed to recognize the duty of a manifested determination by the Administrator of the need for a standardized
price by suggesting that the Administrator showed "reasonable promptness" in making the determination applicable to wastepaper within two months after the Taft
Amendment. But Congress did not sanction standardization for what we may deem a reasonable period after the
enactment of the Taft Amendment wvithout the Administrator's determination of its need.
This is too substantial a qualification to be made by
judicial interpolation. Nor can we draw on broad arguments about inflationary pressures on price control in construing legislation dealing with so technically confining a
provision as that of the Taft Amendment. The legislation was too specifically directed agai'nst prior unauthor-

ized regulations, promulgated no doubt with the best of
motives in the great effort against inflation, for us to give
it a meaning other than that which the language in the
context of its history yields. Of course, all provisions of
the Emergency Price Control Act are infused by its farreaching aims. But the accommodation of the various
interests involved in a system of price control is for Congress and not for us, and we must construe its legislation as
fairly as we can to catch the will behind the words. That
the construction we have placed upon the Taft Amendment does not touch the vital forces in price control is
indicated by the Government's opposition to a review of
this litigation on the ground that it was devoid of much
practical significance.
It only remains to unsnarl the complicated procedures
by which the petitioners sought to establish the invalidity
of the regulation which they were charged with violating.
On June 15, 1944, petitioners filed a protest against
§ 1347.14 (d) under § 203 (a) of the Act. 56 Stat. 23, 31,
58 Stat. 632, 638; 50 U. S. C. App. § 923 (a). By this
time, as has been noted, the Administrator had amended
the regulation to conform in terms with the Taft Amendment. The Administrator denied the protest on the merits and also expressed doubt as to his power to consider
the validity of a regulation of which the alleged defects
had been cured. The Emergency Court of Appeals sustained the Administrator on the ground that a corrected
regulation bars protest. Thomas Paper Stock Co. v.
Bowles, 148 F. 2d 831. We then brought the case here as
one of a series of cases raising important issues in the
enforcement of the Emergency Price Control Act. 326
U. S. 715.
In the meantime petitioners invoked § 204 (e) of the
Act, 58 Stat. 632, 639; 50 U. S. C. App\ § 924 (e), whereby
they sought leave to file a complaint directly with the

Emergency Court. The District Court, before which the
criminal prosecution was pending, granted such leave pursuant to § 204 (e). The Emergency Court then passed on
the merits of the claim of the invalidity of the regulation in
controversy between the date of the Taft Amendment and
September 11, 1943, when in Supp. Order 64, 8 Fed. Reg.
12554, the Administrator determined the necessity for
standards. That court, as we have seen, held that the
old regulation survived the Taft Amendment, Thomas
Paper Stock Co. v. Bowles, 151 F. 2d 345, and we granted
certiorari. 326 U. S. 715.
It is this latter judgment, in No. 578, that we now reverse with the result that disregard of the regulation based
on standardized prices for wastepaper not "determined"
by the Administrator prior to September 11, 1943, does
not subject petitioners to the penalties of the Price Control
Act. In view of disposition in No. 578 of the merits of
petitioner's claim of invalidity under the Taft Amendment it would be futile to decide the issue on which judgment went in No. 67. Accordingly, the writ of certiorari
issued in No. 67 will be dismissed.

took no part in the consideration

or decision of these cases.
MR. JUSTICE BLAcx, dissenting.
The judgment which the Court just rendered permits
these petitioners and others to keep profits obtained from
sales made at inflationary prices expressly prohibited by
Maximum Price Regulation No. 30. That Regulation
establishes dollar and cent ceiling prices for thirty-two
grades of wastepaper defined by the Price Administrator.
It is the type of regulation, of which there have been
many, which controls prices by first standardizing or
grouping similar commodities, and then fixing one and

the same maximum price for each of the commodities in
a particular classification. On July 16, 1943, long after
Regulation No. 30 was promulgated and fully in force,
Congress added the Taft Amendment (§ 2 (j)) to the
Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. The Court holds
that Congress intended by this Amendment to invalidate
automatically Price Regulation No. 30, and all the numerous regulations like it, until such time as the Price
Administrator should find it possible, amidst all his pressing duties, to investigate and make determinations, formally expressed in writing, that only by standardizing or
grouping certain commodities could price control over
them be successfully enforced. Since the task of rechecking all past regulations which contained standardization
provisions was very great, the Administrator did not find
time to reach the Regulation here involved until two,
months after the Amendment's enactment. The Court
holds that during this interval the public had no protection whatever from inflationary prices prohibited by
this Regulation. In my opinion this holding finds support neither in the Section's language nor its legislative
history.
When the sponsor of the Taft Amendment offered it on
the Senate floor his statement clearly indicated that it
grew out of cooperative effort between the legislators and
the Price Administrator, who certainly would not be interested in throwing a monkey wrench into 0. P. A.'s enforcement of the existing regulations. Referring to provisions
of the Act which his Amendment was intended to clarify,
Senator Taft said: "Price Administrator Brown came
before the committee and urged that it would seriously
hamper his price regulations in a number of trades, regulations for which had already been issued, to many of
which there was no objection. He submitted another

form of amendment, carrying out the same purpose, but
,making it perfectly clear that it would not interfere with
those regulations, which are proper." Cong. Rec. July 6,
1943, Vol. 89, p. 7251.
In spite of this clear declaration on the part of Senator
Taft of his intention to save "proper" existing regulations,
the Court now gives the Taft Price Administrator Amendment a meaning which does "interfere with those regulations." It not only interferes with them; it completely
destroys their effectiveness for an indefinite interval of
time. These petitioners and others are wholly freed from
any possible penalty for deliberate inflationary overcharges, forbidden by Congress, during the period between
the passage of the Amendment and the Administrator's
publication of his determinations. That the Regulation
here involved was a "proper" regulation on the day the
Taft Amendment was passed is conceded. That its standardization provisions were at all times necessary to the
effective enforcement of the Act is shown both by the
Administrator's later findings and by his original promulgation. Consequently, it is this Court, and not the Congress, which must take the responsibility for permitting
petitioners to violate the price regulation with impunity.
Furthermore, the Taft Amendment's language offers no
support for the Court's decision. For by its terms it
neither repeals nor renders unenforceable or ineffective
valid outstanding regulations which standardize commodities. And in addition to what has already been pointed
out, the prevailing circumstances at the time of its enactment make it highly improbable that Congress intended
such a result. At the time the Amendment was enacted
the threat of inflation was the greatest since the outbreak
of the war. Just in April the President had thought it
necessary to issue his well-known "Hold-the-Line Order"

in order to tighten controls designed to stem the inflationary trend. Purchasing power was very great and consumer
goods had become extremely scarce. Had Congress really
intended to protect the public against inflation, as its legislation shows it did, it would not have chosen this time for
relaxing government controls. The giving of free reign
to inflationary pressure was likely to endanger seriously
our economy and to bring great hardship to many individuals. I cannot, without a clear declaration to that
effect with respect to any part of our economy, impute to
Congress an intent to let inflation run riot during such
critical times. I cannot conclude, therefore, as the opinion of the Court necessarily does, that Congress intended
to suspend all Maximum Price Regulations containing
standardization provisions until the Price Administrator
reviewed them.
What then was the purpose of Congress in enacting the
Taft Amendment? The Managers on the part of the
House thus stated the Section's purpose in the Conference
Report on the Amendment: It "is to meet the objection
that the Price Administrator has exceeded the limitations
expressed in section 2 (h) of . . . [the 1942 Price Control
Act] in issuing certain regulations already promulgated."
(Italics supplied.) Section 2 (h) provides: "The powers
granted . . . shall not be used or made to operate to compel changes in the business practices, cost practices or
methods, or means or aids to distribution, established in
any industry, except to prevent circumvention or evasion
of any regulation, order, price schedule, or requirement
under this Act." (Italics supplied.) As the Conference
Report indicates, the Taft Amendment actually added
little new, if anything at all, to the requirements already
contained in § 2 (h). It was merely an explanation and
elaboration of one phase of the requirements of)§-2 (h).

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
BLACK, J., dissenting.

328 U. S.

Any regulation, including the one here held invalid, that
was promulgated when § 2 (h) was in effect had to meet
its requirements. As later explained by the Taft Amendment, the requirements of § 2 (h) which permitted the
Administrator to require changed business practices to
prevent "circumvention or evasion" included, in the case
of regulations containing new standardization provisions,
a determination that there was no practical alternative to
effective price control. All standardization provisions, including the one here held invalid, in order to be valid under
the old § 2 (h) had to be based on such a determination.
The Taft Amendment was not, as the Court now holds, a
declaration by Congress that all past standardization provisions had not been based on such a determination and
that they were therefore invalid. Here the Regulation in
question was promulgated while § 2 (h) was in full force
and effect. Not only did petitioners fail to show that the
Regulation was not based on the determination required
by § 2 (h) as explained by the Taft Amendment, but the
Administrator, after the Amendment was enacted, and
before any proceedings were brought against petitioners,
double checked the Regulation to make sure that it was
based on the determination required. It is not denied,
and apparently cannot be denied, that it was absolutely
necessary for the Administrator to order these changed
standardization practices in order to prevent circumvention or evasion. In my opinion, therefore, the wastepaper
provisions of Maximum Price Regulation No. 30 were
valid at all times, since they met the requirements of
§ 2 (h) as explained by § 2 (j). I would affirm the judgment below, which dismissed the complaint.
