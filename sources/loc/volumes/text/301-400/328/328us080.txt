Statement of the Case.

328 U. S.

QUEENSIDE HILLS REALTY CO., INC. v. SAXL,
COMMISSIONER OF HOUSING AND BUILDINGS
OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW YORK.

No. 769.

Argued March 28, 1946.-Decided April 22, 1946.

In 1940 appellant constructed a lodging house in New York, complying with all applicable laws then in force. In 1944 New York
amended its Multiple Dwelling Law so as to provide that lodging
houses of "non-fireproof construction existing prior to the enactment" of the amendment should comply with certain new requirements, including the installation of an automatic wet pipe sprinkler
system. Appellant asserted that its building did not constitute a
fire hazard or a danger to its occupants; that it had a market value
of $25,000; that the cost of complying with the 1944 law would be
$7,500; and that the benefits to be obtained by the changes were
negligible. Held:
1. The law does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it is within the police power of the State
and the owner of property does not acquire immunity against the
exercise of the police power by constructing.it in full compliance
with existing laws. P. 82.
2. In the absence of a showing that there are in existence other
lodging houses of the same category which will escape its requirem'ents, the law can not be held to violate the equal protection clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment 'because of its failure to apply to
lodging houses which might be erected subsequently; since lack of
equal protection is found in the actual existence of an invidious
discrimination and not in the mere possibility that there will be like
or similar cases which will be treated more leniently. Pp. 83-85.
3. The wisdom of the legislation and the need for it are questions
for the legislature. P. 82.
294 N. Y. 917, 63 N. E. 2d 116, affirmed.

Appellant sued in the New York courts for a declaratory
judgment holding certain provisions of the New York
Multiple Dwelling Law (L. 1929, c. 713) as amended in
1944 (L. 1944, c. 553) unconstitutional and restraining
eir enforcement. The Supreme Court dismissed the

suit. The Appellate Division affirmed. 269 App. Div.

that questions involving the Fourteenth Amendment were
presented and necessarily passed upon. 295 N. Y. 567,

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the

opinion of the

Court.
In 1940 appellant constructed a four-story building on
the Bowery in New York City and since that time has
operated it as a lodging house. It was constructed so as
to comply with all the laws applicable to such lodging
houses and in force at that time. New York amended its
Multiple Dwelling Law1 in 1944,2 providing, inter alia,
that lodging houses "of non-fireproof construction existing
prior to the enactment of this subdivision"' should comply with certain new requirements.' Among these was
the installation of an automatic wet pipe sprinkler system.
Appellant received notice to comply with the new requirements and thereupon instituted this suit in the New York
courts for a declaratory judgment holding these provisions
of the 1944 law unconstitutional and restraining their
enforcement.

I This followed a disastrous fire in an old lodging house in New York
City in which there was a considerable loss of life.

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of the Court.

328 U. S.

The bill alleged that the building was safe for occupancy as a lodging house and did not constitute a fire
hazard or a danger to the occupants; that it complied with
all building laws and regulations at the time of its construction; that part of it was fireproof and that the rest was
so constructed as not to be dangerous to occupants; that
the regulations existing prior to 1944 were adequate and
sufficient to prevent loss of life in lodging houses of this
particular type. It was further alleged that this lodging
house has a market value of about $25,000, that the cost
of complying with the 1944 law would be about $7,500; and
that the benefits to be obtained by the changes were negligible. By reason of those circumstances the 1944 law
was alleged to violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It was also alleged to violate the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
since it was applicable to lodging'houses "existing" prior
to the 1944 law but not to identical structures erected
thereafter. Appellee answered, denying the material allegations of the bill, and moved to dismiss. The Supreme
Court granted the motion. The Appellate Division affirmed without opinion. 269 App. Div. 691, 54 N. Y. S. 2d
394. On appeal to the Court of Appeals the judgment
was likewise affirmed without opinion. 294 N. Y. 917, 63
N. E. 2d 116. The case is here.on appeal, (he Court of
Appeals having certified by its remittitur that questions
involving the Fourteenth Amendment were presented
and necessarily passed upon. 295 N. Y. 567, 64 N. E. 2d
278.
Little need be said on the due process question. We are
not concerned with the wisdom of this legislation or the
need for. it. Olsen v. Nebraska, 313 U. S. 236, 246. Protection of the safety of persons is one of the traditional uses
of the police power of the States. Experts may differ as to
the most appropriate way of dealing with fire hazards' in
lodging houses. Appellant, iideed, says that its building,

QUEENSIDE HILLS CO. v. SAXL.

Opinion of the Court.

far from being a fire-trap, is largely fireproof; and to the
extent that any fire hazards exist, they are adequately
safeguarded by a fire alarm system, constant watchman
service, and other safety'arrangements. But the legislature may choose not to take the chance thathuman life will
be lost in lodging house fires and a.dobt the most conse vative course which science and engineering offer. It is for
the legislature to decide what regulations are needed to
reduce fire hazards to the minimum. Many types of social
legislation diminish the value of the property which is
regulated. The extreme cases are those where in the interest of the public safety or welfare the owner is prohibited from using his property.- Reinman v. Little Rock,
237 U. S. 171; Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394;
Pierce Oil Corp. v. Hope, 248 U. S. 498. We are dealing
here with a less drastic measure. But in no case does the
owner of property acquire immunity against exercise of
the police power because he constructed it in full compliance with the existing laws. Hadacheck v. Sebastian,
supra, p. 410. And see Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Nebraska, 170 U. S. 57; Hutchinson v. Valdosta, 227 U. S. 303.
The police power is one of the least limitable of governmental powers, and in its operation often cuts down
property rights. Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135, 155. And
see Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 531.
Appellant may have a lodging house far less hazardous
than the other existing structures regulated by the 1944
law. Yet a statute may be sustained though some of the
objects affected by it may be wholly innocent. Purity
Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192, 204. The question
of validity turns on the power of the legislature to deal
with the prescribed class. That power plainly exists
here.
Appellant's claim of lack of equal protection is based
on the following argument: The 1944 law applies only to

existing lodging houses; if a new lodging house were
erected or if an existing building were converted into a
lodging house, the 1944 law would be inapplicable. An
exact duplicate of appellant's building, if constructed
today, would not be under the 1944 law and hence could
be lawfully operated without the installation of. a wet pipe
sprinkler system. That is said to be a denial of equal
protection of the laws.
The difficulty is that appellant has not shown that there
are in existence lodging houses of that category which will
escape the law. The argument is based on an anticipation
that there may come into existence a like or identical class
of lodging houses which will be treated less harshly. But
so long as that class is not in existence, no showing of lack
of equal protection can possibly be made. For under
*those circumstances the burden which is on one who challenges the constitutionality of a law could not be satisfied.
Metropolitan Casualty Insurance Co. v. Brownell, 294
U. S. 580, 584. The legislature is entitled to hit the evil
that exists. Patsone v. Pennsylvania,232 U. S. 138, 144;
Bryant v. Zimmerman, 278 U. S. 63; Bain Peanut Co: v.
Pinson, 282 U. S.499. It need not take account of new
and hypothetical inequalities that may come into existence as time passes or as conditions change. So far as we
know, the 1944 law may have been designed as a stop-gap
measure to take care of a pressing need until more comprehensive legislation could be prepared. Itis common
knowledge that due to war conditions there has been little
construction in this field in recent years. By the time new
lodging houses appear they, too, may be placed under the
1944 law; or different legislation may be adopted to take
care both of the old and thenew on the basis of parity. Or
stricter standards for new lodging houses may be adopted.
In any such case the asserted discrimination would have
turned out to be -fanciful, not real. The point is that lack
