CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 349. Argued March 25, 1946.-Decided May 20, 1946.
1. A federal court jury panel from which persons who work for a daily
wage were intentionally and systematically excluded held unlawfully
constituted. Pp. 221, 225.
2. Such discrimination against daily wage earners as a class was not
justified by e:ther federal or California law. P. 222.
3. The choice of the means by which unlawful distinctions and discriminations in the selection of jury panels are to be avoided rests
largely in the sound discretion of the trial courts and their officers.
P. 220.
4. The pay period of an individual is irrelevant to his eligibility and
capacity to serve as a juror. P. 223.
5. Although a federal judge may be justified in excusing a daily wage
earner for whom jury service would entail an.undue financial hardship, that fact can not support the complete exclusion of all daily
wage earners regardless of whether there is actual hardship involved.

Petitioner brought suit in a state court against the railroad company to recover damages for alleged negligence
in its treatment of him while a passenger on one of its
trains. On application of the railroad company, the suit
was removed to the federal district court on the ground of
diversity of citizenship. The judgment of the District
Court. upon a trial by jury, was in favor of the railroad
company. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.. 149 F.

Petitioner, a passenger, jumped out of the window, of

Pacific Company. He filed a complaint in a California
state court to recover damages, alleging that the respondent's agents knew that he was "out of his normal mind"
and should not be accepted as a passenger or else should
be guarded and that, having accepted him as a passenger,
they left him unguarded and failed to stop the train before
he finally fell to the ground. At respondent's request the
case was removed to the Federal District Court at San
Francisco on the ground of diversity of citizenship,
respondent being a Kentucky corporation. Several vain
attempts were then made by the petitioner to obtain a
remand of the case to the state court; petitioner was also
restrained from attempting to proceed further in the state
court.'
After demanding a jury trial, petitioner moved to strike
out the entire jury panel, alleging inter alia that "mostly
business executives or those having the employer's viewpoint are purposely selected on said panel, thus giving a
majority representation to one class or occupation and
discriminating against other occupations and classes, particularly the employees and those in the poorer classes
who constitute, by far, the great majority of citizens eligible for jury service . . ." Following a hearing at which
testimony was taken, the motion was denied. Petitioner
then attempted to withdraw his demand for a jury trial
but the respondent refused to consent. A jury of twelve
was chosen. Petitioner thereupon challenged these jurors
upon the same grounds previously urged in relation to the
entire jury panel and upon the further ground that six
of the twelve jurors were closely affiliated and connected
with the respondent. The court denied this challenge.
The trial proceeded and the jury returned a verdict for
the respondent.
The injunction against petitioner proceeding in the state court was
affirmed upon appeal. Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 126 F. 2d 710;

Opinion of the Court.

328 U. S.

Petitioner renewed his objections in his motion to set
aside the verdict or, in the alternative, to grant a new
trial. In denying this motion the court orally found that
five of the twelve jurors "belong more closely and ,intimately with the working man and employee class than
they do with any other class" and that they might be
expected to be "sympathetic with the experiences in life,
the affairs of life, and with the economic views, of people
who belong to the working or employee class." The
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in
its entirety, 149 F. 2d 783, and we brought the case here
on certiorari "limited to the question whether petitioner's
motion to strike the jury pinel was properly denied."
The American tradition of trial by jury, considered in
connection with either criminal or civil proceedings, necessarily contemplates an impartial jury drawn from a
cross-section of the community. Smith v. Texas, 311
U. S. 128, 130; Glasser v. United States, 315 U. S. 60, 85.
This does not mean, of course, that every jury must contain representatives of all the economic, social, religious,
racial, political and geographical groups of the community; frequently. such complete representation would be
impossible. But it does mean that prospective jurors
shall be selected by court officials without systematic and
intentional exclusion of any of these groups. Recognition
must be given to the fact that those eligible for jury service
are to be found in every stratum of society. Jury competence is an individual rather than a group or class matter.
That fact lies at the very heart of the jury system. To
cisregard it is to open the door to class distinctions and
discriminations which are abhorrent to the democratic
ideals of trial by jury.
The choice of the means by which unlawful distinctions
and discriminations are to be avoided rests largely in the
sound discretion of the trial courts and their officers. This

THIEL v. SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO.
217

Opinion of the Court.

discretion, of course, must be guided by pertinent statutory provisions. So far as federal jurors are concerned,
they must be chosen "without reference to party affiliations," 28 U. S. C. § 412; and citizens cannot' be disqualified "on account of race, color, or previous condition of
servitude," 28 U. S. C. § 415. In addition, jurors must
be returned from such parts of the district as the court
may direct "so as to be most favorable to an impartial
trial, and so as not to incur an unnecessary expense, or
unduly burden the citizens of any part of the district with
such service," 28 U. S. C. §413. For the most part, of
course, -the qualifications and exemptions in regard to
federal jurors are to be determined by the laws of the state
where the federal court is located, 28 U. S. C. § 411.2
Pointer v. United States, 151 U. S. 396. A state law creating an unlawful qualification, however, i not binding
and should not be utilized in selecting federal jurors. See
Kie v. United States, 27 F. 351, 357.
The undisputed evidence in this case demonstrates a
failure to abide by the proper rules and principles of jury
selection. Both the clerk of the court and the jury commissioner testified that they deliberately and intentionally
excluded from the jury lists all persons who work for a
daily wage. They generally used the city directory as the
2 Federal statutes prohibit the service by any person as a petit juror
"more than one term in a year," 28 U. S. C. § 423, exempt from jury
service artificers and workmen employed in the armories and arsenals
of the United States, 50 U. S. C. § 57, and set up disqualifications for
service as a juryman or talesman "in any prosecution for bigamy,
polygamy, or unlawful cohabitation, under any statute of the United
States," 28 U. S. C. § 426.

source of names of prospective jurors. In the words of the
clerk, "If I see in the directory the name of John Jones
and it says he is a longshoreman, I do not put his name in,
because I have found by experience that that man will
not serve as a juror, and I will not get people who will
qualify. The minute that a juror is called into court on
a venire and says he is working for $10 a day and cannot
afford to work for four, the Judge has never made one of
those men serve, and so in order to avoid putting names
of people in who I know won't become jurors in the court,
won't qualify as jurors in this court, I do leave them
out. . . . Where I thought the designation indicated
that they were day laborers, I mean they were people who
were compensated solely when they were working by the
day, I leave them out." The jury commissioner corroborated this testimony, adding that he purposely excluded
"all the iron craft, bricklayers, carpenters, and machinists"
because in the past "those men came into court and offered
that [financial hardship] as an excuse, and the judge usually let them go.". The evidence indicated, however, that
laborers who were paid weekly or monthly wages were
placed on the jury lists, as well as the wives of daily wage
earners.
It was further admitted that business men and their
wives constituted at least 50% of the jury lists, although
both the clerk and the commissioner denied that they consciously chose according to wealth or occupation. Thus
the admitted discrimination was limited to those who
worked for a daily wage, many of whom might suffer financial loss by serving on juries at the rate of $4 aday and
would be excused for that reason.
This exclusion of all those who earn a daily wage cannot
be justified by federal or state law. Certainly nothing in
the federal statutes warrants such an exclusion. And the
California statutes are equally devoid of justification for

THIEL v. SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO.
217

Opinion of the Court.

the practice. Under California law a daily wage earner
may be fully competent as a juror. A juror, to be competent, need only be a citizen of the United States over the
age of 21, a resident of the state and county for one year
preceding selection, possessed of his natural faculties and
of ordinary intelligence and not decrepit, and possessed of
sufficient knowledge of the English language. California
Code of Civil Procedure, § 198. Cf. § 199. Nor is a daily
wage earner listed among those exempt from jury service.
§ 200. And under the state law, "A juror shall not be
excused by a court for slight or trivial causes, or for hardship, or for inconvenience to said juror's business, but
only when material injury or destruction to said juror's
property or of property entrusted to said juror is threatened . . ." § 201.
Moreover, the general principles underlying proper jury
selection clearly outlaw the exclusion practiced in this
instance. Jury competence is not limited to those who
earn their livelihood on other than a daily basis. One
who is paid $3 a day may be as fully competent as one
who is paid $30 a week or $300 a month. In other words,
the pay period of a particular individual is completely
irrelevant to his eligibility and capacity to serve as a juror.
Wage earners, including those who are paid by the day,
constitute a very substantial portion of the community,3
a portion that cannot be intentionally and systematically
excluded in whole or in part without doing violence to the
democratic nature of the jury system. Were we to sanc- /
tion an exclusion of this nature we would encourage whatever desires those responsible for the selection of jury panels may have to discriminate against persons of low

economic and social status. We would breathe life into
any latent tendencies to establish the jury as the instrument of the economically and socially privileged. That
we refuse to do.
It is clear that a federal judge would be justified in excusing a daily wage earner for whom jury service would
entail an undue financial hardship.4 But that fact cannot
support the complete exclusion of all daily wage earners
regardless of whether there is actual hardship involved.
Here there was no effort, no intention, to determine in
advance which individual members of the daily wage earning class would suffer an undue hardship by serving on a
jury at the rate of $4 a day. All were systematically and
automatically excluded. In this connection it should be
noted that the mere fact that a person earns more than $4 a
day would not serve as an excuse. Jury service is a duty as
well as a privilege of citizenship; it is a duty that cannot
be shirked on a plea of inconvenience or decreased earning
power. Only when the financial embarrassment is such
as to impose a real burden and hardship does a valid excuse
of this nature appear. Thus a blanket exclusion of all
daily wage earners, however well-intentioned and however
justified by prior actions of trial judges, must be counted
among those -tendencies which undermine and weaken the
institution of jury trial. "That the motives influencing
such tendencies may be of the best must not blind us to
the dangers of allowing any encroachment whatsoever on
this essential right. Steps innocently taken may, one by

one, lead to the irretrievable impairment of substantial
liberties." Glasser v. United States, supra, 86.
It follows that we cannot sanction the method by which
the jury panel was formed in this case. The trial court
should have granted petitioner's motion to strike the,panel.
That conclusion requires us to reverse the judgment below
in the exercise of our power of supervision over the administration of justice in the federal courts. See McNabb v.
United States, 318 U.S. 332,340. On that basis it becomes
unliecessary to determine whether the petitioner was in
any way prejudiced by the wrongful exclusion or whether
he was one of the excluded class. See Glasser v. United
States, supra; Walter v. State, 208 Ind. 231, 195 N. E. 2C8;
State ex rel. Passer v. County Board, 171 Minn. 177, 213
N. W. 545. It is likewise immaterial that the jury
which actually decided the factual issue in the case was
found to contain at least five members of the laboring
class. The evil lies in the admitted wholesale exclusion
of a large class of wage earners in disregard of the high
standards of jury selection. To reassert those standards,
to guard against the subtle undermining of the jury system, requires a new trial by a jury drawn from a panel
properly and fairly chosen.

tioner. The District Court found no ground for setting it
aside and entered judgment on the verdict. -Upon full
review of the trial, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment. 149 F. 2d 783.
Thus, a verdict arrived at by a jury whose judgment on the
merits the District Court has found unassailable, which
the Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed on the merits,
and which this Court hai refused to review on the merits,
326 U. S. 716, is here ,nullified because of an abstract
objection to the manner in which the district judges for
the Northern District of California have heretofore generally discharged their duty, with the approval of the
reviewing judges of the Ninth Circuit, to secure appropriate jury panels.
The process of justice must of course not be tainted by
property prejudice any more than by racial or religious
prejudice. The task of guarding against such prejudice
devolves upon the district judges, who have the primary
responsibility for the selection of jurors, and the circuit
judges, whose review of verdicts is normally final. It is
embraced in the duty, formulated by the judicial oath, to
"administer justice without respect -to persons, and do
equal right to the poor and to the rich . . ." 1 Stat. 73,
76, 36 Stat. 1087, 1161; 28 U. S. C. § 372. But it is not
suggested that the jury was selected so as to bring property prejudice into play in relation to this specific case or
type of case, nor is there the basis for contending that the
trial judge allowed the selective process to be manipulated
in favor of the particular defendant. No such claim is
now sustained.' Neither is it claimed that the district
judges for the Northern District of California, with the
approval of the circuit judges, designed racial, religious,
social, or economic discrimination to influence the makeup
of jury panels, or that such infair, influence infused the
selection of the panel, or was reflected in those who were

THIEL v. SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO.
217

J., dissenting.

chosen as jurors in this case. Nor is there any suggestion
that the method of selecting the jury in this case was an
innovation. What is challenged isa long-standing practice adopted in order to deal with the special hardship
which jury service entails for workers paid by the day.
What is challenged, in short, is not a covert attempt to
benefit the propertied but a practice designed, wisely or
unwisely, to relieve the economically least secure from the
financial burden which jury service. involves under existing
circumstances.
No constitutional issue is at stake. The problem is one
of judicial administration. The sole question over which
the Court divides is whether the established practice in the
Northern District of California not to call for jury duty
those otherwise qualified but dependent on a daily wage
for their livelihood requires reversal of a judgment which
is inherently without flaw.
Trial by jury presupposes a jury drawn from a pool
broadly representative of the community as well as impartial in a specific case. Since the color of a man's skin
is unrelated to his fitness as a juror, negroes cannot be
excluded from jury service because they are negroes.
E. g., Carter v. Texas, 177 U. S. 442. A group may be
excluded for reasons that are relevant not to their fitness
but to competing considerations of public interest, as is
true of the exclusion of doctors, minist, rs, lawyers, and
the like. Rawlins v. Georgia, 201 U. S. 638. But the
broad representative character of the jury should be maintained, partly as assurance of a diffused impartiality and
partly because sharing in the administration of justice is a
phase of civic responsibility. See Smith v. Texas, 311
U. S. 128, 130.
Obviously these accepted general considerations must
have much leeway in application. In the abstract the
Court acknowledges this. "The choice of the means by

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.

38 U. S.

which unlawful distinctions and discriminstions are to be
avoided rests largely in the sound discretion of the trial
courts and their officers." Congress has made few inroads
upon this discretion. Its chief enactment underlines the
importance of avoiding rigidities in the jury system and
recognizes that ample play must be allowed the joints
of the machinery. The First Judiciary Act adopted for
the federal courts the qualifications and exemptions, with
all their diversities, prevailing in the States where the federal courts sit. 1 Stat. 73, 88. That has remained the
law. 36 Stat. 1087, 1164; 28 U. S. C. § 411. (For a collection of federal statutes regulating the composition and
selection of jurors, see 37 Harv. L. Rev. 1010, 1098-1100.)
We would hardly have taken this case to consider whether
the federal court in San Francisco deviated from the requirements of California law, and nothing turns on that
here. But it is not without illumination that under California law all those belonging to this long string of occupations are exempted from jury service: judicial, civil;
naval, and military officers of the United States or California; local government officials; attorneys, their clerks,
secretaries, and stenographers; ministers; teachers; physicians, dentists, chiropodists, optometrists, an6 druggists;
officers, keepers, and attendants at hospitals or other
charitable institutions; officers in attendance at prisons
and jails; employees on boats and ships in navigable
waters; express agents, mail carriers, employees of telephone and telegraph companies; keepers of ferries or tollgates; national guardsmen and firemep; superintendents,
engineers, firemen, brakemen, motormen, or conductors of
railroads; practitioners treating the sick by prayer. California Code of Civil Procedure,§ 200.
Placed in its proper framework the question now before

District of California, supported by the circuit judges of

the Ninth Circuit, abused their discretion in sanctioning
a practice of not calling for jury duty those who are dependent upon a daily wage for their livelihood?
The precise issue must be freed from all atmospheric
innuendoes. Not to do so is unfair to the administration
of justice, which should be the touchstone for the disposition of the judgment under challenge, and no less unfair
to a group of judges of long experience and tested fidelity.
If workmen were systematically not drawn for the jury,
the practice would be indefensible. But concern over
discrimination against wage earners must be put out of the
reckoning. Concededly those who are paid weekly or
mohthly wages were placed on the jury lists. And that
no line was drawn against the wage earners because they
were wage earners, and that there was merely anticipatory
excuse of daily wage earners, is conclusively established
by the fact that the wives of such daily wage earners were
included in the jury lists. As to any claim of the operation of a designed economic bias in the method of selecting
the juries, the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly found "no
evidence that the persons whose names were in the box, or
the persons whose names were drawn therefrom and who
thus became members of the panel, were 'mostly business
executives or those having the employer's viewpoint.'"
149 F. 2d 783, 786.
"When the question is narrowed to its proper form the
answer does not need much discussion. The nature of the
classes excluded was not such as was likely to affect the
conduct of the members as jurymen, or.to make them act
otherwise than those who were drawn would act. The
exclusion was not the result of race or class prejudice. It
does not even appear that any of the defendants belonged
to any of the excluded classes. The ground of omission no
doubt was that pointed out by the state court, that the
business of the persons omitted was such that either they

would have been entitled to claim exemption or that probably they would have been excused." So this Court
speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes answered a related
question in Rawlins v. Georgia, 201 U. S.638, 640. And
the justification for the answer applies to the present
situation.
It is difficult to believe that this judgment would have
been reversed if the trial judge had excused, one by one,
all those wage earners whom the jury commissioner, acting
on the practice of trial judges of San Francisco, excluded.
For it will hardly be contended that the absence of such
daily wage earners from the jury panel removed a group
who would act otherwise than workers paid by the week or
the wives of the daily wage earners themselves. The
exclusion of the daily wage earners does not remove a
group who would, in the language of Mr. Justice Holmes,
"act otherwise than those who are drawn would act."
Judged by the trend of census statistics, laborers paid by
the day are not a predominant portion of the workers of
the country. See Sixteenth Census of the United States,
1940, Population, Vol. III, The Labor Force, Part 2, pp.
290 et seq. it certainly is too large an assumption on
which to base judicial action that those workers who are
paid by the day have a different outlook psychologically
and economic.1 1y than those who earn weekly wages. In
the language of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, "Impartiality
is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind."
UnitedStates v. Wood, 299 U. S.123,145. And American
society is happily not so fragmentized that those who get
paid by the day adopt a different social outlook, have a
different sense of justice, and a different conception of a
juror's responsibility than their fellow workers paid by
the week. No doubt the insecurities of a system of daily
earnings, or generally of wages on less than an annual
basis raise serious problems as does, of course, also the

THIEL v. SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO.

question of guaranteed wage plans. See the letter of
President Roosevelt to the Director of War Mobilization,
James F,Byrnes, on the date of March 20, 1945, carrying
out the suggestion of a report to the President by the War
Labor Board for the creation of a Commission to study
the question of guaranteed wage plans. And see Basic
Steel Case, 19 W. L. B. 568, 653 et seq.; N. W. L. B. Research and Statistics Report No. 25, Guaranteed Employment and Annual Wage Plans (1944). But these are matters quite irrelevant to the problem confronting district
judges in dealing with the present plight of daily wage
earners when called to serve as jurors and the power of the
judges, as a m'atter of discretion, to excuse such daily wage
earners from duty.
For it cannot be denied that jury service by persons
dependent upon a daily wage imposes a very real burden.
Judge John C. Knox, Senior District Judge of the Southern District of New York, thus described the problem:
id... when jurors' compensation islimited to $4 per
day, and when their periods of service are often protracted, thousands upon thousands of persons simply
cannot afford to serve. To require them to do so is
nothing less than the imposition upon them of
extreme hardship.
"With respect to the item last-mentioned, it is easy
to say that jury duty should be regarded as a patriotic
service, and that all public-spirited persong phould
willingly sacrifice pecuniary rewards in the performance of an obligation of citizenship. With that statement I am in full accord, but it does not solve the
difficulty. Adequate provision for one's family is the
first consideration of most men. And if, with this
thought predominant in a man's mind, he is required
to perform a public service that means a default of an
insurance premium, the sacrifice of a suit of clothes,

or the loss of this [his] job, he will entertain feelings
of resentment that will be anything but conducive to
the rendition of justice. In.other words, persons
with a grievance against the Government or who serve
under conditions that expose them to self-denial are
not likely to have the spiritual contentment and
mental detachment that good jurors require." Hearings before H. R. Committee on the Judiciary on

Sess. (1945) 8.
No doubt, in view of the changes in the composition and
distribution of 'our population and the growth of metropolitan areas, a reexamination is due of the operation of
the jury system in the federal courts. Just as the federal
judicial system has been reorganized and administratively
modified through a series of recent enactments (see Actof
September 14, 1922, 42 Stat. 837, 838, 28 U. S. C. §§ 218
et seq.; Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936, 28 U. S. C.
§§ 41 et seq.; Act of August 7, 1939, 53 Stat. 1223, 28
U. S. C. §§ 444 et seq.), the jury system, that indispensable
adjunct of the federal courts, calls for review to meet modern conditions. The object is to devise a system that is
fairly representative of our variegated population, exacts
the obligation' of citizenship to share in the administration
of justice without operating too harshly upon any section
of the community, and is duly regardful of the public interest in matters outside the jury system. This means
that the many factors entering into the manner of selection, with appropriate qualifications and exemptions, the
length, of service and the basis of compensation must be
properly balanced. These are essentially problems in
administration calling for appropriate standards flexibly
adjusted.
Wise answers preclude treatment by rigid legislation or
rigid administration. Congress has devised the appro-

priate procedure and instrument for making these difficult
and delicate adjustments by its creation, in 1922, of the
Conference of Senior Circuit Judges. The Conference
under the presidency of the Chief Justice of the United
States, is charged with the duty of continuous oversight
of the actual workings of the federal judicial system and
of meeting disclosed needs, either through practices formulated by the Conference, or, when legislation is necessary
or more appropriate, through proposals submitted to Congress. See 40 Harv. L. Rev. 431. That is precisely the
course that has been followed in regard to the inadequacies
in the operation of the federal jury system. In September, 1941, the'late Chief Justice brought the matter before
the Conference. As a result, Mr. Chief Justice Stone appointed a committee of experienced district judges, see
Report.of the Judicial Conference (.941) 16, under the
chairmanship of Judge Knox who, because of the length
and richness of his experience in the busiest district of the
country, brought unusual equipment for devising appropriate reforms. In September, 1942, the Committee
reported, Report to the Judicial Conference of the Committee on Selection of Jurors (1942) 1, and submitted
proposals for legislation. Id. at 44, 62, 107. Bills to
carry out these recommendations were introduced in the
Senate on January 11, 1944, S. 1623, 1624, 1625, 78th
Cong., 2d Sess., and in the House on June 5, 1945, H. R.
3379, 3380, 3381, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. Hearings were had
upon the House Bills on June 12 and 13, 1945, and action
on them is now pending.
The Court now deals by adjudication with one phase of
an organic problem and does so by nullifying a judgment
which, on the record, was wholly unaffected by difficulties
inherent in a situation that calls for comprehensive treatment, both -legislative and administrative. If it be suggested that until there is legislation this decision will be
