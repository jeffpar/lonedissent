APPEAL from a judgment for the defendants in a suit
brought by the United States to quiet title.
Solicitor General Fahy and Mr. Alex. H. Bell, Jr. were
on the brief for the United States.
Messrs. Milton D. Campbell and Walter M. Bastian
were on the brief for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia was brought by the United States under the Act of
April 27,1912, c. 96,37 Stat. 93, to establish and make clear
its title to certain parcels of land adjacent to the Anacostia
River. The District Court entered judgment for the defendants, and the United States seeks a direct appeal to
this Court under § 5 of that Act, which provides: "That
from the final decree of the Supreme Court of the District
of Columbia... an appeal shall be allowed to the United
States, and to any other party in the cause complaining of such decree, to the Supreme Court of the United
States. .... "

Section 238 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the
Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936, 938, 28 U. S. C.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

§ 345, permits direct review by this Court of the judgments
of the district courts in only five specified categories, "and
not otherwise." The case at bar is within neither those
categories nor that recognized by Ex parte Kawato, 317
U. S. 69, and Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, viz., the use of
auxiliary writs in exceptional cases in aid of this Court's
appellate jurisdiction. The Government seeks to remove
this case from the restrictions of the Act of 1925 on the
ground that it was not intended to affect such special instances of direct review as that afforded by the Act of April
27, 1912. But we cannot read such an exception into the
1925 Act.
Nor is the contrary result required because the District
Court for the District of Columbia was known as the
"Supreme Court of the District of Columbia" when the
Act of 1925 became law. At that time the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia possessed the jurisdiction of
a district court of the United States, see Code of Law for
the District of Columbia (1924) §§ 61, 62, 84, and it was
treated as a "district court" for purposes of the AntiTrust Acts, see Federal Trade Comm'n v. Klesner, 274 U.
S. 145, 153-54, and Swift & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S.
311, 324-25. Considerations no less controlling exist for
treating it as a "district court" within the scope of § 238.
The dominating policy of the Act of 1925 was to restrict direct review to this Court as a matter of right, and more particularly to shut off such direct review of the judgments of
federal nisi prius courts. It would be wholly inconsistent
with that Act to exclude the District Court for the District
of Columbia from the scope of its provisions merely because that court did not become a district court in name
until the Act of June 25, 1936, c. 804, 49 Stat. 1921. Cf.
H. R. Rep. No. 1075, 68th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 6-7.
We hold, therefore, that the provisions for direct review
to this Court contained in § 5 of the Act of April 27, 1912,
were repealed by § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1925, because

they were "inconsistent therewith." The judgment appealed from is vacated and the cause is remanded to the
District Court so that it may enter a new judgment from
which the United States may, if it wishes, perfect a timely
appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.
No. 766. Argued May 12, 13, 1942.-Decided June 7, 1943.
Under the Revenue Act of 1938, which provides that the basis on which
depreciation shall be "allowed" as a deduction in computing net income is the cost of the property with proper adjustments for depreciation to the extent "allowed (but not less than the amount
allowable)" under that and prior income tax laws, excessive amounts
claimed by the taxpayer for depreciation in his returns for earlier
years were properly deducted from cost in readjusting the depreciation basis of the property in question, although in those years no
tax benefit resulted to the taxpayer from the use of depreciation as
a deduction. P. 526.
132 F. 2d 909, affirmed.
