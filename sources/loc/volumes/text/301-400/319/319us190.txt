APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 554. Argued February 10, 11, 1943.-Decided May 10, 1943.
1. The regulatory powers of the Federal Communications Commission are not limited to the engineering and technical aspects of radio
communication. P. 215.
2. Regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission,
as "in the public interest," touching the relations between licensed
broadcasting stations on the one hand, and network organizations
furnishing programs to such stations on the other hand, are sustained as within the powers conferred upon the Commission by the
Federal Communications Act, viz.:
(1) A regulation providing that no license shall be granted to a
standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding with a network organization under which the station
is prevented or hindered from, or penalized for, broadcasting the
programs of any other network organization. P. 198.
(2) A regulation providing that no license shall be granted to a
standard broadcast station having any contract, etc., with a network organization which prevents or hinders another station serving
substantially the same area from broadcasting the network's programs not taken by the former station, or which prevents or hinders
another station serving a substantially different area from broadcasting any program of the network organization; but not prohibiting any contract between a station and a network organization pursuant to which the station is granted the first call in its primary
service area upon the programs of the network organization. P. 200.
(3) A regulation declaring that no license shall be granted to a
standard broadcast station having any contract, etc., with a network organization which provides for the affiliation .of the station
with the network organization for a period longer than two
years. P. 201.

(4) A regulation providing that no license shall be granted to a
standard broadcast station which options for network programs
any time subject to call on less than 56 days' notice, or more time
than a total of three hours within each of four segments of the
broadcast day, as described in the regulation, and that such options
may not be exclusive as against other network organizations and
may not prevent or hinder the station from optioning or selling any
or all of the time covered by the option, or other time, to other network organizations. P. 202.
(5) A regulation providing that no license shall be granted to
a standard broadcast station having any contract, etc., with a network organization which (a), with respect to programs offered
pursuant to an affiliation contract, prevents or hinders the station from rejecting or refusing network programs which the station reasonably believes to be unsatisfactory or unsuitable; or
which (b), with respect to network programs so offered or already
contracted for, prevents the station from rejecting or refusing
any program which, in its opinion, is contrary to the public interest, or from substituting a program of outstanding local or national importance. P. 204.
(6) A regulation providing that no license shall be granted to
a network organization, or to any person directly or indirectly
controlled by or under common control with a network organization, for more than one standard broadcast station where one of
the stations covers substantially the service area of the other
station, or for any standard broadcast station in any locality where
the existing standard broadcast stations are so few or of such unequal desirability (in terms of coverage, power, frequency, or other
related matters) that competition would be substantially restrained by such licensing. P. 206.
(7) A regulation providing that no license shall be granted to
a standard broadcast station having any contract, etc., with a network organization under which the station is prevented or hindered from, or penalized for, fixing or altering its rates for the
sale of broadcast time for other than the network's programs.
P. 208.
3. Section 311 of the Federal Communications Act, by 'authorizing
the Commission to withhold broadcasting station licenses from
persons who have been convicted of violating the Antitrust Laws,
does not imply that, in the absence of such conviction, conduct of
the applicant amounting to such violation may not be considered
by the Commission in determining whether the granting of his
application would be contrary to the "public interest." P. 222.

4. The standard of "public interest" governing the exercise of the
powers delegated to the Commission by the Act is not so vague and
indefinite as to create an unconstitutional delegation of legislative
authority. P. 225.

5. The Commission by announcing that it will refuse station licenses
to persons who engage in specified network practices contrary to
the public interest, convenience or necessity does not thereby deny
to such persons the constitutional right of free speech. P. 226.
6. In a suit to enjoin the enforcement of regulations promulgated

Court.
In view of our dependence upon regulated private enterprise in discharging the far-reaching r6le which radio plays
in our society, a somewhat detailed exposition of the history of the present controversy and the issues which it
raises is appropriate.
These suits were brought on October 30, 1941, to enjoin
the enforcement of the Chain Broadcasting Regulations
promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission
on May 2, 1941, and amended on October 11, 1941. We

held last Term in Columbia System v. United States, 316
U. S. 407, and National BroadcastingCo. v. United States,

Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 219,

dismissing the suits for want of jurisdiction should therefore be reversed. On remand the District Court granted
the Government's motions for summary judgment and
dismissed the suits on the merits. 47 F. Supp. 940.

broadcasting 1 were required in the "public interest, convenience, or necessity." The Commission's order directed
that inquiry be made, inter alia, in the following specific
matters: the number of stations licensed to or affiliated
with networks, and the amount of station time used or
controlled by networks; the contractual rights and obligations of stations under their agreements with networks;
the scope of network agreements containing exclusive affiliation provisions and restricting the network from affiliating with other stations in the same area; the rights and
obligations of stations with respect to network advertisers;
the nature of the program service rendered by stations
licensed to networks; the policies of networks with respect
to character of programs, diversification, and accommodation to the particular requirements of the areas served by
the affiliated stations; the extent to which affiliated stations exercise control over programs, advertising contracts,
and related matters; the nature and extent of network
program duplication by stations serving the same area;
the extent to which particular networks have exclusive
coverage in some areas; the competitive practices of stations engaged in chain broadcasting; the effect of chain
broadcasting upon stations not licensed to or affiliated with
networks; practices or agreements in restraint of trade,
or in furtherance of monopoly, in connection with chain
broadcasting; and the scope of concentration of control
over stations, locally, regionally, or nationally, through
contracts, common ownership, or other means.
On April 6, 1938, a committee of three Commissioners
was designated to hold hearings and make recommendaChain broadcasting is defined in ยง 3 (p) of the Communications

Act of 1934 as the "simultaneous broadcasting of an identical program
by two or more connected stations." In actual practice, programs are
transmitted by wire, usually leased telephone lines, from their point of
origination to each station in the network for simultaneous broadcast
over the air.

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.

tions to the full Commission. This committee held public hearings for 73 days over a period of six months, from
November 14, 1938, to May 19, 1939. Order No. 37, announcing the investigation and specifying the particular
matters which would be explored at the hearings, was
published in the Federal Register, 3 Fed. Reg. 637, and
copies were sent to every station licensee and network
organization. Notices of the hearings were also sent to
these parties. Station licensees, national and regional networks, and transcription and recording companies were invited to appear and give evidence. Other persons who
sought to appear were afforded an opportunity to testify.
96 witnesses were heard by the committee, 45 of whom
were called by the national networks. The evidence covers
27 volumes, including over 8,000 pages of transcript and
more than 700 exhibits. The testimony of the witnesses
called by the national networks fills more than 6,000 pages,
the equivalent of 46 hearing days.
The committee submitted a report to the Commission on
June 12, 1940, stating its findings and recommendations.
Thereafter, briefs on behalf of the networks and other interested parties were filed before the full Commission, and
on November 28, 1940, the Commission issued proposed
regulations which the parties were requested to consider
in the oral arguments held on December 2 and 3, 1940.
These proposed regulations dealt with the same matters
as those covered by the regulations eventually adopted by
the Commission. On January 2, 1941, each of the national networks filed a supplementary brief discussing at
length the questions raised by the committee report and
the proposed regulations.
On May 2, 1941, the Commission issued its Report on
Chain Broadcasting, setting forth its findings and conclusions upon the matters explored in the investigation,
together with an order adopting the Regulations here assailed. Two of the seven members of the Commission dis-

sented from this action. The effective date of the Regulations was deferred for 90 days with respect to existing
contracts and arrangements of network-operated stations,
and subsequently the effective date was thrice again postponed. On August 14, 1941, the Mutual Broadcasting
Company petitioned the Commission to amend two of the
Regulations. In considering this petition the Commission
invited interested parties to submit their views. Briefs
were filed on behalf of all of the national networks, and
oral argument was had before the Commission on September 12, 1941. And on October 11, 1941, the Commission (again with two members dissenting) issued a Supplemental Report, together with an order amending three
Regulations. Simultaneously, the effective date of the
Regulations was postponed until November 15, 1941, and
provision was made for further postponements from time
to time if necessary to permit the orderly adjustment of
existing arrangements. Since October 30, 1941, when the
present suits were filed, the enforcement of the Regulations has been stayed either voluntarily by the Commission or by order of court.
Such is the history of the Chain Broadcasting Regulations. We turn now to the Regulations themselves, illumined by the practices in the radio industry disclosed by
the Commission's investigation. The Regulations, which
the Commission characterized in its Report as "the expression of the general policy we will follow in exercising our
licensing power," are addressed in terms to station licensees and applicants for station licenses. They provide, in
general, that no licenses shall be granted to stations or applicants having specified relationships with networks.
Each Regulation is directed at a particular practice found
by the Commission to be detrimental to the "public interest," and we shall consider them seriatim. In doing so,
however, we do not overlook the admonition of the Commission that the Regulations as well as the network prac-

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.

ices at which they are aimed are interrelated: "In considering above the network practices which necessitate the
regulations we are adopting, we have taken each practice
singly, and have shown that even in isolation each warrants the regulation addressed to it. But the various practices we have considered do not operate in isolation; they
form a compact bundle or pattern, and the effect of their
joint impact upon licensees necessitates the regulations
even more urgently than the effect of each taken singly."
(Report, p. 75.)
The Commission found that at the end of 1938 there
were 660 commercial stations in the United States, and
that 341 of these were affiliated with national networks.
135 stations were affiliated exclusively with the National
Broadcasting Company, Inc., known in the industry as
NBC, which operated two national networks, the "Red"
and the "Blue." NBC was also the licensee of 10 stations, including 7 which operated on so-called clear channels with the maximum power available, 50 kilowatts; in
addition, NBC operated 5 other stations, 4 of which had
power of 50 kilowatts, under management contracts with
their licensees. 102 stations were affiliated exclusively
with the Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., which was
also the licensee of 8 stations, 7 of which were clear-channel stations operating with power of 50 kilowatts. 74
stations were under exclusive affiliation with the Mutual
Broadcasting System, Inc. In addition, 25 stations were
affiliated with both NBC and Mutual, and 5 with both
CBS and Mutual. These figures, the Commission noted,
did not accurately reflect the relative prominence of the
three companies, since the stations affiliated with Mutual
were, generally speaking, less desirable in frequency,
power, and coverage. It pointed out that the stations
affiliated with the national networks utilized more than
97% of the total night-time broadcasting power of all the

198

Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

stations in the country. NBC and CBS together controlled more than 85% of the total night-time wattage,
and the broadcast business of the three national network
companies amounted to almost half of the total business
of all stations in the United States.
The Commission recognized that network broadcasting
had played and was continuing to play an important part
in the development of radio. "The growth and development of chain broadcasting," it stated, "found its impetus
in the desire to give widespread coverage to programs
which otherwise would not be heard beyond the reception
area of a single station. Chain broadcasting makes possible a wider reception for expensive entertainment and
cultural programs and also for programs of national or
regional significance which would otherwise have coverage
only in the locality of origin. Furthermore, the access to
greatly enlarged audiences made possible by chain broadcasting has been a strong incentive to advertisers to finance
the production of expensive programs . ..
But the fact
that the chain broadcasting method brings benefits and
advantages to both the listening public and to broadcast
station licensees does not mean that the prevailing practices and policies of the networks and their outlets, are
sound in all respects, or that they should not be altered.
The Commission's duty under the Communications Act of
1934 is not only to see that the public receives the advantages and benefits of chain broadcasting, but also, so far
as its powers enable it, to see that practices which adversely affect the ability of licensees to operate in the public interest are eliminated." (Report, p. 4.)
The Commission found that eight network abuses were
amenable to correction within the powers granted it by
Congress:
Regulation3.101-Exclusive affiliation of station. The
Commission found that the network affiliation agreements
of NBC and CBS customarily contained a provision which

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.
190

Opinion of the Court.

prevented the station from broadcasting the programs of
any other network. The effect of this provision was to
hinder the growth of new networks, to deprive the listening public in many areas of service to which they were
entitled, and to prevent station licensees from exercising
their statutory duty of determining which programs would
best serve the needs of their community. The Commission observed that in areas where all the stations were
under exclusive contract to either NBC or CBS, the public
was deprived of the opportunity to hear programs presented by Mutual. To take a case cited in the Report:
In the fall of 1939 Mutual obtained the exclusive right
to broadcast the World Series baseball games. It offered
this program of outstanding national interest to stations
throughout the country including NBC and CBS affiliates
in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC
immediately invoked the "exclusive affiliation" clauses
of their agreements with these stations, and as a result
thousands of persons in many sections of the country
were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games.
"Restraints having this effect," the Commission observed, "are to be condemned as contrary to the public
interest irrespective of whether it be assumed that Mutual
programs are of equal, superior, or inferior quality. The
important consideration is that station licensees are denied freedom to choose the programs which they believe
best suited to their needs; in this manner the duty Qf a station licensee to operate in the public interest is defeated.
.... Our conclusion is that the disadvantages resulting
from these exclusive arrangements far outweigh any advantages. A licensee station does not operate in the public
interest when it enters into exclusive arrangements which
prevent it from giving the public the best service of which
it is capable, and which, by closing the door of opportunity
in the network field, adversely affects the program structure of the entire industry." (Report, pp. 52, 57.) Ac-

200

Opinion of the Court.

319 U.S.

cordingly, the Commission adopted Regulation 3.101,
providing as follows: "No license shall be granted to a
standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network organization under which the station is prevented or
hindered from, or penalized for, broadcasting the programs
of any other network organization."
Regulation 3.102-Territorial exclusivity. The Commission found another type of "exclusivity" provision in
network affiliation agreements whereby the network bound
itself not to sell programs to any other station in the
same area. The effect of this provision, designed to protect the affiliate from the competition of other stations
serving the same territory, was to deprive the listening
public of many programs that might otherwise be available. If an affiliated station rejected a network program,
the "territorial exclusivity" clause of its affiliation agreement prevented the network from offering the program
to other stations in the area. For example, Mutual presented a popular program, known as "The American
Forum of the Air," in which prominent persons discussed
topics of general interest. None of the Mutual stations
in the Buffalo area decided to carry the program, and a
Buffalo station not affiliated with Mutual attempted to
obtain the program for its listeners. These efforts failed,
however, on account of the "territorial exclusivity" provision in Mutual's agreements with its outlets. The result
was that this program was not available to the people of
Buffalo.
The Commission concluded that "It is not in the public
interest for the listening audience in .an area to be deprived of network programs not carried by one station
where other stations in that area are ready and willing to
broadcast the programs. It is as much against the public
interest for a network affiliate to enter into a contractual
arrangement which prevents another station from carrying

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.
190

Opinion of the Court.

a network program as it would be for it to drown out that
program by electrical interference." (Report, p. 59.)
Recognizing that the "territorial exclusivity" clause was
unobjectionable in So far as it sought to prevent duplication of programs in the same area, the Commission limited
itself to the situations in which the clause impaired the
ability of the licensee to broadcast available programs.
Regulation 3.102, promulgated to remedy this particular
evil, provides as follows: "No license shall be granted to
a standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network
organization which prevents or hinders another station
serving substantially the same area from broadcasting the
network's programs not taken by the former station, or
which prevents or hinders another station serving a substantially different area from broadcasting any program of
the network organization. This regulation shall not be
construed to prohibit any contract, arrangement, or understanding between a station and a network organization
pursuant to which the station is granted the first call in its
primary service area upon the programs of the network
organization."
Regulation ,3.103-Term of affiliation. The standard
NBC and CBS affiliation contracts bound the station for
a.period of five years, with the network having the exclusive right to terminate the contracts upon one year's notice. The Commission, relying upon ยง 307 (d) of the Communications Act of 1934. under which no license to operate
a broadcast station can be granted for a longer term than
three years, found the five-year affiliation term to be contrary to the policy of the Act: "Regardless of any changes
that may occur in the economic, political, or social life of
the Nation or of the community in which the station is
located, CBS and NBC affiliates are bound by contract
to continue broadcasting the network programs of only
one network for 5 years. The licensee is so bound even

202

Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

though the policy and caliber of programs of the network
may deteriorate greatly. The future necessities of the
station and of the community are not considered. The
station licensee is unable to follow his conception of the
public interest until the end of the 5-year contract." (Report, p. 61.) The Commission concluded that under contracts binding the affiliates for five years, "stations become
parties to arrangements which deprive the public of the
improved service it might otherwise derive from competition in the network field; and that a station is not operating in the public interest when it so limits its freedom of
action." (Report, p. 62.) Accordingly, the Commission
adopted Regulation 3.103: "No license shall be granted to
a standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network
organization which provides, by original term, provisions
for renewal, or otherwise for the affiliation of the station
with the network organization for a period longer than two
years: 2 Provided,That a contract, arrangement, or understanding for a period up to two years, may be entered into
within 120 days prior to the commencement of such
period."
Regulation 3.104-Option time. The Commission
found that network affiliation contracts usually contained
so-called network optional time clauses. Under these
provisions the network could upon 28 days' notice call
upon its'affiliates to carry a commercial. program during
any of the hours specified in the agreement as "network
optional time." For CBS affiliates "network optional
time" meant the entire broadcast day. For 29 outlets of
NBC on the Pacific Coast, it also covered the entire broadcast day; for substantially all of the other NBC affiliates,

Standard and High-Frequency Broadcast Stations, as amended October

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

it included 8 hours on weekdays and 8 hours on Sundays.
Mutual's contracts with about half of its affiliates contained such a provision, giving the network optional time
for 3 or 4 hours on weekdays and 6 hours on Sundays.
In the Commission's judgment these optional time provisions, in addition to imposing serious obstacles in the
path of new networks, hindered stations in developing a
local program service. The exercise by the networks of
their options over the station's time tended to prevent regular scheduling of local programs at desirable hours. The
Commission found that "shifting a local commercial program may seriously interfere with the efforts of a [local]
sponsor to build up a regular listening audience at a definite hour, and the long-term advertising contract becomes
a highly dubious project. This hampers the efforts of the
station to develop local commercial programs and affects
adversely its ability to give the public good program service. . . . A station licensee must retain sufficient freedom
of action to supply the program and advertising needs of
the local community. Local program service is a vital
part of community life. A station should be ready, able,
and willing to serve the needs of the local community by
broadcasting such outstanding local events as community
concerts, civic meetings, local sports events, and other programs of local consumer and social interest. We conclude
that national network time options have restricted the
freedom of station licensees and hampered their efforts to
broadcast local commercial programs, the programs of
other national networks, and national spot transcriptions.
We believe that these considerations far outweigh any supposed advantages from 'stability' of network operations
under time options. We find that the optioning of time
by licensee stations has operated against the public in'terest." (Report, pp. 63, 65.)
The Commission undertook to preserve the advantages
of option time, as a device for "stabilizing" the industry,
531559-44-17

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

without unduly impairing the ability of local stations to
develop local program service. Regulation 3.104 called
for the modification of the option-time provision in three
respects: the minimum notice period for exercise of the
option could not be less than 56 days; the number of hours
which could be optioned was limited; and specific restrictions were placed upon exercise of the option to the
disadvantage of other networks. The text of the Regulation follows: "No license shall be granted to a standard
broadcast station which options for network programs any
time subject to call on less than 56 days' notice, or more
time than a total of three hours within each of four segments of the broadcast day, as herein described The
broadcast day is divided into 4 segments, as follows: 8:00
a. m. to 1:00 p. m.; 1:00 p. m. to 6:00 p. m.; 6:00 p. m. to
11:00 p. m.; 11:00 p. m. to 8:00 a. m. Such options may
not be exclusive as against other network organizations
and may not prevent or hinder the station from optioning
or selling any or all of the time covered by the option, or
other time, to other network organizations."
Regulation8.105-Right to reject programs. The Commission found that most network affiliation contracts contained a clause defining the right of the station to reject
network commercial programs. The NBC contracts provided simply that the station "may reject a network program the broadcasting of which would not be in the public
interest, convenience, and necessity." NBC required a
licensee who rejected a program to "be able to support his
contention that what he has done has been more in the
public interest than had he carried on the network program." Similarly, the CBS contracts provided that if the
station had "reasonable objection to any sponsored program or the product advertised thereon as not being in the
public interest, the station may, on 3 weeks' prior notice
thereof to Columbia, refuse to broadcast such program,

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.
190

Opinion of the Court.

unless during such notice period such reasonable objection of the station shall be satisfied."
While seeming in the abstract to be fair, these provisions, according to the Commission's finding, did not sufficiently protect the "public interest." As a practical matter, the licensee could not determine in advance whether
the broadcasting of any particular network program would
or would not be in the public interest. "It is obvious that
from such skeletal information [as the networks submitted to the stations prior to the broadcasts] the station
cannot determine in advance whether the program is in
the public interest, nor can it ascertain whether or not
parts of the program are in one way or another offensive.
In practice, if not in theory, stations affiliated with networks have delegated to the networks a large part of their
programming functions. In many instances, moreover,
the network further delegates the actual production of
programs to advertising agencies. These agencies are far
more than mere brokers or intermediaries between the
network and the advertiser. To an ever-increasing extent,
these agencies actually exercise the fuj nction of program
production. Thus it is frequently neither the station
nor the network, but rather the advertising agency, which
determines what broadcast programs shall contain. Under such circumstances, it is especially important that individual stations, if they are to operate in the public interest, should have the practical opportunity as well as the
contractual right to reject network programs. ...
"It is the station, not the network, which is licensed
to serve the public interest. The licensee has the duty of
determining what programs shall be broadcast over his
station's facilities, and cannot lawfully delegate this duty
or transfer the control of his station directly to the network or indirectly to an advertising agency. He cannot
lawfully bind himself to accept programs in every case

206

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

where he cannot sustain the burden of proof that he has
a better program. The licensee is obliged to reserve to
himself the final decision as to what programs will best
serve the public interest. We conclude that a licensee is
not fulfilling his obligations to operate in the public
interest, and is not operating in accordance with the express requirements of the Communications Act, if he
agrees to accept programs on any basis other than his own
reasonable decision that the programs are satisfactory."
(Report, pp. 39, 66.)
The Commission undertook in Regulation 3.105 to formulate the obligations of licensees with respect to supervision over programs: "No license shall be granted to a
standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network
organization which (a), with respect to programs offered
pursuant to an affiliation contract, prevents or hinders the
station from rejecting or refusing network programs which
the station reasonably believes to be unsatiqfactory or
unsuitable; or wiich (b), with respect to network programs so offered or already contracted for, prevents the
station from rejecting or refusing any .program which, in
its opinion, is contrary to the public interest, or from substituting a program of outstanding local or national
importance."
Regulation8.106-Network ownership of stations. The
Commission found that NBC, in addition to its network
operations, was the licensee of 10 stations, 2 each in New
York, Chicago, Washington, and San Francisco, 1 in
Denver, and 1 in Cleveland. CBS was the licensee of 8
stations, 1 in each of these cities: New York, Chicago,
Washington, Boston, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Charlotte,
and Los Angeles. These 18 stations owned by NBC and
CBS, the Commission observed, were among the most
powerful and desirable in the country, and were permanently inaccessible to competing networks. "Competi-

tion among networks for these facilities is nonexistent,
as they are completely removed from the network-station
market. It gives the network complete control over its
policies. This 'bottling-up' of the best facilities has undoubtedly had a discouraging effect upon the creation and
growth of new networks. Furthermore, common ownership of network and station places the network in a position where its interest as the owner of certain stations may
conflict with its interest as a network organization serving affiliated stations. In dealings with advertisers, the,
network represents its own stations in a proprietary capacity and the affiliated stations in something akin to an
agency capacity. The danger is present that the network
organization will give preference to its own stations at the
expense of its affiliates." (Report, p. 67.)
The Commission stated that if the question had arisen
as an original matter, it might well have concluded that
the public interest required severance of the business of
station ownership from that of network operation. But
since substantial business interests have been formed on
the basis of the Commission's continued tolerance of the
situation, it was found inadvisable to take such a drastic
step. The Commission concluded, however, that "the
licensing of two stations in the same area to a single network organization is basically unsound and contrary to
the public interest," and that it was also against the "public interest" for network organizations to own stations in
areas where the available facilities were so few or of such
unequal coverage that competition would thereby be
substantially restricted. Recognizing that these considerations called for flexibility in their application to
particular situations, the Commission provided that "networks will be given full opportunity, on proper application for new facilities or renewal of existing licenses, to
call to our attention any reasons why the principle should
be modified or held inapplicable." (Report, p. 68.)

Regulation 3.106 reads as follows: "No license shall be
granted to a network organization, or to any person directly or indirectly controlled by or under common control with a network organization, for more than one standard broadcast station where one of the stations covers
substantially the service area of the other station, or for
any standard broadcast station in any locality where the
existing standard broadcast stations are so few or of such
unequal desirability (in terms of coverage, power, frequency, or other related matters) that competition would
be substantially restrained by such licensing."
Regulation 3.107-Dual network operation. This regulation provides that: "No license shall be issued to a
standard broadcast station affiliated with a network organization which maintains more than one network:
Provided, That this regulation shall not be applicable if
such networks are not operated simultaneously, or if there
is no substantial overlap in the territory served by the
group of stations comprising each such network." In its
Supplemental Report of October 11, 1941, the Commission announced the indefinite suspension of this regulation. There is no occasion here to consider the validity of
Regulation 3.107, since there is no immediate threat of its
enforcement by the Commission.
Regulation 8.108-Control by networks of station rates.
The Commission found that NBC's affiliation contracts
contained a provision empowering the network to reduce
the station's network rate, and thereby to reduce the compensation received by the station, if the station set a lower
rate for non-network national advertising than the rate
established by the contract fQr the network programs.
Under this provision the station could not sell time to a
national advertiser for less than it would cost the advertiser if he bought the time from NBC.. In the words of
NBC's vice-president, "This means simply that a national
advertiser should pay the same price for the station

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.
190

Opinion of the Court.

whether he buys it through one source or another source.
It means that we do not believe that our stations should
go into competition with ourselves." (Report, p. 73.)
The Commission concluded that "it is against the
public interest for a station licensee to enter into a contract
with a network which has the effect of decreasing its
ability to compete for national business. We believe that
the public interest will best be served and listeners supplied with the best programs if stations bargain freely
with national advertisers." (Report, p. 75.) Accordingly, the Commission adopted Regulation 3.108, which
provides as follows: "No license shall be granted to. a
standard broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network organization under which the station is prevented or
hindered from, or penalized for, fixing or altering its rates
for the sale of broadcast time for other than the network's
programs."
The appellants attack the validity of these Regulations
along many fronts. They contend that the Commission
went beyond the regulatory powers conferred upon it by
the Communications Act of 1934; that even if the Commission were authorized by the Act to deal with the matters comprehended by the Regulations, its action is nevertheless invalid because the Commission misconceived the
scope of the Act, particularly ยง 313 which deals with the
application of the anti-trust laws to the radio industry;
that the Regulations are arbitrary and capricious; that
if the Communications Act of 1934 were construed to
authorize the promulgation of the Regulations, it would
be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power;
and that, in any event, the Regulations abridge the appellants' right of free speech in violation of the First Amendment. We are thus called upon to determine whether
Congress has authorized the Commission to exercise the

regulation of radio 8 begins with the Wireless
Ship Act of June 24, 1910, 36 Stat. 629, which forbade any
steamer carrying or licensed to carry fifty or more persons
to leave any American port unless equipped with efficient
apparatus for radio communication, in charge of a skilled
operator. The enforcement of this legislation was entrusted to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, who was
in charge of the administration of the marine navigation laws. But it was not until 1912, when the United
States ratified the first international radio treaty, 37 Stat.
1565, that the need for general regulation of radio communication became urgent. In order to fulfill our obligations under the treaty, Congress enacted the Radio Act
of August 13, 1912, 37 Stat. 302. This statute forbade
the operation of radio apparatus without a license from
the Secretary of Commerce and Labor; it also allocated
certain frequencies for the use of the Government, and
imposed restrictions upon the character of wave emissions, the transmission of distress signals, and the like.
The enforcement of the Radio Act Of 1912 presented no
serious problems prior to the World War. Questions of
interference arose only rarely because there were more
than enough frequencies for all the stations then in existence. The war accelerated the development of the art,
however, and in 1921 the first standard broadcast stations

were established. They grew rapidly in number, and by
1923 there were several hundred such stations throughout
the country. The Act of 1912 had not set aside any particultr frequencies for the use of private broadcast stations; consequently, the Secretary of Commerce selected
two frequencies, 750 and 833 kilocycles, and licensed all
stations to operate upon one or the other of these channels. The number of stations increased so rapidly, however, and the situation became so chaotic, that the Secretary, upon the recommendation of the National Radio
Conferences which met in Washington in 1923 and 1924,
established a policy of assigning specified frequencies to
particular stations. The entire radio spectrum was divided into numerous bands, each allocated to a particular
kind of service. The frequencies ranging from 550 to 1500
kilocycles (96 channels in all, since the channels were separated'from each other by 10 kilocycles) were assigned to
the standard broadcast stations. But the problems
created by the enormously rapid development of radio
were far from solved. The increase in the number of
channels was not enough to take care of the constantly
growing number of stations. Since there were more stations than available frequencies, the Secretary of Commerce attempted to find room for everybody by limiting
the power and hours of operation of stations in order that
several stations might use the same channel. The number of stations multiplied so rapidly, however, that by November, 1925, there were almost 600 stations in the country, and there were 175 applications for new stations.
Every channel in the standard broadcast band was, by
that time, already occupied by at least one station, and
many by several. The new stations could be accommodated only by extending the standard broadcast band, at
the expense of the other types of services, or by imposing
still greater limitations upon time and power. The National Radio Conference which met in November, 1925,

212

319 U. S.

opposed both of these methods and called upon Congress
to remedy the situation through legislation.
The Secretary of Commerce was powerless to deal with
the situation. It had been held that he could not deny a
license to an otherwise legally qualified applicant on the
ground -that the proposed station would interfere with
existing private or Government stations. Hoover v. Intercity Radio Co., 52 App. D. C. 339, 286 F. 1003. And
on April 16, 1926, an Illinois district court held that the
Secretary had no power to impose restrictions as to frequency, power, and hours of operation, and that a station's
use of a frequency not assigned to it was not a violation of
the Radio Act of 1912. United States v. Zenith Radio
Corp., 12 F. 2d 614. This was followed on July 8, 1926, by
an opinion of Acting Attorney General Donovan that the
Secretary of Commerce had no power, under the Radio Act
of 1912, to regulate the power, frequency or hours of operation of stations. 35 Ops. Atty. Gen. 126. The next
day the Secretary of Commerce issued a statement abandoning all his efforts to regulate radio and urging that the
stations undertake self-regulation.
But the plea of the Secretary went unheeded. From
July, 1926, to February 23, 1927, when Congress enacted
the Radio Act of 1927, 44 Stat. 1162, almost 200 new stations went on the air. These new stations used any frequencies they desired, regardless of the interference thereby caused to others. Existing stations changed to other
frequencies and increased their power and hours of operation at will. The result was confusion and chaos. With
everybody on the air, nobody could be heard. The situation became so intolerable that the President in his message of December 7, 1926, appealed to Congress to enact
a comprehensive radio law:
"Due to the decisions of the courts, the authority of
the department [of Commerce] under the law of 1912
has broken down; many more stations have been operat-

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

ing than can be accommodated within the limited number
of wave lengths available; further stations are in course of
construction; many stations have departed from the
scheme of allocations set down by the department, and the
whole service of this most important public function has
drifted into such chaos as seems likely, if not remedied,
to destroy its great value. I most urgently recommend
that this legislation should be speedily enacted." (H. Doc.
483, 69th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10.)
The plight into which radio fell prior to 1927 was attributable to certain basic facts about radio as a means of
communication-its facilities are limited; they are not
available to all who may wish to use them; the radio
spectrum simply is not large enough to accommodate
everybody. There is a fixed natural limitation upon the
number of stations that can operate without interfering
with one another.' Regulation of radio was therefore as
vital to its development as traffic control was to the development of the automobile. In enacting the Radio Act
of 1927, the first comprehensive scheme of control over
radio communication, Congress acted upon the knowledge
that if the potentialities of radio were not to be wasted,
regulation was essential.
The Radio Act of 1927 created the Federal Radio Commission, composed of five members, and endowed the Commission with wide licensing and regulatory powers. We
do not pause here to enumerate the scope of the Radio
Act of 1927 and of the authority entrusted to the Radio
Commission, for the basic provisions of that Act are incorporated in the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat.

Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

"In its essentials the Communications Act of 1934 [so
far as its provisions relating to radio are concerned] derives from the Federal Radio Act of 1927. . . . By this
Act Congress, in order to protect the national interest involved in the new and far-reaching science of broadcasting,
formulated a unified and comprehensive regulatory system for the industry. The common factors in the administration of the various statutes by which Congress had
supervised the different modes of communication led to
the creation, in the Act of 1934, of the Communications
Commission. But the objectives of the legislation have
remained substantially unaltered since 1927."
Section 1 of the Communications Act states its "purpose
of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available, so
far as possible, to all the people of the United States a
rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and
radio communication service with adequate facilities at
reasonable charges." Section 301 particularizes this general purpose with respect to radio: "It is the purpose of this
Act, among other things, to maintain the control of the
United States over all the channels of interstate and foreign radio transmission; and to provide for the use of such
channels, but not the ownership thereof, by persons for
limited periods of time, under licenses granted by Federal
authority, and no such license shall be construed to create
any right, beyond the terms, conditions, and periods of the
license." To. that end a Commission composed of seven
members was created, with broad licensing and regulatory
powers.
Section 303 provides:
"Except as otherwise provided. in this Act, the Commission from time to time, as public convenience, interest, or
necessity requires, shall(a) Classify radio stations;

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.
190

Opinion of the Court.

(b) Prescribe the nature of the service to be rendered
by each class of licensed stations and each station within
any class;
(f) Make such regulations not inconsistent with law as
it may deem necessary to prevent interference between stations and to carry out the provisions of this Act ...;
(g) Study new uses for radio, provide for experimental
uses of frequencies, and generally encourage the larger and
more effective use of radio in the public interest;
(i) Have authority to make special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain broadcasting;
(r) Make such rules and regulations and prescribe such
restrictions and conditions, not inconsistent with law, as
may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this
Act. .

....

The criterion governing the exercise of the Commission's
licensing power is the "public interest, convenience, or
necessity." ยงยง 307 (a) (d), 309 (a), 310, 312. In addition, ยง 307 (b) directs the Commission that "In considering applications for licenses, and modifications and renewals thereof, when and insofar as there is demand for the
same, the Commission shall make such distribution of
licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power
among the several States and communities as to provide a
fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service
to each of the same."
The Act itself establishes that the Commission's powers
are not limited to the engineering and technical aspects
of regulation of radio communication. Yet we are asked
to regard the Commission as a kind of traffic officer, policing the wave lengths to prevent stations from interfering
with each other. But the Act does not restrict the Com-

mission merely to supervision of the traffic. It puts upon
the Commission the burden of determining the composition of that traffic. The facilities of radio are not large
enough to accommodate all who wish to use them. Methods must be devised for choosing from among the many
who apply. And since Congress itself could not do this,
it committed the task to the Commission.
The Commission was, however, not left at large in performing this duty. The touchstone provided by Congress was the "public interest, convenience, or necessity,"
a criterion which "is as concrete as the complicated factors
for judgment in such a field of delegated authority permit."
FederalCommunicationsComm'n v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 138. "This criterion is not to be
interpreted as setting up a standard so indefinite as to
confer an unlimited power. Compare New York Central
Securities Co. v. United States, 287 U. S. 12, 24. The requirement is to be interpreted by its context, by the nature
of radio transmission and reception, by the scope, character and quality of services . . ." FederalRadio Comm'n
v. Nelson Bros. Co., 289 U. S. 266, 285.
The "public interest" to be served under the Communications Act is thus the interest of the listening public in
"the larger and more effective use of radio." ยง 303 (g).
The facilities of radio are limited and therefore precious;
they cannot be left to wasteful use without detriment to
the public interest. "An important element of public
interest and convenience affecting the issue of a license
is the ability of the licensee to render the best pradticable
service to the community reached by his broadcasts."
Federal Communications Comm'n v. Sanders Radio Station, 309 U. S. 470,475. .The Commission's licensing function cannot be discharged, therefore, merely by finding
that there are no technological objections to the granting
of a license. If the criterion of "public interest" were
limited to such matters, how could the Commission

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.
190

Opinion of the Court.

choose between two applicants for the same facilities, each
of whom is financially and technically qualified to operate
a station? Since the very inception of federal regulation
by radio, comparative considerations as to the services to
be rendered have governed the application of the standard of "public interest, convenience, or necessity." See
FederalCommunicationsComm'n v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134,138 n. 2.
The avowed aim of the Communications Act of 1934 was
to secure the maximum benefits of radio to all the people
of the United States. To that end Congress endowed the
Communications Commission with comprehensive powers
to promote and realize the vast potentialities of radio.
Section 303 (g) provides that the Commission shall "generally encourage the larger and more effective use of radio
in the public interest"; subsection (i) gives the Commission specific "authority to make special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain bioadcasting";
and subsection (r) empowers it to adopt "such rules and
regulations and prescribe such restrictions and conditions,
not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary to carry out
the provisions of this Act."
These provisions, individually and in the aggregate, preclude the notion that the Commission is empowered to
deal only with technical and engineering impediments to
the "larger and more effective use of radio in the public
interest." We cannot find in the Act any such restriction
of the Commission's authority. Suppose, for example,
that a community can, because of physical limitations,
be assigned only two stations. That community might be
deprived of effective service in any one of several ways.
More powerful stations in nearby cities might blanket out
the signals of the local stations so that they could not be
heard at all. The stations might interfere with each other
so that neither could be clearly heard. One station might
dominate the other with the power of its signal. But

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

319 U. S.

the community could be deprived of good radio service
in ways less crude. One man, financially and technically
qualified, might apply for and obtain the licenses of both
stations and present a single service over the two stations,
thus wasting a frequency otherwise available to the area.
The language of the Act does not withdraw such a situation from the licensing and regulatory powers of the
Commission, and there is no evidence that Congress did
not mean its broad language to carry the authority it
expresses.
In essence, the Chain Broadcasting Regulations represent a particularization of the Commission's conception
of the "public interest" sought to be safeguarded by Congress in enacting the Communications Act of 1934.

The

basic consideration of policy underlying the Regulations
is succinctly stated in its Report: "With the number of
radio channels limited by natural factors, the public interest demands that those who are entrusted with the available channels shall make the fullest and most effective
use of them. If a licensee enters into a contract with a
network organization which limits his ability to make the
best use of the radio facility assigned him, he is not serving the public interest. .

.

. The net effect [of the prac-

tices disclosed by the investigation] has been that broad,
casting service has been maintained at a level below, that
possible under a system of free competition. Having so
found, we would be remiss in our statutory duty of encouraging 'the larger and more effective use of radio in
the public interest' if we were to grant licenses to persons
who persist in these practices." (Report, pp. 81, 82.)
. We would be asserting our personal views regarding the
effective utilization of radio were we to deny that the Commission was entitled to find that the large public aims of
the Communications Act of 1934 comprehend the considerations which moved the Commission in promulgating
the Chain Broadcasting Regulations. True enough, the

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.
190

Opinion of the Court.

Act does not explicitly say that the Commission shall have
power to deal with network practices found inimical to
the public interest. But Congress was acting in a field qf
regulation which was both new and dynamic. "Congress
moved under the spur of a widespread fear that in the
absence of governmental control the public interest might
be subordinated to monopolistic domination in the broadcasting field." FederalCommunicationsComm'n v. Pottsville BroadcastingCo., 309 U. S.134, 137. In the context
of the developing problems to which it was directed, the
Act gave the Commission not niggardly but expansive
powers. It was given a comprehensive mandate to "encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the
public interest," if need be, by making "special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain broadcasting." ยง 303 (g) (i).
Generalities unrelated to the living problems of radio
communication of course cannot justify exercises of power
by the Commission. Equally so, generalities empty of all
concrete considerations of the actual bearing, of regulations promulgated by,thq Commission. to the Subjectmatter entrusted to it, cannot strike down exercises .of
power by the Commission. While Congress did not give
the Commission unfettere' discretion to regulate
phases of the radio in dustry, it did not frustrate the purposes for which the Communications Act of 1934 was
brought into being by attempting an itemized catalogue
of the specific manifestations of the general problems for
the solution of which it was establishing a regulatory
agency. That would have stereotyped the powers of the
Commission to specific details in regulating a field of enterprise the dominant characteristic of which was the rapid
pace of its unfolding. And so Congress did what experience had taught it in similar attempts at regulation, even
in fields where the subject-matter of regolation was far
less fluid and dynamic than radio. The essence of that

experience Y4is to define broad areas for regulation and to

estab1isfitafidards for judgment adequately related in
theirrjolication to the problems to be solved.
For the crarhping construction of the Act pressed upon
us, support cannot be found in its legislative history.
The principal argument is that ยง303 (i), empowering the
Commission "to make special regulations applicable to
radio stations engaged in chain broadcasting," intended
to restrict the scope of the Commission's powers to the
technical and engineering aspects of chain broadcasting.
This provision comes from ยง 4 (h) of the Radio Act of
1927. It was introduced into the legislation as a Senate
committee amendment to the House bill (H. R. 9971, 69th
Cong., 1st Sess.) This amendment originally read as
follows:
"(C) The commission, from time to time, as public
convenience, interest, or necessity requires, shall(j) Whe n s fions are connected ;by. wire for chain
broadcastigj d trmine th6 power 'each 'station shall use

6hinibroadcasting.1
"The report of the Senate-C6mmittee on Interstate Comme ce, which submitted this amendment, stated that under the' bill the Commission was given "complete authority . . . to control chain broadcasting."

Sen. Rep.

No. 772, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3. The bill as thus
amended was passed by the Senate, and then sent to conference. The bill that emerged from the conference committee, and which became the Radio Act of 1927, phrased
the amendment in the general terms now contained in
ยง 303 (i) of the 1934 Act: the Commission was authorized
"to make special regulations applicable to radio stations

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S..

engaged in chain broadcasting." The conference reports
do not give any explanation of this particular change in
phrasing, but they do state that the jurisdiction conferred
upon the Commission by the conference bill was substantially identical with that conferred by the bill passed by
the Senate. See Sen. Doc. No. 200, 69th Cong., 2d Sess.,
p. 17; H. Rep. 1886, 69th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 17. We agree
with the District Court that in view of this legislative history, ยง 303 (i) cannot be construed as no broader than the
first clause of the Senate amendment, which limited the
Commission's authority to the technical and engineering
phases of chain broadcasting. There is no basis for assuming that the conference intended to preserve the first
clause, which was dof limited scope, and abandon the second clause, which was of general scope, by agreeing upon
a provision which was broader and more comprehensive
than those it supplanted.'
5 In the course of the Senate debates on the conference report upon
the bill that became the Radio Act of 1927, Senator Dill, who was in
charge- of the bill, said: "While the commission would have the power
under'the general terms of the bill, the bill specifically sets out as one
of the special powers of the commission the right to make specific
regulations for governing chain broadcasting. As to creating a monopoly of radio in this country, let me say that this bll absolutely protects the public, so far as it can protect them, by giving. the commission full power to refuse a license to anyone who it believes will not
serve the public interest, convenience, or necessity. It specifically provides that any corporation guilty of monopoly shall not only not receive a license but that its licerfse may be revoked; and if after a corporation has received its license for a period of three years it is then
discovered and found to be guilty of monopoly, its license will be revoked. . , . In addition to that, the bill contains a provision that no
license may be transferred from one owner to another without the
written consent of the commission, and the commission, of course, having the power to protect against a monopoly, must give such protection. I wish to state further that the only way by which monopolies
in the radio business can secure control of radio here, even for a limited period of time, will be by the commission becoming servile to
them. Power must be lodged somewhere, and I myself am unwilling

319 U. S.

A totally different source of attack upon the Regulations is found in ยง,311 of the Act, which authorizes the
Commission to withhold licenses from persons convicted
of having violated the anti-trust laws. Two contentions
are made-first, that this provision puts considerations
relating to competition outside the Commission's concern
before an applicant has been convicted of monopoly or
other restraints of trade, and second, that, in any event,
the Commission misconceived the scope of its powers under ยง 311 in issuing the Regulations. Both of these contentions are unfounded. Section 311 derives from ยง 13
of the Radio Act of 1927, which expressly commanded,
rather than merely authorized, the Commission to refuse
a license to any person judicially found guilty of having
violated the anti-trust laws. The change in the 1934
Act was made, in the words of Senator Dill, the manager
of the legislation in the Senate, because "it seemed fair
to the committee to do that." 78 Cong. Rec, 8825. The
Commission was thus permitted to exercise its judgment
as to whether violation of the anti-trust laws disqualified
an applicant from operating a station in the "public interest." We agree with the District Court that "The
necessary implication from this [amendment in 1934] was
that the Commission might infer from the fact that the
applicant had in the past tried to monopolize radio, or had
engaged in unfair methods of competition, that the disposition so manifested would continue and that if it did it
would make him an unfit licensee." 47 F. Supp. 940,
944.

That the Commission may refuse to grant a license to
persons adjudged guilty in a court of law of conduct in
violation of the anti-trust laws certainly does not render
to assume in advance that the commission proposed to be created will
be servile to the desires and demands of great corporations of this
country." 68 Cong. Rec. 2881.

irrelevant consideration by the Commission of the effect
of such conduct upon the "public interest, convenience,
or necessity." A licensee charged with practices in contravention of this standard cannot continue to hold his
license merely because his conduct is also in violation of
the anti-trust laws and he has not yet been proceeded
against and convicted. By clarifying in ยง 311 the scope
of the Commission's authority in dealing with persons convicted of violating the anti-trust laws, Congress can hardly
be deemed to have limited the concept of "public interest"
so as to exclude all considerations relating to monopoly
and unreasonable restraints upon commerce. Nothing in
the provisions or history of the Act lends support to the
inference that the Commission was denied the power to
refuse a license to a station not operating in the "public
interest," merely because its misconduct happened to be
an unconvicted violation of the anti-trust laws.
Alternatively, it is urged that the Regulations constitute an ultra vires attempt by the Commission to enforce
the anti-trust laws, and that the enforcement of the antitrust laws is the province not of the Commission but of the
Attorney General and the courts. This contention misconceives the basis of the Commission's action. The
Commission's Report indicates plainly enough that the
Commission was not attempting to administer the antitrust laws:
. "The prohibitions of the Sherman Act apply to broadcasting. This Commission, although not charged with
the duty of enforcing that law, should administer its
regulatory powers with respect to broadcasting in the light
of the purposes which the Sherman Act was designed to
achieve. . .

While many of the network practices raise

serious questions under the antitrust laws, our jurisdiction
does not depend on a showing that they do in fact constitute a violation of the antitrust laws. It is not our func-

224

319 U. S.

tion to apply the antitrust laws as such. It is our duty,
however, to refuse licenses or renewals to any person who
engages or proposes to engage in practices which will prevent either himself or other licensees or both from making
the fullest use of radio facilities. This is the standard of
public interest, convenience or necessity which we must
apply to all applications for licenses and renewals ...
We do not predicate our jurisdiction to issue the regulations on the ground that the network practices violate
the antitrust laws. We are issuing these regulations because we have found that the network practices prevent
the maximum utilization of radio facilities in the public
interest." (Report, pp. 46, 83, 83 n. 3.)
We conclude, therefore, that the Communications Act
of 1934 authorized the Commission to promulgate regulations designed to correct the abuses disclosed by its investigation of chain broadcasting. There remains for
consideration the claim that the Commission's exercise of
such authority was unlawful.
The Regulations are assailed as "arbitrary and capricious." If this contention means that the Regulations
are unwise, that they are not likely to succeed in accomplishing what the Commission intended, we can say only
that the appellants have selected the wrong forum for such
a plea. What was said in Board of Trade v. UnitedStates,
314 U. S. 534, 548, is relevant here: "We certainly have
neither technical competence nor legal authority to pronounce upon the wisdom of the course taken by the Commission." Our duty is at an end when we find that the
action of the Commission was based upon findings supported by evidence, and was made pursuant to authority
granted by Congress. It is not for us to say that the
"public interest" will be furthered or retarded by the
Chain Broadcasting Regulations. The responsibility belongs to the Congress for the grant of valid legislative
authority and to the Commission for its exercise.

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.
190 ,

Opinion of the Court.

It would be sheer dogmatism to say that the Commission made out no case for its allowable discretion in formulating these Regulations. Its long investigation disclosed the existences of practices which it regarded as contrary to the "public interest." The Commission knew
that the wisdom of any action it took would have to be
tested by experience: "We are under no illusion that the
regulations we are adopting will solve all questions of public interest with respect to the network system of program
distribution. . . . The problems in the network field are
interdependent, and the steps now taken may perhaps operate as a partial solution of problems not directly dealt
with at this time. Such problems may be examined again
at some future time after the regulations here adopted
have been given a fair trial." (Report, p. 88.) The
problems with which the Commission attempted to deal
could not be solved at once and for all time by rigid rulesof-thumb. The Commission therefore did not bind itself
inflexibly to the licensing policies expressed in the Regulations. In each case that comes before it the Commission must still exercise an ultimate judgment whether the
grant of a license would serve the "public interest, convenience, or necessity." If time and changing circumstances reveal that the "public interest" is not served by
application of the Regulations, it must be assumed that
the Commission will act in accordance with its statutory
obligations.
Since there is no basis for any claim that the Commission failed to observe procedural safeguards required by
law, we reach the contention that the R2gulations should
be denied enforcement on constitutional grounds. Here,
as in New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States,
287 U. S. 12, 24-25, the claim is made that the standard of
"public interest" governing the exercise of the powers delegated to the Commission by Congress is so vague and indefinite that, if it be construed as comprehensively as the

words alone permit, the delegation of legislative authority
is unconstitutional.' But, as we held in that case, It is a
mistaken assumption that this is a mere general ref6ren
to public welfare without any standard to guide determinations. The nurpose of the Act, the requirements it
imposes, and the context of the provision in quest6 'show
the contrary.".- id.

We come, finally,to ai appeal to the First Amendment.
The Regulations, even if valid in all other respects, must
fall because they abridge, say the appellants, their right
of free speech. If that be so, it would follow that every
person whose application for a license to operate a station is denied by the Commission is thereby denied his
constitutional right of free speech. Freedom of utterance
is abridged to many who wish to use the limited facilities
of radio. Unlike other modes of expression, radio inherently is not available to all. That is its unique characteristic, and that is why, unlike other modes of expression, it
is subject to governmental regulation. Because it cannot
be used by all, some who wish to use it must be denied.
But Congress did not authorize the Commission to choose
among applicants upon the basis of their political, economic or social views, or upon any other capricious basis.
If it did, or if the Commission by these Regulations proposed a choice among applicants upon some such basis,
the issue before us would be wholly different. The question here is simply whether the Commission, by announcing that it will refuse licenses to persons who engage in
specified network practices (a basis for choice which we
hold is comprehended within the statutory criterion of

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.
190

MuRPHY, J., dissenting.

"public interest"), is thereby denying such j ersons 1te
constitutional right of free speech. The right 0f free
speech does not include, however, the right to use the tacilities of radio without a license. The licensing system
established by Congress in the Communications Act of
1934 was a proper exercise of its power over commerce.
The standard it provided for the licensing of stations wasthe "public interest, convenience, or necessity." Denial
of a station license on that ground, if valid under the Act,
is not a denial of free speech.
A procedural point calls for just a word. The District
Court, by granting the Government's motion for summary
judgment, disposed of the case upon the pleadings and
upon the record made before the Commission. The court
below correctly held that its inquiry was limited to review
of the evidence before the Commission. Trial de novo of
the matters heard by the Commission and dealt with in its
Report would have been improper. See Tagg Bros. v.

Congress has not granted. Since that is what the Court in
subtnce
does today, I dissent.
In the present
case we are dealing with a subject
of
extreme importance in the life of the nation. Although
radio broadcasting, like the press, is generally conducted
on a commercial basis, it is not an ordinary business activity, like the selling of securities or the marketing of
electrical power. In the dissemination of information and
opinion, radio has assumed a position of commanding importance, rivalling the press and the pulpit. Owing to its
physical characteristics radio, unlike the other methods
of conveying information, must be regulated and rationed
by the government. Otherwise there would be chaos, and
radio's usefulness would be largely destroyed. But because of its vast potentialities as a-medium of communication, discussion and propaganda, the character and extent of control that should be exercised over it by the government is a matter of deep and vital concern. Events in
Europe show that radio may readily be a weapon of authority and misrepresentation, instead of a means of entertainment and enlightenment. It may even be an instrument of oppression. In pointing out these possibilities I do not mean to intimate in the slightest that they
are imminent or probable in this country, but they do
suggest that the construction of the instant statute should
be approached with more than ordinary restraint and
caution, to avoid an interpretation that is not clearly
justified by the conditions that brought about its enactment, or that would give the Commission greater powers
than the Congress intended to confer.
The Communications Act of 1934 does not in terms
give the Commission power to regulate the contractual
relations between the stations and the networks. Columbia System v. United States, 316 U. S. 407, 416. It is only
as an incident of the power to grant or withhold licenses to
individual stations under ยง ยง307, 308, 309 and 310 that this

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.

MuRPnz, J., dissenting.

authority is claimed,' except as it may have been provided by subdivisions (g), (i) and (r) of ยง 303, and by
ยงยง 311 and 313. But nowhere in these sections, taken
singly or collectively, is there to be found by reasonable
construction or necessary inference, authority to regulate
the broadcasting industry as such, or to control the complex operations of the national networks.
In providing for regulation of the radio, the Congress
was under the necessity of vesting a considerable amount
of discretionary authority in the Commission. The task
of choosing between various claimants for the privilege
of using the air waves is essentially an administrative one.
Nevertheless, in specifying with some degree of particularity the kind of information to be included in an application for a license, the Congress has indicated what general
conditions and consideratbno aq o govern the granting
and withholding of statio'n licenses. Thus an applicant
is required by ยง 308 (b) to subxfif ihformation bearing
upon his citizenship, charactl . and technical, financial
and other qualifications to p*per
tihe proposed station,
as well as data relating 't.the ownersh
andlocation of
the proposed station, the po Ver and fre uencies desired,
operating periods, intended ise, and such other information as the Commission may require. ! Licenses, frequencies, hours of operation and power are to be fairly
distributed among the several States and communities to
provide efficient service to each. ยง 307 (b). Explicit
provision is made for dealing with applicants and licensees
'The regulations as first proposed were not connected with denial
of applications for initial or renewal station licenses but provided in-

stead that: "No licensee of a standard broadcast station shall enter

into any contractual arrangement, express or implied, with a network organization," which contained any of the disapproved provisions.
After a short time, however, the regulations were cast in their present
form, making station licensing depend upon conformity with the
regulations.

who are found guilty, or who are under the control of
persons found guilty of violating the federal anti-trust
laws. ยงยง 311 and 313. Subject to the limitations defined
in the Act, the Commission is required to grant a station
license to any applicant "if public convenience, interest,
or necessity will be served thereby." ยง 307 (a). Nothing
is said, in any of these sections, about network contracts,
affiliations, or business arrangements.
The power to control network contracts and affiliations
by means of the Commission's licensing powers cannot be
derived from implication out of the standard of "public
convenience, interest or necessity." We have held that:
"the Act does not essay to regulate the business of the
licensee. The Commission is given no supervisory control of the programs,'of business management or of policy.
In short, the broadcasting field is open to anyone, provided there be an available &quency over which he can
broadcast without intlerence to others, if he shows hig
competency, the adequacy o his equipment, and financial
ability to make g. od use'of -the assigned channel." Federal

terest or necessity" is not an.indefinite standard, but one
to be "ihterpreted by its context, by the nature of radio
transmission and reception, by the scope, character and
quality of services, . . ." FederalRadio Comm'n v. Nel-

son Bros. Co., 289 U. S. 266, 285. Nothing in the context
of which the standard is a part refers to network contracts.
It is evident from the record that the Commission is making its determination of whether the public interest would
be served by renewal of an existing license or licenses, not
upon an examination of written applications presented to
it, as required by ยงยง 308 and 309, but upon an investigation of the broadcasting industry as a whole, and general
findings made in pursuance thereof which relate to the
business methods of the network companies rather than

NAT. BROADCASTING CO. v. U. S.

MuRPHr, J., dissenting.

the characteristics of the individual stations and the peculiar needs of the areas served by them. If it had been the
intention of the Congress to invest the Commission with

the responsibility, through its licensing authority, of exercising far-reaching control-as exemplified by the proposed regulations-over the business operations of chain
broadcasting and radio networks as they were then or are
now organized and established, it is not likely that the
Congress would have left it to mere inference or implication from the test of "public convenience, interest or necessity," or that Congress would have neglected to include
it among the considerations expressly made relevant to
license applications by ยง 308 (b). The subject is one of
such scope and importance as to warrant explicit mention.
To construe the licensing sections (ยงยง 307, 308, 309, 310)
as granting authority to require fundamental and revolutionary changes in the business methods of the broadcasting networks--methods which have been in existence
for several years and which have not been adjudged unlawful-would inflate and distort their true meaning and
extend them beyond the limited purposes which they were
intended to serve.
It is quite possible, of course, that maximum utilization
of the radio as an instrument of culture, entertainment,
and the diffusion of ideas is inhibited by existing network
arrangements. Some of the conditions imposed by the
broadcasting chains are possibly not conducive to a freer
use of radio facilities, however essential they may be to
the maintenance of sustaining programs and the operation of the chain broadcasting business as it is now conducted. But I am unable to agree that it is within the
present authority of the Commission to prescribe the
remedy for such conditions. It is evident that a correction of these conditions in the manner proposed by
the regulations will involve drastic changes in the business of radio broadcasting which the Congress has not

clearly and definitely empowered the Commission to
undertake.
If this were a case in which a station license had been
withheld from an individual applicant or licensee because
of special relations or commitments that would seriously
compromise or limit his ability to provide adequate service to the listening public, I should be less inclined to
make any objection. As an incident of its authority to
determine the eligibility of an individual applicant in an
isolated case, the Commission might possibly consider such
factors. In the present case, however, the Commission
has reversed the order of things. Its real objective is to
regulate the business practices of the major networks, thus
bringing within the range of its regulatory power the chain
broadcasting industry as a whole. By means of these
regulations and the enforcement program, the Commission would not only extend its authority over business
activities which represent interests and investments of a
very substantial character, which have not been put under
its jurisdiction by the Act, but would greatly enlarge its
control over an institution that has now become a rival of
the press and pulpit as a purveyor of news and entertainment and a medium of public discussion. To assume a
function and-responsibility of such wide reach and importance in the life of the nation, as a mere incident of its
duty to pass on individual applications for permission to
operate a radio station and use a specific wave length, is
an assumption of authority to which I am not willing to
lend my assent.
Again I do not question the need of regulation in this
field, or the authority of the Congress to enact legislation
that would vest in the Commission such power as it requires to deal with the problem, which it has defined and
analyzed in its report with admirable lucidity. , It is pos'sible that the remedy indicated by the proposed regulations is the appropriate one, whatever its effect may be on

the sustaining programs, advertising .ontracts, and ather
characteristics of chain broadcastingasri, is now co4ducLtd
in this country. I do not believe, however, that.the Commission was justified in claiming the responsibility and
authority it has assumed to exercise without a clear mandate from the Congress.
An examination of the history of this legislation, convinces me that the Congress did not intend by anything
in ยง 303, or any other provision of the Act, to confer on the
Commission the authority it has assumed to exercise by
the issuance of these regulations. Section: 303 is concerned primarily with technical matters, and the subjqcts
of regulation authorized by most of its subdivisions are 9xceedingly specific-so specific in fact that it is reasonable
to infer that, if Congress had intended to cover the subject of network contracts and affiliations, it would not have
left it to dubious implications from general clauses, lifted
out of context, in subdivisions (g), (i) and (r). I am
unable to agree that in authorizing the Commission in
ยง 303 (g) to study new uses for radi6, provide for experimental use of frequencies, and' "generally encourage the
larger and more effective use of radib in the public interest," it was the intention or the purp6se of the Congress
to confer on the Commission the regulatory powers now
being asserted. Manifestly that subdivision dealt with
experimental and development work-technical and scientific matters, and the construction of its concluding clause
should be 'accordingly limited to those considerations.
Nothing in its legislative history suggests that it had any
broader purpose.
. It was clearly not the intention of the Congress by the
enactment ofยง 303 (i), authorizing the Commission "to
make special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain broadcasting," to invest the Commission
with the authoriy now claimed over network contracts.
This sectionis a verbatim reenactment of ยง 4 (h) of the

319 U. S.

Radio Act of 1927,: dnd had its origin in a Senate amendment to the bill which became that Act. In its original
form it provided that the Commission, from time to time,
as' public -convenience, interest, or necessity required,
should: "When stations are connected by wire for chain broadcasting, [the Commission should] determine the power
each station shall use and the wave lengths to be used during the time stations are so connected and so operated, and
make all other regulations necessary in the interest of
equitable radio service to the listeners in the communities
or hreas affected by chain broadcasting."
It was evidently the purpose ofthis provision to remedy
a' situation that was described as follows by Senator Dill
(who was in charge of the bill in the. Senate) in qp~estioning a witness at the hearings of the Senate Committee on
Interstate Commerce:
During the past few months there has grown up a
system of chain broadcasting, extending over the United
States a great deal of the, time. I say a great deal of the
time--many nights month-and the stations
that are
connected are of such wide.y varying meter lengths that
the ordinary radio set that reaches out any distance is unable to get anything but that one program, and so, in effect,
that one program monopolizes the air. I realize it is somewhat of a technical engineeringproblem, but iihas seemed
to many people, at least many who have written to me,
that when stations are carrying on chain programs that
they might be limited to the use of wave lengths adjoining
or near enough to one another that, they would not cover
the entire dial. I do not know wheth iegilation ought
to restrict that or whether it had better be doht by regulations of the department. I want to g~V your opinion as to
the advisability in some way protecting'people who want
to hear some other program than the one being bro~idcasted by chain broadcast." (Report of .- arihg9 Before

1754, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. (1926) p. 123.)
In other words, when the same program was simultaneously broadcast by chain stations, the weaker independent
stations were drowned out because of the high power of
the chain stations. With the receiving sets then commonly in use, listeners were unable to get any program except the chain program. It was essentially an interference problem. In addition to determining power and
wave length for chain stations, it would have been the duty
of the Commission, under the amendment, to make other
regulations necessary for "equitable radio service to the
listeners in the communities or areas affected by chain
broadcasting." The last clause should not be interpreted
out of context and without relation to the problem at
which the amendment was aimed. It is reasonably construed as simply authorizing the Comnmission to remedy
other technical problems of interference involved in chain
broadcasting in addition to power and wave length by requiring special types of equipment, controlling locations,
etc. The statement in the Senate Committee Report that
this provision gave the Commission "complete authority . . . to control chain broadcasting" (S. Rep. No. 772,
69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3) must be taken as meaning that
the provision gave complete authority with respect to the
specific problem which the Senate intended to meet, a
problem of technical interference.
While the form of the amendment was simplified in the
Conference Committee so as to authorize the Commission "to make special regulations applicable to radio stations engaged in chain broadcasting," both Houses were
assured in the report of the Conference Committee that
"the jurisdiction conferred in this paragraph is substantially the same as the jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by . . . the Senate amendment." (Sen. Doc.

69th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 17). This is further borne out by
a statement of Senator Dill in discussing the conference
report on the Senate floor:
"What is happening to-day is that the National Broadcasting Co., which is a part of the great Radio Trust, to
say the least, if not a monopoly, is hooking up stations
in every community on their various wave lengths with
high powered stations and sending one program out,
and they are forcing the little stations off the board so
that the people cannot hear anything except the one
program.
"There' is no power to-day in the hands of the Department of Commerce to stop that practice. The radio commission will have the power to regulate and prevent it
and give the independents a chance." (68 Cong. Rec.
3031.)
. Section 303 (r) is certainly no basis for inferring that
the Commission is empowered to issue the challenged regulations. This subdivision is not an independent grant
of power, but only'an authorization to: "Make such rules
and regulations and prescribe such restrictions and conditions, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary to
carry out the provisions of this Act." There is no provision in the Act for the control of network contractual
arrangements by the Commission, and consequently
ยง 303 (r) is of no consequence here.
To the extent that existing network practices may have
run counter to the anti-trust laws, the Congress has expressly provided the means of dealing with the problem.
The enforcement of those laws has been committed to
the courts and other law enforcement agencies. In addition to the usual penalties prescribed by statute for their
violation, however, the Commission has been expressly
authorized by ยง 311 to refuse a station license to any per-

son "finally adjudged guilty by a Federal court" of attempting unlawfully to monopolize radio communication.
Anyone under the control of such a person may also be
refused a license. And whenever a court has ordered the
revocation of an existing license, as expressly provided in
ยง 313, a new license may not be granted by the Commission to the guilty party or to any person under his control.
In my opinion these provisions (ยงยง 311 and 313) clearly
do not and were not intended to confer independent
authority on the Commission to supervise network contracts or to enforce competition between radio networks
by withholding licenses from stations, and do not justify
the Commission in refusing a license to an applicant otherwise qualified, because of business arrangements that may
constitute an unlawful restraint of trade, when the applicant has not been finally adjudged guilty of violating
the anti-trust laws, and is not controlled by one so
adjudged.
The conditions disclosed by the Commission's investigation, if they require correction, should be met, not by the
invention of authority where none is available or by diverting existing powers out of their true channels and
using them for purposes to which they were not addressed,
but by invoking the aid of the Congress or the service
of agencies that have been entrusted with the enforcement of the anti-trust laws. In other fields of regulation the Congress has made clear its intentions. It has
not left to mere inference and guess-work the existence
of authority to order board changes and reforms in the
national economy or the structure of business arrangements in the Public Utility Holding Company Act, 49
Stat. 803, the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, the Federal Power Act, 49 Stat. 838, and other measures of similar character. Indeed the Communications Act itself contains cogent internal evidence that Congress did not in-

tend to grant power over network contractual arrangements to the Commission. In ยง 215 (c) of Title II, dealing with common carriers by wire and radio, Congress
provided:
"The Commission shall examine all contracts of common carriers subject to this Act which prevent the other
party thereto from dealing with another common carrier
subject to this Act, and shall report its findings to Congress, together with its recommendations as to whether
additional legislation on this subject is desirable."
Congress had no difficulty here in expressing the possible
desirability of regulating a type of contract roughly similar to the ones with which we are now concerned, and in
reserving to itself the ultimate decision upon the matters
of policy involved. Insofar as the Congress deemed it
necessary in this legislation to safeguard radio broadcasting against arrangements that are offensive to the antitrust laws or monopolistic in nature, it made specific provision in ยงยง 311 and 313. If the existing network contracts
are deemed objectionable because of monopolistic or other
features, and no remedy is presently available under these
provisions, the proper course is to seek amendatory legislation from the Congress, not to fabricate authority by
ingenious reasoning based upon provisions that have no
true relation to the specific problem.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS agrees with these views.
