COUNTY OF MAHNOMEN v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 684. Argued May 4, 1943.-Decided June 7, 1943.

1. In an action by the United States on behalf of an emancipated
Indian against a county to recover money paid as taxes on the
Indian's non-taxable allotment, where the issue is whether the
payment was voluntary, the burden of proving it involuntary is on
the Government. P. 477.
2. An Indian allotment was taxed by a county for a succession of
years, in part before and in part after the expiration of the twentyfive year period during which the land was declared immune to
taxation. The Indian then, being emancipated, voluntarily made a
compromise with the county whereby the land was relieved of all
the taxes and of tax sales based thereon, upon payment by the
Indian of an amount less than the part of the taxes which had
been laid after the twenty-five year period had expired. Held that
the payment was not recoverable by the Government in a suit on
behalf of the Indian. P. 477.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK

delivered the opinion of th a Court.

This action was brought by the government :,n a federal district court to recover real estate taxes alleged to
have been illegally collected by Mahnomen County, Minnesota, from Isabelle Garden, an Indian allottee.1 . The
suit, brought in 1940, seeks a refund of taxes for the
years 1911 to 1927 inclusive. It is conceded that any
limitation on the County's power to tax expired in 1928
with the termination of the twenty-five year trust described below. The District Court rendered judgment
against the County for the years 1911 to 1921, inclusive,
giving a total judgment of $405.97. On appeal by both
the government and the County, the Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed but gave an added judgment for the
years 1922 through -1925. 131 F. 2d 936.
In its petition for certiorari, the County claimed that
Garden was an emancipated Indian who had paid the taxes
voluntarily, and that hence the judgment granting a refund conflicts with Ward v. Love County, 253 U. S. 17.
The County also contended that it was wholly within an
Indian reservation; that it had long been dependent on
taxation of allotted lands; that after the passage of the
first Clapp Amendment in 1906, 34 Stat. 325, 353, which
emancipated the Mahnomen County Indians, and lifted
"all restrictions as to the sale, incumbrance, or taxation
for allotments," the County had assumed that the Indians
could voluntarily contribute to the support of county institutions; and that while the instant judgment is small,
the aggregate amount of such judgments which might be
obtained in similar actions would adversely affect the
solvency of the County and imperil the continuance of
IThe government's original complaint included additional claims
against Mahnomen and other counties, but these other claims are not
involved in the case as it reaches us.

county institutions. On these representations of the public importance of the case, we granted certiorari.

In 1902, the Secretary of the Interior, acting under Congressional authority, issued a patent to this Indian allottee,
agreeing to hold a tract of land in trust for twenty-five
years "for the sole use and benefit of the Indian" and then
to convey the land to her "discharged of said trust and free
of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever." 2 Indian land
so held by the government has been said to be exempt from
all state taxation. United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S.
432, 436-438. The first and second Clapp Amendments,
passed in 1906 and 1907,1 lifted restrictions previously imposed upon the sale, encumbrance and taxation of the
allotments of adult mixed-blood Indians, and in addition
declared that "the trust deeds heretofore or hereafter executed by the Department for such allotments, are hereby
declared to pass the title in fee simple." Garden is an
adult mixed-blood Indian and has been an adult since 1911,
when the first controverted tax payment was made. These
amendments evidence "a legislative judgment that adult
mixed-blood Indians are, in the respects dealt with in the
act, capable of managing their own affairs, and for that
reason they are given full power and authority to dispose
of allotted lands." UnitedStates v. Waller, 243 U. S. 452,
462; Baker v. McCarthy, 145 Minn. 167, 170, 176 N. W.
643.
Notwithstanding these acts the County concedes, and
we assume arguendo, that it was without power to impose a
tax upon these allotted lands prior to 1928 against the consent of the Indians. Choate v. Trapp,224 U. S. 665.' The

834 Stat. 325, 353; 34 Stat. 1034.
I We do not consider whether Choate v. Trapp is controlling here.
In that case the government had patented land with a provision that
"the land should be non-taxable" and the agreement with the Indians
was held to be a contract which, "having been accepted by the State
224

MAHNOMEN COUNTY v. U. S.
474

Opinion of the Court.

Clapp Amendment gives the consent of the United States
to state taxation, thus removing the barrier to taxation
found to exist in United States v. Rickert, supra;but under
Choate v. Trapp the Indian, who has gained a "vested
right" not to be taxed, must also consent. Acceptance
of Choate v. Trapp does not mean that an Indian, legislatively declared to be competent to handle his own affairs,
cannot voluntarily decide to pay taxes for his own advantage and welfare. If, as the petitioner argued, and as the
government does not deny, the capacity of the County to
provide schools, roads, and other necessary services would
have been seriously jeopardized, if not destroyed, by the
failure of the Indians to contribute to a tax fund, their
newly granted emancipation would have been of little
value. In addition, the market value of their lands would
have been greatly reduced by the complete inability of the
County to secure funds essential to the establishment of
means of travel and communication and the maintenance
of an orderly society. Nothing that was said in Choate v.
Trapp, or in any other decision of this Court, deprived an
emancipated Indian of freedom voluntarily to pay taxes
in his own interest. Ward v. Love County, 253 U. S. 17,
22, assumed that the test of the right to recover a tax illegally collected from an Indian is whether the tax was
paid voluntarily, and that the burden is upon one seeking
recovery of the tax to establish that the payment was made
involuntarily. The issue before us, therefore, is whether
the government has sustained that burden.
There is no allegation, stipulation, or finding by either
court that these taxes were involuntarily paid. Both
courts below erroneously assumed that the government's
original obligation .to hold the land in trust and deliver
it free of encumbrances permits the government to mainof Oklahoma in its Constitution upon admission to statehood, was a
limitation upon the taxing power of the State." Carpenter v. Shaw,
280 U. S. 363, 366.

tain this suit even though the Indian has willingly paid
taxes. 1911-1921 taxes were evidently paid without
protest, and there is nothing in the -record to permit a deduction that the payments were involuntary.'
The 1922-25 taxes were discharged in somewhat different ,fashion. The allottee became delinquent in the
payment and the lands were sold to the State. Subsequently, in 1936, she made a compromise arrangement
with the State, for a period including not only the years
1922-27, for which tax exemption is claimed, but also for
the years 1928-34, for which there is no conceivable claim
of exemption. This compromise, made in the form of
purchase of two tax certificates for the allottee, resulted in
payment by Garden for the entire 1922-34 period of less
than the amount of the 1928-34 taxes. The compromise,
made at a time when the Indian was fully as free as any
other citizen, was, in the words of the District Court, a
"voluntary action and election of the allottee to proceed
in a manner which she deemed wise and prudent." It resulted in a net saving to the allottee of $66.42 for the taxable years 1928-1934.' The voluntary nature and the
5In 1923 Garden sued in a state court for recovery of her 19111921 taxes. A demurrer was sustained in the trial court and no appeal
was taken. The record does not show that she had made the tax payments under protest, which would probably have entitled her to

recovery under state law according to the doctrine of Warren v. Mahnomen County, 192 Minn. 464, 257 N. W. 77. This action, brought after
the tax benefits had been enjoyed, is no indication that she did not
originally pay the taxes willingly in order to enjoy the benefits of
county government. We need not consider the contention of the
County that the 1923 action is res adjudicata. Cf. Bryan County v.
United States, 123 F. 2d 782.
8The parties have entered the following stipulation as to the payment of these taxes: "That said taxes for the years 1922 to 1927,
both inclusive, were paid and discharged by the said allottee by the
purchase by her of State Assignment Certificate No. 76 in the amount
of $33.22 covering the taxes for the years 1922 to 1925, both inclusive,
and State Assignment Certificate No. 232 in the amount of $145.93
covering taxes for the years 1926 to 1934, both inclusive, all pursuant

MAHNOMEN COUNTY v. U. S.
474

Opinion of the Court.

fairness of the 1936 settlement are further indicated by
the fact that the County, in its answer to the complaint,
has declared its willingness to refund the sum paid in settlement in order that it may relevy the taxes for the years
1928 and 1934 and thus collect the taxes which Garden

admittedly owed.
The allottee paid the 1911-21 taxes voluntarily and settled the balance of her taxes to her advantage in 1936.

Neither Minnesota law " nor federal law ' requires that
to Chapter 387 Laws of Minnesota for 1935, that the aggregate for said
State Assignment Certificates is the sum of $179.15 and that the valid
taxes for the years 1928 to 1934, both inclusive, thereby discharged
amounted to $245.57 without penalty or interest and that therefore
said allottee effected a saving of $66.42 plus penalty and interest by the
purchase of said State Tax Assignment Certificates."
The government in effect concedes the merit of the argument that the
1936 settlement was a fair and voluntary compromise but seeks to
avoid its force by an assumption that the two tax certificates are to be
treated in different fashion. As the stipulation makes clear, Certificate
No. 76 formally covers the years 1922-25, and No. 232 covers the
years 1926-34. In view of the substantial benefit received by the
allottee from the compromise, the government has waived its claim
for any refund for the years 1926-27, but it apparently assumed that
Certificate No. 76 was unrelated to this compromise. However, both
certificates were purchased at the same time, both covered the same
lands, and each would be worthless without the other since the Minnesota law under which the arrangement was made is aimed at the
settlement of all delinquent taxes. C. 387, Minn. Laws, 1935; Minn.
Stat. (Henderson, 1941), § 280.11-13; cf. Security Trust Co. v. Heyderstaedt, 64 Minn. 409, 67 N. W. 219.. The reason for the use of
two certificates, one for the years prior to 1925 and the other for the
years thereafter, may have resulted from the fact that the Minnesota
statute applies different standards of value to compromises of taxes
delinquent prior to 1925 and those delinquent thereafter. As is indicated by the stipulation, the transaction for the two certificates was
considered as a unit and is in fact one compromise, termed by the
trial judge a settlement for a "lump sum."

MR. JuSTi

and MR.

JUSTICE RUT-

MURPHY, dissenting:

I dissent because the Court today takes too narrow a
view of our obligations to our Indian citizens--obligations
engendered by a history marked at times with trespass,
depredation and corruption, and by the concomitant necessity of aiding and protecting a people once dependent
and unlearned in our ways during their difficult period of
transition from that situation to the assumption of civic
responsibilities and assimilation into the mass of our
citizenry.
The assumptions which the opinion of the Court makes
regarding the tax status of Isabelle Garden's allotted land
but state the applicable law. The land which she received
in 1902 under a trust patent, issued pursuant to the Nelson
Act (25 Stat. 642) and the General Allotment Act (24
Stat. 388), was exempt from state and local taxation for
a period of 25 years, or until 1928. United States v.
Rickert, 188 U. S. 432; Board of Commissioners v. Seber,
318 U. S. 705. Since the tribe to which she belonged gave
up its extensive holdings after assurances that the forthcoming allotments would be non-taxable for 25 years,' this
tax exemption was a .vested right of which she could not
be deprived without her consent. Choate v. Trapp, 224
U. S. 665; Ward v. Love County, 253 U. S. 17; Carpenterv.
Shaw, 280 U. S. 363. Consequently, although Isabelle

cipated by virtue of the Clapp Amendments of 1906 and
1907 (34 Stat. 353, 1034), that legislation did not disturb
her vested tax exemption.
. The Court's reliance upon Ward v. Love County,
253
U. S. 17, as the basis for its decision with regard to the
1911-21 taxes paid by Isabelle Garden is unwarranted.
In that case it was assumed that an emancipated Indian
possessing a vested tax exemption could not recover back
taxes illegally assessed but voluntarily paid. 253 U. S.
at 22. But that case did not hold, as the Court now asserts
that it did, that the burden was on the Indian claimant
to establish the involuntary character of the payment.
Still less, since the United States was not a party, did it
consider what the rights of the United States would be
should it bring suit on behalf of the Indian. That is the
instant question, and while it is ordinarily true that the
burden of demonstrating the illegality of a collected tax
and compliance with the statutory requirements for refund
are upon the taxpayer seeking recovery, strong reasons
of policy suggest an opposite rule should prevail in this
case. While "emancipated" upon attaining twenty-one,
Isabelle Garden was an Indian "just emerging from a
state of dependency and wardship," Ward v. Love County,
supra,at p. 23, and the United States had the right, if not
the duty, to enforce for her benefit its guarantee of tax
immunity even though she was a citizen, the restrictions
on her property were removed, and she was otherwise
emancipated from a wardship status. Cf. Cramer v.
United States, 261 U. S. 219, 232; Heckman v. United
States, 224 U. S.413, 437; United States v. Minnesota, 270
U. S. 181, 194. To hold that the United States is foreclosed by action which Isabelle Garden may have taken or
failed to *take in ignorance of her legal rights is to hinder
the United States in the performance of its considered
policy of protection and to deprive her indirectly of that
of which she could not directly be deprived-her vested tax

exemption. Without legal right the County placed her
tax-exempt property upon its tax rolls immediately upon
her reaching adulthood, assessed it, and she paid the taxes

under circumstances not fully disclosed. In this situation
it is only fair to put the burden on the County, whose unauthorized action brought it about, of establishing that
she paid the taxes of her own free will with full knowledge
of her legal rights. A contrary rule fails to take into
account the long and not altogether creditable history of
our relations with the Indians and the obligations we owe
to those people to protect them intbf. rights.
Apart from the question of burden of proof, however,
I cannot agree with the opinion of the Court. The crucial issue with regard to the 1911-21 taxes is assumed
to be the voluntary or involuntary character of those
payments. The trial court admittedly made no findings
on this issue, and, in the absence of such findings, the
proper procedure would be to remand the case to the
trial court. Cf. Seminole Nation v. United States, 316
U. S. 286, 300. But if we are to decide the case here by
indulging in presumptions, I think the only tenable assumption is that the payments were made under compulsion. Isabelle Garden's land was assessed immediately after she became twenty-one, and she ran the risk
of losing it unless she paid the taxes. The record shows
that some of the Indians, originally included in this action,
who failed to pay their taxes did lose their allotments.
On the record it cannot be said with certainty that Isabelle
Garden paid the taxes for any other purpose than to
prevent her allotment from being sold for unpaid taxes.
This is borne out by the fact that she herself brought
suit in 1923 to recover the 1911-21 taxes.' Suggested
2This unsuccessful suit is no bar to the present action by the United
States. The interest of the United States in having its obligations and
policies respected cannot be defeated by judgments in actions to which
it is not a party. United States v. Candelaria,271 U. S. 432, 443-44;

MAHNOMEN COUNTY v. U. S.

MuRpiar, J., dissenting.

reasons for finding that the payments were voluntary are
without substance. Isabelle Garden did not have to pay
those taxes for the privilege of managing her allotment
as she wished. That right was hers under the Clapp
Amendments which were competent to remove the restrictions upon her land, but not the vested tax immunity. Cf. Choate v. Trapp, supra, p. 673. And there is
nothing in the record, apart from argument contained in
the County's unsuccessful motion for a new trial, to support the assumption that she voluntarily paid the taxes
to enjoy the benefits of county government. Payments
made under circumstances such as this, where an exempt
Indian runs the risk of losing her allotment unless the
taxes are paid, should not be considered voluntary payments. Cf. Ward v. Love County, supra, p. 23; Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, 369.
Finally, I cannot assent to the proposition that since
Isabelle Garden settled her taxes for 1922 through 1934
for less than the amount she owed for taxes validly assessed for the period beginning in 1928 when her land became taxable, the United States cannot recover for her the
amounts she paid to discharge the 1922-25 taxes. Those
taxes were discharged in 1936 by the purchase of State
Assignment Certificate No. 76. At the same time, the
taxes for 1926-34 were discharged by the purchase of
another assignment certificate. The fact, unexplained
by the stipulation, that two certificates were used to discharge the taxes suggests that there was no relation between the discharge of the 1922-25 taxes and the settlement of the admittedly due taxes for 1928-34. But even
if a relation is assumed, the United States should still
be allowed to recover the amount paid for Assignment

Certificate No. 76. Isabelle Garden probably would have
been able to compromise her 1928-34 taxes even more
advantageously if the County had not asserted its unwarranted claims for the years 1922-25 during which,
period the property was still tax exempt. That is sufficient to warrant recovery of the amount paid for Assignment Certificate No. 76 in discharge of the 1922-25
taxes."
