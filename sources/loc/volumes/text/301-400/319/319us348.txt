Statement of the Case.

319 U. S.

less judicial or any the more administrative. Nor should
it be adequate to wipe out a distinction that is so embedded
in our constitutional history and practice.
The opinion of the Court cuts deep into our judicial
fabric. The duty of the judiciary is to exercise the jurisdiction which Congress has conferred. What the Court
is doing today I might wholeheartedly approve if it were
done by Congress. But I cannot justify translation of the
circumstance of my membership oi this Court into an opportunity of writing my private view of legislative policy
into law and thereby effacing a far greater area of diversity
jurisdiction than Senator Norris, as chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, was ever able to persuade Congress
itself to do.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS and MR. JUSTICE REED join in this
dissent.
The CHIEF JUSTICE expresses no views as to the desirability, as a matter of legislative policy, of retaining the
diversity jurisdiction. In all other respects he concurs in
the opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.

CERTIORARI, 317 U. S. 621, to review a judgment of the

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. W. Edward Lee for 0. L. Hastings et al.; and Mr.
James D. Smullen, Assistant Attorney General of Texas,
with whom Messrs. Gerald C. Mann, Attorney General,
and E. R. Simmons, Assistant Attorney General, were on
the briefs, for the Railroad Commission of Texas et al.,petitioners.
Mr. Dan Moody argued the cause on the original argument, and submitted on the reargument, for respondents.
delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is an action in the nature of an equity proceeding
brought by the respondents to cancel an order of the
Texas Railroad Commission granting petitioners Hastings
and Dodson a permit under Rule 37 of the Railroad
Commission to drill an oil well. The respondents contend
that the order granting a permit to the petitioners deprives them of property without due process of law, and
that the order is invalid as a matter of Texas law. Jurisdiction is rested on diversity of citizenship.
There are no significant differences between the problems presented here and those in Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,
ante, p. 315. For the reasons set forth in that opinion, the
decision below is reversed and the cause is remanded with
instructions to dismiss the complaint.
It is so ordered.
