Syllabus.

their superior officers for leave and to make and file a
formal record of their superior officers' refusal.
. I fear that today's decision seriously limits the benefits
Congress intended to provide in the Soldiers' and Sailors'
Civil Relief Act. It apparently gives the Act a liberal
construction for the benefit of creditors rather than for
the benefit of soldiers. It places in trial judges an enormous discretion to determine from a distance whether a
person in military service has exercised proper diligence
to secure a leave, or whether it is best for the national
defense that he make no application at all. These are
questions on which the judiciary has no competence,
since only the military authorities can know the answers.
BUSEY r AL. v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 235. Argued June 1, 1943.-Decided June 14, 1943.

cause is remanded in order that the court below may reexamine the
questions whether ยง 47-2336 of the District of Columbia Code
(1940), which forbids unlicensed sales upon the public streets, or
from public space, should be construed as applicable to the facts of
this case, and whether, if applicable, it is constitutional. P. 580.
75 U. S. App. D. C. 352, vacated.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

PER CURIAM.

In this case petitioners, who are Jehovah's Witnesses,
were convicted of selling, on the streets of the District
of Columbia, magazines which expound their religious
views, without first procuring the license and paying the
license tax required by ยง 47-2336 of the District of Columbia Code (1940). In affirming the conviction the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia below had two
questions before it: whether the statute, was applicable
to petitioners, and if so whether its application as to
them infringed the First Amendment. The court construed the statute as applicable and sustained its constitutionality (75 U. S. App. D. C. 352, 129 F. 2d 24), following the decision in Cole v. Fort Smith, 202 Ark. 614,
151 S. W. 2d 1000, the judgment in which was affirmed
by this Court in Bowden v. Fort Smith, 316 U. S. 584, one
of the cases argued together with Jones v. Opelika, 316
U. S. 584. Since the decision below, and after hearing
reargument in the Opelika case, we Liave :vacated our
earlier judgment and held the license tax'7.impsedin that
case to be unconstitutional. Jones v. Opelika, 319 U. S.
103; Murdock v. Pennsylvania,319 U, S. 105. Petitioners
urge us to construe the District of Columbia statute as
'inapplicable in order to avoid the constitutional infirmity
which might otherwise exist-an infirmity conceded by
respondent on the oral argument before us. In view of
our decisions in the Opelika and Murdock cases, we vacate
the judgment in this case and remand the cause to the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to enable
it to reexamine its rulings on the construction and validity
of the District ordinance in the light of those decisions.
Cf. New York ex rel. Whitman v. Wilson, 318 U. S. 688,
690-691, and cases cited.
So ordered.
MR. JUSTIcE RUTLEDGE took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
