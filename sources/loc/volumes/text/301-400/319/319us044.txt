Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
By writs of certiorari these two cases were brought here
to resolve the conflict between them over the proper inter-

pretation of § 13 (b) (1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act
of 1938.1

Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act relates to the
maximum number of hours per week an employer may
employ an employee who is engaged in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce.'. The scope of the
exemption from the maximum hour standards granted by
13 (b) (1) in turn depends upon the interpretation to be
given § 204 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act. The portions
of that section which are important here are set out
below. '
152 Stat. 1060, 1068, § 13 (b):
"The provisions of section 7 shall not apply with respect to (1) any
employee with respect to whom the Interstate Commerce Commission
has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service
pursuant to the provisions of section 204 of the Motor Carrier Act,
1935; or (2) any employee of an employer subject to the provisions of
Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act."
2 The pertinent provisions of § 7 are as follows:
"No employer shall, except as otherwise provided in this section,
employ any of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce"(1) for a workweek longer than forty-four hours during the first
year from the effective date of this section,
"(2) for a workweek longer than forty-two hours during the second
year from such date, or
"(3) for a workweek longer than forty hours after the expiration of
the second year from such date,
unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in
excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and onehalf times the regular rate at which he is employed." 52 Stat. 1063.
3 49 Stat. 543, 49 U. S. C. § 301:
"See. 204. (a) It shall be the duty of the Commission"(1) To regulate common carriers by motor vehicle as provided in
this part, and to that end the Commission may establish reasonable

These cases turn upon the interpretation to be given the
exemption, by § 13 (b) (1) of the Fair Labor Standards
Act, of employees "with respect to whom the Interstate
Commerce Commission has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section 204 of the Motor Carrier Act, 1935."
In the Southland case, the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit construed this to exempt employees of
private carriers of property from the requirements of the
Fair Labor Standards Act only after the Interstate Commerce Commission has found need to etablish maximum
hours for such employees under the authority of § 204
(a) (3) of the Motor Carrier Act. Bayley v. Southland
Gasoline Co., 131 F. 2d 412. The Fourth Circuit, in the
Gibbons Company case, was of the opinion that "power"
in § 13 (b) meant the existence of the power and not its
actual exercise. 132 F. 2d 627; cf. Plunkett v. Abraham
Bros. Packing Co., 129 F. 2d 419, 421, C. C. A. 6.
The employers in both cases are concededly private
carriers of property, engaged in interstate commerce. All
employees are subject to regulation to promote safety of
operation under § 204 (a) (3). In both cases the employees seek recovery solely for the failure of their employers to pay them the time and a half for overtime as
requirements with respect to continuous and adequate service, trans-

portation of baggage and express, uniform systems of accounts, records,
and reports, preservation of records, qualifications and maximum hours
of service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment.

"(2) To regulate contract carriers by motor vehicle as provided in

this part, and to that end the Commission may establish reasonable
requirements with respect to uniform systems of accounts, records, and
reports, preservation of records, qualifications and maximum hours of
service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment.

"(3) To establish for private carriers of property by motor vehicle,
if need therefor is found, reasonable requirements to promote safety of
operation, and to that end prescribe qualifications and maximum hours
of service of employees, and standards of equipment ..

Opinion of the Court.

required by §7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act. There
is no claim for unpaid overtime compensation after May
1, 1940, the date that the Interstate Commerce Commission first found need to establish reasonable requirements
as to maximum hours to promote safety in the operations
of private carriers of property by motor vehicle under
§ 204 (a) (3).
The problem of statutory construction posed by this
conflict of circuits should not be solved simply by a literal reading of the exemption section of the Fair Labor
Standards Act and the delegation of power section of the
Motor Carrier Act. Both sections are parts of important
general statutes and their particular language should be
construed in the light of the purposes which led to the
enactment of the entire legislation. United States v.
American Trucking Assn., 310 U. S. 534,542. The words
of the sections under consideration are, however, basic
data from which to draw the sections' meaning. Section
13 (b) (1) exempts from the maximum hour limitation
of the Fair Labor Standards Act those employees over
whom the Interstate Commerce Commission "has power
to" prescribe maximum hours of service. Section 204 (a)
(3) certainly gives "power to" the Commission to establish maximum hours for the employees here involved.
There is a limitation on the authority delegated, urged
here by the employees as a condition precedent to the
existence of the power. This is that the Commission may
establish maximum hours only "if need therefor is found."
Since the employees seek unpaid overtime compensation
only for the period prior to a finding of need by the Commission, the employees argue that no "power"' existed in
the Commission during the tine for which compensation
is claimed. We conclude to the contrary. The power to
fix maximum hours has existed in the Commission since
the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act in 1935. Before
that power could be used, it was necessary to make a

finding of need. Such a necessity, however, did not affect
the existence of the power. Legislation frequently delegates power subject to a finding of need or necessity for
its exercise.'
The general purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Adt
.and of the Motor Carrier Act do not point to a different
conclusion. With the adoption of the Motor Carrier Act,
the national government undertook the regulation of interstate motor transportation to secure the benefits of an
efficient system. Safety through the establishment of
maximum hours for drivers was an important consideration. Maurer v. Hamilton,309 U. S. 598, 604, 607. When
Congress later came to deal with wages and hours, its primary concern was that persons should not be permitted
to take part in interstate commerce while operating with
substandard labor conditions. United States v. Darby,
312 U. S. 100, 115. The Fair Labor Standards Act sought
a reduction in hours to spread employment as well as to
maintain health. Overnight Motor Co. v. Missel, 316
U. S. 572, 576, 577. By exempting the drivers of motors
from the maximum hour limitations of the Fair Labor
Standards Act, Congress evidently relied upon the Motor
Carrier provisions to work out satisfactory adjustments
for employees charged with the safety of operations in a
business requiring fluctuating hours of employment; without the burden of additional pay for overtime.
Not only does the language of § 13 (b) (1) indicate this
Congressional purpose but what slight evidence there is
from the legislative history points to the same conclusion.
The amendment was adopted to free operators of motor

vehicles from the regulation by two agencies of the hours
of drivers. No comment appears as to the desirability of
statutory limitation on their hours prior to the establishment of maximum hours by the Commission. 81 Cong.
Rec. 7875; 82 Cong. Rec. 1573 et seq. No distinction was
pointed out between common, contract, and private carriers, although there was a distinction in § 204 (a). It
would seem that if the point now urged had been in the
mind of Congress it would have itself expressed the intention to leave private carriers subject to the Fair Labor
Standards Act until the Commission took action.' Even
under the argument of the employees, those drivers who
work for common or contract carriers would not at
any time be subject to the maximum hour provision of the
Labor Act. Furthermore, it was said on the Senate floor
that the amendment as to motor vehicle operators was to
give them the exemption from the Fair Labor Standards
Act enjoyed by the railway employers under the Hours of
Service Acts.' These do not provide for overtime pay and
like the subsections of § 204 of the Motor Carrier Act are
immediately effective to exempt the railroad employees
covered by their provisions from the maximum hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Cf. note 1.
Since the employees of contract and common motor carriers, as well as railway employees, are exempt from the
Fair Labor Standards provisions for maximum hours by
virtue of the same words which govern private motor carriers' employees, it would require definite evidence of a

An understanding that the Interstate Commerce Commission had
already acted upon maximum hours for drivers may have shortened the
discussion of the amendment. 81 Cong. Rec. 7875. Subsequent to
this discussion and prior to the passage of the Labor Act, the Commission had acted for common and contract carriers. Ex parte MC-2,

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.
No. 460. Argued March 5, 8, 1943.-Decided May 3, 1943.
The conclusion of the National Labor Relations Board in this case,
that an association of employees which prior to the passage of the
National Labor Relations Act in 1935 was a company-dominated and
supported union had not ceased to be such, notwithstanding the
reorganization of the association and efforts to dissipate the effect
of such early domination, was supported by substantial evidence;
and the order directing the company to disestablish completely the
association as bargaining representative, and to cease and desist
