APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF ERRORS AND APPEALS OF
XEW JERSEY.

No. 659. Argued April 12, 13, 1943.-Decided May 3, 1943.
1. A grantor domiciled in New Jersey made in New York in 1929 a
transfer of securities. The transfer was in trust, and irrevocable,
to pay the income to the grantor for life, then to his wife for life
if she survived him; if she predeceased him, the principal was to go
to two sons, nonresidents of New Jersey. The wife predeceased,
and the sons survived, the grantor, who in 1936 died domiciled in
New Jersey. The securities were at all timnes kept in New York
and there administered by the trustee. Held, a New Jersey tax upon
the transfer, measured by the value of the securities at the time of
the grantor's death, did not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendmbnt. P. 96.
2. The determination by the New Jersey courts, in applying the tax
statute of that State, of the kind of interest transferred and the time
when it was effected, is a matter of local law and is -binding here.

APPEAL from a judgment sustaining the imposition of a
state tax upon a transfer of property in trust.

Mr. Robert McC. Marsh, with whom Messrs. Jehiel G.
Shipman and Claude A. Hope were on the brief, for
appellants.
Mr. William A. Moore, Assistant Attorney General of
New Jersey, for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
New Jersey imposes a tax, with exceptions not material
here, "upon the transfer of any property, real or personal,
of the value of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or over, or of
any interest therein or income therefrom, in trust or other-

wise, to persons or corporations, . . . in the following

gift made in contemplation of the death of the grantor,
vendor or donor, or intended to take effect in possession or
enjoyment at or after such death." Laws of 1935, c. 90,
pp. 264-265. And see Rev. Stat. 1937, § 54: 34-1.
Prior to 1929 decedent, who at all times relevant here
was a resident of New Jersey, owned certain securities
which he kept in New York City in safekeeping with the
appellant tfust company, a New York corporation. In
1929 he went to New York City and executed a trust agreement by which he transferred those securities to the appellant corporation as trustee. The trust deed was an
irrevocable agreement under which he retained no control
over the property. It contained a provision that it was to
be construed according to the laws of New York -where it
was made and where it was to be enforced. It provided
that the trustee should pay the net income to the grantor
during his life and thereafter to his wife for life in case she
survived him. In the event that the grantor's wife did not
survive him and his two sons did, then the trustee was to
transfer to each son one-half of the principal. The wife
predeceased the grantor, who died in 1936 a resident of
New Jersey. Both sons survived him. They were nonresidents of New Jersey. The securities were at all times

kept in New York and there administered by the trustee.
1 The statute embraces the transfer of property "whether such property be situated within or without this State." Rev. Stat. 1937,
§ 54: 33-1. The word "transfer" is defined so a- to include "the passing of property, or any interest therein, in possession or enjoyment,
present or future" by deed. Id.
2Art. XVI, § 3 of the Constitution of the State of New York provides: "Mocys, creslts, securities and other intangible personal property within the state not employed in carrying on any business therein
by the owner shall be deemed to be located at the domicile of the owner
for purpose of taxation, and, if held in trust, shall not be deemed to be
located in this state for purposes of taxation because of the trustee being

Opinion of the Court.

319 U.S.

The New Jersey Prerogative Court held on an appeal
from the Tax Commissioner that the creation of the socalled equitable contingent remainders in the sons was a
"transfer" of an interest in the property by deed within the
meaning of the statute at a time when the grantor was
domiciled in New Jersey; 'that that transfer was made in
contemplation of the grantor's death and intended to take
effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death; and
that it was that transfer rather than the property on which
the tax was laid. It accordingly upheld the assessment of
the Commissioner against the contention of appellants
that the statute as construed and applied violated the due
process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment. 129 N. J. Eq. 186, 18 A. 2d 45. Both the
Supreme Court and the Court of Errors and Appeals of
New Jersey affirmed.' See 127 N. J. L. 468, 23 A. 2d 284;
129 N. J. L. 127, 28 A. 2d 174. The case is here on appeal.
§ 237 (a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 344 (a).
It is much too late to contend that domicile alone is
insufficient to give the domiciliary state the constitutional
power to tax a transfer of intangibles where the owner,
though domiciled within the state, keeps the paper evidences of the intangibles outside its boundaries. See
Blackstone v. Miller, 188 U. S. 189; Blodgett v. Silberman,
277 U. S. 1; Curry v. McCanless, 307 U. S. 357, and cases
cited. The command of the state over the owner, the
obligations which domicile creates, the practical necessity
domiciled in this state, provided that if no other state has jurisdiction
to subject such property held in trust to death taxation, it may be
deemed property having a taxable situs within this state for purposes

of death taxation."
8The Court held, in the alternative, that there was a taxable transfer
under the statute even if it be assumed that the remainder was vested
in the grantor until the happening of the contingency. Under that
view, there was no transfer until the actual vesting at his death. Yet
at that time he was domiciled in New Jersey. So the transfer was
taxable. 129 N. J. Eq. pp. 212-213.

of associating intangibles with the person of the owner at
his domicile since they represent only rights which he may
enforce against others-these are the foundation for the
jurisdiction of the domiciliary state to tax. Curry v.
McCanless, supra. We recently applie that principle to
sustain, on facts very close to the present ones, Oregon's
power to tax a transfer of intangibles held in Illinois by
one domiciled in Oregon. Pearsonv. McGraw, 308 U. S.
313. And see Van Dyke v. Tax Commission, 235 Wis. 128,
292 N. W. 313, aff'd 311 U. S. 605. The execution of the
present trust agreement in New York, the circumstance
that the remaindermen as well as the trustee were non
residents of the taxing state are quite immaterial. Domicile is the single controlling consideration in this situation,
as it is in the case of the taxation of income derived from
activities outside the state. Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, 286 U. S. 276, 279; New York ex rel. Cohn v.
Graves, 300 U. S. 308.
Appellants contend, however, that at the timeof the execution of the trust agreement there was no taxable transfer to the sons; that their interests were wholly speculative and contingent and did not become taxable until
they became vested interests; and that New Jersey has
not levied a tax according to the quality and value of the
interests as they existed in 1929 but has appraised the
property at its value at the time of the grantor's death.
They also argue that if the trust agreement be construed to transfer an .interest to the sons only at the
grantor's death, it was a transfer which New Jersey could
not tax.
The determination by the New Jersey courts of the
kind of interest transferred and the time when it was effected is a matter of local law binding on us. Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278, 288; Chanlerv. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466,
476; Nickel v. Cole, 256 U. S. 222, 225-226; Saltonstalt
v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260, 270. There is no constitu-

tional reason why a state may not make the transfer
inter vivos the taxable event and then measure the tax
by the value of the property at time of death. Keeney
v. New York, 222 U. S. 525. Cf. Milliken v. United
States, 283 U. S. 15, 20, 22, 23; Helvering v. Hallock, 309
U. S. 106, 111; Paul, Federal Estate and Gift Taxation
(1942) § 2.13. A state which may tax the disposition of
property made by one of its domiciliaries certainly may
make the payment of the tax conditional on his being
domiciled in the state at his death, and may delay payment until then. The fact that the taxable event and the
tax levy are widely separated in time is quite irrelevant.
In short, "The due process clause places no restriction on a
State as to the time at which an inheritance tax shall be
levied or the property valued for purposes of such tax."
Salomon v. State Tax Commission, 278 U. S. 484, 490. And
if the transfer to the sons is assumed to have taken place
only at the time of the grantor's death, there is no constitutional reason why the result need be different. The fact
that he did not then "own" the property is inconsequential. Cf. Whitney v. State. Tax Commission, 309 U. S.
530. The significant facts are that the rights of the remaindermen derived'solely from the trust agreement and
that the grantor died domiciled in New Jersey.
