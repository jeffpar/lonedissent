1. Under § 24 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, which
grants a right of review to "any person or party aggrieved" by an
order issued by the Securities & Exchange Commission under the
Act, a stockholder having a substantial financial or economic interest distinct from that of the corporation, which is directly and

adversely affected by an order of the Commission, is a "person
aggrieved." P. 388.
2. A sole stockholder of a company ordered by the Securities & Exchange Commission under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act to make certain accounting entries which would affect adversely the stockholder's right to dividends, held entitled under
§ 24 (a) to a review of the order as a "person aggrieved." Pittsburgh & West Virginia R. Co. v. United States, 281 U. S. 479, distinguished. P. 389.
3. Where review of an order issued by the Securities & Exchange

4. A stockholder owning 9,000 out of a total of some 5,250,000 shares
of stock of a corporation, charging illegality and fraud in a refinancing transaction between the corporation and a subsidiary

Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

CERTIORARI, 323 U. S. 701, 324 U. S. 835, to review, in
No. 470, the dismissal of a petition for review of an order
of the Commission; and, in No. 815, denials of motions to
dismiss (and to dismiss or affirm) a petition for review of
an order of the Commission.

Mr. R. A. Henderson, with whom Mr. A. J. G. Priest
was on the brief, for petitioner in No. 470.
Mr. Roger S. Foster,with whom Solicitor General Fahy
and Mr. Milton V. Freeman were on the briefs, for the
Securities & Exchange Commission.
Mr. Samuel Okin for respondent in No. 815.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
We granted certiorari in these cases because of an apparent conflict in the decisions below I concerning the
application of § 24 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act,' which provides that "any person or party
aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission" under
the Act may obtain a review of the order by the
Circuit Court of Appeals of the circuit of his residence or principal place of business. The difference
of view is as to the scope of the phrase "person or
party aggrieved."
In No. 470 it appears that the petitioner is a registered
holding company and owns all the common stock of the
Florida Power & Light Company. The paragraphs of
the order in controversy require Florida to make certain
accounting entries which will result in taking out of surplus moneys which would otherwise be available to pay

Opinion of the Court.

dividends to petitioner. The order including these' paragraphs was made as the result of proceedings before
the Commission to which American and Florida were
parties, and in which American participated; and the
provisions in controversy appear to have been drawn with
a view that they might be contested apart from other
matters before the Commission, and to have included
statements to the effect that they were made without
prejudice to the rights of American and Florida to
contest them.
American petitioned the court below to set aside the
order. Later Florida petitioned another Circuit Court of
Appeals to set aside the same paragraph attacked by
American. The Commission moved to dismiss American's petition, reciting the fact that Florida had instituted a similar proceeding, and asserting that American,
as sole stockholder, had no standing to seek review of the
order.
In No. 815 it appears that Electric Bond & Share
Company, a registered holding company, loaned $35,000,000 to a subsidiary, American and Foreign Power
Company, which is also a registered holding company,
and that the question of how this loan should be
refinanced became the subject of a proceeding before
the Commission.
The respondent, Okin, as the owner of 9,000 out of a total
of some 5,250,000 common shares of Electric Bond and
Share, was allowed to participate in the proceeding,
and opposed a proposition which the two companies
submitted for a method of refinancing the loan. The
Commission made an. order approving the proposal;
and Okin thereupon petitioned the court below to
review the order. The gist of his complaint was that
the refinancing as approved would reduce the value
of his stock by reducing the interest income of Electric
Bond and Share.

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325.U. S.

The Commission, before filing a certified copy of the
transcript of the record upon which the order complained
of was entered, moved to dismiss Okin's petition upon
two grounds. The first was that, within the meaning of
§ 24 (a), Okin was not a person or party aggrieved. The
second was that his objection to the order was frivolous.
In response to this the court held that, while it might well
be that Okin's attack lacked merit, if it did the result
should be an affirmance of the order rather than a dismissal
of the proceeding, and that jurisdiction to consider the
merits was lacking in the absence of a transcript of the
proceedings before the Commission. The motion was
accordingly denied.
The Commission alleges that subsequently it filed a
motion to dismiss or affirm, after having filed an abbreviated transcript containing so much of the record as was
relied on for the purposes of the motion, and that this
motion was denied without opinion. The record shows
that a motion to dismiss or affirm was denied without
opinion.
The Commission asks us to review both denials. The
respondent insists we lack jurisdiction so to do, for the
reason that neither order is final.
First. We hold that a stockholder having a substantial
financial or economic interest distinct from that of the corporation which is directly and adversely affected by an
order of the Commission, irrespective of any effect the
order may have on the corporation, is a "person aggrieved"
within the meaning of § 24 (a).
The Commission does not question that American, as
sole stockholder of Florida, has a substantial economic interest which is affected by the order; nor does it maintain
that the term "person aggrieved" is not broad enough to
include one whose economic interest is affected by an
order affecting his company under circumstances which
make it inequitable that he be bound by the action or

Opinion of the Court.

inaction of the management. It insists, however, that
American's application for review in the court below was
in the nature of a derivative action, commonly designated
a stockholder's suit, to redress a wrong to his corporation.
In this view, the Commission urges that, as Florida has
itself sought a review of the order, it must be presumed
that Florida will endeavor to protect the interest of its
sole stockholder, American, and that American has consequently failed to show any necessity for its representing
the interests of Florida.
The difficulty with this contention is that the action
of
the Commission in ordering thd transfer of an item from
surplus account to another account where the item will
not be available for the payment of dividends does not deprive the corporation of any asset or adversely affect the
conduct of its business in the manner it affects the petitioner, whereas the order has a direct adverse effect upon
American as a stockholder entitled to dividends. It was
because the court below overlooked this difference that it
found support for its decision in Pittsburgh & West Virginia R. Co. v. United States, 281 U. S. 479. That was a'
suit brought under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set
aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission
addressed to a carrier other than the plaintiff in the
suit. The plaintiff was a minority stockholder-of the
carrier affected. This court pointed out that, under the
accepted doctrine, the plaintiff had no standing to sue
since in attempting to do so it was merely seeking, in
a derivative capacity, to vindicate the'rights of the
corporation.
In awarding a review of an administrative proceeding,
Congress has power to formulate the conditions under
which resort to the courts may be had.' The persons ac8 Federal Power Comm'n v. Pacific Power & Light Co., 307 U. S.

corded a right to obtain review are, therefore, to be oscertained from the terms of the statute. Congress might
here have provided that only parties to the administrative
proceeding should have standing to obtain court review.
When the bill which became the Public Utility Holding
Company Act was introduced in the houses of Congress it
provided that "any person aggrieved by an order issued
by the Commission in a proceeding under this title to
which such person is a party may obtain a review of such
order."' The provision was altered so as to read as it
is now found in the statute. There seems to be no reason not to accord the statutory language its natural meaning in a case such as this, where the considerations which
would move the corporation to seek review differ from
those which may be relevant to the stockholder's interests. There may be situations in which the two interests
are the same and where consequently the grievance ought
not to support two proceedings identical in character.
This, however, is not such a case; for it is possible that
without any legal wrong to stockholders the corporation
may elect not to prosecute, or to abandon, a proceeding
for review.
This court has not allowed the usual criteria of standing to sue to deny persons who, in analogous cases under
that doctrine, would ordinarily not be permitted to invoke
court review, the benefit of such review under statutes
embodying the same language as § 24 (a). 5 The same
is true of the lower federal courts.' In these instances

the extension of the privilege to persons aggrieved was
held to extend it to those not technically parties, and,
therefore, not entitled, without the statutory provision,
to initiate litigation in a court.
While the matter was not specifically mooted, it would
seem that, until the instant cases, both the Commission
and the courts have been of the view that persons situated as are the stockholders in these cases were given the
statutory right to apply for review of a Commission order.
In Circuit Courts of Appeals, and in this court, stockholders have been heard upon the merits of orders made
against corporations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.!
The further suggestion is made that to permit stockholders to resort to court review would create unnecessary
inconvenience and expense since a stockholder entitled to
apply to a court may go to the Circuit Court of Appeals
of the circuit in which he resides or has his principal place
of business. Thus, it is urged, the Commission might
be called upon to answer suits in various circuits. But
§ 24 (a) provides that the Commission may file a transcript 6f its proceedings in any circuitqm which a proceeding has been-initiated and thereupon the court in which
the transcript is filed shall have exclusive jurisdiction.
Thus, if the Commission had here elected to file a transcript in the Circuit Court of Appeals where Florida applied for review, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit, in which American's petition was filed,
should have transferred that petition to the other court
and all the complaints would have been heard by a single
court and on the same record.8

Opinion of the Court.

Second. In No. 815, the court below held the respondent had standing to maintain the proceeding for review
of the Commission's order. In this case, Okin, as a stockholder, attacked the transaction made by his company
with its subsidiary on the grounds that it was both illegal
and fraudulent. His corporation urged that the Commission approve the transaction, thus taking a position
adverse to him. His application for review of the
Commission's order approving the settlement was, therefore, in the nature of a derivative or stockholder's action.
Inasmuch as he charged illegality and fraud, it is
evident that application to the Board of Directors
would have been futile. Under the Commission's own
view, therefore, the Circuit Court of Appeals was
right in denying a dismissal of the proceeding for lack
of standing on the part of Okin to initiate it. But, as
above stated in the decision of No. 470, we do not deem
it essential that the proceeding have the character of a
derivative suit.
The Commission urges us to hold that the petition on
its face presents only frivolous contentions. The court
below was unwilling to dismiss on this ground, holding
that a more appropriate order would be one of affirmance.
It required that the record be filed, as required by the Act,
as a condition of consideration of this matter. Apparently it was not satisfied that'the filing of an abbreviated
transcript furnished a basis for affirmance. The Commission, without inordinate delay or additional expense,
might have filed the full transcript of the proceedings
before it and obtained the judgment of the court on the
adequacy of the petition. We think we are not called
upon to examine the merits of the Commission's contentions or to reverse the decision denying the motion to
dismiss, or that denying the motion to dismiss or affirm.
The court below has discretion to deal with the problem
of the necessity of a record, and the extent thereof, in con-

the result in No. 815.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY, dissenting.
Fifteen years ago this Court was confronted with an
attempt by a corporate stockholder to set aside an order
of the Interstate Commerce Commission on the claim that
the order threatened the financial stability of the corporation to which it was directed as well as the "appellant's
financial interest as a minority stockholder." The Court,
speaking through Mr. Justice Brandeis, held that the
stockholder had no standing to maintain the suit since
"the order under attack does not deal with the interests
of investors" and the only injury feared "is the indirect
harm which may result to every stockholder from harm to
the corporation." Pittsburgh & West Virginia R. Co. v.
United States, 281 U. S. 479, 481. That holding, in my
estimation, disposes of this attempt by the American
Power & Light Company to obtain an independent judicial review of an order of the Securities and Exchange
Commission directed at a company in which it is the sole
stockholder.
Section 24 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act allows "any person or party aggrieved by an order
issued by the Commission" to obtain a review of such
order in an appropriate Circuit Court of Appeals. The
test, then, is whether American was "aggrieved" by the
Commission's order in this instance. Since the term "person or party aggrieved" is not defined in the Act we can

394

MumRY, J., dissenting.

325 U. S.

only assume that its meaning is to be drawn from traditional legal principles and from any relevant statutory
policies.
Only two paragraphs of the Commission's order are in
issue. They are directed solely to the Florida Power &
Light Company, all of whose securities are owned by
American. These paragraphs fail even to mention American; they neither require nor prohibit any action by it.
Nor do they in any way affect American's rights as a
stockholder. They simply require Florida to make certain
accounting adjustments in the form of charges to earned
surplus. Since dividends are paid from earned surplus
and since these requirements will decrease the earned surplus account, the Court reasons that "the order has a
direct adverse effect upon American as a stockholder
entitled to dividends." From this it is concluded that
American is "aggrieved" by the order. To that reasoning
and conclusion I cannot agree.
1. There is no evidence in the record to justify the assumption that the items to be charged to surplus would
necessarily have been available for distribution as-dividends to American or that the surplus was otherwise inadequate to pay the normal amount of dividends. Florida
might well have retained these items for reinvestment in
the business, thus making them unavailable for dividend
distribution. Moreover, to the extent that Florida retains these items in its capital structure, American's ultimate equity in the organization is increased. It cannot be
said, therefore, that American has been adversely and
permanently affected by this order.
2. But even if it were clear that the order would necessarily restrict dividend payments it does not follow that
the restraint so directly affects American as to entitle it
to challenge the order as a person "aggrieved." It has
long been established that ordinarily the mere accunulation of an adequate surplus does not entitle a stockholder

AMERICAN POWER CO. v. S. E. C.
38

395

MuRPHY, J., dissenting.

to dividends until the directors, in their discretion, declare them. Southern Pacific Co. v.. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330.
And until such a declaration is made the directors are free
to deal with that surplus in good faith, as they may, see fit
in the exercise of their business judgment, the stockholders
not having sufficient interest in undeclared or potential
dividends to challenge such action. See Wabash R. Co. v.
Barclay, 280 U. S. 197. The stockholders' interest in such
matters, in other words, is indistinct from that of the corporation prior to an actual declaration. Thus if the Florida management had made the same accounting adjustments as those ordered by the Commission in thi, case
American would not be sufficiently "aggrieved" to attempt
to prevent Florida from making such adjustments, even
though dividend payments might be adversely affected.
No adequate reason is evident from the facts or from the
opinion of this Court as to why American is any more
directly or adversely "aggrieved" when the accounting
adjustments are ordered by the Commission rather than by
Florida's management or as to why any different results
should follow. The impact of the adjustments in either
instance is presumably to strengthen the financial structure of Florida; that they may have the incidental effect
of decreasing dividends temporarily has never heretofore
been sufficient to entitle a stockholder to challenge the
adjustments.
3. The fact that American is trying to appeal an administrative order rather than to institute an original
action against Florida's management is irrelevant under
the circumstances. The Commission's order does not deal
with the rights of stockholders as such, in which case a
stockholder clearly could appeal from the order. Securities & Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S.
80; Lawless v. Securities & Exchange Commission, 105 F.

325 U. S.

Co. v. Securities & Exchange Commission, 134 F. 2d 65.
See also Otis & Co. v. Securities & Exchange Commission,
323 U. S. 624. Nor is there any charge of fraud or breach
of duty on the part of Florida, from which it could be
argued that American should be given the right to appeal
since Florida might not act to protect American's legitimate interests. Indeed, such a possibility is expressly
negatived by the fact that Florida has already appealed
the Commission's order to another court and is urging
precisely the same considerations that American seeks to
present in this proceeding. In view of American's complete control of Florida through stock ownership there is
no danger of conflicting interests arising between the two
companies in the other proceeding. There is thus no basis
for concluding that the economic interest asserted by
American cannot or will not be adequately protected by
Florida. Cf. Federal Communications Commission v.
Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U. S. 470; Associated
Industries v. Ickes, 134 F. 2d 694, dismissed as moot, 320
U. S. 707. The inevitable logic of the facts of this case
leads straight back to the conclusion that American's
grievance is only "the indirect harm which may result to
every stockholder from harm to the corporation." Pittsburgh & West Virginia R. Co. v. United States, supra,487.
That conclusion calls for a dismissal of American's attempted appeal from the Commission's order just as it
would call for a dismissal of any suit brought by American
against Florida on these facts.
4. The Court's conclusion here leads only to unfortunate consequences in the judicial review of administrative orders. If the remote economic interest asserted
by American is sufficient to institute a review proceeding such as this there is no limit to which minority
stockholders may harass the Commission and their respective corporations by challenging orders of the Commission directed to the corporations. It is no answer that

AMERICAN POWER CO. v. S. E. C.
385

MuRPHY. J.. dissenting.

§ 24 (a), gives exclusive jurisdiction to the court in which
the Commission files the transcript of a particular proceeding. That provision clearly envisages two or more
.appeals in different courts by persons who are legally
"aggrieved" by a Commission order and who can obtain
adequate relief only by individual appeals. But under
this decision stockholders are now free, whenever they feel
that their potential dividends are affected by Commission action directed to the corporation's accounting
entries against which dividends are charged, to appeal
regardless of the management's wishes in the matter and
regardless of the management's ability to protect their
interests fully and fairly. Stockholders in effect supplant
the management in deciding whether to appeal from administrative action affecting such internal accounting procedure of the corporation, a problem which until now was
exclusively and properly within the domain of the corporate directors and officers. Many stockholders are not
in a position to know the intricacies of modern corporate
accounting or the proper attitude to take, from the corporation's point of view, as to the challenged administrative action. But now they have been given carte
blanche to prioceed as they desire. It is difficult 'to believe
that Congress intended such consequences to flow from its
use of the word "aggrieved" in § 24 (a).
Finally, I dissent from the Court's disposition of the
writ in the Okin case. It is no doubt true, as the Court
states, that an assertion that a transaction approved by
the Commission was fraudulently entered into by the
corporation is sufficient to entitle the stockholder to an
independent review of the Commission's action. But it
does nit follow that the mere cry of "fraud" is sufficient.
There must be some bona fide basis appearing on the face
of so serious a charge. Here, however, Okin merely
charges that (1) a Maine corporation is not subject to the
Commission's jurisdiction because its subsidiaries operate

outside the United States; (2) the particular transaction
In issue is detrimental to Okin's interests as a stockholder
inasmuch as the management extended a note of a subsidiary at a reduced interest rate; (3) various corporate officers held conversations with each other and with members
of the Commission's staff; (4) his constitutional rights
have been invaded; and (5) the transaction is void for
failure to comply with § 20 of the New York Stock Corporation Law. Such frivolous claims of fraud' are insufficient to warrant making an exception to the general rule
that a stockholder cannot appeal an administrative order
which involves only the corporation as such.

of which under the state constitution was upheld by the highest
court of the State-,-violated no fundamental principle of justice and
denied no right of the petitioner under the Federal Constitution.

2. Although there was but one Negro on the grand jury which indicted
the Negro petitioner, the record in this case fails to establish that
the jury commissioners deliberately and intentionally limited the
number of Negroes on the panel, or that there was discrimination
on account of race in the selection of the grand jury, in violation of
the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Pp. 403, 407.
