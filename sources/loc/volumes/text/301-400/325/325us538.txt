HILL ET AL. V. FLORIDA EX REL. WATSON,
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA.

No. 811. Argued April 4, 5, 1945.-Decided June 11, 1945.
1. Section 4 of a statute of Florida (Laws of 1943, c. 21968) provides
that no person shall be licensed as a "business agent" of a labor
union who has not been a citizen of the United States for more
than 10 years, who has been convicted of a felony, or who is not
a person of good moral character. Section 6 requires every labor
union operating in the State to file an annual report disclosing its
name, the location of its principal offices, and the names and
addresses of its officers; and to pay an annual fee of $1.00 therefor.
Violation of the statute by any person or labor organization is made
a misdemeanor punishable by fine and imprisonment. A state
court enjoined the petitioner labor union from further functioning
and operating, and enjoined its business agent from further acting
in that capacity, until they shall have complied with the statute.
Held that §§ 4 and 6 of the Florida statute, as so applied, are invalid
as in conflict with the National Labor Relations Act. P. 541.
2. As here applied, § 4 of the Florida statute circumscribes the "full
freedom" of choice of collective bargaining agents which is secured
to employees by the National Labor Relations Act. P. 541.
3. The requirement of reports and the exaction of a $1.00 annual fee
in § 6 does not, in and of itself, conflict with the National Labor
Relations Act; it is the sanction here imposed-injunction against
the labor union functioning as such-which is inconsistent with the
federally protected process of collective bargaining. P. 543.
155 Fla. 254, 19 So. 2d 857, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 324 U. S. 832, to review the affirmance of
a decree granting injunctions against a labor union and its
business agent until they shall have complied with the
requirements of a state statute the validity of which they
challenged.

Messrs. Joseph A. Padway and Herbert S. Thatcher for

petitioners.

HILL v. FLORIDA.
538

Opinion of the Court.

J. Tom Watson, Attorney General of Florida, and
Howard S. Bailey, Assistant Attorney General, for
respondent.
Briefs were filed by Solicitor General Fahy, Messrs.
Robert L. Stern, Alvin J. Rockwell, Miss Ruth Weyand
and Mrs. Elizabeth W. Weston on behalf of the United
States; Messrs. Arthur Garfield Hayes and Osmond K.
Fraenkel on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union;
and Mr. Paul O'Dwyer on behalf of the Workers Defense
League, as amici curiae, in support of petitioners.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The only question we find it necessary to decide in this
case is whether a Florida statute' regulating labor union
activities has been applied to these petitioners in a manner which brings it into irreconcilable conflict with the
collective bargaining regulations of the National Labor
Relations Act. 49 Stat. 449. That Federal Act, we
decided in Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Board, 315
U. S. 740, did not wholly foreclose state power to regulate
labor union activities. Certain conduct, such as mass
picketing, threats, violence, and related actions, we held
were not governed by the Wagner Act, and hence, Wisconsin was free to regulate them. We carefully pointed
out, however, that had the state order under consideration, "affected the status of the employees, or . . caused
a forfeiture of collective bargaining rights, a distinctly
different question would arise." That question which we
so distinctly reserved in the Wisconsin case has now arisen
in this case.
The Attorney General of Florida filed a bill for injunction against the petitioner union and its business agent,
Hill, in a state court. He sought to restrain both of them

325 U. S.

from functioning as such until they had complied with
the Florida statute. The basis for the relief sought against
Hill was that he had for a pecuniary reward acted as a
business agent in violation of § 4; the basis for the relief
sought against the union was that it had operated without
obtaining a state license as required by § 6. Section 4,
which was invoked against Hill, provides that no one shall
be licensed as a "business agent" of a labor union who has
not been a citizen of the United States for more than 10
years, who has been convicted of a felony, or who is not a
person of good moral character. Application for a license
as a "business agent" must be accompanied by a $1.00
fee and a statement signed by officers of the union setting
forth the agent's authority. The statute then provides
that the application be held for 30 days to permit the
filing of objections to the issuance of a license. A Board,
composed of the Governor, the Secretary of State, and
the Superintendent of Education, then passes on the
application, and if it finds the applicant measures up to
the standards of the act, as it sees them, it authorizes the
license to be issued, to "expire on December 31 of the year
for which issued unless sooner surrendered, suspended, or
revoked." Section 2 (2) defines "business agent" as "any
person who shall for a pecuniary or financial consideration
act or attempt to act" for a union "in soliciting or receiving from any employer any right or privilege for employees . . ." or "in the issuance of membership or
authorization cards, work permits or any other evidence
of rights granted or claimed in, or by, a labor organization . . ." Section 6, which the Attorney General invoked against the union, requires every labor union
"operating" in the state to file a written report with the
Secretary of State, disclosing its name, the location of its
offices, and the names and addresses of its officers. Section
14 makes it a misdemeanor for "any person or labor
organization" to violate the statute.

HILL v. FLORIDA.
538

Opinion of the Court.

Motions by Hill and the union to dismiss the bill on
the ground that the state statute violated the Fourteenth
Amendment and conflicted with the Wagner Act were
denied. Answers were then filed admitting violations of
§§ 4 and 6. The court held the licensing and reporting
provisions valid. Hill was enjoined from further acting as
the union's business agent until he obtained a state
license. The union was enjoined from further functioning and operating until it made the report and paid the
fee to the Secretary of State. The State Supreme Court
affirmed. 155 Fla. 254, 19 So. 2d 857.
It is apparent that the Florida statute has been so construed and applied that the union and its selected representative are prohibited from functioning as collective
bargaining agents, or in any other capacity, except upon
conditions fixed by Florida. The declared purpose of the
Wagner Act, as shown in its first section, is to encourage
collective bargaining, and to protect the "full freedom"
of workers in the selection of bargaining representatives
of their own choice. To this end Congress made it illegal
for an employer to interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in selecting their representatives. Congress attached no conditions whatsoever to their freedom of
choice in this respect. Their own best judgment, not that
of someone else, was to be their guide. "Full freedom"
to choose an agent means freedom to pass upon that
agent's qualifications.
Section 4 of the Florida Act circumscribes the "full freedom" of choice which Congress said employees should
possess. It does this by requiring a "business agent" to
prove to the satisfaction of a Florida Board that he
measures up to standards set by the State of Florida as
one who, among other things, performs the exact function of a collective bargaining representative. To the
extent that § 4 limits a union's choice of such an "agent"
or bargaining representative, it substitutes Florida's
judgment for the workers' judgment.

542

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

Thus, the "full freedom" of employees in collective bargaining which Congress envisioned as essential to protect
the free flow of commerce among the states would be, by
the Florida statute, shrunk to a greatly limited freedom.
No elaboration seems required to demonstrate that § 4 as
applied here "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of
Congress." Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67;
Cloverleaf Butter Co. v. Patterson,315 U. S. 148; Napier
v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605. It is not
amiss, however, to call attention to the fact that operation
of this very section has already interfered with the collective bargaining process. An employer before the Labor
Board defended its refusal to bargain with a duly selected
representative of workers on the ground that the representative had not secured a Florida license as a business
agent. In the Matter of Eppinger & Russell Co., 56
N. L. R. B. 1259. The Board properly rejected the employer's contention, holding that Congress did not intend
to subject the "full freedom" of employees to the eroding
process of "varied and perhaps conflicting provisions of
state enactments." Cf. Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U. S. 111.
Since the Labor Board has held that an employer must
bargain with a properly selected union agent despite his
failure to secure a Florida license, it is argued that the
state law does not interfere with the collective bargaining
process. But here, this agent has been enjoined, and if
the Florida law is valid he could be found guilty of a
contempt for doing that which the act of Congress permits
him to do. Furthermore, he could, under § 14 of the state
law, be convicted of a misdemeanor and subjected to fine
and imprisonment. The collective bargaining which Congress has authorized contemplates two parties free to
bargain, and cannot thus be frustrated by state legislation.
We hold that § 4 of the Florida Act is repugnant to the
National Labor Relations Act.

HILL v. FLORIDA.
538

543

Opinion of the Court.

Section 6, as here applied, stands no better. The requirement as to the filing of information and the payment
of a $1.00 annual fee does not, in and of itself, conflict
with the Federal Act. But, for failure to comply, this
union has been enjoined from functioning as a labor union.
It could not without violating the injunction and also subjecting itself to the possibility of criminal punishment
even attempt to bargain to settle a controversy or a strike.
It is the sanction here imposed, and not the duty to report, which brings about a situation inconsistent with the
federally protected process of collective bargaining.' Cf.
Western Union Co. v. Massachusetts, 125 U. S. 530, 553,
554; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Kaw Valley Drainage District, 233 U. S. 75, 78; St. Louis S. W. R. Co. v.
Arkansas, 235 U. S. 350, 368. This is true because if the
union or its representatives acted as bargaining agents
without making the required reports, presumably they
would be liable both to punishment for contempt of court
and to conviction under the misdemeanor section of the
act. Such an obstacle to collective bargaining cannot be
created consistently with the Federal Act.
Nor can it be argued that our decision in Thomas v.
Collins, 323 U. S. 516, forecloses such result. In that case
we did not have, as here, to deal with such a direct impediment to the free exercise of the federally established
right to collective bargaining.
Our holding is that the National Labor Relations Act
and §§ 4 and 6 of the Florida Act as here applied cannot
"move freely within the orbits of their respective purposes
without impinging upon one another." Union Brokerage
Co. v. Jensen, 322 U. S. 202, 207.2 Accordingly the case

is reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE.

I concur in so much of the opinion as finds conflict between the licensing provisions of the Florida statute and
the National Labor Relations Act. I do so only on the
ground that the command of § 7 of the National Labor
Relations Act that "employees shall have the right . . .
to bargain collectively through representatives of their
own choosing" conflicts with the licensing provisions of
the Florida Act purporting to fix the qualifications of business agents of labor organizations.
This, of course, does not mean that labor unions or their
officers are immune, in other respects, from the exercise of
the state's police power to punish fraud, violence, or other
forms of misconduct, either because of the commerce
clause or the National Labor Relations Act. It is familiar
ground that the commerce clause does hot itself preclude
a state from regulating those matters which, not being
themselves interstate commerce, nevertheless affect the
commerce, Californiav. Thompson, 313 U. S. 109, 113114, 116, and cases cited; Parkerv. Brown, 317 U. S. 341,
360, and cases cited, and that the state's authority is
curtailed only as Congress may by law prescribe in the
exercise of the commerce power. United States v. Darby,
312 U. S. 100, 119, and cases cited. I can find nothing in
ville, Florida, which company has been held by the Labor Board to
be engaged in interstate commerce and subject to the Federal Act.
Matter of St. Johns River Shipbuilding Co., 52 N. L. R. B. 12; 52

R. B. No. 55. The case was submitted on the pleadings, which assume
that interstate commerce questions were involved. The Supreme
Court of Florida so treated the case in holding that there was no constitutionally prohibited conflict between the Florida and Federal

Opinion of STONE, C. J.

the National Labor Relations Act or its legislative history to suggest a Congressional; purpose to' withdraw the
punishment of fraud or violence, or the violation of any
state law otherwise valid, from the state's power merely
because the state might subject the business agent of a
labor union, who violates its law, to imprisonment, which
would prevent his functioning as a bargaining agent for
employees under the National Labor Relations Act.
Allen-Bradley Local v. Board, 315 U. S. 740, 748. See S.
Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. Rep. No. 1147,
74th Cong., 1st Sess.
For the same reasons, the National Labor Relations Act
does not preclude a state from requiring a labor union,
or its officers and agents, as such, to procure licenses or
make reports or perform other duties which do not materially obstruct the exercise of rights conferred by the
National Labor Relations Act or other federal legislation.
Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 542. But it is quite
another matter to say that a state may fix standards or
qualifications for labor unions and their officers and agents
which would preclude any of them from being chosen and
from functioning as bargaining agents under § 7 of the
National Labor Relations Act. The right conferred on
employees to bargain collectively through a representative
of their own choosing is the foundation of the National
Labor Relations Act. Without that right, or if it were
restricted by state action, the Act as drawn would have
little scope for operation. The fact that the National
Labor Relations Act imposes sanctions on the employer
alone does not mean that it did not, by § 7, confer the right
on employees as against others as well as the employer
to make an uninhibited choice of their bargaining agents.
Cf. United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219. Section 7
confers the right of choice generally on employees and
not merely as against the employer.

Opinion of

STONE, C. J.

325 U. S.

I dissent from so much of the opinion as holds that § 6
of the Florida statute, as applied, is invalid becauseit
conflicts with the National Labor Relations Act. The
requirement of filing by a labor organization of the information prescribed by § 6, accompanied by a filing fee of
$1.00, is, as the opinion of the Court recognizes, not
incompatible with the National Labor Relations Act,
since it in no substantial way hinders or interferes with the
"performance of the union's functions under that Act.
Thomas v. Collins, supra, 542; cf. Northwestern Bell Tel.
Co. v. Nebraska Comm'n, 297 U. S. 471, 478; see Smith v.
Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 282 U. S. 133; Western Distributing

Power Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n, 292 U. S. 290;
NaturalGas Co. v. Slattery,302 U. S. 300,306.
Notwithstanding the conflict between the commerce
clause or the federal statute and the local regulation which
was found in Western Union. Co. v. Massachusetts, 125
U. S. 530, 554, and St. Louis S. W. R. Co. v. Arkansas, 235
U. S. 350, 368, I can find no' logical or persuasive legal
ground or practical reason *for saying that Congress by
the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act intended to preclude the state from exercising to the utmost
extent its sovereign power to enforce the lawful demands
of § 6 of the Florida Act. There is no more occasion for
implying such a Congressional purpose where the union
is prevented from functioning by punishment or injunction, for a violation of a valid state law, than for saying
that Congress, by the National Labor Relations Act, intended to forbid the states to arrest and imprison a labor
leader for the violation of any other valid state law, because that would pfevent his or the union's functioning
under the NationalLabor Relations Act. The question is
wholly one of state power.. Here the state power is not
restricted by the comlneree clause-standing alone, nor, so
far as I can see, by any .Congressional intention expressed

in the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.
Union Brokerage Co. v. Jensen, 322 U. S. 202, 206.
MR. JUSTIcE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.

The Court is striking down a State law not because
such a statute in and of itself is beyond the power of a
State to enact. The Florida statute is nullified because,
so Florida is told, Congress has barred Florida from this
lawmaking, although Congress has neither expressly nor
by fair inference forbidden Florida to deal with the matter
with which Florida has dealt and Congress has not. Concretely, Congress by protecting employees in their right to
choose representatives for collective bargaining . free from
the coercion or influence of employers did not impliedly
wipe out the right of States under their police power to.
require qualifications appropriate for union officials
having fiduciary duties.
It was settled early in our constitutional history that
the mere fact that Congress has power to regulate commerce among the several States does not exclude State
legislation in the exercise of the police power, even though
it may affect such commerce, where the subject matter
does not demand a nation-wide rule. Willson v. Blackbird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245; Cooley v. Board of
Wardens, 12 How. 299, 319. The States, in short, may
speak on matters even in the general domain of commerce
so long as Congress is silent. But when Congress has
spoken, although not as fully as the Constitution authorizes, that is, when a federal enactment falls short of the
Congressional power to legislate touching commerce, the
States may still speak where Congress is still silent. The
real question is: Has Congress spoken so as to silence the
States? The same regard for the harmonious balance of
our federal system, whereby the States may protect local
interests despite the dormant Commerce Clause, allows
State legislation for the protection of local interests so

325 U. S.

long as Congress has not supplanted local regulation either
by a regulation of its own or by an unmistakable indication that there is to be no regulation at all. The relation
of such enactments of local concern to federal enactments
which fall short of the full reach of the Constitution raises
a problem of judicial judgment similar to that presented
where a State law encounters no federal statute. The
problem is one of judicial accommodation between respect
for the supplanting authority of Congress and the reserved
police power of the States. Long ago this policy of accommodation was formulated by this Court: "We agree, that
in the application of this principle of supremacy of an act
of Congress in a case where the State law is but the exercise of a reserved power, the repugnance or conflict should
be direct and positive, so that the two acts could not
be reconciled or consistently stand together." Sinnot v.
Davenport, 22 How. 227, 243.
But conflicts between State laws regulating aspects of
business enterprise and federal enactments relating to
such aspects were few and far between in the first hundred
ygars of our history. Apart from taxes and tariffs, the
regulation of fisheries, and measures dealing with the
coastwise trade, there was little intervention by federal
legislation in the affairs of men until, in 1887, the Interstate Commerce Act initiated the tide of federal regulation. Since then, this Court has often had to deal with
the claim that a federal statute, though only partially
regulating a particular phase of commerce, superseded
State legislation in the exercise of the police power bearing
upon that phase.
In a great variety of cases, the Court has applied the
accommodation formulated in Sinnot v. Davenport, supra, and either reasserted or reinforced that policy. The
emphasis has been on recognizing that both the State
law and the federal statute must be allowed to prevail
if they may prevail together-that is, if they do not, as a

matter of language or practical enforcement, collide, or if
Congress has not manifested an unambiguous purpose
that there be no regulation, either State or federal, as to
matters for which it has not prescribed. This judicial
principle is established by an impressive body of opinions.
A few samples must suffice:
1. "May not these statutory provisions stand without obstructing or embarrassing the execution of the act
of Congress? This question must of course be determined
with reference to the settled rule that a statute enacted in
execution of a reserved power of the State is not to be
regarded as inconsistent with an act of Congress passed in
the execution of a clear power under the Constitution,
unless the repugnance or conflict is so direct and positive
that the two acts cannot be reconciled or stand together."
Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Haber, 169 U. S.613, 623.
2. "It should never be held that Congress intends to
supersede or by its legislation suspend the exercise of the
police -powers of the States, even when it may do so,
unless its purpose to effect that result is clearly manifested ...
"The principle is universal that legislation, whether
by Congress or by a State, must be taken to be valid, unless the contrary is made clearly to appear; and as the contrary does not so appear, the statute of Colorado is to be
taken as a constitutional exercise of the power of the
State." Reid v. Colorado, 187 U. S.137, 148, 153.
3. "Is, then, a denial to the State of the exercise of its
power for the purposes in question necessarily implied
in the Federal statute? For when the question is whether
a Federal act overrides a state law, the entire scheme of
the statute must of course be considered and that which
needs must be implied is of no less force than that which
is expressed. If the purpose of the act cannot otherwise be
accomplished-if its operation within its chosen field else
must be frustrated and its provisions be refused their

natural effect--the state law must yield to the regulation of Congress within the sphere of its delegated
power....
"But the intent to supersede the exercise by the State
of its police power as to matters not covered by the Federal legislation is not to be inferred from the mere fact
that Congress has seen fit to circumscribe its regulation
and to occupy a limited field. In other words, such intent is not to be implied unless the act of Congress fairly
interpreted isin actual conflict with the law of the State.
This principle has had abundant illustration." Savage v.
Jones, 225 U. S. 501, 533.
4. "These cases recognize the established rule that a
state law enacted under any of the reserved powers-especially if under the police power-is not to be set aside
as inconsistent with an act of Congress, unless there is
actual repugnancy, or unless Congress has, at least, manifested a purpose to exercise its paramount authority over
the subject. The rule rests upon fundamental grounds
that should not be disregarded." Missouri,K. & T. R. Co.
v. Harris,234 U. S. 412, 418-419.
5. "In construing federal statutes enacted under the
power conferred by the commerce clause of the Constitution the rule is that it should never be held that Congress
intends to supersede or suspend the exercise of the reserved powers of a State, even where that may be done,
unless, and except so far as, its purpose to do so is clearly
manifested." Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities
Comm'n, 245 U. S. 493, 510.
6. "The principle thus applicable has been frequently
stated. It is that the Congress may circumscribe its regulation and occupy a limited field, and that the intention
to supersede the exercise by the State of its authority as
to matters not covered by the federal legislation is not to
be implied unless the Act of Congress fairly interpreted
is in conflict with the law of the State." Atchison, T. &

that when exerted it excludes and supersedes state legislation in respect of the same matter. But Congress may so

measure is plainly inconsistent with state regulation of
the same matter." Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley R. Co.,

9. "The case calls for the application of the well-established principle that Congress may circumscribe its regulation and occupy a limited field, and that the intent
to supersede the exercise by the State of its police power
as to matters not covered by the federal legislation is not
to be implied unless the latter fairly interpreted is in
actual conflict with the state law." Townsend v. Yeomans,
301 U. S.441, 454.

legislation an essential protective power. And when Congress does exercise its paramount authority, it is obvious
that Congress may determine how far its regulation shAll

When it does so, state regulation outside that limited field
and otherwise admissible is not forbidden or displaced.
The principle is thoroughly established that the exercise
by the State of its police power, which would be valid
if not superseded by federal action, is superseded only
where the repugnance or conflict is so 'direct and positive'
that the two acts cannot 'be reconciled or consistently
stand together.'" Kelly v. Washington,302 U. S.1, 10.
These rules of respect for the allowable area of State.
law have not been ceremonial phrases dishonored in observance. Deviations from this policy have been very
rare, considering the fact that we are dealing not with a
mathematical formula but with the application of a constitutional doctrine by judicial judgment. The deviations have been. so rare all these decades, despite the
changes in the Court, because of fidelity to the purposes
of this vital aspect of our federalism.
A survey of the scores of cases in which the claim has
been made that State action cannot survive some contradictory command of Congress leaves no doubt that
State action has not been set aside on mere generalities
about Congress having "occupied the field," or on the
basis of loose talk instead of demonstrations about "conflict" between State and federal action. We are in the
domain of government and practical affairs, and this
Court has not stifled State action, unless what the State
has required, in the light of what Congress has ordered,
would truly entail contradictory duties or make actual,
not argumentative, inroads on what Congress has commanded or forbidden.
Since the bulk of federal regulatory legislation has
until recently been concerned with the great interstate
utilities, the cases dealing with the relation of State to
federal legislation in this field shed most light on the
question before us. Moreover, these present situations
least favorable to tolerance for State legislation. The

HILL v. FLORIDA.
538

J., dissenting.

need for national control, with corresponding restriction
of local regulation, is presumably most powerfully asserted where interstate transportation and communication are involved.
The range and particularity of federal legislation regulating railroads, expressed in a long series of enactments,
have given rise to most of the cases in which State action
has been found in conflict with federal action. Once Congress established a uniform federal rule concerning liability for freight loss or damage in place of the variegated
rules of the several States, State policy "differently conceived" had to yield. Charleston& W. C. R. Co. v. Varnvale Co., 237 U. S. 597, 604. The comprehensive control
over railroad rates, progressively exercised by Congress,
necessarily displaced much prior State law. And so, the
permissive power of States to deal with aspects of transportation in the absence of federal law ceased when State
action ran counter to the specific requirements of the
Hepburn Act. Southern R. Co. v. Reid, 222 U. S. 424;
Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Hardwick Elevator Co., 226
U. S. 426. State regulation of the hours of railroad employees could not survive a Congressional policy as to
hours of service. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Washington,
222 U. S. 370. Explicitness by Congress relating to the
equipping of freight cars with safety appliances superseded a State law dealing differently with such safety requirements. Southern R. Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, 236
U. S. 439. When Congress saw fit to define in the Federal
Employers Liability Act a carrier's responsibility for the
death or injury of its employees, a State could not assert
a different basis of responsibility. N. Y. CentralR. Co. v.
Winfield, 244 U. S. 147. Uniform standards set by the
Interstate Commerce Commission for the equipment of
locomotives preclude different requirements for such
equipment by the States. Napier v. Aflantic Coast Line,

possessed by a federal agency does not displace State
regulation if no federal standards are set. See Welch Co.
v. New Hampshire,306 U. S. 79; Eichholz v. PublicService
Comm'n, 306 U. S. 268. That even in this technical field
a State is not denied the exercise of its police power beyond what is practically required by the actual use of
federal power, is illustrated by the limited application
given to Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Public Service Comm'n,
250 U. S. 566, in Terminal Assn. v. Trainmen, 318
U.S. 1.
These are illustrations of a closely knit body of regulations, full of technical implications, protected against
incursions from local discriminations as to the very subject matter for which Congress deemed a national rule
essential. There was, in short, concreteness of conflict between what a State prescribed and what Congress prescribed; the collision was demonstrable, not
argumentative.
Even where the enforcement of a State statute carries
international implications and thus deals with sensitive
concerns peculiarly within the direction of federal authority, this Court only recently was slow to strike down an
exercise of the State police power. When, in Hines v.
Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, the United States strongly
urged upon us that a Pennsylvania system of alien registration, establshed in 1939, had been superseded by
the Federal Alien Registration Act of 1940, we did not
displace the State law cavalierly, on the basis of loose
inference and dogmatic assertion, but examined with
painstaking care the particular requirements of Pennsylvania in order to ascertain whether, in their practical
operation, they ran counter to the scheme as conceived
by Congress and impinged upon its administration. A
detailed examination of the long course of federal legislation affecting' aliens, of which the Act of 1940 was the
latest in a series, led the Court to conclude that Congress

HILL v. FLORIDA.
538

FRANKFURTER,

J., dissenting.

had "provided a standard for alien registration in a single
integrated and all-embracing system .
through one
uniform national registration system" to which Pennsylvania had to subordinate its local policy. 312 U. S. 52, 74.
Even this conclusion evoked a weighty dissent, and one
cannot read the Court's opinion without an awareness
that the case presented a close question. Shortly after this
decision we unanimously made it clear that Hines v.
Davidowitz was not intended to relax the requirement of
practical and effective conflict between a State law and
a federal enactment before a State police measute can be
nullified, and that the international bearing ot the circumstances made persuasive the finding of conflict in that
case. What was said about Hines v. Davidowitz in AllenBradley Local v. Board, 315 U. S. 740, 749, is precisely
relevant here:
"In the Hines case, a federal system of alien registration
was held to supersede a state system of registration. But
there we were dealing with a problem which had an impact
on the general field of foreign relations. The delicacy of
the issues which were posed alone raised grave questions
as to the propriety of allowing a state system Of regulation to function alongside of a federal system. In that
field, any 'concurrent state power that may exist is restricted to the narrowest of limits.' p. 68. Therefore, we
were more ready to conclude that a federal Act in a field
that touched international relations superseded state regulation than we were in those cases where a State was exercising its historic powers over such traditionally local
matters as public 'Safety and order and the use of streets
and highways. Maurer v. Hamilton, [309 U. S. 598]
supra, and cases cited. Here, we are dealing with the
latter type of problem. We will not lightly infer that
Congress by the mere passage of a federal Act has impaired the traditional sovereignty of the several States in
that regard."

In truth, when a State statute is assailed because of alleged conflict with a federal law, the same considerations
of forbearance, the same regard for the lawmaking power
of States, should guide the judicial judgment as when this
Court is asked to declare a statute unconstitutional outright. The problem of conflict arises only when the States
have power concurrent with Congress to legislate; to find
conflict is merely a form of denying the power of legislation to the States. Except in rare instances, as already
indicated, this Court has been extremely cautious in upsetting State regulation unless it has found that the regulation devised by Congress and that by which the State
dealt wilh some local concern cannot, in a practical world,
coexist. Only then has the Court been justified in holding that Congress has manifested its will to displace the
constitutional authority of the State. To strike down a
State law when that which a State requires does not truly
hinder or obstruct federal regulation is unwarrantably
to deprive the States of their constitutional power.
These are the principles which have been recognized
and applied by the vast body of the decisions of this
Court, and they are the principles that should determine
the fate of the Florida legislation now here for judgment.
By legislation known as House Bill No. 142, Florida, in
1943, undertook to regulate labor unions and their officers.
Laws of Florida, 1943, Ch. 21968, p. 565. That Act prohibits any person from acting as a "business agent" for any
"labor organization" without having obtained a license.
§ 9 (6). In order to obtain such a license, for a fee of
one dollar, a person must file with the Secretary of State
an application under oath, accompanied by a statement
showing the applicant's authority to act as business agent,
vouched for by the president and secretary of the labor
organization. To permit the filing of objections to granting the license, the application must be held on file for
thirty days. Thereafter, the application, with all relevant

documents, goes to a Board composed of the Governor,
the Secretary of State and the Superintendent of Education. On finding the applicant qualified, the Board
must authorize the Secretary of State to issue a license for
the calendar year. A license may not be issued to any
person who has not been a citizen and resident of the
United States for at least ten years, or who has been
convicted of a felony, or who is not of good moral character. § 4. Another provision of the Act requires every
"labor organization operating in the State of Florida" to
file an annual report with the Secretary of State giving
the name of the organization, the location of its office,
the names and addresses of the president, secretary,
treasurer and business agent. A filing fee of one dollar
is required. § 6. A penal provision provides for fines
not exceeding $500, or six months imprisonment, or both,
for violatien of the Act by any person or labor organization. § 14.
The Attorney General of Florida sought and obtained
from a Florida Circuit Court an injunction forbidding the
petitioner, United Association of Journeymen Plumbers
and Steamfitters, Local No. :234, from functioning as a
labor union until it had complied with the requirements
of § 6, and forbidding petitioner Hill from acting as business agent for the Association until he had procured the
license required by § 4. The Supreme Court of Florida
affirmed the injunction. 19 So. 2d 857. This Court reverses the Florida decision by concluding that the National Labor Relations Act, familiarly known as the Wagner Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. § 151 et seq., debarred
Florida from dealing with the matters with which her
legislation dealt.
The Court reaches this conclusion rather summarily, as
though the conflict between the Wagner Act and the
Florida Act is too obvious for argument. Considering
the fact that this case involves what so often has been

characterized as the most delicate function of this Court,
-that of invalidating legislation, the issue cannot be disposed of so easily.
While employer-employee relations on railroads have
been the subject of Congressional legislation for more than
half a century, giving rise to a more and more comprehensive scheme of federal regulation, as to such relations
in industry generally Congress abstained from regulation
until 1935. Its first essay in this field was professedly
very limited in scope. Not content with setting forth
the central aim of the Wagner Act in the legislative
reports, Congress in the Act itself defined its purposes.
In view of the inequality between organized employers
and employees devoid of "full freedom of association or
actual liberty of contract," and of the "denial by employers of the right of employees to organize and the
refusal by employers to accept the procedure of collective
bargaining," it was "declared to be the policy of the
United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have
occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of
collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by
workers of full freedom of association, self-organization,
and designation of representatives of their own choosing,
for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions
of their employment or other mutual aid or protection."
§ 1. To that end § 8, the heart of the Act, enumerated
conduct by employers which the National Labor Relations Board was established to prevent. § 10. It is an
accurate summary of the Wagner Act to say that it aimed
to equalize bargaining power between industrial employees and their employers by putting federal law behind
the employees' right of association. The whole plan or
scheme of the Wagner Act was to enable employees to
bargain on a fair basis, freed from "restraint or coercion

by their employer" through the protection given by the
federal government. Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin,
301 U. S. 1, 33.
All proposals to make of the Wagner Act a more comprehensive industrial code, by dealing with the conduct
of employees and their unions, were rejected. The rights
Congress created, the obligations it defined, the machinery
it devised for enforcing these rights and securing obedience
to these obligations, all were exclusively concerned with
putting the strength of the Government against this conduct by employers. All other aspects of industrial relations were left untouched by the Wagner Act, and purposely so. All activities or aspects of labor organizations
outside of their right to be free from employer coercion
were left wholly unregulated by that Act. Neither expressly nor by indirection did the Wagner Act displace
whatever police power the States may have to deal with
those aspects of the life of a trade union as to which Congress, with eyes wide open, refused to legislate. When
Congress purposely dealt only with the employer aspect
of industrial relations and purposely abstained from
making any rules touching union activities, the internal
affairs of unions, or the responsibility of union officials to
union members and to the public, Congress certainly did
not sponge out the States' police power as to these matters. It wipes out State power and distorts Congressional
intention to disregard the limited policy explicitly set forth
by Congress. That policy-curbing of employer interferences with union rights--was scrupulously observed by
Congress in the substantive provisions as well as in the
enforcement structure of the Act. There is not a breath in
the Act referring to any aspect of union activity unrelated
to employer interference therewith. By refusing to legislate beyond that, Congress did not forbid the States
from so legislating.
If Congress tomorrow chose to subject labor organizations and their officers to regulations similar to those dealt

325 U. S

with in the Florida law, it could hardly be suggested that
the Wagner Act, as it now stands, already covers these
subjects. Specifically, if Congress were to make certain
requirements for the filing of reports by labor organizations that seek to avail themselves of the rights defined
by the Wagner Act, and also were to devise a system of
identification and licensing of authorized representatives
of the unions, one would be hard put to it to find anything
in the Wagner Act to prove that it had already dealt with
these matters. Congress may well believe that there is
such a difference in local circumstances as to make it
desirable to leave treatment of these matters to the different localities. In any event, since these subjects are outside of the Wagner Act for purposes of making additions
by federal law, they cannot be inside it to justify nullification of the Florida law. Whether the interests of union
members or of outsiders call for an identification and licensing system for men discharging the responsibilities of
business agents, it is not for us to determine. The only
issue before us is whether Florida is free to deal with these
matters when Congress has not done so. To repeat what
was said in Allen-Bradley Local v. Board, supra, "We
will not lightly infer that Congress by the mere passage of
a federal Act"-this very Act-"has impaired the teaditional sovereignty of the several States" over such police
matters as are the concern of the Florida legislation.
If the Wagner Act has left Florida free to deal with
these matters, Florida may not only legislate but also,
provide for enforcement of its legislation. In other words,
if Florida may call for reports and require business agents
to apply for licenses, of course Florida may provide appropriate sanctions for such regulations. If: a union may
properly be required to file a report and does not do so
and therefore is prohibited from pursuing its industrial
activities until it does file such a report, the State is not
interfering with whatever rights the union may have

under the Wagner Act. It will be time enough to consider
such a claim of conflict, if anything that Florida may exact
should, in a concrete situation, actively interfere with
appropriate action by the National Labor Relations
Board. In any event, we do not know the Teach of the
Florida Act. For all that appears the Supreme Court of
Florida may construe the Act's requirements to apply only
to intrastate activities of the union and its business
agents.
The judgment should be affirmed.
