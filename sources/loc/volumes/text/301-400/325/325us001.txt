SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 13.

Argued March 9, 1944. Reargued November 6, 1944.Decided April 23, 1945.

1. In a prosecution upon an indictment charging treason by adhering
to enemies of the United States, giving them .aid and comfort, in
violation of ยง 1 of the Criminal Code, tbe, overt act relied on, of
which the Constitution requires proof by two witnesses, must be
at least an act of the accused sufficient, in its setting, to sustain
a finding that the accused actually gave aid and comfort to the
enemy. P. 34.
2. The protection of the two-witness rule of the Constitution in such
case extends at least to all acts of the defendant which are used to
draw incriminating inferences that aid and comfort have been
given. P. 33.
3. In a prosecution upon an indictment charging treason by adhering
to enemies of the United States, giving them'aid and comfort, in
violation of ยง 1 of the Criminal Code, two of the overt acts alleged
and relied on were:
"1. Anthony Cramer, the defendant herein, on or about June 23,
1942, at the Southern District of New York and within the jurisdiction of this Court, did meet with Werner Thiel and Edward John

and Edward John Kerling for a period of time for the purpose of
giving and with intent to give aid and comfort to said enemies,
Werner Thiel and Edward John Kerling.
"2. Anthony Cramer, the defendant herein, on or about June 23,
1942, at the Southern District of New York and within the jurisdiction of this Court, did accompany, confer, treat, and counsel
with Werner Thiel, an enemy of the United States, for a period
of time at the Twin Oaks Inn at Lexington Avenue and 44th Street,
and at Thompson's Cafeteria on 42nd Street between Lexington
and Vanderbilt Avenues, both in the City and State of New York,
for the purpose of giving and with intent to give aid and comfort
to said enemy, Werner Thiel."
By direct testimony of two or more witnesses it was established
that Cramer met Thiel and Kerling on the occasions and at tIle
places charged; that they drank together; and that they engaged
long and earnestly in conversation. There was no proof by two
witnesses of what they said or in what language they conversed;
no showing that Cramer gave them any information whatever of
value to their mission or that he had any to give; no showing of
any effort at secrecy, they having met in public places; and no
evidence that Cramer furnished them shelter, sustenance or
supplies, or that he gave them encouragement or counsel, or even
paid for their drinks.
Held that overt acts 1 and 2 as proved were insufficient to support a finding that the accused had given aid and comfort to the
enemy, and therefore insufficient to support a judgment of conviction. Pp. 36-37, 48.

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Anthony Cramer, the petitioner, stands convicted of
violating Section 1 of the Criminal Code, which provides:
"Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies
war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them
aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere,
is guilty of treason." 1
Cramer owed allegiance to the United States. A German by birth, he had been a resident of the United States
since 1925 and was naturalized in 1936. Prosecution resulted from his association with two of the German saboteurs who in June 1942 landed on our shores from enemy
submarines to disrupt industry in the United States and
whose cases we considered in Ex parte Quirin,317 U. S. 1.
One of those, spared from execution, appeared as a government witness on the trial of Cramer. He testified that
Werner Thiel and Edward Kerling were members of that
sabotage crew, detailed their plot, and described their
preparations for its consummation.
Cramer was conscripted into and served in the German
Army against the United' States in 1918. After the war
he came to this country, intending to remain permanently.
So far as appears, he has been of good behavior, never
before in trouble with the law. He was studious and intelligent, earning $45 a week for work in a boiler room and
living accordingly.
There was no evidence, and the Government makes no
claim, that he had foreknowledge that the saboteurs were
coming to this country or that he came into association
with them by prearrangement. Cramer, however, had
known intimately the saboteur Werner Thiel while the
latter lived in this country. They had worked together,

roomed together, and jointly had ventured in a small and
luckless delicatessen enterprise. Thiel early and frankly
avowed adherence to the National Socialist movement in
Germany; he foresaw the war and returned in 1941 for
the purpose of helping Germany. Cramer did not do so.
How much he sympathized with the doctrines of the
Nazi Party is not clear. He became at one time, in Indiana, a member and officer of the Friends of New Germany, which was a predecessor of the Bund. However,
he withdrew in 1935 before it became the Bund. He says
there was some swindle about it that he did not like and
also that he did not like their drilling and "radical activities." In 1936 he made a trip to Germany, attended the
Olympic games, and saw some of the Bundsmen from
this country who went there at that time for conferences
with Nazi Party officials. There is no suggestion that
Cramer while there had any such associations. He does
not appear to have been regarded as a person of that consequence. His friends and associates in this country
were largely German. His social life in New York City,
where he recently had lived, seems to have been centered
around Kolping House, a German-Catholic recreational
center.
Cramer retained a strong affection for his fatherland.
He corresponded in German with his family and friends
there. Before the United States entered the war he expressed strong sympathy with Germany in its conflict with
other European powers. Before the attack upon Pearl
Harbor, Cramer openly opposed participation by this
country in the war against Germany. He refused to work
on war materials. He expressed concern about being
drafted into our army and "misused" for purposes of
"world conquest." There is no proof, however, except
for the matter charged in the indictment, of any act or
utterance disloyal t.o this country after we entered the
war.

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

Coming down to the time of the alleged treason, the
main facts, as related on the witness stand by Cramer,
are not seriously in dispute. He was living in New York;
and in response to a cryptic note left under his door,
which did not mention Thiel, he went to the Grand Central Station. There Thiel appeared. Cramer had supposed that Thiel was in Germany, knowing that he had
left the United States shortly before the war to go there.
Together they went to public places and had some drinks.
Cramer denies that Thiel revealed his mission of sabotage.
Cramer said to Thiel that he must have come to America
by submarine, but Thiel refused to confirm it, although
his attitude increased Cramer's suspicion. Thiel promised to tell later how he came to this country. Thiel asked
about a girl who was a mutual acquaintance and'whom
Thiel had engaged to marry previous to his going to
Germany. Cramer knew where she was, and offered to
and did write to her to come to New York, without disclosing in the letter that Thiel had arrived. Thiel said
that he had in his possession about $3,600, but did not
disclose that it was provided by the German Government,
saying only that one could get money in Germany if he
had the right connections. Thiel owed Cramer an old
debt of $200. He gave Cramer his money belt containing
some $3,600, from which Cramer was to be paid. Cramer
agreed to and did place the rest in his own safe-deposit
box, except a sum which he kept in his room in case Thiel
should want it quickly.
After the second of these meetings Thiel and Kerling,
who, was present briefly at one meeting, were arrested.
Cramer's expectation of meeting Thiel later and of bringing him and his fianc6e together was foiled. Shortly
thereafter Cramer was arrested, tried, and found guilty.
The trial judge at the time of sentencing said:
"I shall not impose the maximum penalty of death. It
does not appear that this defendant Cramer was aware

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

that Thiel arid Kerling were in possession of explosives
or other means for destroying factories and property in
the United States or planned to do that.
"From the evidence it appears that Cramer had no more
guilty knowledge of any subversive purposes on the part
of Thiel or Kerling than a vague idea that they came here
for the purpose of organizing pro-German propaganda
and agitation. If there were any proof that they had
confided in him what their real purposes were, or that
he knew or believed what they really were, I should not
hesitate to impose the death penalty."
Cramer's case raises questions as to application of the
constitutional provision that "Treason against the United
States shall consist only in levying War against them, or in
adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.
No person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the
Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on
Confession in open Court." 2
Cramer's contention may be well stated in words of
Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Robinson:3
"Nevertheless a question may indeed be raised whether
the prosecution may lay -as an overt act a step taken in
execution of the traitorous design, innocent in itself, and
getting its treasonable character only from some covert
and undeclared intent. It is true that in prosecutions
for conspiracy under our federal statute it is well settled
that any step in performance of the conspiracy is enough,
though it is innocent except for its relation to the agreement. I doubt very much whether that rule has any
application to the case of treason, where the requirement
affected the character of the pleading and proof, rather
than accorded a season of repentance before the crime
should be complete. Lord Reading in his charge in

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

Casement's Case uses language which accords with my
understanding:
"'Overt acts are such acts as manifest a criminal intention and tend towards the accomplishment of the criminal
object. They are acts by which the purpose is manifested
and the means by which it is intended to be fulfilled.' ""
The Government, however, contends for, and the court
below has affirmed, this conviction upon a contrary principle.' It said: "We believe in short that no more need
be laid for an overt act of treason than for an overt act of
conspiracy . .. Hence we hold the overt acts relied on
were sufficient to be submitted to the jury, even though
they perhaps may have appeared as innocent on their
face." A similar conclusion was reached in United States
v. Fricke;6 it is: "An overt act in itself may be a perfectly
innocent act standing by itself; it must be in some manner in furtherance of the crime."
As lower courts thus have taken conflicting positions,
or, where the issue was less clearly drawn, have dealt with
the problem ambiguously," we granted certiorari' and

reargument addressed to specific questions.9 Since our
primary question here is the meaning of the constitutional provision, we turn to its solution before considering
its application to the facts of this case.

When our forefathers took up the task of forming an
independent political organization for New World society,
no one of them appears to have doubted that to bring into
being a new government would originate a new allegiance
for its citizens and inhabitants. Nor were they reluctant
to punish as treason any genuine breach of allegiance, as
every government time out of mind had done. The betrayal of Washington by Arnold was fresh in mind. They
were far more awake to powerful enemies with designs on
this continent than some of the intervening generations
have been. England was entrenched in Canada to the
north and Spain had repossessed Florida to the south, and
each had been the scene of invasion of the Colonies; the
King of France had but lately been dispossessed in the
Ohio Valley; Spain claimed the Mississippi Valley; and,
except for the seaboard, the settlements were surrounded
by Indians-not negligible a- enemies themselves, and
especially threatening when allied to European foes. The
proposed national government could not for some years
become firmly seated in the tradition or in the habits of
8 May 22, 1944. Counsel for petitioner, although assigned by the
trial court, has responded with extended researches. The Solicitor
General engaged scholars not otherwise involved in conduct of the
case to collect and impartially to summarize statutes, decisions, and
texts from Roman, Continental, and Canon law as well as from English, Colonial, and American law sources. The part of the study dealing with American materials has been made available through publication in 58 Harv. L. Rev. 226 et seq. Counsel have lightened our
burden of, examination of the considerable accumulation of historical

the people. There is no evidence that the forefathers
intended to withdraw the treason offense from use as an
effective instrument of the new nation's security against
treachery that would aid external enemies.
The forefathers also had suffered from disloyalty. Success of the Revolution had been threatened by the adherence of a considerable part of the population to the king.
The Continental Congress adopted a resolution after a
report by its "Committee on Spies"
which in effect
declared that all persons residing within any colony owed
allegiance- to it, and that if any such persons adhered to
the King of Great Britain, giving him aid and comfort,
they were guilty of treason, and which urged the colonies
to pass laws for punishment of such offenders "as shall
be provably attainted of open deed.""
Many of the colonies complied, and a variety of laws, mostly modeled

on English law, resulted. 12 Some of the legislation in later
years became so broad and loose as to make treason of
states substantially adopted the recommendation of the
Congress: Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia.
(The Virginia law, though it did not copy in full the recommendation
of Congress, was drawn by Jefferson, among others, and hence probably can be regarded as originating in the same source as the others.)
Three states had basic treason statutes not patterned on the Congressional model, one antedating the latter: Connecticut, Maryland,
South Carolina. Georgia is not found to have enacted any general
treason statute, although it passed a number of separate acts of
attainder.
The Maryland act declared that "the several crimes aforesaid shall
receive the same constructions that have been given to such of the
said crimes as are enumerated in the statute of Edward the third, commonly called the statute of treasons." None of the statutes contained
negative language, limiting the definition of treason expressly to that
set forth in the statute. In general, too, they added to the definition
of the model recommended by Congress other specific kinds of treason. Thus a number defined treason as including conspiracy to levy
war. Conspiracy to adhere to the enemy and give aid and comfort
was also included in several, or incorporated by separate acts. Much
explicit attention was given to the problem of contact with the enemy.
Conveying of intelligence or carrying on of correspondence with the
enemy were expressly mentioned. One typical provision declared

guilty of treason those persons who were "adherent to . . .the enemies

any vessel belonging to this State or the United States to the Enemies of the United States of America"; and to persons who "have

and with an intent to obstruct the service dissuade others from enlisting, or maliciously spread false rumors concerning the forces of either
side such as to alienate the affections of the people from the Government "or to terrify or discourage the good Subjects of this State, or
to dispose them to favor the Pretensions of the Enemy," or who "shall
take a Commission or Commissions from the King of Great Britain,
or any under his Authority, or other the Enemies of this State, or the
United States of America."
A number of the statutes required "the testimony of two lawful and
credible witnesses." But the requirement was not linked to the
proof of overt acts, and there was no suggestion of the type of provision later embodied in the Constitution. Supplementary acts
creating special treasonable offenses tended to omit any requirement
as to quantum of proof.
See Hurst, op. cit. supra, 58 Harv. L. Rev. at 248 et seq.
isFor example, the New York Act of March 30, 1781, after reciting
that it was necessary to make further provision respecting treason
in order to prevent adherence to the king, made it a felony to declare
or maintain "that the King of Great Britain hath, or of Right ought
to have, any Authority, or Dominion, in or over this State, or the
Inhabitants thereof," or to persuade or attempt to persuade any
inhabitant to renounce allegiance to the State or acknowledge allegiance
to the king, or to affirm one's own allegiance to the king. A person convicted was to "suffer the Pains and Penalties prescribed by Law in Cases
.of Felony without Benefit of Clergy," except that the court might,
instead of prescribing death, sentence to three years' service on an
American warship. Laws of the State of New-York (Poughkeepsie,
1782) 4th Sess., Ch. XLVIII. Virginia imposed a fine not exceeding ยฃ20,000, and imprisonment up to five years "if any person residing or being within this commonwealth shall . . .by any word,

colonial law which made him guilty of treason if he adhered to his king.1' Not a few of these persons were
subjected to confiscation of property or other harsh
treatment by the Revolutionists under local laws; none,
however, so far as appears, to capital punishment. 5
'Before this revolutionary experience there were scattered treason prosecutions in the colonies," usually not
well reported. Some colonies had adopted treason statutes modeled on English legislation." But the earlier
colonial experience seems to have been regarded as of
A similar situation prevailed during the Civil War, when treason
prosecutions were instituted against citizens of some southern states
for treason to the state, consisting of adherence to the United States.

226, 268-71. Although these acts, dealing with withdrawal to enemy
territory, imposed in general only forfeiture and banishment, some
did reinforce these penalties with the threat of death if the person
should later be found within the state. Id., 272.
The only pre-Revolutionary treason trial of which there is an
extensive record is King v. Bayard (1702), a New York prosecution
under an Act of May 6, 1691, which made it treason "by force of
arms or otherwise to disturb the peace good and quiet of this their
Majestyes Government as it is now Established." (The act was
thought by the home authorities to be objectionably broad and
vague and was later repealed.) See The Trial of Nicholas Bayard,
14 Howell's State Trials 471; 10 Lawson, American State Trials,
518; Hurst, op. cit. supra, 58 Harv. L. Rev. at 233. For other material on colonial treason prosecutions, see Hurst, op. cit. supra, 58

17In the early part of the colonial period, charters and grants gave
royal governors authority to use martial law for suppression of
"rebellion," "sedition," and "mutiny," and references to treason were
not in the traditional language. A provision of the General Laws
of New Plimouth Colony, 1671, is representative:

However, their experience with treason accusations had
been many-sided. More than a few of them were descendthe State and Common-wealth of England, shall be punished by

of the Fundamental Frame and Constitutions of this Government;
every such Person shall be put to Death."
But the bulk of colonial legislation prior to the Revolution drew
extensively on English law, especially the statute 25 Edward III.
Some of the acts substantially adopted the language of the latter
statute, with additions, and some simply declared that the offense of
treason should follow the English law. With the exception of Georgia
and New Jersey, all the colonies eventually adopted one or the other
type statute. In addition, the English law of treason itself applied,
to an undefined extent, and several colonial acts were disallowed on
the theory that they covered ground already occupied by the mother
country's legislation. The colonies which enacted their own statutes
patterned after -25 Edward III did not narrow its terms. Several
expressly included the treason of compassing the death of the king,
and a couple even made an analogous offense of compassing the death
of the proprietor. The offense of levying war against the king was
given a broad definition; some of the colonies expressly included
various forms of "constructive" levying of war which had been put
into the English statute by judicial construction, in general extending
the crime to domestic disturbances; and some of the statutes made
conspiracy to levy war sufficient to constitute the crime of levying
war. Some specific attention was given in separate legislation at
various times to contact with the enemy, legislation comparable to
that subsequently enacted during the Revolutionary period.
Most of the colonial treason acts contained two-witness requirements, without the additional qualification later adopted in the Constitution, that they must be witnesses to the same overt act, although it was
required that they be witnesses to the same general kind of treason.

ants of those who had fled from measures against sedition
and its ecclesiastic counterpart, heresy. Now the treason
offense was under revision by a Convention whose members almost to a man had themselves been guilty of treason under any interpretation of British law.18 They not
only had levied war against their king themselves, but
they had conducted a lively exchange of aid and comfort
with France, then England's ancient enemy. Every step
in the great work of their lives from the first mild protests
against kingly misrule to the final act of separation had
been taken under the threat of treason charges.1 " The

that had been perpetrated under the pretense of justice; for the most
part they had been traitors themselves, and having risked their necks

of the Declaration of Independence that if the signers did not hang
together they should hang separately. It was also the meaning of the

in the Virginia House of Burgesses evoking the famous reply "If this

21The men who were responsible for framing our Constitution were
influenced by eighteenth century liberal thought from both French and
English sources. French influences, more philosophical than legal in
character, were particularly strong with Franklin, who took a significant part in framing the treason clause. Franklin had been a member
of the French Academy of Sciences since 1772 and had many friends
among French intellectuals. He spent much time in England and in
France, to which he was sent by the Continental Congress as Commissioner in 1776. He remained until 1783, when he signed the Treaty
of Peace with England, and thereafter until 1785 as Minister to France.
Becker, Franklin, 6 Dictionary of American Biography 585; 9 Encyclopedia Britannica (14th ed.) 693. Jefferson, a strong influence with
the men of that period, was sent to France by the Continental Congress to assist Franklin, remaining there from 1784 to 1789, succeeding Franklin in 1785 as Minister. Jefferson was so closely in touch
with French revolutionary thought that in July 1789 he was invited
to assist in the deliberations of the Committee of the French National
Assembly to draft a Constitution, but declined out of respect for his
position. See Malone, Jefferson, 10 Dictionary of American Biography

Chinard, Thomas Jefferson, The Apostle of Americanism. Best known
in America of the French writings was Montesquieu's L'Esprit des
Lois, which appeared in French in 1748. (An English edition was
published in London in 1750.) Book 12 thereof was devoted to his
philosophical reactions to the abuses of treason. It is hardly a coincidence that the treason clause of the Constitution embodies every one
of the precepts suggested by Montesquieu in discussing the excesses
of ancient and European history.
Some of his precepts were: "If the crime of high treason be indeterminate, this alone is sufficient to make the government degenerate

cerning treasons began to flow in fairly definable channels
in 1351 with the enactment of the great Treason Act, 25
Edw. III, Stat. 5, Ch. 2.2 That was a monumental piece
into arbitrary power." (Book 12, Ch. 7, Of the Crime of High
Treason.) "The laws do not take upon them to punish any other
than overt acts." (Book 12, Ch. 11, Of Thoughts.) "Nothing renders the crime of high treason more arbitrary than declaring people
guilty of it for indiscreet speeches . ...
Words do not constitute
an overt act; they remain only in idea. ...
Overt acts do not happen
every day; they are exposed to the eye of the public; and a false
charge with regard to matters of fact may be easily detected. Words
carried into action assume the nature of that action. Thus a man
who goes into a public market-place to incite the subject to revolt,
incurs the guilt of high treason, because the words are joined to the
action, and partake of its nature. It is not the words that are punished but an action in which the words are employed." (Book 12,
Ch. 12, Of indiscreet Speeches.) "Those laws which condemn a man
to death on the deposition of a single witness, are fatal to liberty."
(Book 12, Ch. 3, Of The Liberty of the Subject.)
Both French and English influences on American thought as shown
by Jefferson's writings are traced by Perry, Puritanism and Democracy

whereas divers opinions have been before this time in what oase treason

the death of our lord the King, or of our lady his queen or of their
eldest son and heir; or if a man do violate the King's companion, or
the King's eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife the King's eldest

of legislation several times referred to in the deliberations
of the Convention. It cut a bench-mark by which the
English-speaking world tested the level of its thought on
the subject 23 until our own abrupt departure from it in
all other justices assigned to hear and determine, beifag in their places,
doing their offices: and it is to be understood, that in the cases above
rehearsed, that ought to be judged treason which extends to our lord
the King, and his royal majesty: And of such treason the forfeiture
of the escheats pertaineth to our sovereign lord, as well as of the lands
and tenements holden of other, as of himself: And moreover there is
another manner of treason, that is to say, when a servant slayeth his
master, or a wife her husband, or when a man secular or religious
slayeth his prelate, to whom he oweth faith and obedience; and of such
treason the escheats ought to pertain to every lord of his own fee.
And because that many other like cases of treason may happen in
time to come, which a man cannot think or declare at this present
time; it is accorded, that if any other case, supposed treason, which
is not above specified, doth happen before any justices, the justices
shall tarry without any going to judgement of the treason, till the cause
be shewed and declared before the King and his Parliament, whether
it ought to be judged treason or other felony. And if percase any
man of this realm ride armed covertly or secretly with men of arms
against any other, to slay him, or rob him, or take him, or retain him
till he hath made fine or ransom for to have his deliverance, it is not
the mind of the King nor his council, that in such case it shall be
judged treason but shall be judged felony or trespass, according to
the laws of the land of old time used, and according as the case
requireth." 4 Halsbury's Statutes of England 273.
23 Stephen said of it: "In quiet times it is seldom put in force,
and
if by any accident it is necessary to apply it, the necessity for doing
so is obvious. For revolutionary periods it is obviously and always
insufficient, and at such times it is usually supplemented by enactments which ought to be regarded in the light of war measures, but
which are usually represented by those against whom they are directed
as monstrous invasions of liberty. The struggle being over, the
statute of 25 Edw. 3 is reinstated as the sole definition of treason,
and in this way it has become the subject of a sort of superstitious
reverence." 2 Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England

1789, and after 600 years it still is the living law of treason
in England. Roger Casement in 1917 forfeited his life
for violating it.4 We, of course, can make no independent

judgment as to the inward meanings of the terms used in
a six-century-old statute, written in a form of Norman
French that had become obsolete long before our Revolution. We can read this statute only as our forebears
read it-through the eyes of succeeding generations of
English judges, to whom it has been the core of all decision, and of common-law

the fourth and queen Mary, and particularly in the bloody reign of
Henry the eighth, the spirit of inventing new and strange treasons
was revived; among which we may reckon the offences of clipping
money; breaking prison or rescue, when the prisoner is committed for
treason; burning houses to extort money; stealing cattle by Welshmen; counterfeiting foreign coin; wilful poisoning; execrations
against the king; calling him opprobrious names by public writing;
counterfeiting the sign manual or signet; refusing to abjure the pope;
deflowering, or marrying without the royal licence, any of the king's
children, sisters, aunts, nephews, or nieces; bare solicitation of the
chastity of the queen or princess, or advances made by themselves;
marrying with the king, by a woman not a virgin, without previously
discovering to him such her unchaste life; judging or believing (manifested by any overt act) the king to have been lawfully married to
Anne of Cleve; derogating from the king's royal stile and title; impugning his supremacy; and assembling riotously to the number of
twelve, and not dispersing upon proclamation..." 4 Blackston'

15 Chief among these were Coke and Blackstone. Coke emphasized the salutary effects of the Statute of Edward III in limiting
treason prosecution and strongly emphasized the overt-act requirement, probably quoting Bracton. Institutes of the' Laws of England,
5th Ed. (1671) Part III, 14. He used as examples overt acts which of
themselves appear to evidence treasonable intent. Id., 2, 3, and 14.
See 1 Hale, History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736) 86, 259. But we
cannot be sure whether this was intended to imply that acts from

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

Adjudicated cases in English history generally hag e
dealt with the offense of compassing the monarch's death;
which intent would be less evident would suffice. Other authors
known on this side of the water leave us with little light on our
particular problem.
Hale (History of the Pleas of the Crown, Emlyn ed. London, 1736)
frequently uses terminology, found in Coke and earlier writers, which
might mean that the function of an overt act is to prove intent, saying that the overt act is to "manifest" or "declare" the compassing
of the king's death, and so forth. Id., 109. But, as in the other writers,
the statements are usually open as well to the interpretation that
the act must show translation of thought into action. In the latter
sense, the act "declares" intent in that it shows, in the light of other
evidence, that the defendant's thoughts were not mere idle desires.
This is a different thing from saying that the overt act must of itself
display an unambiguously traitorous character. Elsewhere Hale
gives some support to the view that the act may itself be of an innocent
character. Dealing with the principle that words alone cannot be an
overt act, he says that "words may expound an overt-act to make
good an indictment of treason of compassing the king's death, which
overt-act possibly of itself may be indifferent and unapplicable to such
an intent; and therefore in the indictment of treason they may be joined
with such an overt-act, to make the same applicable and expositive of
such a compassing." Id., 115. He also declares that the mere meeting of persons with the intent of plotting the king's death is a sufficient overt-act for the treason of compassing the king's death. Id.,
108, 109. These remarks, however, deal only with compassing the
king's death, and little light is given as to the overt act in connection
with levying war and adhering to the enemy. With Coke, Hale takes
the position that a mere meeting of persons to conspire, though sufficient under the compassing clause, is not sufficient for the levying-ofwar clause. Id., 130.
Foster's view of the overt act does not seem materially different
from Hale's. (A Report of Some Proceedings on the Commission for
the Trial of the Rebels in the Year 1746 in the County of Surry; and
of other Crown Cases, 2d ed. 1791.) "Overt acts undoubtedly do discover the man's intentions; but, I conceive, they are not to be considered merely as evidence, but as the means made use of to eflectuate
the purposes of the heart . . .though in the case of the King overtacts of less malignity, and having a more remote tendency to his destruction, are, with great propriety, deemed treasonable; yet still

only eleven reported English cases antedating the Constitution are cited as involving distinct charges of adherence to the king's enemies." When constructive treasons
were not joined on the face of the indictment, it is not
possible to say how far they were joined in the minds of
the judges. No decision appears to have been a factor
in the deliberations of our own Constitutional Convention. Nor does any squarely meet our issue here, and for
good reason-the Act of Edward III did not contain the
two-witnesses-to-the-same-overt-act requirement which
precipitates the issue here.
Historical materials are, therefore, of little help; necessity as well as desire taught a concept that differed from
all historical models in the drafting of our treason clause.
Treason statutes theretofore had been adapted to a society
in which the state was personified by a king, on whose
person were focused the allegiances and loyalties of the
subject. When government was made representative of
the whole body of the governed, there was none to say "I
they are considered as means to affectuate [sic], not barely as evidence
of the treasonable purpose." Foster also repeats the assertion that
the mere meeting of persons with intent to plan the king's death is a
sufficient overt act. Id., 195. However, his discussion, too, is confined
to the treason of compassing, and he says little that is helpful about
levying war and adhering.

am the State" and a concept of treason as compassing or
imagining a ruler's death was no longer fitting. Nor can
it be gainsaid that the revolutionary doctrine that the
people have the right to alter or abolish their government
relaxed the loyalty which governments theretofore had
demanded-dangerously diluted it, as the rulifrg classes of
Europe thought, for in their eyes the colonists not only
committed treason, they exalted it. 2'

The idea that

loyalty will ultimately be given to a government only so
long as it deserves loyalty and that opposition to its abuses
is not treason " has made our government tolerant of
opposition based on differences of opinion that in some
parts of the world would have kept the hangman busy.
But the basic law of treason in this country was framed
by men who, as we have seen, were taught by experience
and by history to fear abuse of the treason charge almost
as much as they feared treason itself. The interplay in
27 Philip Guedalla characterizes the figures of the American Revolution as they occur in British legend: "There they are oddly shrunken;
they dwindle into a provincial pettiness; and their voices monotonously intone the dreary formule of sedition." Fathers of the Revolution, p. 8.
28 Mr. Jefferson had referred to the Statute of Edward III as "done
to take out of the hands of tyrannical Kings, and of weak and wicked
Ministers,' that deadly weapon, which constructive treason had furnished them with, and which had drawn the blood of the best and
honestest men in the kingdom." 1 Writings of Thomas Jefferson
(Library ed. 1903) 215.

Later, as Secretary of State, he wrote: "Treason

. . .

when real,

merits the highest punishment. But most codes extend their definitions
of treason to acts not really against one's country. They do not distinguish between acts against the government, and acts against the
oppressions of the government; the latter are virtues; yet they

have furnished more victims to the executioner than the former;
because real treasons are rare; oppressions frequent. The unsuccessful
strugglers against tyranny, have been the chief martyrs of treason
laws in all countries." 8 Jefferson's Writings 332. Compare 7th

the Convention of their two fears accounts for the problem
which faces us today.
II
We turn then to the proceedings of the Constitutional
Convention of 1787 so far as we have record of them. The
plan presented by Pinckney evidently proposed only that
Congress should have exclusive power to declare what
should be treason and misprision of treason against the
United States." The Committee on Detail, apparently
not specifically instructed on the subject, reported a draft
Constitution which left no such latitude to create new
treasons. It provided that: "Treason against the United
States shall consist only in levying war against the United
States, or any of them; and in adhering to the enemies
of the United States, or any of them. The Legislature of
the United States shall have power to declare the punishment of treason. No person shall be convicted of treason,
unless on the testimony of two witnesses. No attainder
of treason shall work corruption of bloods, nor forfeiture,
except during the life of the person attainted." 0
This clause was discussed on August 20, 1787. Mr.
Madison, who opened the discussion, "thought the definition too narrow. It did not appear to go as far as the Stat.
of Edwd. III. He did not see why more latitude might not
be left to the Legislature. It wd. be as safe in the hands
of State legislatures; and it was inconvenient to bar a
discretion which experience might enlighten, and which
might be applied to good purposes as well as be abused." 3
Mr. Mason was in favor of following the language of the
Statute of Edward III. The discussion shows some confusion as to the effect of adding the words "giving them
aid and comfort," some thinking their effect restrictive

and others that they gave a more extensive meaning.
However, "Col. Mason moved to insert the words 'giving
(them) aid comfort' as restrictive of 'adhering to their
Enemies, &c'-the latter he thought would be otherwise
too indefinite." The motion prevailed.
Mr. Dickenson "wished to know what was meant by the
'testimony of two witnesses', whether they were to be
witnesses to the same overt act or to different overt acts.
He thought also that proof of an overt act ought to be expressed as essential to the case." Doctor Johnson also
"considered . . . that something should be inserted in the
definition concerning overt acts."
When it was moved to insert "to the same overt act"
after the two-witnesses requirement, Madison notes that
"Doc'r Franklin wished this amendment to take placeprosecutions for treason were generally virulent; and perjury too easily made use of against innocence." James
Wilson observed that "Much may be said on both sides.
Treason may sometimes be practiced in such a manner,
as to render proof extremely difficult-as in a traitorous
correspondence with an Enemy." 82 But the motion
carried.
By this sequence of proposals the treason clause of the
Constitution took its present form. ' The temper and attitude of the Convention toward treason prosecutions is unmistakable. It adopted every limitation that the practice
of governments had evolved or that politico-legal philos32 James Wilson was not unlikely one of the authors of the treason
clause, as a member of the Committee on Detail. He had participated
in the Pennsylvania treason trials in 1778 as one of the defense counsel
(Respublica v. Malin, 1 Dall. 33 (Pa. 0. & T.), Respublica v. Carlisle,
id. 35, Respublica v. Roberts, id. 39). In the Pennsylvania ratifyin,
convention he made detailed statements in praise of the clause without
its having been challenged. 2 Elliott, Debates, 469, 487. Later, he devoted a lecture to the clause in his law course delivered at the College
of Philadelphia in 1790 and .1791. 3 Works of Hon. James Wilson

ophy to that time had advanced. 3 Limitation of the
treason of adherence to the enemy to cases where aid and
comfort were given and the requirement of an overt act
were both found in the Statute of Edward III, praised in
the writings of Coke and Blackstone, and advocated in
Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws. Likewise, the two-witness
requirement had been used in other statutes, was advocated by Montesquieu in all capital cases,3 and was a
familiar precept of the New Testament " and of Mosaic
law. 3' The framers combined all of these known protections and added two of their own which had no precedent.
They wrote into the organic act of the new government
a prohibition of legislative or judicial creation of new treasons. And a venerable safeguard against false testimony
was given a novel application by requiring two witnesses
to the same overt act.
Distrust of treason prosecutions was not just a transient
mood of the Revolutionists. In the century and a half of
our national existence not one execution on a federal treason conviction has taken place. Never before has this
Court had occasion to review a conviction. In the few
cases that have been prosecuted the treason clause has
had its only judicial construction by individual Justices

Historical materials aid interpretation chiefly in that
they show two kinds of dangers against which the framers
were concerned to guard the treason offense: (1) perversion by established authority to repress peaceful political
opposition; and (2) conviction of the innocent as a result
of perjury, passion, or inadequate evidence. The first
danger could be diminished by closely circumscribing the
kind of conduct which should be treason-making the constitutional definition exclusive, making it clear, and
making the offense one not susceptible of being inferred
from all sorts of insubordinations. The second danger lay
in the manner of trial and was one which would be dimindown and annihilated. Some loyalists who returned were harshly
treated-others came back and settled down peacefully as citizens
of the new state. There was neither blood bath nor purge. There
was bitter political dispute-but no small group of men plotted in
secret to overthrow the government by force of arms. There were
a couple of minor and local revolts, based on genuine grievancesShays' Rebellion in 1786-the Whisky Rebellion in 1794. Both collapsed when the government showed itself able to put down rebellionand nobody was hanged for either of them. Shays and his temporary
rebels received a general amnesty-the leaders of the Whisky Rebellion were convicted of treason and then pardoned by the President." Benet, America, pp. 49-50.
Speaking of the War Between the States he says:
"Again, there was no blood purge. There were no mass executions.
No heads rolled.
"The handful of fanatics who had plotted the assassination of Lincoin and other government leaders were executed. His actual murderer was tracked down and shot. The half-crazy officer who commanded a notorious southern prison camp was hanged. The former
President of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, was kept for a while
in prison with certain of his associates and then released. But that
was all.
"Not one of the great southern generals or statesmen, Lee, Johnson, Stephens, Hampton, Longstreet-was even tried for treason."

ished mainly by procedural requirements-mainly but not
wholly, for the hazards of trial also would be diminished
by confining the treason offense to kinds of conduct susceptible of reasonably sure proof. The concern uppermost in the framers' minds, that mere mental attitudes or
expressions should not be treason, influenced both definition of the crime and procedure for its trial. In the proposed Constitution the first sentence of the treason article
undertook to define the offense; the second, to surround
its trial with procedural safeguards.
"Compassing" and like loose concepts of the substance
of the offense had been useful tools for tyranny. So one
of the obvious things to be put into the definition of treason not consisting of actual levying of war was that it
must consist of doing something. This the draft Constitution failed to provide, for, as we have pointed out,
ยฐ as merely "adhering to the enemies
it defined treason "
of the United States, or any of them."
Treason of adherence to an enemy was old in the law.
It consisted of breaking allegiance to one's own king by
forming an attachment to his enemy. Its scope was comprehensive, its requirements indeterminate. It might be
predicated on intellectual or emotional sympathy with the
foe, or merely lack of zeal in the cause of one's own country. That was not the kind of disloyalty the framers
thought should constitute treason. They promptly accepted the proposal to restrict it to cases where also there
was conduct which was "giving them aid and comfort."
"Aid and comfort" was defined by Lord Reading in the
Casement trial comprehensively, as it should be, and yet
probably with as much precision as the nature of the matter will permit: ". . . an act which strengthens or tends
to strengthen the enemies of the King in the conduct of a

case and is not involved inthe controversy.

war against the King, that is in law the giving of aid
and comfort" and "an act which weakens or tends to
weaken the power of the King and of the country to resist
or to attack the enemies of the King and the country . . .
is . . . giving of aid and comfort." Lord Reading explained it, as we think one must, in terms of an "act."
It is not easy, if indeed possible, to think of a way in
which "aid and comfort" can be "given" to an enemy
except by some kind of action. Its very nature partakes
of a deed or physical activity as opposed to a mental
operation.
Thus the crime of treason consists of two elements: adherence to the enemy; and rendering him aid and comfort.
A citizen intellectually or emotionally may favor the
enemy and harbor sympathies or convictions disloyal to
this country's policy or interest, but so long as he commits
no act of aid and comfort to the enemy, there is no treason.
On the other hand, a citizen may take actions which do
aid and comfort the enemy-making a speech critical of
the government or opposing its measures, profiteering,
striking in defense plants or essential work, and the hundred other things which impair our cohesion and diminish
our strength-but if there is no adherence to the enemy in
this, if there is no intent to betray, there is no treason.
Having thus by definition made treason consist of something outward and visible and capable of direct proof, the
framers turned to safeguarding procedures of trial and
ordained that "No Person shall be convicted of Treason
unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same
overt Act, or on Confession in open Court." This repeats
in procedural terms the concept that thoughts and attitudes alone cannot make a treason. It need not trouble
us that we find so dominant a purpose emphasized in two
different ways. But does the procedural requirement add
some limitation not already present in the definition of
the crime, and if so, what?

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.

While to prove giving of aid and comfort would require
the prosecution to show actions and deeds, if the Constitution stopped there, such acts could be inferred from circumstantial evidence. This the framers thought would
not do.4 ' So they added what in effect is a command that
the overt acts must be established by direct evidence, and
the direct testimony must be that of two witnesses instead
of one. In this sense the overt act procedural provision adds something, and something important, to the
definition.
Our problem begins where the Constitution ends. That
instrument omits to specify what relation the indispensable overt act must sustain to the two elements of the
offense as defined: viz., adherence and giving aid and comfort. It requires that two witnesses testify to the same
overt act, and clearly enough the act must show something toward treason, but what? Must the act be one of
giving aid and comfort? If so, how must adherence to
the enemy, the disloyal state of mind, be shown?
The defendant especially challenges the sufficiency of
"1Hallam in his Constitutional History of England (1827) said:
"Nothing had brought so much disgrace on the councils of government, and on the administration of justice, nothing more forcibly
spoken the necessity of a great change, than the prosecutions for
treason during the latter years of Charles II, and in truth during the
whole course of our legal history. The statutes of Edward III and
Edward VI, almost set aside by sophistical constructions, required
the corroboration of some more explicit law; and some peculiar securities were demanded for innocence against that conspiracy of the court
with the prosecutor, which is so much to be dreaded in all trials for
political crimes." v. 2, p. 509.
Continuing, after comment on partioular cases, he said: "In the vast
mass of circumstantial testimony which our modern trials for high
treason display, it is sometimes difficult to discern, whether the great
principle of our law, requiring two witnesses to overt acts, has been
adhered to; for certainly it is not adhered to, unless such witnesses
depose to acts of the prisoner, from which an inference of his guilt is
immediately deducible." v. 2, p. 516.

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

the overt acts to prove treasonable intention. Questions
of intent in a treason case are even more complicated
than in most criminal cases because of the peculiarity of
the two different elements which together make the offense. Of course the overt acts of aid and comfort must
be intentional as distinguished from merely negligent or
undesigned ones. Intent in that limited sense is not in
issue here. But to make treason the defendant not only
must intend the act, but he must intend to betray his
country by means of the act. It is here that Cramer defends.. The issue is joined between conflicting theories
as to how this treacherous intention and treasonable purpose must be made to appear.
Bearing in mind that the constitutional requirement in
effect is one of direct rather than circumstantial evidence,
we must give it a reasonable effect in the light of its purpose both to preserve the offense and to protect citizens
from its abuse. What is designed in the mind of an accused never is susceptible of proof by direct testimony.
If we were to hold that the disloyal and treacherous intention must be proved by the direct testimony of two witnesses, it would be to hold that it is never provable. It
seems obvious that adherence to the enemy, in the sense
of a disloyal state of mind, cannot be, and is not required
to be, proved by deposition of two witnesses.
Since intent must be inferred from conduct of some
sort, we think it is permissible to draw usual reasonable
inferences as to intent from the overt acts. The law of
treason, like the law of lesser crimes, assumes every man
to intend the natural consequences which one standing in
his circumstances and possessing his knowledge would
reasonably expect to result from his acts. Proof that a
citizen did give aid and comfort to an enemy may well be
in the circumstances sufficient evidence that he adhered
to that enemy and intended and purposed to strike at his

own country. 2 It may be doubted whether it would be
what the founders intended, or whether it would well serve
any of the ends they cherished, to hold the treason offense
available to punish only those who make their treacherous
intentions more evident than may be done by rendering
aid and comfort to an enemy. Treason-insidious and
dangerous treason-is the work of the shrewd and crafty
more often than of the simple and impulsive.
While of course it must be proved that the accused
acted 'with an intention and purpose to betray or there is
no treason, we think that in some circumstances at least
the overt act itself will be evidence of the treasonable
purpose and intent. But that still leaves us with exceedingly difficult problems. How decisively must treacherous intention be made manifest in the act itself? Will
a scintilla of evidence of traitorous intent suffice? Or must
it be sufficient to convince beyond reasonable doubt? Or
need it show only that treasonable intent was more probable than not? Must the overt act be appraised for legal
sufficiency only as supported by the testimony of two witnesses, or may other evidence be thrown into the scales
to create inferences not otherwise reasonably to be drawn
or to reinforce those which might be drawn from the act
itself?
It is only overt acts by the accused which the Constitution explicitly requires to be proved by the testimony of
two witnesses. It does not make other common-law evidence inadmissible nor deny its inherent powers of persuasion. It does not forbid judging by the usual process by
which the significance of conduct often will be determined
by facts which are not acts. Actions of the accused are set
There are, of course, rare cases where adherence might be proved
by an overt act such as subscribing an oath of allegiance or accepting
pay from an enemy. These might supplement proof of other acts of
aid and comfort, but no such overt acts of adherence are involved in
this case.

in time and place in many relationships. Environment
illuminates the meaning of acts, as context does'that of
words. What a man is up to may be clear from considering his bare acts by themselves; often it is made clear
when we know the reciprocity and sequence of his acts
with those of others, the interchange between him and
another, the give and take of the situation.
It would be no contribution to certainty of judgment,
which is the object of the provision, to construe it to
deprive a trial court of the aid of testimony under the
ordinary sanctions of verity, provided, of course, resort
is not had to evidence of less than the constitutional standard to supply deficiencies in the constitutional measure of
proof of overt acts. For it must be remembered that the
constitutional provision establishes a minimum of proof
of incriminating acts, without which there can be no conviction, but it is not otherwise a limitation on the evidence
with which a jury may be persuaded that it ought to convict. The Constitution does not exclude or set up standards to test evidence which will show the relevant acts of
persons other than the accused or their identity or enemy
character or other surrounding circumstances. Nor does
it preclude any proper evidence of non-incriminating facts
about a defendant, such for example as his nationality,
naturalization, and residence.
From duly proven overt acts of aid and comfort to the
enemy in their setting, it may well be that the natural and
reasonable inference of intention to betray will be warranted. The two-witness evidence of the acts accused, together with common-law evidence of acts of others and of
facts which are not acts, will 'help to determine which
among possible inferences as to the actor's knowledge,
motivation, or intent are the true ones. But the protection of the two-witness rule extends at least to all acts of
the defendant which are used to draw incriminating inferences that aid and comfort have been given.

34

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

The controversy before us has been waged in terms of
intentions, but this, we think, is the reflection of a more
fundamental issue as to what is the real function of the
overt act in convicting of treason. The prisoner's contention that it alone and on its face must manifest a traitorous
intention, apart from an intention to do the act itself,
would place on the overt act the whole burden of establishing a complete treason. On the other hand, the Government's contention that it may prove by two witnesses
an apparently commonplace and insignificant act and
from other circumstances create an inference that the act
was a step in treason and was done with treasonable intent
really is a contention that the function of the overt act in a
treason prosecution is almost zero. It is obvious that the
function we ascribe to the overt act is significant chiefly
because it measures the two-witness rule protection to
the accused and its handicap to the prosecution. If the
overt act or acts must go all the way to make out the complete treason, the defendant is protected at all points by
the two-witness requirement. If the act may be an insignificant one, then the constitutional safeguards are
shrunken so as to be applicable only at a point where they
are least needed.
The very minimum function that an overt act 48 must
perform in a treason prosecution is that it show sufficient
action by the accused, in its setting, to sustain a finding
that the accused actually gave" aid and comfort to the
enemy. Every act, movement, deed, and word of the defendant charged to constitute treason must be supported
,s Of course, the Constitution does not require a treason to be
proved by any single overt act. It may be grounded upon any
number, each to be supported by the testimony of two witnesses. We
speak in the singular but what we say applies as well to a series of
acts or to the sum of many acts.
"We are not concerned here with any question as to whether there
may be an offense of attempted treason.

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

by the testimony of two witnesses. The two-witness principle is to interdict imputation of incriminatingacts to the
accused by circumstantial evidence or by the testimony of
a single witness. The prosecution cannot rely on evidence
which does not meet the constitutional test for overt acts
to create any inference that the accused did other acts or
did something more than was shown in the overt act, in
order to make a giving of aid and comfort to the enemy.
The words of the Constitution were chosen, not to make
it hard to prove merely routine and everyday acts, but to
make the proof of acts that convict of treason as sure as
trial processes may. When the prosecution's case is thus
established, the Constitution does not prevent presentation of corroborative or cumulative evidence of any admissible character either to strengthen a direct case or to
rebut the testimony or inferences on behalf of defendant.
The Government is not prevented from making a strong
case; it is denied a conviction on a weak one.
It may be that in some cases the overt acts, sufficient to
prove giving of aid and comfort, will fall short of showing
intent to betray and that questions will then be raised as
to permissible methods of proof that we do not reach in
this case. But in this and some cases we have cited where
the sufficiency of the overt acts has been challenged because they were colorless as to intent, we are persuaded
the reason intent was left in question was that the acts
were really indecisive as a giving of aid and comfort.
When we deal with acts that are trivial and commonplace
and hence are doubtful as to whether they gave aid and
comfort to the enemy, we are most put to it to find in other
evidence a treacherous intent.
We proceed to consider the application of these principles to Cramer's case.

fort, and set forth ten overt acts. The prosecution withdrew seven, and three were submitted uo the jury. The
overt acts which present the principal issue 15 are alleged
in the following language:
"1. Anthony Cramer, the defendant herein, on or about
June 23, 1942, at the Southern District of New York and
within the jurisdiction of this Court, did meet with Werner
Thiel and Edward John Kerling, enemies of the United
States, at the Twin Oaks Inn at Lexington Avenue and
44th Street, in the City and State of New York, and did
confer, treat, and counsel with said Werner Thiel and Edward John Kerling for a period of time for the purpose of
giving and with intent to give aid and comfort to said
enemies, Werner Thiel and Edward John Kerling.
"2. Anthony Cramer, the defendant herein, on or about
June 23, 1942, at the Southern District of New York and
45 The verdict in this case was a general one of guilty, without special
findings as to the acts on which it rests. Since it is not possible to
identify the grounds on which Cramer was convicted, the verdict
must be set aside if any of the separable acts submitted was insufficient. Stromberg v. California,283 U. S. 359, 368; Williams v. North
Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 292. The tenth act charged, the third submitted, was based on five falsehoods told by Cramer after his arrest
to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, admittedly for the
purpose of shielding Werner Thiel. After some time he recanted the
falsehoods and told the truth. Thiel had already been taken into
custody when the interviews occurred. The prisoner contends that
lying to his jailer does not constitute treason, that in the whole history of treason no precedent can be or is cited for holding a false
statement while under interrogation after imprisonment is treason,
that in any event it amounted to no more than an attempt which was
not consummated, that there was no right to interrogate Cramer under
the circumstances, and that admissions made out of court are rendered inadmissible as proof of overt acts in view of the requirement
that the act be proved by two witnesses or by "confession in open
court." The use of this evidence as an overt act of treason is complicated, and we intimate no views upon it in view of reversal on other
grounds. Were we to affirm we should have first to resolve these
questions against the prisoner.

within the jurisdiction of this Court, did accompany, confer, treat, and counsel with Werner Thiel, an enemy of the
United States, for a period of time at the Twin Oaks Inn
at Lexington Avenue and 44th Street, and at Thompson's
Cafeteria on 42nd Street between Lexington and Vanderbilt Avenues, both in the City and State of New York, for
the purpose of giving and with intent to give aid and comfort to said enemy, Werner Thiel."
At the present stage of the case we need not weigh
their sufficiency as a matter of pleading. Whatever the
averments might have permitted the Government to
prove, we now consider their adequacy on the proof as
made.
It appeared upon the trial that at all times involved
in these acts Kerling and Thiel were under surveillance of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. By direct testimony of two or more agents it was established that Cramer
met Thiel and Kerling on the occasions and at the places
charged and that they drank together and engaged long
and earnestly in conversation. This is the sum of the overt
acts as established by the testimony of two witnesses.
There is no two-witness proof of what they said nor in
what language they conversed. There is no showing that
Cramer gave them any information whatever of value to
their mission or indeed that he had any to give. No
effort at secrecy is shown, for they met in public places.
Cramer furnished them no shelter, nothing that can be
called sustenance or supplies, and there is no evidence
that he gave them encouragement or counsel, or even paid
for their drinks.
The Goverment recognizes the weakness of il, proof of
aid and comfort, but on this score it urges: "Little imagination is required to perceive the advantage such meeting
would afford to enemy spies not yet detected. Even apart
from the psychological comfort which the meetings furnished Thiel and Kerling by way of social intercourse with

325 U.S.

one who they were confident would not report them to the
authorities, as a loyal citizen should, the meetings gave
them a source of information and an avenue for contact.
It enabled them to be-seen in public with a citizen above
suspicion and thereby to be mingling normally with the
citizens of the country with which they were at war."
The difficulty with this argument is that the whole purpose
of the constitutional provision is to make sure that treason conviction shall rest on direct proof of two witnesses
and not on even a little imagination. And without the
use of some imagination it is difficult to perceive any advantage which this meeting afforded to Thiel and Kerling
as enemies or how it strengthened Germany or weakened
the United States in any way whatever. It may be true
that the saboteurs were cultivating Cramer as a potential
"source of information and an avenue for contact." But
there is no proof either by two witnesses or by even one
witness or by any circumstance that Cramer gave them
information or established any "contact" for them with
any person other than an attempt to bring about a rendezvous between Thiel and a girl, or that being "seen in
public with a citizen above suspicion" was of any assistance to the enemy. Meeting with Cramer in public drinking places to tipple and trifle was no part of the saboteurs'
mission and did not advance it. It may well have been
a digression which jeopardized its success.
The shortcomings of the overt act submitted are emphasized by contrast with others which the indictment
charged but which the prosecution withdrew for admitted
insufficiency of proof. It appears that Cramer took from
Thiel for safekeeping a money belt containing about
$3,60Q, some $160 of which he held in his room concealed
in books for Thiel's use as needed. An old indebtedness of
Thiel to Cramer of $200 was paid from the fund, and the
rest Cramer put in his safe-deposit box in a bank for safekeeping. All of this was at Thiel's request. That Thiel

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

would be aided by having the security of a safe-deposit
box for his funds, plus availability of smaller amounts,
and by being relieved of the risks of carrying large sums
on his person-without disclosing his presence or identity
to a bank-seems obvious. The inference of intent from
such act is also very different from the intent manifest by
drinking and talking together. Taking what must have
seemed a large sum of money for safekeeping is not a usual
amenity of social intercourse. That such responsibilities
are undertaken and such trust bestowed without the
scratch of a pen to show it, implies some degree of mutuality and concert from which a jury could say that aid and
comfort was given and was intended. If these acts had
been submitted as overt acts of treason, and we were now
required to decide whether they had been established as
required, we would have a quite different case. We would
then have to decide whether statements on the witness
stand by the defendant are either "confession in open
court" or may be counted as the testimony of one of the
required two witnesses to make out otherwise insufficiently
proved "overt acts." But this transaction was not proven
as the Government evidentlylhoped to do when the indictment was obtained. The overt acts based on it were expressly withdrawn from the jury, and Cramer has not been
convicted of treason on account of such acts. We cannot sustain a conviction for the acts submitted on the
theory that, even if insufficient, some unsubmitted ones
may be resorted to as proof of treason. Evidence of the
money transaction serves only to show how much went
out of the case when it was withdrawn.
The Government contends that outside of the overt
acts, and by lesser degree of proof, it has shown a treasonable intent on Cramer's part in meeting and talking with
Thiel and Kerling. But if it showed him disposed to betray, and showed that he had opportunity to do so, it still
has not proved in the manner required that he did any acts

325 U. S.

submitted to the jury as a basis for conviction which had
the effect of betraying by giving aid and comfort. To take
the intent for the deed would carry us back to constructive
treasons.
It is outside of the commonplace overt acts as proved
that we must find all that convicts or convinces either
that Cramer gave aid and comfort or that he had a traitorous intention. The prosecution relied chiefly upon the
testimony of Norma Kopp, the fianc6e of Thiel, as to incQrminating statements made by Cramer to her," upon
admissions made by Cramer after his arrest to agents of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 7 upon letters and
4" The testimony of Norma Kopp was probably the most damaging
to the prisoner. She was a German alien who had been in the United
States since 1928, but had never become a citizen. She had long and
intimately known both Cramer and Thiel and became engaged to
marry Thiel four days before he left for Germany. She knew him to
be a Nazi. She received at Westport, Conn., where she was working as a laundry and kitchen maid, a note from Cramer, asking her
to come to New York for an undisclosed reason. She came and Cramer
then, she says, told her that Thiel was back, that he came with others,
that six of them landed from a submarine in a rubber boat in Florida,
that they brought much money "from Gernany from the German
Government," that Cramer was keeping it for Thiel in his safety
deposit box, that these men got instructions from a "sitz" in the
Bronx as to where to go, but Cramer said he did not know what he
meant by "sitz." Cramer said he expected Thiel that evening at his
apartment, but Thiel did not come. Cramer failed to bring about
her meeting with Thiel, as he had promised her. She was at Kolping
House when Cramer was taken into custody. The following day pictures of the saboteurs and the story of their landing and arrest was in
the newspapers. She was taken into custody and questioned by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
47 Cramer left a note for "William Thomas," the name under which
Thiel was going, at the Commodore Hotel, where he was staying, saying
that Miss Kopp had come and asking Thiel to meet them at Thompson's Cafeteria at 4:00 that afternoon or call them at 7:00 that evening at Kolping House. Thiel had been arrested and did not keep the

documents found on search of his room by permission
after his arrest, 8 and upon testimony that Cramer, had
rendezvous nor make the call. About 10:50 p.m. June 27, Cramer was
taken into custody at Kolping House and taken to the Bureau's headquarters in New Y6rk. He told the agents that the man he had been
with at Thompson's Cafeteria was William Thomas, that Thomas had
worked in a factory on the West Coast since March of 1941 and had
not been 3ut of the United States. When asked if the true name of
William Thomas was not Werner Thiel, he replied that it was, and
that Thiel was using an assumed name because of difficulties with his
draft board. He stated that the money belt which Thiel had given
him contained only $200, which Thiel owed him, and that the $3,500
in the safety deposit box belonged to him and had been obtained from
the sale of securities. The gravity of the offense with which he might
be confronted was intimated to Cramer, and he asked if he might
speak with agent Ostholthoff alone. To him he recanted his previous
false statements and admitted that he knew Thiel had come from Germany, probably' on a mission for the German Government, which he
thought was "to stir up unrest among the people and probably spread
propaganda."
He repeated this in -the presence of other agents
and stated that he had lied in order to protect Thiel. Cramer authorized the agents to search his room and to open his safe-deposit
box at the Corn Exchange Bank and remove the contents thereof.

As summarized in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals,
these are: "Writing Thiel in Germany, November 25, 1941, appellant
said that 'defiance, boldness, will, and sharp weapons will decide
the war, and the Germany Army and the German people are not lacking in these,' that he was 'very discontet' and sat here 'in pitiable
comfort,' and that he had' refused a job in Detroit at $100 per week
because 'I do not want to soil my hands with war work.' To his family in Germany he wrote December 3, 1941, of 'the gigantic sacrifices
which the glorious, disciplined German Army is making from day to
day for the Homeland,' that 'every day here I hear the shrieks of
hatred and the clamor for annihilation from the hostile foreigners,'
and that a lost war 'means today a complete extirpation of the German nation.' To a friend in Chicago he wrote April 21, 1942, objecting to conscription 'after one has spent almost half a lifetime here in
the States,' and saying 'personally I should not care at all to be
misused by the American army as a world conqueror.' All the letters
were written in German."

curtly refused to buy Government bonds.49 After denial
of defendant's motion to dismiss at the close of the
prosecution's case, defendant became a witness in his
own behalf and the Government obtained on crossexamination some admissions of which it had the benefit
on submission."
. 9 On the Government's case a witness testified that he went to
Cramer's apartment, told him that he was a representative of the
United States Government on a pledge drive and asked him if he
would like to sign a pledge for a bond. Cramer said he was not
-interested and, in reply to the question whether he would sign up
for a stamp, he said he was not even interested in the purchase of a
10-cent stamp. He then closed the door. The witness rang again
and Cramer opened the door again and then closed it.
Norma Kopp testified that Cramer told her that the "Minute Man"
called at his door "and he got kind of fresh and he closed the door at
him." Miss Kopp's testimony was objected to and was offered as
"showing the general motive and disposition, in so far as loyalty to the
country is concerned, of this defendant," and as probative on the
issue of intent. The court received it on the theory that incidents of
that sort might corroborate or the jury might find it corroborated certain other testimony offered by the Government indicating a motive
or intent.
50 The defendant, having testified in his own behalf, was under
cross-examination. He was asked! "Q. Now, sir, isn't it the fact that
you did write to Germany in the year 1941 several letters in which
you discussed the United States in an unfriendly manner? A. I do
not know unfriendly. I would say that I have criticized a few persons I have never criticized the United States as such." He was then
asked whether in 1941 he did not receive letters from his nephew
Norbert and whether it was not the fact that Cramer's brother, Norbert's father, "through Norbert warned you that your letters discussed the United States in such an unfriendly fashion that Norbert's
father feared that you would be put on the blacklist, because according to him the letters went through an American censorship?" Objection was duly made that the letters referred to were from someone
else and could not bind the defendant. The objection was overruled,
and the witness answered: "Well, I have received a letter from my
nephew Norbert which mentions that, I admit that." A motion to

we take of the more fundamental issues, to discuss the
strike the answer was denied, and exceptions to both rulings were
duly taken.
The Circuit Court of Appeals observed that, "Of course, theseexpressions of opinion could not properly bind appellant; and the
objection might wisely have been sustained." But it concluded that
the ruling was not sufficiently prejudicial to call for reversal.
While defendant was under cross-examination, he was asked, "By
the way, Mr. Witness, you have testified at length here about your
various studies and your various occupations and interests. Were you
ever interested in law? A. No, sir; I was not. Q. Isn't it a fact, sir,
that at one time you were particularly interested in the law of treason? A. No, sir; I have never been interested in that." The District
Attorney then offered a complete text of the Constitution of the
United States as printed in the New York Times in 1937. It had been
found in Cramer's room and on it were marks whikh he admitted
making. One of the marks was opposite the paragraph which defines
treason. The District Attorney offered it for impeachment and also
contended it to be of probative force to show "that this witness had in
mind at the time these events which are the subject of the indictment
here occurred, what the law of treason was." Against objection the
court admitted it as material and relevant and declined to limit the
grounds on which it was received.
It appears without dispute that the marks on this copy of the Constitution were made at a time not definitely established but clearly
before the United States entered the war and when the policy of the
Government was declared to be one of neutrality.
The treason paragraph of the Constitution was one of six provisions which he marked. Another was the provision of Article 1 of
ยง 7, that if any bill passed by the Congress shall not be returned by
the President within ten days after having been presented to him,
the same shall be a law. Another, the provision of Article 1, ยง 8,
that Congress shall have the power to declare war, grant letters of
marque and reprisal and make rules concerning captures on land and
water. A third was Article 1, ยง 9, which provides that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed. A fourth was that pro-

reservations which all of us entertain as to the admissibility of some of it or those which some entertain as to
other of it. We could conclude in favor of affirmance
only if all questions of admissibility were resolved against
the prisoner. At all events much of the evidence is of
the general character whose infirmities were feared by the
framers and sought to be safeguarded against.
Most damaging is the testimony of Norma Kopp, a
friend of Cramer's and one with whom, if she is to be
believed, he had been most indiscreetly confidential. Her
testimony went considerably beyond that of the agents
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to admissions
of guilty knowledge of Thiel's hostile mission and of
Cramer's sympathy with it. To the extent that his conviction rests upon such evidence, and it does to an unknown but considerable extent, it rests upon the uncor:
roborated testimony of one witness not without strong
emotional interest in the drama of which Cramer's trial
was a part. Other evidence relates statements by Cramer
before the United States was at war with Germany. At
the time they were uttered, however, they were not treasonable. To use pre-war expressions of opposition to
entering a war to convict of treason during the war is a
dangerous 'procedure at best. The same may be said about
the inference of disloyal attitude created by showing that
he refused to buy bonds and closed thd door in the salesman's face. Another class of evidence consists of admissions to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
They are, of course, not "confessions in open court." The
Government does not contend and could not well contend
vision of Article 1, ยง9, that no title of nobility shall be granted by
the United States. Another was the portion of Axticle 2, ยง 1, which
sets forth the President's oath.
The petitioner was naturalized in 1936 and, so far as appears, came
into possession of the Constitution in 1937.

that admissions made out of court, if otherwise admissible,
can supply a deficiency in proof of the overt act itself.
V
The Government has urged that our initial interpretation of the treason clause should be less exacting, lest treason be too hard to prove and the Government disabled
from adequately combating the techniques of modern
warfare. But the treason offense is not the only nor can
it well serve as the principal legal weapon to vindicate our
national cohesion and security. In debating this provision, Rufus King observed to the Convention that the
"controversy relating to Treason might be of less mag,
nitude than was supposed; as the legislature might punish
capitally under other names than Treason." I' His statement holds good today. Of course we do not intimate that
Congress could dispense with the two-witness rule merely
by giving the same offense another name. But the power
of Congress is in no way limited to enact prohibitions of
specified acts thought detrimental to our wartime safety.
The loyal and the disloyal alike may be forbidden to do
acts which place our security in peril, and the trial thereof
may be focussed upon defendant's specific intent to do
those particular acts " thus eliminating the accusation of
treachery and of general intent to betray which have such
passion-rousing potentialities. Congress repeatedly has
enacted prohibitions of specific acts thought to endanger
our security ' and the practice of foreign nations with de512

fense problems more acute than our own affords examples

The framers' effort to compress into two sentences the
law of one of the most intricate of crimes gives a superficial appearance of clarity and simplicity which proves
illusory when it is put to practical application. There are
few subjects on which the temptation to utter abstract
54The Government's Appendix includes such examples as the
following:
Danish Penal Code.-"Sec. 105. One who commits an act by virtue of which a foreign service of military intelligence is set up, or
who assists directly or indirectly in its functioning on the territory of
the State of Denmark, shall be punished by imprisonment up to two

Polish Code.-"Art. 100. Sec. 1. Whoever in time of war acts in
favor of the enemy or to the damage of the Polish armed forces or
allied forces shall be punished by imprisonment not under ten years

"Art. 100. Sec. 2. If the offender unintentionally acted, he shall

French Code of 1939.-"Art. 103. Whoever, knowing about the

The French Code (Harboring) provides in Article 85 that every
Frenchman and every foreigner shall be punished as an accomplice

"(1) Who, knowing the intentions of the perpetrators of major

interpretative generalizations is greater or on which they
are more to be distrusted. The little clause is packed.
with controversy and difficulty. The offense is one of
subtlety, and it is easy to demonstrate lack of logic in
almost any interpretation by hypothetical cases, to which
real treasons rarely will conform. The protection of the
two-witness requirement, limited as it is to overt acts,
may be wholly unrelated to the real controversial factors
in a case. We would be understood as speaking only in
the light of the facts and of the issues raised in the case
under consideration, although that leaves many undetermined grounds of dispute which, after the method of
the common law, we may defer until they are presented by
facts which may throw greater light on their significance.
Although nothing in the conduct of Cramer's trial evokes
it, a repetition of Chief Justice Marshall's warning can
never be untimely:
"As there is no crime which can more excite and agitate
the passions of men than treason, no charge demands more
from the tribunal before which it is made, a deliberate and
temperate inquiry. Whether this inquiry be directed to
the fact or to the law, none can be more solemn, none more
important to the citizen or to the government; none can
more affect the safety of both.
". .. It is, therefore, more safe, as well as more consonant to the principles of our constitution, that the crime
of treason should not be extended by construction to
doubtful cases; and that ,crimes not clearly within the
constitutional definition, should receive such punishment
as the legislature in its wisdom may provide." Ex parte
Bolman, 4 Cranch 75, 125, 127.
It is not difficult to find grounds upon which to quarrel
with this constitutional provision. Perhaps the framers
placed rather more reliance on direct testimony than modern researches in psychology warrant. Or it may be considered that such a quantitative measure of proof, such

a mechanical calibration of evidence is a crude device at
best or that its protection of innocence is too fortuitous
to warrant so unselective an obstacle to conviction. Certainly the treason rule, whether wisely or not, is severely
restrictive. It must be remembered, however, that the
Constitutional Convention was warned by James Wilson
that "Treason may sometimes be practiced in such a manner, as to render proof extremely difficult-as in a traitorous correspondence with an Enemy." " The provision
was adopted not merely in spite of the difficulties it put in
the way of prosecution but because of them. And it was
not by whim or by accident, but because one of the most
venerated of that venerated group considered that "prosecutions for treason were generally virulent." Time has
not made the accusation of treachery less poisonous, nor
the task of judging one charged with betraying the country, including his triers, less susceptible to the influence of
suspicion and rancor. The innovations made by the forefathers in the law of treason were conceived in a faith such
as Paine put in the maxim that "He that would make his
own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a
precedent that will reach himself."
We still put trust
in it.
We hold that overt acts 1 and 2 are insufficient as proved
to support the judgment of conviction, which accordingly is

It states a rule of law based on an interpretation of the
Constitution which is not only untenable but is also unnecessary for the decision. It disregards facts essential
to a determination of the question presented for decision.
It overlooks the basic issue on which our disposition of the
case must turn. In order to reach that issue we must have
a more exact appreciation of the facts than can be gleaned
from the opinion of the Court.

I
Cramer is a naturalized citizen of the United States,
born in Germany. He served in the German army in the
last war, coming to this country in 1925. In 1929 he met
Thiel who had come to this country in 1927 from a place
in Germany not far from petitioner's birthplace. The two
became close friends; they were intimate associates during a twelve-year period. In 1933 Cramer found work ih
Indiana. Thiel joined him there. Both became members of the Friends of New Germany, predecessor of the
German-American Bund. Cramer was an officer of thve
Indiana local. He resigned in 1935 but Thiel remained a
member and was known as a zealous Nazi. in 1936
Cramer visited Germany. 0 1i his return he received his
final citizenship papers. He and Thiel returned to Nev
York in 1937 and lived either together or in close proximity for about four years. Thiel left for Germany in
the spring of 1941, feeling that war between the United
States and Germany was imminent. According to Cramer,
Thiel was "up to his ears" in Nazi ideology. Cramer corresponded with Thiel in Germany. Prior to our declaration of war, he was sympathetic with the German cause
and critical of our attitude. Thus in November, 1941, he
wrote Thiel saying he had declined a job in Detroit, "as I
don't want to dirty my fingers with war material"; that
"We sit here in pitiable comfort, when we should be in the

battle-as Nietzsche says-I want the man, I want the
woman, the one fit for war, the other fit for bearing." In
the spring of 1942 he wrote another friend in reference to
the possibility of being drafted: "Personally I should not
care at all to be misused by the American army as a world
conqueror." Cramer listened to short-wave broadcasts
of Lord Haw-Haw and other German propagandists. - He
knew that the theme of German propaganda was that
England and the United States were fighting a war of
aggression and seeking to conquer the world.
So much for the background. What followed is a
sequel to Ex parte Quinn, 317 U. S.1.
Thiel entered the German army and in 1942 volunteered
with seven other German soldiers who had lived in the
United States for a special mission to destroy the Ameri.can aluminum industry. They were brought here by German submarines in two groups. . Kerling was the leader
and Thiel a member of one group which landed by rubber
boat near Jacksonville, Florida on June 17, 1942. They
buried their explosives and proceeded to New York City,
where on June 21st they registered at the Hotel Commodore under the assumed names of Edward Kelly and
William Thomas.
The next morning a strange voice called Cramer's name
from the hall of the rooming house where he lived. On
his failure to reply an unsigned note was slipped under
his door. It read, "Be at the Grand Central station tonight at 8 o'clock, the upper platform near the information
booth, Franz from Chicago has come into town and wants
to see you; don't fail to be there." Cramer said he knew
no Franz from Chicago. But nevertheless he was on hand
at the appointed hour and place. Thiel shortly appeared.
They went to the Twin Oaks Inn where they talked for
two hours. Cramer admitted that he knew Thiel had
come from Germany; and of course, he knew that at that
time men were not freely entering this country from Ger.

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.

many. He asked Thiel, "Say, how have you come over,
have you come by submarine?" Thiel looked startled,
smiled, and said, "Some other time I am going to tell you
all about this." Thiel told him that he had taken the assumed name of William Thomas and had a
forged draft
card. Thiel admonished him to remember that he, Thiel,
was "anti-Nazi"-a statement Cramer doubted because
he knew Thiel was a member of the Nazi party. Thiel
indicated he had come from the coast of Florida. Cramer
inquired if he had used a rubber boat. When Thiel said
that the only time he was "scared to death was when I
came over here we got bombed," Cramer replied, "Then
you have come over by submarine, haven't you?" Thie1
told Cramer that he had "three and a half or four thousand
dollars" with him and that "if you have the right kind of
connection you can even get dollars in Germany."
Cramer offered to keep Thiel's money for him. Thiel
agreed but nothing was done about it that, evening.
Cramer admitted he had-a "hunch" that Thiel was here
on a mission for the German government. He asked
Thiel "whether he had come over here to spread rumors
and incite unrest." Cramer after his arrest told agents
of the F. B. I. that he had suspected that Thiel had received the money from the German government, that
Thiel in fact had told him that he was on a mission for
Germany, and that "whatever his mission was, I thought
that he was serious in his undertaking." Thiel from the
beginning clothed his actions with secrecy; was unwilling
to be seen at Cramer's room ("because I have too many
acquaintances there and I don't want them to see ne');
and cautioned Cramer against conversing loudly with him
in the public tavern.
So they agreed to meet at the Twin Oaks Inn at 8 P. M.
on the following evening, June 23, 1942. At this meeting
Kerling joined them. Cramer had met Kerling in this
country and knew he had returned to Germany. Kerling

and Thiel told Cramer that they had come over together.
Cramer had a "hunch" that Kerling was here for the same
purpose as Thiel. Kerling left Thiel and Cramer after
about an hour and a half. Kerling was followed and arrested. Cramer and Thiel stayed on at the tavern for
about another hour. After Kerling left, Thiel agreed to
entrust his money to Cramer for safekeeping. He told
Cramer to take out $200 which Thiel owed him. But he
asked Cramer not to put all of the balance in the safedeposit box-that he should keep some of it out "in the
event I need it in a hurry." Thiel went to the washroom
to remove the money belt. He handed it to Cramer on the
street when they left the tavern. From the Twin Oaks
Thiel and Cramer went to Thompson's Cafeteria where
they conversed for about fifteen minutes. They agreed
to meet there at 8 P. M. on June 25th. They parted.
Thiel was followed and arrested.
Cramer returned home. He put Thiel's money belt in
a shoe box. He put some of the money between the pages
of a book. Later he put the balance in his bank, some in
a savings account, most of it in his safe deposit box. He
and Thiel had talked of Thiel's fianc6e, Norma Kopp. At
the first meeting Cramer had offered to write her on Thiel's
behalf. He did so. He did not mention Thiel's name
but asked her to come to his room, saying he had "sensational" news for her. Cramer appeared at Thompson's
Cafeteria at 8 P. M. June 25th to keep his appointment
with Thiel. He waited about an hour and a half. He
returned the next night, June 26th, and definitely
suspected Thiel had been arrested. Though he knew
Thiel was registered at the Hotel Commodore, he made
no attempt to get in touch with him there. When he returned to his room that night, Norma Kopp was waiting
for him. She testified that he told her that Thiel was
here; that "they came about six men with a U-boat, in a
rubber boat, and landed in Florida"; that they "brought so

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting.

much money along from Germany, from the German government" he was keeping it in a safe-deposit box; and that
they "get instructions from the sitz (hideout) in the Bronx
what to do, and where to go." The next morning Cramer
left a note for "William Thomas" at the Commodore saying that Norma Kopp had arrived and suggested a rendezvous. Later in the day Cramer was arrested. He
told the agents of the F. B. I. that the name of the man
who had been with him at Thompson's Cafeteria on the
evening of June 23rd was "William Thomas," that
"Thomas" had been working in a factory on the West
Coast since March, 1941, and had not been out of the
United States since then. He was asked if "Thomas"
was not Thiel. He then admitted he was, saying that
Thiel had used an assumed name, as he was having difficulties with his draft board. He also stated that the
money belt Thiel gave him contained only $200 which
Thiel owed him and that the $3,500 in his safe-deposit box
belonged to him and were the proceeds from the sale of
securities. After about an hour or so of the falsehoods,
Cramer asked to speak to one of the agents alone. The
request was granted. He then recanted his previous false
statements and stated that he felt sure that Thiel had
come from Germany by submarine on a mission for the
German government and that he thought that mission
was "to stir up unrest among the people and probably
spread propaganda." He stated he had lied in order to
protect Thiel.
The Court holds that this evidence is insIfficient to
sustain the conviction of Cramer under the requirements
of the Constitution. We disagree.

their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person

two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in
open Court."
The charge against Cramer was that of adhering. The
essential elements of the crime are that Cramer (1) with
treasonable intent (2) gave aid and comfort to the
enemy.
There was ample evidence for the jury that Cramer had
a treasonable intent.

The trial court charged the jury

that "criminal intent and knowledge, being a mental state,
are not susceptible of being proved by direct evidence, and
therefore you must infer the nature of the defendant's in-

tent and knowledge from all the circumstances."

It

charged that proof of criminal intent and knowledge is
sufficient if proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and that
the two witnesses are not necessary for any of the facts
other than the overt acts. On that there apparently is no
disagreement. It also charged: "Now, gentlemen, motive
should not be confused with intent. If the defendant
knowingly gives aid and comfort to one who he knows or
believes is an enemy, then he must be taken to intend the
consequences of his own voluntary act, and the fact that
his motive might not have been to aid the enemy is no
1lt is well established that the overt act and the intent are separate
and distinct elements of the -crime of treason under the Constitution.

defense. In other words, one cannot do an act which he
knows will give aid and comfort to a person he knows to be
an enemy of the United States, and then seek to disclaim
criminal intent and knowledge by saying that one's motive
was not to aid the enemy. So if you believe that the defendant performed acts which by their nature gave aid and
comfort to the enemy, knowing or believing him to be an
enemy, then you must find that he had criminal intent,
since he intended to do the act forbidden by the law. The
fact that you may believe that his motive in so doing was,
for example, merely to help a friend, or possibly for financial gain, would not change the fact that he had a criminal
intent." On that there apparently is no disagreement. A
man who voluntarily assists one known or believed to be
an enemy agent may not defend on the ground that he
betrayed his country for only thiity piees of silver. See
Hanauer v. Doane, 12 Wall. 342, 347; Sprott v. United
States, 20 Wall. 459, 463. "The consequencesoof his acts
are too serious and enormous to admit of such a plea. He
must be taken to intend the consequences of his own
voluntary act." Hanauerv. Doane, supra. For the same
reasons a man cannot slip through our treason law because
his aid to those who would destroy his country was
prompted by a desire to "accommodate a friend." 2
Loyalty to country cannot be subordinated to the amenities of personal friendship.

aid and assistance to an alien enemy permanently residing in the
United States without any showing that the enemy alien has designs
against the interests of the United States, does not without more establish an act of treason. See United States v. Fricke, 259 F. 673, 682.

Cramer had a traitorous intent if he knew or believed
that Thiel and Kerling were enemies and were working
here in the interests of the German Reich. The trial
court charged that mere suspicion was not enough; but
that it was not necessary for Cramer to have known all
their plans. There apparently is no disagreement on that.
By that test the evidence against Cramer was overwhelming. The conclusion is irresistible that Cramer believed,
if he did not actually know, that Thiel and Kerling were
here on a secret mission for the German Reich with the
object of injuring the United States and that the money
which Thiel gave him for safekeeping had been supplied
by Germany to facilitate the project of the enemy. The
trial court charged that if the jury found that Cramer
had no purpose or intention of assisting the German
Reich in its prosecution of the war or in hampering the
United States in its prosecution of the war but acted solely
for the purpose of assisting Kerling and Thiel as individuals, Cramer should be acquitted. There was ample evidence for the jury's conclusion that the assistance Cramer
rendered was assistance to the German Reich, not merely
assistance to Kerling and Thiel as individuals.
The trial judge stated when he sentenced Cramer that
it did not appear that Cramer knew that Thiel and Kerling were in possession of explosives or other means for
destroying factories in this country or that they planned to
do that. He stated that if there had been direct proof
of such knowledge he would have sentenced Cramer to
death rather than to forty-five years in prison. But however relevant such particular knowledge may have been to
fixing the punishment for Cramer's acts of treason, it
surely was not essential to proof of his traitorous intent.
A defendant who has aided an enemy agent in this country may not escape conviction for treason on the ground
that he was not aware of the enemy's precise objectives.
Knowing or believing that the agent was here on a mis-

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

sion on behalf of a hostile government, he could not,
by simple failure to ask too many questions, assume that
this mission was one of charity and benevolence toward
the United States. But the present case is much stronger.
For Cramer claims he believed the enemy agent's objective
was to destroy national morale by propaganda and not to
blow up war factories. Propaganda designed to cause disunity among adversaries is one of the older weapons known
to warfare, and upon occasion one of the most effective.
No one can read this record without concluding that the
defendant Cramer knew this. He is an intelligent, if misguided, man. He has a quick wit sharpened by considerable learning of its kind. He is widely read and a student
of history and philosophy, particularly Ranke and Nietzsche. He had been an officer of a pro-German organization, and his closest associate had been a zealous Nazi.
He also had listened to German propagandists over the
short wave. But, in any event, it is immaterial whether
Cramer was acquainted with the efficacy of propaganda in
modern warfare. Undoubtedly he knew that the German government thought it efficacious. When he was
shown consciously and voluntarily to have assisted this
enemy program his traitorous intent was then and there
sufficiently proved.
The Court does not purport to set aside the conviction
for lack of sufficient evidence of traitorous intent. It
frees Cramer from this treason charge solely on the ground
that the overt acts charged are insufficient under the constitutional requirement.

The overt acts alleged were (1) that Cramer met with
Thiel and Kerling on June 23rd, 1942, at the Twin Oaks
Inn and "did confer, treat, and counsel" with them "for
the purpose of giving and with the intent to give aid and
comfort" to the enemy; (2) that Cramer "did accompany,

The Court concedes that an overt act need not manifest
on its face a traitorous intention. By that concession it
rejects the defense based on the treason clause which
Cramer has made here. The Court says an overt act
must "show sufficient action by the accused, in its setting,
to sustain a finding that the accused actually gave aid
and comfort to the enemy." It says, however, that the
"protection of the two-witness rule extends at least to all
acts of the defendant which are used to draw incriminating inferences that aid and comfort have been given." It
adds, "Every act, movement, deed, and word of the defendant charged to constitute treason must be supported
by the testimony of two witnesses. The two-witness
principle is to interdict imputation of incriminating acts
to the accused by circumstantial evidence or by the testimony of a single witness. The prosecution cannot rely
on evidence which does not meet the constitutional test
for overt acts to create any inference that the accused did
other acts or did something more than was shown in the
overt act, in order to make a giving of aid and comfort to
the enemy." And when it comes to the overt acts of meeting and conferring with Thiel and Kerling the Court holds
that they are inadequate since there was "no two-witness
proof of what they said nor in what language they conversed." That is to say, reversible error is found because
the two witnesses who testified to the fact that Cram6r
met twice with the saboteurs did not testify that Cramer

gave them information of "value to their mission" such as
shelter, sustenance, supplies, encouragement or counsel.
That conclusion, we submit, leads to ludicrous results.
The present case is an excellent example.
It is conceded that if the two witnesses had testified not
only that they saw Cramer conferring with Thiel and Kerling but also heard him agree to keep Thiel's money and
saw him take it, the result would be different. But the
assumption is that since the two witnesses could not testify as to what happened'at the meetings, we must appraise
the meetings in isolation from the other facts of the record.
Therein lies the fallacy of the argument.
In the first place, we fully agree that under the constitutional provision there can be no conviction of treason
without proof of two witnesses of an overt act of treason.
We also agree that the act so proved need not itself manifest on its face the treasonable intent. And as the Court
states, such intent need not be proved by two-witnesses.
It may even be established by circumstantial evidence.
For it is well established that the overt act and the intent
are separate and distinct elements of the crime.3 The
"intent may be proved by one witness, collected from
circumstances, or even by a single fact." Case of Fries, 9
Fed. Cas. 826, 909, No. 5126; Respublica v. Roberts, 1
Dallas 39; United States v. Lee, 26 Fed. Cas. 907, No.
15,584; Trial of David Maclane, 26 How. St. Tr. 721, 795798. Acts innocent on their face, when judged in the light
of their purpose and of related events, may turn out to
be acts of aid and comfort committed with treasonable
purpose. It is the overt act charged as such in the indictment which must be proved by two witnesses and not the
related events which make manifest its treasonable quality
and purpose. This, we think, is the correct and necessary
conclusion to be drawn from the concession that the overt
act need not on its face manifest the guilty purpose. The

grossest and most dangerous act of treason may be. as
in this case, and often is, innocent on its face. But the
ruling of the Court that the related acts and events which
show the true character of the overt act charged must be
proved by two witnesses is without warrant under the
constitutional provisions, and is so remote from the practical realities of proving the offense, as to render the constitutional command unworkable. The treasonable intent
or purpose which it is said may be proved by a single
witness or circumstantial evidence, must, in the absence
of a confession of guilt in open court, be inferred from all
the facts and circumstances which surround and relate
to the overt act. Inference of the treasonable purpose
from events and acts related to or surrounding the overt
act necessarily includes the inference that the accused
committed the overt act with the knowledge or understanding of its treasonable character. To say that the
treasonable purpose with which the accused committed
the overt act may be inferred from related events proved
by a single witness, and at the same time to say that so far
as they show the treasonable character of the overt act,
they must be proved by two witnesses, is a contradiction in
terms. The practical effect of such a doctrine is to require
proof by two witnesses, not only of the overt act charged
which the Constitution requires but of every other fact
and circumstance relied upon to show the treasonable character of the overt act and the treasonable purpose with
which it was committed which the Constitution plainly
does not require. Here, as in practically all cases where
there is no confession in open court, the two are inseparable, save only in the single instance where the overt act
manifests its treasonable character on its face. The Court
thus in substance adopts the contention of the respondent,
which it has rejected in words, and for all practical purposes requires proof by two witnesses, not only of the overt
act but of all other elements of the crime save only in the

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.

DOUGLAS, J.,

case where the accused confesses in open court. It thus
confuses proof of the overt act with proof of the purpose
or intent with which the overt act was committed and,
without historical support, expands the constitutional requirement so as to include an element of proof not
embraced by its words.
We have developed in the Appendix to this opinion the
historic function of the overt act in treason cases. It is
plain from those materials that the requirement of an
overt act is designed to preclude punishment for treasonable plans or schemes or hopes which have never moved
out of the realm of thought or speech. It is made a necessary ingredient of the crime to foreclose prosecutions for
constructive treason. The treasonable project is complete as a crime only when the traitorous intent has
ripened into a physical and observable act. The act standing alone may appear to be innocent or indifferent, such
as joining a person at a table, stepping into -a boat, or
carrying a parcel of food. That alone is insufficient. It
must be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the
act was part of the treasonable project and done in furtherance of it. Its character and significance are to be
judged by its place in the effectuation of the project. That
does not mean that where the treasonable scheme involves
several treasonable acts, and the overt act which is charged
has been proved by two witnesses, that all the other acts
which tend to show the treasonable character of the overt
act and the treasonable purpose with which it was committed must be proved by two witnesses. The Constitution does not so declare. There is no historical support for
saying that the phrase "two witnesses to the same overt
act" may be or can be read as meaning two witnesses to all
the acts involved in the treasonable scheme of the accused.
Obviously one overt act proved by two witnesses is enough
to sustain a conviction even though the accused has committed many other acts which can be proved by only one

62

325 U.S.

witness or by his own admission in open court. Hence, it
is enough that the overt act which is charged be proved by
two witnesses. As the Court concedes, its treasonable
character need not be manifest upon its face. We say that
its true character may be proved by any competent evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict of a jury. Any other
conclusion leads to such absurd results as to preclude the
supposition that the two-witness rule was intended to have
the meaning attributed to it.
.When we apply that test to the facts of this case it is
clear to us that the judgment of conviction against Cramer
should not be set aside. The historical materials which
we have set forth in the Appendix to this opinion establish
that a meeting with the enemy may be adequate as an
overt act of treason. Hale, Kelyng and Foster establish
that beyond peradventure of doubt. Such a meeting
might be innocent on its face. It might also be innocent
in its setting, as Hale; Kelyng and Foster point out, where,
for example, it was accidental. We would have such a
case here if Cramer's first meeting with Thiel was charged
as an overt act. For, as we have seen, Cramer went to
the meeting without knowledge that he would meet and
confer with Thiel. But the subsequent meetings were
arranged between them. They were arranged in furtherance of Thiel's designs. Cramer was not only on notice
that Thiel was here on a mission inimical to the interests
of this nation. He had agreed at the first meeting to hide
Thiel's money. He had agreed to contact Norma Kopp.
He knew that Thiel wanted his identity and presence in
New York concealed. This was the setting in which the
later meetings were held. The meetings take on their true
character and significance from that setting. They constitute acts. They demonstrate that Cramer had a liking
for Thiel's design to the extent of aiding him in it. They
show beyond doubt that Cramer had more than a treasonable intent; that that intent had moved from the realm of

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
DouGLAs, J., dissenting.

thought into the realm of action. Since two witnesses
proved that the meetings took place, their character and
significance might be proved by any competent evidence.
In the second'place, this judgment of conviction should
be sustained even though we assume, arguendo, that Cramer's motion to dismiss at the end of the government's case
should have been granted. The concern of the Court is
that acts innocent on their face may be transformed into
sinister or guilty acts by circumstantial evidence, by inference, by speculation. The rule announced by the Court
is based on a desire for trustworthy evidence in determining the character and significance of the overt acts. But
this is not a case where an act innocent on its face is given
a sinister aspect and made a part of a treasonous design
by circumstantial evidence, by inference, or by the testimony of a single witness for the prosecution. We know
from Cramer's own testimony-from his admissions at
the trial-exactly what happened.
We know the character of the meetings from Cramer's
own admissions. We know from his own lips that they
were not accidental or casual conferences, or innocent,
social meetings. He arrangd them with Thiel. When he
did so he believed that Thiel was here on a secret mission
for the German Reich with the object of injuring this
nation. He also knew that Thiel was looking for a place
to hide his money. Cramer had offered to keep it for
Thiel and Thiel had accepted the offer. Cramer had also
offered to write Norma Kopp, Thiel's fianc6e, without
mentioning Thiel's name. Cramer also knew that Thiel
wanted his identity and his presence in New York concealed. Cramer's admissions at the trial gave character
and significance to those meetings. Those admissions
plus the finding of treasonable intent place beyond a rea-'
sonable doubt the conclusion that those meetings were
steps in and part and parcel of the treasonable project.
Nor need we guess or speculate for'knowledge of what
happened at the meetings. We need not rely on circum-

stantial evidence, draw inferences from other facts, or
resort to secondary sources. Again we know from Cramer's testimony at the trial-from his own admissions-precisely what transpired.
Cramer told the whole story in open court. He admitted he agreed to act and did act as custodian of the
saboteur Thiel's money, He agreed to hold it available
for Thiel's use whenever Thiel might need it. It is difficult to imagine what greater aid one could give a saboteur unless he participated in the sabotage himself. Funds
were as essential to Thiel's plans as the explosives he
buried in the sands of Florida. Without funds the mission of all the saboteurs would have soon ended or been
seriously crippled. Cramer did not stop here. Preservation of secrecy was essential to this invasion of the enemy.
It was vital if the project was to be successful. In this
respect Cramer also assisted Thiel. He cooperated with
Thiel in the concealment of Thiel's identity and presence
in New York City. He did his best to throw federal
officers off the trail and to mislead them. He made false
statements to them, saying that Thiel's true name was
"Thomas" and that Thiel had not been out of the country
since the war began.
If Cramer had not testified, we would then be confronted with the questions discussed in the opinion of the
Court. But he took the stand and told the whole story.
It is true that at the end of the government's case Cramer
moved to dismiss on the ground that the crime charged
had not been made out. That motion was denied and
an exception taken. If Cramer had rested there, the
case submitted to the jury and a judgment of conviction
rendered, we would have before us the problem presented
in the opinion -of the Court. But Cramer didl not rest on
that motion. He took the stand and told the whole story.
Any defect in the proof was cured by that procedure.
As stated in Bogk v. Gassert, 149 U. S. 17, 23, "A defend-

ant has an undoubted right to stand upon his motion for
a nonsuit, and have his writ of error if it be refused; but
he has no right to insist upon his exception, after having
subsequently put in his testimony and made his case upon
the merits, since the court and jury have the right to
consider the whole case as made by the testimony. It not
infrequently happens that the defendant himself, by his
own evidence, supplies the missing link." And see Sigafus v. Porter, 179 U. S. 116, 121; McCabe & Steen Co. v.
Wilson, 209 U. S. 275, 276; Bates v. Miller, 133 F. 2d 645,

. Why then must we disregard Cramer's admissions at the
trial? Why must we assume, as does this Court, that
those admissions are out of the case and that our decision
-must depend solely on the evidence presented by the
government?
The Constitution says that a "confession in open court"
is sufficient to sustain a conviction of treason. It was
held in United States v. Magtibay, 2 Philippine Rep. 703,
that a confession in open court to the overt acts charged
in the indictment was not an adequate substitute for the
testimony of two witnesses where the accused denied treasonable purpose. We need not go so far as to say that if
the whole crime may be proved by an admission by the
accused in open court, one of the ingredients of .the offense
may be established in like manner. See Respublica v.
Roberts, supra. We do not say that if the government
completely fails to prove an overt act or proves it by one
witness only, the defect can be cured by the testirmony
of other witnesses or by the admissions of the accused.
We do say that a meeting with the enemy is an act and

may in its setting be an overt act of treason. We agree
that overt acts innocent on their face should not be lightly
transformed into incriminating acts. But so long as overt
acts of treason need not manifest treason on their face,
as the Court concedes, the sufficiency of the evidence to
establish the treasonable character of the act, like the
evidence of treasonable intent, depends on the quality of
that evidence whatever the number of witnesses who supplied it. There can be no doubt in this case on that score.
Certainly a person who takes the stand in defense of a
treason charge against him will not be presumed to commit perjury when he makes admissions against self-interest. Admissions against self-interest have indeed always
been considered as the highest character of evidence.
When two witnesses testify to the overt acts, why then
are not admissions of the accused in open court adequate
to establish their true character? Could the testimony of
any number of witnesses more certainly or conclusively
establish the significance of what was done? Take the
case where two witnesses testify that the accused delivered"
a package to the enemy, the accused admitting in open
court that the package contained guns or ammunition. Or
two witnesses testify that the accused sent the enemy a
message, innocuous on its face, the-accused admitting in
open court that the message was a code containing military
information. Must a conviction be set aside because the
two witnesses did not testify to what the accused admitted in open court? We say no. In such circumstances
we have no examples of constructive treason. The intent
is not taken for the deed. Proof of the overt act plus
proof of a treasonable intent make clear that the treasonable design has moved out of the realm of thought into
the field of action. And any possibility that an act innocent on its face has been transformed into a sinister or
guilty act is foreclosed. For the significance and character
of the act are supplied by the admissions from the lips of

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.

the accused in open court. The contrary result could be
reached only if it were necessary that the overt act manifest treason on its face. That theory is rejected by the
Court. But once rejected it is fatal to the defense.
Cramer's counsel could not defend on the grounds advanced by the Court for the simple reason that the government having proved by two witnesses that Cramer met
and conferred with the saboteurs, any possible insufficiency in the evidence which it adduced to show the character and significance of the meetings was cured by
Cramer's own testimony. Cramer can defend only on the
ground that the overt act must manifest treason, which
the Court rejects, or on the ground that he had no treasonable intent, which the jury found against him on an
abundance of evidence. Those are the only alternatives
because concededly conferences with saboteurs here on a
mission for the enemy may be wholly adequate as overt
acts under the treason clause. They were proved by two
witnesses as required by the Constitution. Any possible
doubt as to their character and significance as parts of a
treasonable project were removed by the defendant's own
admissions in open court. To say that we are precluded
from considering those admissions in weighing the sufficiency of the evidence of the true character and significance of the overt acts is neither good sense nor good law.
Such a result makes the way easy for the traitor, does
violence to the Constitution and makes justice truly
blind.
APPENDIX

The most relevant source of materials for interpretation
of the treason clause of the Constitution is the statute of
25 Edw. III, Stat. 5, ch. 2 (1351) and the construction
which was given it. It was with that body of law and the
English and colonial experience under it that the Framers
were acquainted. That statute specified seven offenses as

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
DOUGLAS,

325 U. S.

constituting treason. As respects the three offenses relevant to our present discussion, it provided as follows: if
a man "doth compass or imagine the death" of the king,
or "if a man do levy war" against the king in 1is realm,
or if he "be adherent to the king's enemies in his realm,
giving to them aid and comfort in the realm, or elsewhere,
and thereof be probably attainted of open deed," he shall
be guilty of treason.
Coke makes clear 1hat the requirement of an overt act
under the statute applies to all of the offenses included in
the category of treason. See Coke, Institutes of the Laws
of England, Third Part (5th ed., London, 1671), p. 5.
There are indications by Coke that the overt act was a
separate element of the offense and that its function was
to show that the treasonable design had moved from
thought to action. Id., pp. 5,12, 14, 38. Hale is somewhat
more explicit. In discussing the offense of compassing the
king's death he indicates that the overt act may be "indifferent" in character. He says, "That words may expound
an overt-act to make good an indictment of treason of compassing the king's death, which overt-act possibly of itself
may be indifferen- and unapplicable to such an intent."
1 Hale, History of the Pleas of the Crown (Emlyn ed.,
London, 1736), p. 115. And he noted that "If there be an
assembling together to consider how they may kill the
king, this assembling is an overt-act to make good an indictment of compassing the king's death." Id., p. 119.
Kelyng states the same view. He citds Sir Everard
Digby's Case, 1 St. Tr. 234, for the proposition that the
meeting of persons and their consulting to destroy the king
was itself an overt act. "It was resolved that where a
Person knowing of the Design does meet with them, and
hear them discourse of their traitorous Designs, and say or
act nothing; This is High-Treason in that Party, for it
is more than a bare Concealment, which is Misprision,
because it sheweth his liking and approving of their De-

.sign." He says that if a person not knowing their intent
met with them, heard their plans, but said nothing and
never met again, that would be only misprision of treason.
"But if he after meet with them again,' and hear their
Consultations, and then conceal it, this is High-Treason.
For it sheweth a liking, and an approving of their Design."
Kelyng, A Report of Divers Cases in Pleas of the Crown
(3d ed., London, 1873), p. *17. And see p. *21.
Foster is even more explicit. Like Coke he asserts that
an overt act is required for each branch of treason covered
by the Statute of Edward III. Foster, A Report of Some
Proceedings on the Commission for the Trial of the Rebels
in the Year 1746 in the County of Surry, and of other
Crown Cases (2d ed., London, 1791), pp. 207, 237. He
makes clear that an overt act is required not to corroborate
the proof of a traitorous intent but to show that the treasonable project has left the realm of thought and moved
into the realm of action. As respects the offense of compassing the death of the king, he says that the indictment
"must charge, that the defendant did traitorously compass and imagine &c, and then go on and charge the several overt-acts as the means employed by the defendant
for executing his traitorous purposes. For the compassing
is considered as the treason, the overt-acts as the means
made use of to effectuate the intentions and imaginations
of the heart." Id., p. 194. He refers to Crohagan's Case
(Cro. Car. 332) where the defendant said "I will kill the
King of England, if I can come at him" and the indictment added that he came to England for that purpose.
"The traitorous intention, proved by his words, converted.
an action, innocent in itself, into an overt-act of treason."
Id., p. 202. And he also points out that "Overt-acts undoubtedly do discover the man's intentions; but, I conceive, they are not to be considered merely as evidence,
but as the means made use of to effectuate the purposes
of the heart." Id., p. 203. And he adds, "Upon this

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
DOUGLAS,

325 U. S.

principle words of advice or encouragement, and, above all,
consultations for destroying the King, very properly come
under the notion of means made use of for that purpose.
But loose words not relative to facts are, at the worst, no
more than bare indications of the malignity of the heart."
Id., p. 204. He follows Kelyng in saying that attendance
at a meeting with previous notice of the design to plot the
death of the king or a return to a meeting after knowledge
is gained of its treasonable purpose is treason, though
bare concealment would not be if the defendant met the
conspirators "accidentally or upon some indifferent occasion." Id., p. 195.
It is true that these observations related to the offense
of compassing or imagining the death of the king. But
Foster indicates that the same test applies to make out the
offense of adherence to the king's enemies, He says, "The
offence of inciting foreigners to invade the kingdom is a
treason of signal enormity. In the lowest estimation of
things and in all possible events, it is an attempt, on the
part of the offender, to render his country the seat of blood
and desolation." Id., pp. 196-197. This was said in connection with his discussion of Lord Preston'scase, 12 How.
St. Tr. 645, a landmark in the law of treason. Lord Preston was indicted both for compassing the death of the
king and for adherence to his enemies. England was at
war with France. The indictment alleged as an overt act
of treason that on December 30, 1690, Lord Preston and
others hired a small boat in the County of Middlesex to
take them to another vessel which would carry them to
France. The indictment alleged that the defendants were
en route to France to communicate military information to
the enemy. After the vessel set sail for France and when
the vessel was in the County of Kent, the defendants were
arrested. Papers containing information of value to the
enemy were found on the person of Lord Preston's servant.
Lord Preston contended that since the indictment laid the

Do-UGLAs, J., dissenting.

treason in Middlesex there was no showing that a legally
sufficient overt act of treason had been committed in that
county. The court held, however, that the act of boarding
the boat in Middlesex was a sufficient overt act of treason.
Lord Chief Justice Holt ruled, "Now the question is,
whether your lordship had a design to go to France with
these papers? If you had, and if your lordship did go on
ship-board in order to it, your taking boat in Middlesex in
order to go on ship-board, is a fact done in the county of
Middlesex." 12 How. St. Tr., p. 728.
Foster in his analysis of that case makes clear that taking the boat was an overt act sufficient not only to the
crime of compassing the death of the king but also adherence to the enemies of the king. Foster, op. cit., pp.
197-198. Yet on its face and standing alone the overt act
of taking the boat was completely innocent and harmless.
Only when it was related to other activities and events did
it acquire a treasonable significance. Foster gives other
indications that in case of adherence to the enemy the
function of the overt act is no different than when the
offense of compassing is charged. The crime of adherence
is made out where the defendant attempts to send money,
provisions, or information to the enemy "though the
money or intelligence should happen to be intercepted.
For the party in sending did all he could: the treason was
complete on his part, though it had not the effect he
intended." Id., p. 217.
Blackstone emphasizes the desirability of a restrictive
interpretation of the offense of treason, condemning
"constructive" treason and "newfangled treasons" which
imperil the liberty of the people. 4 Blackstone, Commentaries (6th ed. Dublin 1775), pp. 75, 83,85, 86. Blackstone recognizes the distinction between evidence of intent
and the overt act: "But, as this compassing or imagination is an act of the mind, it cannot possibly fall under
any judicial cognizance, unless it be demonstrated by

some open, or overt, act. And yet the tyrant Dionysius is
recorded to have executed a subject, barely for dreaming
that he had killed him; which was held for a sufficient
proof, that he had thought thereof in his waking hours.
But such is not the temper of the English law; and therefore, in this, and the three next species of treason, it is
necessary that there appear an open or overt act of a more
full and explicit nature, 'to convict the traitor upon." Id.,
p. 79. When it comes to the offense of adherence to the
enemy he gives examples of adequate overt acts, some of
which may be innocent standing by themselves. "This
must likewise be proved by some overt act, as by giving
them intelligence, by sending them provisions, by selling
them arms, by treacherously surrendering a fortress, or
the like." Id., pp. 82-83. His analysis supports the views
of Foster that the function of the overt act is to show that
the traitorous project has moved out of the realm of
thought into the realm of action.
The English cases prior to 1790 support this thesis.
We have mentioned Lord Preston's case. In the case of
Captain Vaughan, 13 How. St. Tr. 485, the principal
charge against the defendant was adhering to the enemy,
though levying war was also alleged. The substance of
the overt act of adherence was that when France and
England were at war the defendant cruised in a small
ship of war, in English waters, in the service of France
with intent to take the king's ships. It was objected that
the overt act alleged was insufficient "for it is said only
he went a-cruising; whereas they ought to have alledged
that he did commit some acts of hostility, and at-'
tempted to take some of the king's ships; for cruising alone
cannot be an overt-act; for he might be cruising to secure
the French merchant-ships from being taken, or for many
other purposes, which will not be an overt-act of treason."
p. 531. But Lord Chief Justice Holt ruled: "I beg your
pardon. Suppose the French king, with forces, should

CRAMER v. UNITED STATES.
DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

come to Dunkirk with a design to invade England; if any
one should send him victuals, or give him intelligence,
or by any other way contribute to their assistance, it would
be high-treason in adhering to the king's enemies." p.
531. And Lord Chief Justice Treby added: "The indictment is laid for adhering to, and comforting and aiding
the king's enemies. You would take that to be capable
to be construed adhering to the king's enemies in other
respects; but I take it to be a reasonable construction of
the indictment, to be adhering to the king's enemies in
their enmity. What is the duty ofevery subject? It
is to fight with, subdue, and weaken the king's enemies:
and contrary to this, if he confederate with, and strengthen
the king's enemies, he expressly contradicts this duty of
his allegiance, and is guilty of this treason of adhering
to them. But then you say here is no aiding unless there
were something done, some act of hostility. Now here
is going aboard with an intention to'do such acts; and
is not that comforting and aiding? Certainly it is. Is
not the French king comforted and aided, when he has
got so many English subjects to go a cruising upon our
ships?" pp. 532-533. And he went on to say that acts
which "give the enemy heart and courage to go on with
the war" are acts of adherence even though the whole
project was "an unprosperous attempt." p. 533. He
emphasized that the lack of success was immaterial, for
"if they have success enough, it will be too late to question them." p. 533. This is plain recognition not only
that the aid and comfort may be given though the project
is thwarted,1 but also that aid and comfort is given when
the enemy is encouraged and his morale bolstered as well
as when materials are furnished.
1 Accord: William Gregg, 14 How. St. Tr. 1371; Trial of Dr. Hensey,
19 How. St. Tr. 1341. Both of these involved indictments for compassing and adhering, the overt acts being letters of intelligence
intercepted before they reached the enemy.

The case of Francis De la Motte, 21 How. St. Tr. 687,
is also somewhat illuminating. The indictment charged
compassing and adhering. The overt acts included writing and causing to be written documents conveying intelligence to the enemy, procuring a messenger to carry
the documents, and hiring a person to gather and to send
the intelligence. Mr. Justice Buller in his charge to the
jury said: "The sending intelligence, or collecting intelligence, for the purpose of sending it to an enemy, to
enable them to annoy us or to defend themselves, though
it be never delivered to the enemy; or the hiring a person
for that purpose, is an overt act of both the species of
treason which I am stating to you from this indictment."
p. 808.
These materials indicate that the function of the overt
act was to make certain that before a conviction for the
high crime of treason may be had more than a treasonable
design must be established; it must be shown that action
pursuant to that design has been taken. The treason
of adherence was defined essentially in terms of conduct
for it involved giving aid and comfort. Yet the attempt
alone was sufficient; the aid and comfort need not have
been received by the enemy. Conduct amounting to aid
and comfort might be innocent by itself-such as collecting information or stepping into a boat. It was sufficient if in its setting it reflected a treasonable project. It
need not entail material aid; comfort or encouragement
was sufficient. The only requirement was that it definitely
translate treasonable thought into action which plainly
tended to give aid and comfort to the enemy.
These materials likewise support the contention of the
government that the overt act need not manifest treason
on its face.
The history of treason in this country down to the Constitution has been recently developed in Hurst, Treason
in the United States, (1944) 58 Harv. L. Rev. 226. We

do not stop to explore that field. But Professor Hurst's
researches make plain that prior to the revolution the
influence of 25 Edw. III was strong in the colonies and
that, if anything, the scope of the offense was somewhat
broadened. The Revolution changed matters. The
Continental Congress recommended more restrictive legislation to the colonies which limited treason to levying
war and adhering to the enemy, giving him aid and comfort. Id., p. 247. No form of treason by compassing was
retained. Id., p. 252. Distrust of constructive treason
was beginning to be voiced (id., pp. 253, 254) though in
some colonies treason was so broadly defined as to include
mere utterances of opinions. Id., pp. 266 et seq.
The proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of
1787 have been related in the opinion of the Court. And
see Hurst, Treason in the United States, 58 Harv. L. Rev.
395. As the Court points out the Framers were anxious
to guard against convictions of the innocent by perjury
and to remove treason from the realm of domestic, political disputes. Franklin expressed concern oih the first in
his statement that "prosecutions for treason were generally virulent; and perjury too easily made use of against
innocence." 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, p. 348. Madison and Jefferson I both expressed
distrust of treason for its long history of abuse in the
political field. Madison said in language somewhat reminiscent of Blackstone: "As treason may be committed
2In a letter of April 24, 1792, Jefferson, then Secretary of State,
wrote: "Treason, . .. when real, merits the highest punishment. But
most codes extend their definitions of treason to acts not really against
one's country. They do not distinguish between acts against the
government and acts against the oppressions of the government; the
latter are virtues; yet they have furnished more victims to the executioner than the former; because real treasons are rare; oppressions
frequent. The unsuccessful strugglers against tyranny, have been
the chief martyrs of treason laws in all countries." See 8 Writings of
Thomas Jefferson (Library ad. Wash. 1903) p. 332.

against the United States, the authority of the United
States ought to be enabled to punish it. But as newfangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines
by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free
government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other, the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime, fixing the proof
necessary for conviction of it, and restraining the Congress, even in punishing it, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of its author." The
Federalist, No. XLIII.
The requirement of two witnesses was not novel. England had long had that rule. 9 Holdsworth, A History of
English Law (2d ed. 1938) p. 207. The novelty was in
the requirement that there be two witnesses to the "same"
overt act. Moreover, there was no novelty in the offenses
which were included in the definition of treason. Ad-,
hering to the enemy, giving him aid and comfort, like
levying war, had long been embraced in the English crime
of treason, as we have seen. But there was novelty in the
narrow definition of treason which was adopted-a restrictive definition born of the fear of constructive treason
and distrust of treason as a political instrument.
There is, however, no evidence whatever that the offense
of adhering to the enemy giving him aid and comfort was
designed to encompass a narrower field than that indicated by its accepted and settled meaning. Nor is there
the slightest indication that the kind or character of overt
acts required were any different than those which had
long been recognized or accepted as adequate. The overt
act was of course "intended as a distinct element of proof
of the offense in addition to intent." Hurst, op. cit., pp.
415-416. But any suggested difference from the body of
law which preceded vanishes when two witnesses to the
same overt act are produced. As respects the point vital

for our decision it is therefore quite inaccurate for the
Court to conclude that our treason clause "taught a concept that differed from all historical models." That would
be true only if there was a purpose to depart from the concept of adhering to the enemy or the concept of overt acts
which had become ingrained in the antecedent English
law. We find no such purpose.

NO. 24. CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS.*

Decided April 23, 1945.
For purposes of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, which provides that "No action shall be maintained under this chapter unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action
accrued," an action is "commenced" when instituted by service

of process issued out of a state court which is itself unable to
proceed to judgment but which by the state law or practice is
directed or permitted to transfer the proceeding, by change of venue
or otherwise, to a court which does have jurisdiction to hear and
determine the cause. P. 78.
