organizations which are subject to the Railway Labor Act,

types of associations and organizations, or none. It may
begin with such as in its judgment most need regulation.

We would not have granted certiorari to review so unsubstantial a question, and all the other issues, as presented by the record now before us, are, for reasons which
we have given, inappropriate for decision in a declaratory

in a suit which is not adversary, or in which there is no actual

and in view of the decision in the Alabama State Federation of
Labor case. P. 475.
4. In the absence of an authoritative construction of § 16 by the
state courts, this Court cannot say whether that section will be
interpreted so as to include within its scope employees which petitioners intend to admit to membership, and thus cannot pass on
the constitutional validity of the section as applied to the future
admission of members. P. 476.
5. The contention in this case that § 16 of the Bradford Act conflicts
with the National Labor Relations Act does not appear to have
been properly presented to the state courts, nor to have been passed

is a companion case to Alabama State Federationof Labor
v. McAdory, ante, p. 450.
Petitioners are the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a national labor organization, and certain affiliated
labor organizations, whose members are employed within
the State, and certain of their officers. Petitioners brought
the present suit in the State Circuit Court against respondents who are county officers charged with the duty of
enforcing the Act, praying a declaratory judgment that the
Act as a whole and particularly §§ 7 and 16, among
others, are unconstitutional under the Federal and State
Constitutions, and are invalid because in conflict with
the National Labor Relations Act, and praying that an
injunction issue.
After a trial upon evidence the Circuit Court adjudged
certain sections of the Act, not here in issue, to be invalid
in whole or in part. In other respects it held the Act constitutional and valid. It found that the evidence disclosed no effort on the part of respondents to enforce the
provisions of the Act declared to be invalid and accordingly denied an injunction. On appeal the Supreme
Court of Alabama affirmed, 246 Ala. 198, 20 So. 2d 40, for
the reasons stated in its opinion in the Alabama State Federation of Labor case.
We granted certiorari, 324 U. S.832, on a petition which
urged that §§ 7 and 16 of the Act deprive petitioners of
their civil rights in violation of the constitutional guarantees of free speech and assembly; that §§ 7 and 16 conflict with the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449,
29 U. S. C. § 151 et seq.; and that § 7 denies petitioners
the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment on the ground that its provisions have
not been extended to employers' associations, and that
the Act excludes from its operation labor organizations
which are subject to the Railway Labor Act, 45 U. S. C.
§ 151 et seq.

C. I. 0. v. McADORY.
472

Opinion of the Court.

The record shows that the respondents have agreed not
to enforce § 7 of the Act until the final decision as to the
section's validity by this Court in Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, supra. Since we have held in
that case that it is inappropriate to pass upon the constitutional validity of § 7 on the record presented, we cannot say that the present proceeding is adversary as to § 7.
The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of
legislation in a suit which is not adversary, Bartemeyer v.
Iowa, 18 Wall. 129, 134-5; Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co.
v. Wellman, 143 U. S. 339; Atherton Mills v. Johnston,
259 U. S. 13, 15; Coffman v. Breeze Corps., 323 U. S. 316,
324, or in which there is no actual antagonistic assertion
of rights. Cleveland v. Chamberlain, 1 Black 419; Swift
& Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co., 243 U. S.281, 289; Norton v. Vesta Coal Co., 291 U. S. 641; United States v.
Johnson,319 U. S.302.
Upon an examination of the record in this case we find
that it shows that petitioners or some of them have members who are employed in the State of Alabama in industries whose employees are subject to the National
Labor Relations Act, and that they act in the State and
are certified as bargaining representatives of such employees under the Act. But the extent to which they act
in the State as bargaining representatives of employees in
industries which are not subject to the National Labor
Relations Act does not appear, and consequently the
record affords no adequate basis for an adjudication of
the extent to which for that reason the petitioners or
some of them may be rightly subject to local regulation
even though they also represent employees in other
industries which axe subject to the National Act.
The record does not show whether or not petitioners
provide insurance benefits for their members. The State
Supreme Court has construed § 16 as inapplicable whenever it would otherwise "interfere with or void any in-

476

Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

surance contract now in existence and in force" and, as
construed, has held it valid as applied to petitioners. On
this state of the record we are unable to say to what extent
§ 16 can be deemed applicable to members of any of petitioners because of existing insurance arrangements. For
this and the other reasons stated in our opinion in the
Alabama State Federationof Labor case the record does
not present a case calling for decision of the constitutional validity of § 16 as applied to any existing union
members.
Petitioners nevertheless assert that they intend to admit such supervisory employees as members in the future,
and that the Supreme Court of Alabama in the Alabama
State Federationof Labor case has held that such future
"executive, administrative, professional, or supervisory"
employees are not excepted from the provisions of § 16
by reason of their acquisition as such employees of insurance benefits. Although there is evidence in the record
indicating that some of petitioners who have non-supervisory members admit to membership employees whom
they designate as "supervisory" in the words of the
statute, and will continue to do so, there is also evidence
that they do not admit supervisory employees who have
the right to "hire and fire." The Supreme Court of Alabama did not in its opinion in this case or in the Alabama
State Federationof Labor case define the statutory language "executive, administrative, professional, or supervisory employee." Thus on the basis of the record before
us we do not know whether those employees which petitioners intend to admit to membership are such as are
included in § 16. We do not know that § 16 will not be
interpreted to embrace only those employees which have
the authority to employ and discharge employees. And
so it does not appear that the statute will be applied so
as to raise the federal question which we are asked to
decide.

477

Opinion of the Court.

Further, the contention that § 16 conflicts with the National Labor Relations Act, cf. Hill v. Florida,post, p. 538,
was not passed on by the Circuit Court, was not raised by
assignment of error in the Alabama Supreme Court, and
that court did not pass on that question either in its opinion in this case or in its opinion in the Alabama State Federationof Labor case which it adopted as controlling. The
Alabama Supreme Court will not consider errors which
have not been assigned, Rowland & Co. v. Plummer, 50
Ala. 182, 197; Pettibone-TaylorCo. v. FarmersBank, 156
Ala. 666, 46 So. 751; Malaney v. Ladura Mines Co., 191
Ala. 655, 65 So. 666; Nichols v. Hardegree, 202 Ala. 132,
79 So. 598; Halle v. Brooks, 209 Ala. 486, 96 So. 341, or
which have not beenspecifically and precisely raised in the
assignments of error, Kinnon v. Louisville & Nashville R.
Co., 187 Ala. 480, 65 So. 397; Carney v. Kiser Co., 200 Ala.
527, 76 So. 853; Wall v. Pearce, 209 Ala. 397, 399, 96 So.
608; Jackson Lumber Co. v. Butler, 244 Ala. 348, 13 So. 2d
294, 298. Since the State Supreme Court did not pass on
the question now urged, and since it does not appear to
have been properly presented to that court for decision, we
are without jurisdiction to consider it in the first instance
here. Caperton v. Bowyer, 14 Wall. 216, 236; Hulbert v.
Chicago, 202 U. S. 275, 280,281; Dorrancev. Pennsylvania,
287 U. S. 660; Chandler v. Manifold, 290 U. S. 665; see
also Flournoy v. Wiener, 321 U. S. 253; Charleston Assn.
v. Alderson, 324 U. S. 182, 185, and cases cited.
We find no other factual differences calling for comment
between the case presented by the record here and that
presented in the Alabama State Federationof Labor case.
Our decision here is therefore controlled by our decision
in that case. The question raised as to the equal protection
of the laws is too unsubstantial to merit review. The other
issues, as presented by the record now before us, are, for
reasons stated at length in our opinion in the Alabama
State Federation
of Labor case, inappropriate for decision

KEEGAN v. UNITED STATES.
NO. 39.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.*

Argued November 9, 10, 1944.-Decided June 11, 1945.
1. The evidence in this case was insufficient to sustain conviction of
the petitioners, members of the German-American Bund, for conspiracy knowingly to counsel others to evade service in the armed
forces of the United States, in violation of § 11 of the Selective
Training and Service Act of 1940. Pp. 488, 494.
Opinion of

ROBERTS,

J., in which FRANKFURTER and MURPHY, JJ.,

concur:
2. Promulgation and communication of Bund Command No. 37 was
not in itself a counsel to evade; evidence of the general disposition
of the petitioners either towards the Government of the United
States or towards the Selective Service Act did not make the Command a counsel to evade; and the evidence and oral statements
of the various petitioners at committee meetings and unit meetings
of the Bund did not supply the basis for a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, of counselling, or intending to counsel, or conspiring
to counsel, evasion of military service within the meaning of § 11
of the Act. P. 494.
BiAcK and RUTLEDEo, JJ., concur in separate opinions, pp. 495, 498.
