THE

COURT

OF

APPEALS

OF

YORK.*

Argued April 18-19, 1950.-Decided June 5, 1950.
1. In these suits to collect from a statutory bank liquidator claims
allegedly entitled to preference under New York Banking Law
ยง606, arising from transactions with a Japanese corporation
blocked tinder Executive Orders Nos. 8389 arid 8832, this Court
accepts the determination of the New York Court of Appeals that,
under New York law, these claims arose from transactions in New
York and were entitled to preference. Pp. 842-843.
2. Since the New York court conditioned enforcement of the claims
upon licensing by the Alien Property Custodian, federal control
over alien prol)erty remains undiminished. Propper v. Clark, 337
U. S. 472, distinguished. P. 842.
3. This Court agrees that, at the time the New York judgments
were entered, no licenses had been issued to these claimants; and it
affirms the judgments below. P. 843.

PER CURIAM.

Certiorari was granted in these cases to review federal
issues respecting the administration of frozen alien property. 339 U. S. 902.
The cases arose from suits brought by claimants Singer
and Banque Mellie Iran to collect from a statutory bank
liquidator claims allegedly entitled to a preference under
New York Banking Law ยง 606, arising from transactions
with a Japanese corporation, blocked under Executive Orders Nos. 8389, 5 Fed. Reg. 1400; 8832, 6 Fed. Reg. 3715.
The New York Court of Appeals held that the transactions gave rise to a preferred claim in the liquidation but
that payment by the liquidator must await specific licensing by the Alien Property Custodian of the transactions
underlying the claims. Singer v. Yokohama Specie Bank,
Ltd., 293 N. Y. 542, 58 N. E. 2d 726, 299 N. Y. 113, 85
N. E. 2d 894; Banque Mellie Iran v. Yokohama Specie
Bank, Ltd., 299 N. Y. 139, 85 N. E. 2d 906.
Those opposed to the judgments urge that, as a matter
of federal law, the freezing order prevented the creation
of any claim recognizable under ยง 606 of the New York
Banking Law.
Oral argument and study of the record have convinced
us that the judgments of the New York Court of Appeals
are not inconsistent with the First War Powers Act of
1941, ยง 301, 55 Stat. 839, or the above Executive Orders.
We accept the New York court's determination that under
New York law these claims arose from transactions in
New York and were entitled to a preference. Since the
New York court conditioned enforcement of the claims
upon licensing by the Alien Property Custodian, federal
control over alien property remains undiminished. Our

Opinion of the Court.

decision in Propper v. Clark, 337 U. S. 472, does not require a contrary conclusion. There the liquidator
claimed title to frozen assets adversely to the Custodian,
and sought to deny the Custodian's paramount power to
vest the alien property in the United States. No such
result follows from the New York court's judgments in the
present cases.
Since we further agree that, at the time the New York
judgments were entered, no licenses had been issued to
these claimants, we affirm the judgments below.
Affirmed.
the opinion that since
the federal question in Nos. 513 and 528 has been eliminated by the license granted by the Director, Office of
Alien Property, no jurisdiction to review remains in this
Court. Therefore, the writs of certiorari in these two
cases should be dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER is of
