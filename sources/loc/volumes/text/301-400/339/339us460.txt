HUGHES ET AL. v. SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA FOR CONTRA COSTA COUNTY.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 61.

Argued November 8-9, 1949.-Decided May 8, 1950.

Petitioners demanded of an employer that it hire Negroes at.one of
its grocery stores, as white clerks quit or were transferred, until
the proportion of Negro clerks to white clerks approximated the
proportion of Negro to white customers, which was then about
50%. A California state court enjoined petitioners from picketing
the employer's stores to enforce this specific demand for selective
hiring on a racial basis. For violation of the injunction, petitioners
were found guilty of contempt and were sentenced to fine and
imprisonment. The policy of California is against discrimination
on the basis of color. Held: The injunction did not violate petitioners' right of freedom of speech as guaranteed by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 461-469.
1. The Constitution does not demand that the element of communication in picketing prevail over the-mischief furthered by its
use to compel employment on the basis of racial discrimination
contrary to the State's policy. Pp. 463-464.
2. Industrial picketing is something more than- free, speech, since
it involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very presence of a picket line may induce action of one kind or another,
quite irrespective of the nature of the ideas which are being disseminated. Pp. 464-465.
3. The Due Process Clause cannot be construed as precluding
California from securing respect'for its policy against involuntary
employment on racial lines by prohibiting systematic picketing
that would subvert such policy. Pp. 465-466.
4. The fact that the policy of the State is expressed by its courts
rather than by its legislature is immaterial so far as the Fourteenth
Amendment is concerned. Pp. 466-469.
5. A State may direct its law against what it deems the evil
as it actually exists without covering the whole field of possible
abuses, and it may do so though the forbidden act does not differ
in kind from those that are allowed. P. 468.
32 Cal. 2d 850, 198 P. 2d 885, affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Does the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution
bar a State from use of the injunction to prohibit picketing of a place of business solely in order to secure compliance with a demand that its employees be in proportion
to the racial origin of its then customers? Such is the
broad question of this case.
The petitioners, acting on behalf of a group calling
themselves Progressive Citizens of America, demanded
of Lucky Stores, Inc., that it hire Negroes at its grocery
store near the Canal Housing Project in Richmond, California, as white clerks quit or were transferred, until th e
proportion, of Negro clerks to white clerks approximated
the proportion of Negro to white customers. At the time
in controversy about 50% of the customers of the Canal
store were Negroes. Upon refusal of this demand and
in order to compel compliance, the Canal store was
systematically patrolled by pickets carrying placards stating that Lucky refused to hire Negro clerks in proportion
to Negro customers.

OCTOBER TERM, 1949.
Opinion of the Court.

339 U. S.

Suit was begun by Lucky to enjoin the picketing on
appiopriate allegations for equitable relief. The Superior Court of Contra Costa County issued a preliminary
injunction restraining petitioners and others from picketing any of Lucky's stores to compel "the selective hiring
of negro clerks, such hiring to be based on the proportion
of white and negro customers who patronize plaintiff's
stores." In the face of this injunction, petitioners continued to picket the Canal store, carrying placards reading: "Lucky Won't Hire Negro Clerks in Proportion to
Negro Trade-Don't Patronize." In conformity with
State procedure, petitioners were found guilty of contempt
for "wilfully disregarding" the injunction and were sentenced to imprisonment for two days and fined $20 each.
They defended their conduct by challenging ? ' injunction as a deprivation of the liberty assured them by the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The
intermediate appellate court annulled the judgment of
contempt, 186 P. 2d 756, but it was reinstated on review
by the Supreme Court of California. That court held
that the conceded purpose of the picketing in this caseto compel the hiring of Negroes in proportion to Negro
customers-was unlawful even though pursued in a
peaceful manner. Having violated a valid injunction
petitioners were properly punishable for contempt. "The
controlling points," according to the decision of the Supreme Court of California, "are that the. injunction is
limited to prohibiting picketing for a specific unlawful
purpose and that the evidence justified the trial court in
finding that such narrow prohibition was deliberately violated." 32 Cal. 2d 850, 856, 198 P. 2d 885, 888. We
brought the case here to consider claims of infringement
of the right of freedom of speech as guaranteed by the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 336
U. S. 966.

HUGHES v. SUPERIOR COURT.
460

Opinion of the Court.

First. Discrimination against Negroes in employment
has brought a variety of legal issues before this Court in
recent years. Graham v. Brotherhood of Locomotive
Firemen and Enginemen, 338 U. S. 232; Railway Mail
Assn. v. Corsi, 326 U. S. 88; Steele v. Louisville & N. R.
Co., 323 U. S. 192; Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, 323 U. S. 210; New Negro
Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., 303 U. S. 552 . See
also Myrdal, An American Dilemma cc. 13-14 (1944).
Such discrimination raises sociological problems which in
some aspects and within limits have received legal solutions. California has been sensitive to these problems
and decisions of its Supreme Court have been hostile to
discrimination on the basis of color. James v. Marinship
Corp., 25 Cal. 2d 721, 155 P. 2d 329; Williams v. International Brot~erhood of Boilermakers, 27 Cal. 2d 586, 165
P. 2d 903. IThis background of California's legal policy
is relevant to the conviction of its court that it would
encourage discriminatory hiring to give constitutional
protection to petitioners' efforts to subject the opportunity of getting a job to a quota system. The view of
that court is best expressed in its own words:
"It was just such a situation-an arbitrary discrimination upon the basis of race and color alone, rather
than a choice based solely upon individual qualification for the work to be done -which we condemned
in the Marinship case, supra (25 Cal. 2d 721, 737,
745). The fact that those seeking such discrimination do not demand that it be practiced as to all
employes of a particular employer diminishes in no
respect the unlawfulness of their purpose; they would,
to the extent of the fixed proportion, make the right
to work for Lucky dependent not on fitness for the
work nor on an equal right of all, regardless of race,
to compete in an open market, but, rather, on memb67432 0- 50-:4

bership in a particular race. If petitioners were upheld in their demand then other races, white, yellow,
brown and red, would have equal rights to demand
discriminatory hiring on a racial basis. Yet that
is precisely the type of discrimination to which petitioners avowedly object." 32 Cal. 2d at 856, 198 P.
2d at 889.
These considerations are most pertinent in regard to a
population made up of so many diverse groups as ours.
To deny to California the right to ban picketing in the
circumstances of this case would mean that there could
be no prohibition of the pressure of picketing to secure
proportional employment on ancestral grounds of Hungarians in Cleveland, of Poles in Buffalo, of Germans in
Milwaukee, of Portuguese in New Bedford, of Mexicans
in San Antonio, of the numerous minority groups in
New York, and so on through the whole gamut of racial
and religious concentrations in various cities. States
may well believe that such constitutional sheltering would
inevitably encourage use of picketing to compel employment on the basis of racial discrimination. In disallowing such picketing States may act under the belief that
otherwise community tensions and conflicts would be
exacerbated. The differences in cultural traditions instead of adding flavor and variety to our common citizenry
might well be hardened into hostilities by leave of law.
The Constitution does not demand that the element of
communication in picketing prevail over the mischief furthered by its use in these situations.
Second. "[T]he domain of liberty, withdrawn by the
Fourteenth Amendment from encroachment by the
states," Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 327, no doubt
includes liberty of thought and appropriate means for
expressing it. But while picketing is a mode of communication it is inseparably something more and different.
Industrial picketing "is more than free speech, since it

involves patrol of a particular locality and since the very
presence of a picket line may induceaction of one kind or
another, quite irrespective of the nature of the ideas which
are being disseminated." Mr. Justice Douglas, joined by
Black and Murphy, JJ., concurring in Bakery & Pastry
Drivers & Helpers Local v. Wohl, 315 U. S. 769, 775, 776.
Publication in a newspaper, or by distribution of circulars,
may convey the same information or ,make the same
charge as do those patrolling a picket line. . But the very
purpose of a picket line is to exert influences, and it produces consequences, different from other modes of communication. The loyalties and responses evoked and
exacted by picket lines are unlike those flowing from
appeals by printed word. See Gregory, Labor- and the
Law 346-48 (rev. ed. 1949); Teller, Picketing and Free
Speech, 56 Harv. L. Rev. 180, 200-02 (1942); Dodd,
Picketing and Free Speech: A Dissent, 56 Harv. L. Rev.
513, 517 (1943); Hellerstein, Picketing Legislation and
the Courts, 10 N. C. L. Rev. 158, 186-87, n. 135 (1932).
Third. A State may constitutionally permit picketing
despite the ingredients in it that differentiate it from
speech in its ordinary context. Senn v. Tile Layers
Protective Union, 301 U. S. 468. And we have found
that because of its element of communication picketing
under some circumstances finds sanction in the Fourteenth Amendment. Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S.
88; American Federation of Labor v. Swing, 312 U. S.
321; Bakery & Pastry Drivers & Helpers Local v. Wohl,
315 U. S. 769; Cafeteria Employees Union v. Angelos,
320 U. S. 293. However general or loose the language
of opinions, the specific situations have controlled decision. It has been amply recognized that picketing, not
being the equivalent of speech as a matter of fact, is
not its inevitable legal equivalent. Picketing is not
beyond the control of a State if the manner in which
picketing is conducted or the purpose which- it seeks

to effectuate gives ground for its disallowance. See
Dorchy v. Kansas, 272 U. S. 306; Milk Wagon Drivers
Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies,Inc., 312 U. S. 287; Hotel
and RestaurantEmployees' InternationalAlliance v. Wisconsin E. R. B., 315 U. S. 437; Carpenters & Joiners
Union v. Ritter's Cafe, 315 U. S. 722; Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490. "A state is not
required to tolerate in all places and all circumstances
even peaceful. picketing by an individual." Bakery &
Pastry Drivers & Helpers Local v. Wohl, supra at 775.
The constitutional boundary line between the competing interests of society involved in the use of picketing
cannot be established by general phrases. Picketing
when not in numbers that of themselves carry a threat of
violence may be a lawful means to a lawful end. See
American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades
Council, 257 U. S. 184, 206-07. The California Supreme
Court suggested a distinction between picketing to promote discrimination, as here, and picketing against discrimination: "It may be assumed for the purposes of this
decision, without deciding, that if such discrimination
exists, picketing to protest it would not be for an unlawful
objective." 32 Cal. 2d at 855, 198 P. 2d at 888. We
cannot construe the Due Process Clause as precluding
California from securing respect for its policy against
involuntary employment on racial lines by prohibiting
systematic picketing that would subvert such policy. See
Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., supra.
Fourth. The fact that California's policy is expressed
by the judicial organ of the State rather than by the
legislature we have repeatedly ruled to be immaterial.*
*The range of policy in proscribing or permitting picketing for
various ends is illustrated by a recent bill against picketing of courts
passed by the New York State Legislature but vetoed by Governor
Dewey. See N. Y. Times, Apr. 11, 1950, ). 21, col. 1.

It is not for this Court to deny to a State the right,
or even to question the desirability, of fitting its law
"to a concrete situation through the authority given . . .
to its courts." Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., supra at 297. It is particularly important to bear this in mind in regard to matters affecting
industrial relations which, until recently, have "been left
largely to judicial lawmaking and not to legislation."
Carpenters& Joiners Union v. Ritter's Cafe, supra at 724.
In charging its courts with evolving law instead of formulating policy by statute, California has availed itself of the
variety of law-making sources, and has recognized that in
our day as in Coke's "the law hath provided several
weapons of remedy." Coke, The Compleat Copyholder
§ 9 in Three Law Tracts (1764). California chose to
strike at the discrimination inherent in the quota system'
by means of the equitable remedy of injunction to protect
against unwilling submission to such a system. It is not
for this Court to deny to California that choice from
among all "the various weapons in the armory of the
law." Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S. 141, 148.

OCTOBER TERM, 1949.
Opinion of the Court.

339 U. S.

The policy of a State may rely for the common good
on the free play of conflicting interests and leave conduct
unregulated. Contrariwise, a State may deem it wiser
policy to regulate. Regulation may take the form of
legislation, e. g., restraint of trade statutes, or be left
to the ad hoc judicial process, e. g., common law mode
of dealing with restraints of trade. Either method may
outlaw an end not in the public interest or merely address
itself to the obvious means toward such end. The form
the regulation should take and its scope are surely matters
of policy and, as such, within a State's choice.
If because of the compulsive features inherent in picketing, beyond the aspect of mere communication as an
appeal to reason, a State chooses to enjoin picketing to
secure submission to a demand for employment proportional to the racial origin of the then customers of a business, it need not forbid the employer to adopt such a
quota system of his own free will. A State is not required
to exercise its intervention on the basis of abstract reasoning. The Constitution commands neither logical symmetry nor exhaustion of a principle. "The problems of
government are practical ones and may justify, if they do
not require, rough accommodations-illogical, it may be,
and unscientific." Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago,228
U. S. 61, 69-70. A State may "direct its law against what
it deems the evil as it actually exists without covering the
whole field of possible abuses, and it may do so none the
less that the forbidden act does not differ in kind from
those that are allowed." Central Lumber Co. v. South
Dakota, 226 U. S. 157, 160. See also Lindsley v. Natural
Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U. S. 61, 81; Keokee Consolidated

The injunction here was drawn to meet what California deemed the evil of picketing to bring about proportional hiring. We do not go beyond the circumstances of the case. Generalizations are treacherous in
the application of large constitutional concepts.
