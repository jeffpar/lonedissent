HARRIS v. PENNSYLVANIA R. CO.
Per Curiam.

HARRIS v. PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD CO.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF OHIO.

No. 81.

Decided October 19, 1959.

In this case arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the
proofs justified with reason the jury's conclusion that employer
negligence plaiyed a part in producing petitioner's injury. Therefore, certiorari is granted; the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Ohio setting aside a judgment for petitioner is reversed; and
the cause is remanded.
168 Ohio St. 582, 156 N. E. 2d 822, reversed.

Marshall I. Nurenberg for petitioner.
Edwin Knachel for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The
judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is reversed and
the case is remanded for proceedings in conformity with
this opinion. We hold that the proofs justified with reason the jury's conclusion, embodied in answers to Interrogatories to Jury numbers I and II, that employer negligence played a part in producing the petitioner's injury..
Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500. See also
Moore v. Terminal Railroad Assn., 358 U. S. 31, and cases
cited therein. We therefore find it unnecessary to consider the petitioner's challenge to the Ohio procedure
governing interrogatories to the jury.
For the reasons set forth in his opinion in Rogers v.
Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524, MR. JUSTICE

The suggestion that this and related decisions mean
that we have eliminated "all meaningful judicial supervision over jury verdicts" in FELA pases prompts me-to
file this opinion and bring up to date the compilation
which I made in Wilkerson v. McCarthy 336 U. S. 53,-68,
71-73. The Wilkerson case was decided January 31, 1949.
The attached Appendix presents a statistical summary qf
our stewardship of these FELA cases from that date to
October 19, 1959.
Of the 110 petitions for certiorari filed during this
period of more than 10 years, 73 were filed by employees
- and 37 were filed by employers. Of these, 33 were granted,
each ai the, instance of an employee whb complained of
the lower court's withholding the case from the jury or
overturning a jury verdict in his favor. Thirty cases were
reversed for usurpation of the jury function; and in each
of three the lower court's decision was sustained.
Of the 77 petitions denied, 32 were by employees who
sought reversal of a lower court's decision to withhold
the case from the jury or to upset a jury's verdict. Eight
'Cases in which petitions for certiorari have been granted but
which have not yet been decided on the merits have not been
included nor have cases been included which did not present issues
of negligence or causation under the Act. Moreover, petitions seeking
review of judgments of state courts granting new trials are not
included because -we usually treat them as not being "final" judgm~nts. See 28 U. S. C. ยง 1257; Bruce v. Tobin, 245 U. S.. 18.

HARRIS v. PENNSYLVANIA R. CO.

more employees wanted this Court to overturn jury verdicts rendered in the employers' favor.
Of the petitions filed by employers, 35 asked this Court
to reverse a lower court decision upholding a jury verdict
or holding that the case should have been submitted to
a jury. Employers in two other petitions complained of
the lower court's action in setting aside a jury verdict and
granting a new trial.
It is apparent from the decisions where we refused to
review cases'in which lower courts withheld cases from
the jury or set aside jury verdicts (or where, having
granted certiorari, we sustained the lower courts in that
action) that the system of judicial supervision still exists
in this as in other types of cases.
It is suggested that the Court has consumed too -much
of its time in reviewing these FELA cases. An examination of the 33 cases in which the Court has granted certiorari during the period of over 10 years covered by the
attached Appendix reveals that 16 of these cases were
sqmmarily reversed withoutoral argument and without
full opinions. Only 17 cases were argued during this
period of more than a decade and, of these, 5 were disposed of by brief per curiam opinions. Only 12 cases
in over 10 years were argued, briefed and disposed of
with full opinions by the Court. We have granted certiorari in these cases on an average of less than 3 per year
and have given plenary consideration to slightly more
than 1 per year. Wastage of our' time is therefore a
false issue.
The difference between the majority and minority of
the Court in our treatment of FELA cases concerns the
degree of vigilance we should exercise in safeguarding the
jury trial-guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment and
part and parcel of the remedy under this Federal Act
when suit is brought in state courts. See Bailey v. Cen-

tral Vermont R. Co., 319 U. S. 350, 354; Dice v. Akron,
C. & Y. R. Co., 342 U. S. 359, 363. Whether that right
has been impaired in a particular instance often produces a contrariety of views. Yet the practice of the
Court in allowing four out of nine votes to control the
certiorari docket is well established and of long duration.2
Without it, the vast discretion which Congress allowed us
in granting or denying certiorari might not be tolerable.
Every member of the Court has known instances where
he has strongly protested the action of the minority in
bringing a case or type of case here for adjudication. He
may then feel that there are more important and pressing
matters to which the Court should give its attention.
That is, however, a price we pay for keeping our promise
to Congress ' to let the vote of four Justices bring up any
case here on certiorari.

the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936), which broadened our eertiorari'jurisdiction, was before the Congress, Mr. Justice
Van Devanter, speaking for the Court, made explicit that the "rule
of four" governs the grant of petitions for certiorari. He testified
before the Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee as
follows:
"... if there were five votes against granting the petition and
four in favor of granting it, it would be granted, becaue we proceed
upon the theory that when as many as four members of the court,
-and even three in some instances, are impressed with the propriety
of our taking the case the petition should be granted. This is the
uniform way inwhich petitions for writs of certiorari are considered."
Hearings on S.2060, Feb. 2, 1924, 68th CQng.; 1st Sess., p. 29. And
see Hearings on H.'R; 8206, Dec. 18, 1924, 68th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 8.
3The "rule of four" was given as one of the reasons why the
Congress thought that thie increasd of our discretionary jurisdiction
was warranted. The House Report stated:
"Lest it should be thought that the increase of discretionary jurisdiction might impair the administration of justice and lead to partial

hearings and not secure a decision by the whole court, it is proper
to call attention to the very thorough and complete system by which
discretionary jurisdiction is exercised. In granting or refusing a
prayer for a certiorari the petitioner gets the judgment of the whole
court. The application is not disposed of by a single justice. The
luminous and informing statement of Mr. Justice Van Devanter tells
the whole story:
"'While the *authority of the Supreme Court to take cases on
petition for certiorari is spoken of as a discretionary jurisdiction,
this does not mrean that the court is authorized merely to exercise a
will -in the mat.fer but rather that the petition is to be granted or
denied according to a sound judicial discretion. What actually is
done may well be stated here with some particularity. The party
aggrieved by the decision of the circuit court of appeals and seeking
a further review in the Si'preme Court is required to present to it
a petition and accompanying brief, setting forth the nature of the
case, what questions are involved, how they were decided in the
circuit court of appeals, and- why the case should not rest on the
decision of that court. The petition and brief are required to be
served on the other party, and time is given for the presentation
of an opposing brief. When this has been done copies of the printed
record as it came from the circuit 6ourt of appeals and of the petition
and briefs are distributed among the members of the Supreme Court,
and each judge examines them and prepares a memorandum or note
indicating his view of what should be done.
"'In conference these cases are called, each in its turn, and each
judge states his views in extenso or briefly as lie thinks proper;
and when all have spoken any difference in opinion is discus ,td and
then a vote is taken. I explain this at some length because it seemS
to be thought outside that the cases are referred to particular judges,
as, for instance, that those coming from a particular circuit are referred to the justice assigned to that circuit, and that he reports
on them, and the others accept his report. That impression is wholly
at variance with what actually occurs.
"'We do not grant or deny these petitions merely according to
a majority vote. We always grant the petition when as many as
four think that it should be granted and sometimes when as many
as three think that way. We proceed upon the theory that, if that
number out of the nine are impressed with the thought that the case is
one that ought to be heard and decided by us, the petition should
be granted.'" H. R. Rep. No. 1075, 68th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom

MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER

joins, dissenting.
The opening of a new Term that confronts the Court
with the usual volume of important and exacting business impels me to reiterate the view that cases involving
only factual issues and which are of no general importance
have no legitimate demands upon our energies, already
taxed to the utmost. See Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R.
Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524, 559 (dissenting opinions). The
extreme character of the adjudication which has been
made in this case also deserves something more than
merely noting my dissent on the merits, for I do not think
that the reversal of this judgment is to be justified even
under the philosophy of Rogers.
Petitioner was injured while engaged, as a member of
a "wreck train crew," in retracking two derailed boxcars
on the line of another railroad during the early morning
of a "sleety, wet and sloppy" day. The operation involved
the use on each car of a derrick and four outriggers. Each
outrigger was supported from beneath by wooden blocks.
The first derailed car was successfully retracked. The
equipment then had to be moved for a similar operation

361 U. S.

on the second car. In this process petitioner wrenched
his back while attempting to remove one of the wooden
blocks which had become embedded in mud. Being unable to brace his right foot on the narrow surface of the
ground between the block and one of the railroad crossties, petitioner placed that foot on the tie itself. In answer to interrogatories the jury found that respondent
had been negligent in that "the tie of the track [petitioner] was required to walk was elevated a substantial
distance above the ground level and was covered with
grease or oil, thereby affording unstable footing." A verdict in the sum of $25,000 was returned, which on review
was set aside by the Ohio Supreme Court.
The Court does not reach the question as to the applicability of the Ohio rule that this specification of
negligence excluded appellate consideration of any others
asserted by petitioner. I can hardly believe that the
Court quarrels with the state court's ruling that as a
matter of law the "position of the crosstie, slightly elevated above the roadbed" could not support the jury's
finding of negligence because such state of affairs was a
common and notorious one. Hence justification for the
overturning of this judgment must rest upon what the
record shows as to the presence of grease on the crosstie
and as to the respondent's culpability for that alleged
condition.
Unless liability in FELA cases may be predicated upon
mere conjecture, this record for me is manifestly deficient.
The only evidence that there was grease on the crosstie
was petitioner's statement on cross-examination that he
found some grease on the sole of the shoe of his right
foot, and the testimony of a section foreman of the other
railroad that grease was used on that railroad's switches,
which were customarily lubricated at least twice a week.
Petitioner had not mentioned on direct examination, in

HARRIS v. PENNSYLVANIA R. CO.
15

HARLAN,

J., dissenting.

his pre-trial deposition, or in a written account of the
accident made shortly after it occurred, that he had encountered grease at any stage of the operation, and even
on cross-examination did not claim that he had seen grease
anywhere in the vicinity, still less on the particular crosstie where his foot had rested. With respect to the foreman's testimony, there is no evidence at all in the record
before us as to the position of any of the switches in relation to the crosstie in question-whether any of them
were adjacent to it or far removed.
But even if this evidence be considered as justifying
the jury's conclusion that there was grease on this particular crosstie, theie was, in the words of the Ohio court,
no evidence whatever that respondent "placed it there,
knew about it, or, in the exercise of ordinary care, should
have known about it." Evidence as to how long the
alleged greasy condition of this crosstie had existed was
wholly lacking. The tie on the day in question was covered with mud. And the section foreman of the other
railroad testified that there was nothing untoward about
the condition of the area when he inspected it the next
morning. How in these circumstances it could "withr
reason" be said that the respondent failed in some duty
of inspection is beyond me.
I cannot understand how on this record even the "scintilla" rule of Rogers and its progeny, see dissenting
opinion in Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 356 U. S.
326, 332, can be thought to justify the overturning of
this judgment. I fear that this decision confirms my
growing suspicion that the real but unarticulated meaning
of Rogers is that in FELA cases anything that a jury says
goes, with the consequence that all meaningful judicial
supervision over jury verdicts in such cases has been put
at an end. See separate nemorandum in Gibson v.
Thompson, 355 U. S.18, 19. If so, I think the time has

28

come when the Court should frankly say so. If not, then
the Court should at least give expression to the standards
by which the lower courts are to be guided in these cases.
Continuance of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs
can only lead to much waste motion on the part of lower
courts and defense lawyers.
I would affirm.
