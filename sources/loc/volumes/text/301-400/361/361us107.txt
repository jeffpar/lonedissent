SENTILLES v. INTER-CARIBBEAN
SHIPPING CORP.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 6.

Argued October 19, 1959.-Decided November 23, 1959.

In this suit by a seaman under the Jones Act and the general maritime law to recover from a shipowner damages for a serious
tubercular illness alleged to have been caused by an accident at
sea for which the shipowner was liable, no medical witness testified
that the accident in fact caused the illness. Held: Nevertheless,
the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that,
the illness was caused by the accident, and the Court of Appeals
erred.in reversing a judgment for the seaman. Pp. 107-110.
(a) The lack of medical unanimity as to the respective likelihood
of the potential causes of the illness, and the fact that the other
potential causes were not conclusively negated by the proofs, did
not bar the jury from drawing the inference'which it did. P. 109.
(b) The use of a particular form of words by the medical
witnesses is not determinative, and the jury was entitled to take
all the circumstances, including the medical testimony, into consideration. Pp. 109-110.
256 F. 2d 156, reversed.

into the air and fell back to the deck, where, upon landing,
a wave washed him a considerable distafice. Shortly
after the accident, the petitioner became quite ill and
was hospitalized and treated for a serious case of tuberculosis. The respondent's liability for the accident was
predicated on fault under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007,
46 U. S. C. ยง 688, and alternatively on breach of the
maritime duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel. The petitioner's theory was that the accident activated or aggravated a previously latent tubercular condition.' The case
was submitted to a jury in the District Court, where a
verdict was returned for the petitioner, and judgment
entered thereon. In the Court of Appeals, the respondent did not argue that the jury could not have with
reason found it liable for the accident, but contended
solely that the evidence did not justify the jury's conclusion that the accident caused the serious illness that
followed it. The Court of Appeals agreed with the respondent's contention and reversed, 256 F. 2d 156. We
granted certiorari on a petition in which it was asserted
that the Coirt of Appeals had applied an improper
standard in reviewing the medical evidence and in examin,ing the judgment rendered on the jury's verdict. 359
U. S.923.
There was evidence that petitioner (whose medical
history was an active one) had been examined several
times by his regular physician in the year preceding
the accident, as recently as two months before it, with
no appearance of tuberculosis being then noted. During
the petitioner's acute tuberculosis subsequent to .the accident, a specialist re-examined X-ray pictures taken in
the years preceding the accident, .and concluded that
'Maintenance hnd cure in respect of the illness were also claimed;
this was viewed as presenting a causation problem similar to that
posed by the claim for indemnity damages.

they did in fact reveal a pulmonary lesion, at first involving a "small scarred inactive area." "In retrospect,"
the specialist felt that the lesion had been tubercular.
In response to a hypothetical question as to the effect
of an accident like petitioner's on the aggravation ot activation of a pre-existing, dormant tubercular condition, the
specialist gave an opinion that "acute dissemination of
the tuberculosis" might be a consequence of the accident.
Another specialist, who had treated petitioner during his
hospitalization after the accident, posited the trauma and
petitioner's pre-existing diabetic condition as the most
likely causes of the aggravation of the tuberculosis, though
he was not able to state "which of the two it is more likely
was responsible in this instance." Another medical expert, who had not personally examined petitioner, when
questioned hypothetically, was of opinion that the accident "probably aggravated his condition," though he
would not say definitely: "We don't ever select one item
and say that is the cause of any particular aggravation."
The jury's power to draw the inference that the aggravation of petitioner's tubercular condition, evident so
shortly after the accident, was in fact caused by that
accident, was not impaired by the failure of any medical
witness to testify that it was in fact the cause. Neither
can it be impaired by the lack. of medical unanimity as to
the respective likelihood of the potential causes of the
aggravation, or by the fact that other potential causes
of the aggravation existed and were not conclusively
negated by the proofs. The matter does not turn on the
use of a particular form of words by the physicians in
giving their testimony. The members of the jury, not
the medical witnesses, were sworn to make a legal determination of the question of causation.' They were en2

titled to take all the circumstances, including the medical
testimony, into consideration. See Sullivan v. Boston
Elevated R. Co., 185 Mass. 602, 71 N. E. 90; Miami Coal
Co. v. huce, 76 Ind. App. 245, 131 N. E. 824. Though
this case involves a medical issue, it is no exception to the
admonition that, "It is not the function of a court to
search the record for conflicting circumstantial evidence in
order to take the case away from the jury on a theory that
the proof gives equal support to inconsistent and uncertain inferences. The focal point of judicial review is the
reasonableness of the particular inference or conclusion
drawn by the jury. ... . The very essence of its function
is to select from among conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it considers most reasonable ...
Courts are not free to reweigh the evidence and set aside
the jury verdict merely because the jury could have drawn
different inferences or conclusions or because judges feel
that other results are more reasonable." Tennant v.
Peoria & Pekin Union R. Co., 321 U. S. 29, 35. The
proofs here justified with reason the conclusion of the
jury that the accident caused the petitioner's serious subsequent illness. See Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co.,
352 U. S. 500.

concurring.

Cases like this, I am firmly convinced, do not belong
in this Court. To review individualized personal injury
cases, in which the sole issue is sufficiency of the evidence,
seems to me not only to disregard the Court's proper function, but also to deflect the Court's energies from the mass
of important and difficult business properly here. All this
has been elaborated in extenso by others, and there is no
point in repeating or paraphrasing their words. Suffice
it to note that I agree with what they have said. See,
e. g., Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524
(dissenting opinion); Dick v. New York Life Ins. Co., 359
U. S. 437, 447 (dissenting opinion).
Yet under our rule, when four members of the Court
vote to grant a petition for certiorari, the case is taken.
If this rule is not to be frustrated, I can, as presently
advised, see no escape from the duty of considering a
case brought here on the merits, unless considerations
appear which were not apprehended at the time certiorari
was granted. In short, on this score I agree with the
views expressed by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN in Rogers v.
Missouri.Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 559 (dissenting
opinion). See Mr. Chief Justice Stone's concurring opinion in Bailey v. Central Vermont R. Co., 319 U. S. 350,
at 358.
Upon an independent review of the record in this case,
I concur in the result.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurs in this opinion.

"We do not grant a certiorari to review evidence and
discuss specific facts." United States v. Johnston, 268

practice of the Court in abstaining from exercising its
certiorari jurisdiction for the purpose of reviewing facts
and weighing evidence in relation to them. This practice obviously derived from the Evarts Act of 1891, by
which Congress established intermediate courts of appeals to free this Court from reviewing the great mass
of federal litigation in order to enable the Nation's ultimate tribunal adequately to discharge its responsibility
for the wise adjudication of cases "involving principles
the settlement of which is of importance to the public as
distinguished from that of the parties," Layne & Bowler
Corp. v. Western Well Works, Inc., 261 U. S. *387, 393.
Since Mr. Chief Justice Taft announced this for the Court
in 1923, cases of obvious public importance demanding the Court's attention have increased in number
and difficulty. The practice of not taking cases turning
solely on the evaluation of evidence has been consistently
adhered to, barring an occasional sport like Dick v. New
York Life Insurance Co., 359 U. S. 437, except in the
special class of cases arising under the Federal Employers'
Liability Act and its twin, the Jones Act. The fluctuating
interest in this special class of cases by the necessary
number of Justices for granting certiorari, first on behalf
of employers, see Frankfurter and Landis, The Business
of the Supreme Court (1928), 207-209, and more recently
on behalf of employees, has disregarded the normal
practice.
The oral argument overwhelmingly confirmed what the
petition had already made clear, that this is the kind of
case which, in the language of my Brother STEWART, does
not "belong in this Court." To entertain the case merely
because argument has been had does not lessen the disregard of the Court's practice, formulated in Rule 19.
The Court has in scores of cases dismissed the writ of
certiorari even after oral argument, when the true basis
for a certiorari was lacking. Even in criminal cases

involving sentences of life imprisonment this practice has
been followed. See Triplett v. Iowa, 357 U. S. 217;
Joseph v. Indiana, 359 U. S. 117. Again to-quote Mr.
Chief Justice Taft in Layne & Bowler Corp. v. Western
Well Works, Inc., supra, at 393, "it is very important that
we be consistent in not granting the writ of certiorari . . . ." As a general practice the Court does not
review cases involving merely individualized circumstances not unlike the type of factual situations arising in
the application of the Federal Employers' Liability Act
and the Jones Act. Since this case does not "belong
in this Court," to have brought it here was an undue exercise of judicial discretion. Accordingly, I would dismiss
the writ as improvidently granted. See my opinion in
Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524.
