MR.

JUSTICE

CLARK,

whom MR.

JUSTICE

HARLAN,

join,
dissenting.
I have concluded that Harris Truck Lines v. Cherry
Meat Packers, 371 U. S. 215 (1962), should be confined
to its peculiar facts, i. e., a finding of "excusable neglect"
under Rule 73 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. I say this, although I joined Harris, because
the Court has used Harris to spawn the present hopeless confusion which I never contemplated at the time
of its decision. Harris was the authority upon which
the Court rested Thompson v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 375 U. S. 384 (1964), despite the
fact that Thompson involved Rules 52 (b) and 59 (b)
and (e) with their specific requirements that the motion
must be made or served not later than 10 days after the
MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE WHITE

CLARK,

J., dissenting.

376 U. S.

entry of judgment. The Court brushed aside these express and unambiguous mandates of Congress with the
assertion that Thompson "fits squarely within the letter
and spirit of Harris." 375 U. S. 384, 387. And now
comes a third case, involving the same Rule 59 (b), which
further compounds the subversion of the rules. It
appears clear to me that through Harris this Court has
given trial judges the de facto power to grant extensions
of time, directly contra to the definite requirements of
Rules 52 (b) and 59 and the command of Rule 6 (b) that
the court "may not extend the time for taking any action
under rules . . . 52 (b), 59 (b), (d) and (e) . . . ." I
therefore respectfully dissent.
