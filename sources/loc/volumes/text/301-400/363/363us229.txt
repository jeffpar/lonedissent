UNITED STATES v. GRAND RIVER DAM
AUTHORITY.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 503. Argued May 17, 1960Decided June 13, 1960.
Respondent is an agency of the State of Oklahoma created to develop
hydroelectric power on the Grand River, a nonnavigable tributary
of the navigable Arkansas River. It proposed a river development
plan at Pensacola, Markham Ferry and Ft. Gibson, all sites on the
Grand River, and, under license from the Federal Power Commission, completed, a project at Pensacola in 1940. Subsequently, by
the Flood Control Act of 1941, Congress incorporated the Grand
River plan into a comprehensive plan for regulation of navigation,
control of floods and production of power on the Arkansas River
and its tributaries; and the United States constructed a project
at Ft. Gibson, in connection with which it compensated respondent
for a condemned tract of land, flowage rights over its lands and
relocation of its transmission lines. Respondent sued in the Court
of Claims for additional compensation for the "taking" of its water
power rights at Ft. Gibson and its franchise to develop electric
power and energy at that site. Held: Respondent is not entitled
to recover. It failed to show that it had any rights in the flow of
the river. The United States had the superior right under the
Commerce Clause to build the Ft. Gibson project itself to protect
the navigable capacity of the Arkansas River, and the frustration
of respondent's plans and expectations which resulted when the
United States chose to do so did not take property from respondent
in the sense of the.Fifth Amendment. Pp. 230-236.

Opinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,
announced by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.
Grand River is a nonnavigable tributary of the navigable Arkansas River and flows through Oklahoma. Respondent was created by the Oklahoma Legislature to
develop hydroelectric power on the Grand River. It is,
to use the statutory language of the law creating it, "a
governmental agency and body politic and corporAte."
Session Laws of Oklahoma, 1935, c. 70, Art. 4, ยง 1. A
report of the Army Corps of Engineers, made in 1930,
indicated that federal development at Pensacola, Markham Ferry, and Ft. Gibson-all sites on the Grand Riverwas not then economically justified.1 Respondent, following its creation in 1935, proposed a river development
plan at these three sites. In 1939 the Army Engineers
recommended a three-dam coordinated project as a federal undertaking.! Congress by the Flood Control Act
of August 18, 1941,1 incorporated that Grand River plan
into a comprehensive plan for the Arkansas River basin.
Meanwhile respondent obtained a license under ยง 23 (b)
of the Federal Power Act ' to build and operate a project
at Pensacola and completed it in 1940. The United States
took over the operation of this project during World
War II, after which it was returned to respondent. In
1946 the United States started the construction of a project at Ft. Gibson. It has been completed as an in-tegral
part of a comprehensive plan for the regulation of navigation, the control of floods, and the production of power. on
the Arkansas River and its tributaries. Congress, by
modifying its plan for the Arkansas River basin,5 cleared

Opinion of the Court.

the way for respondent to obtain from the Federal Power
Commission a license for a project-at Markham Ferry.
Thus the United States operates the Ft. Gibson project
which is the farthest downstream, while the respondent has the two upstream projects. A 70-acre tract
owned by the respondent was condemned when the Ft.
Gibson project was built; flowage rights over its lands
were acquired; and payment was made for relocation of
its transmission lines. Respondent claimed more. It demanded of the United States $10,000,000 for the "taking"
of its water power iights at Ft. Gibson and its franchise
to develop electric power and energy at that site." The
7Court of Claims, while reserving the question as to the
amount of compensation due, held by a divided vote that

the United States was liable. Supp. 153. The case is here on a writ of certiorari. 361
U. S.922.
The Court of Claims recognized that if the Grand River
were a navigable stream the United States would not be
liable for depriving another entrepreneur of the opportunity to utilize the flow of the water to produce power.
Our cases hold that such an interest is not compensable
because when the United States asserts its superior authority under the Commerce Clause to utilize br regulate
the flow of the water of a navigable stream there is no
"taking" of "property'! in the sense of the Fifth Amend-,
ment because the United' States has a superior navigation
easement which precludes private ownership of the water

Severance damages, storage and headwater benefits accruing to
Ft. Gibson from the Pensacola unit, the cost and value of surveys,
plans, and specifications for the Ft. Gibson unit, the loss of the
use and value of lands and rights-of-way acquired for the interconnection of' the Ft. Gibson unit with respondent's system and
for the .distribution of power from Ft. Gibson were also claimed.
But these claims were denied by the Court of Claims and no review
of that denial has been sought here.

or its flow. See United States v. Chandler-DunbarCo.,
229 U. S. 53, 69; United States v. Twin City Power Co.,
350 U. S. 222, 224-225. The Government contends that
the navigational servitude of the United States extends
also to nonnavigable waters, pre-empting state-created
property rights in such waters, at least when asserted
against the Government. In the view we take in this
case, however, it is not necessary that we reach that
contention. Congress by the 1941 Act, already mentioned, 7 adopted as one work of improvement "for the
benefit of navigation and the control of destructive floodwaters" the reservoirs in the Grand River. That action
to protect the "navigable capacity" of the Arkansas
River (United States v. Iiio Grande Irrigation Co., 174
U. S. 690, 708) was within the constitutional power of
Congress. We held in Oklahoma v. Atkinson Co., 313
U. S. 508, that the United States over the objection of
Oklahoma could build the Denison Dam on the Red River,
also nonnavigable, but a tributary of the Mississippi. We
there stated, "There is no constitutional reason why Congress cannot, under the commerce power, treat the watersheds as a key to flood control on navigable streams and
their tributaries." Id., at 525. And see United States v.
Appalachian Power Co., 311 U. S. 377, 426; Grand River
Dam Authority v. Grand-Hydro,335 U. S. 359, 373. We
also said in Oklahoma v. Atkinson Co., supra, that
". .. the power of flood control extends to the tributaries
of navigable streams." Id., at 525. We added, "It is for
Congress alone to- decide whether a particular project, by
itself or as part of a more comprehensive scheme, will have
such a beneficial effect on the arteries of interstate commerce as to warrant it. That determination is legislative
in character." Id., at 527. We held that the fact that
the project had a multiple purpose was irrelevant to the

constitutional issue, id., at 528-534, as was the fact that
power was expected to pay the way. Id., at 533. "[T]he
fact that ends other than flood control will also be
served, or that flood control may be relatively of lesser
importance, does not invalidate (he exercise of the authority conferred on Congress." Id., at 533-534.
We cannot say on this record that the Ft. Gibson dam
is any less essential or useful or desirable from the viewpoint of flood control and navigation than was Denison
Dam." When the United States appropriates the flow
either of a navigable or a nonnavigable stream pursuant
to its superior power under the Commerce Clause, it is exercising established prerogatives and is beholden to no one.
Plainly under our decisions it could license another to
build the project and operate it. If respondent sued for
damages for failure of the Federal Government to grant it
a license to build the Ft. Gibson project, it could not claim
that something of right had been withheld from it. So it
is when the United States exercises its prerogative by
building the project itself.'
Respondent, however, argues that it had a vested interest in the waters of the Grand River and points to the
grant made by Oklahoma to it for the development of
hydroelectric power on the Grand River. It seeks to
trace the title of Oklahoma through the Cherokees who, in
consideration of their agreement to remove to the territory which included the Grand River, received on December 31, 1838, a deed from the United States to the
1 The findings are "There is storage capacity between elevation 554
and elevation 582 that is reserved for the control of flood waters."
' No riparian land is involved, and it cannot be claimed as was
asserted in United States v. Kelly, 243 U. S. 316, 330, that in substance there was a taking of land. And see United States v. Willow
River Co., 324 U. S. 499, 507, which narrowly confined the holding in
the Kelly case.

territory.'" By ยง 15 of the Act of March 3, 1893, 27 Stat.
612, 645, Congress agreed that this Cherokee land could
be allotted to the members of the nation in severalty.
The argument is that the United States had divested
itself entirely of any rights in the water of the Grand River
prior to Oklahoma's admission as a State in 1907. Assuming, arguendo, that that is true, respondent's claim is not
advanced. In dealing with a grant by the United States
to the Osage Indians over a nonnavigable stretch of the
Arkansas River the Court in Brewer Oil Co. v. United
States, 260 U. S. 77, 87-88, said:
"The title of the Indians grows out of a federal
grant when the Federal Government had complete
sovereignty over the territory in question. Oklahoma when she came into the Union took sovereignty
over the public lands in the condition of ownership
as they were then, angd, if the bed of a non-navigable
stream had then become the property of the Osages,
there was nothing in the admission of Oklahoma into
a constitutional equality of power with other States
which required or permitted a divesting of the title."
Respondent argues that if any rights in the waters of the
Grand River remained in the United States after the grant
to the Indians in 1838, rights over them were later given
to Oklahoma. The reference is to ยง 25 of the Ac of April
26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137, 146, which granted light and power
companies the right to construct dams across nonnavigable
streams in Cherokee territory for power and other purposes. The right to acquire or condemn property was
granted the companies in prescribed situations "subject to
approval by the Secretary of the Interior." And ยง 25
contained at the end a proviso critical to respondent's
case and, reading as follows: "Provided, That all rights

granted hereunder shall be subject to the control of
the future Territory or State within which the Indian
Territory may be situated." But this Act was no more
than a regulatory measure. It did not purport to grant
title to waters and appurtenant lands. The 1906 Act
was an assertion of power possessed by the Federal
Government to regulate Indian territory. Moreover,
no water rights condemned under this Act are shown
to have passed to Oklahoma and from Oklahoma to re-spondent. Yet the Federal Government was the initial
proprietor in these western lands and any claim by a State
or by others must derive from this federal title. See
United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co., 339 U. S. 725,
747; Federal Power Comm'n v. Oregon, 349 U. S. 435.
Congress has made various grants or conveyances or by
statute recognized certain appropriations of lands or waters in the public domain made through machinery of the
States. United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co., supra,
at 747-748; Federal Power Comm'n v. Oregon, supra, at
446-448. Yet the only Federal Act on which reliance is
based by respondent for the grant of these water rights
to Oklahoma is ยง 25 of the Act of April 26, 1906. As we
have seen, that was a regulatory measure through which
title might be obtained; but no water rights under it
were acquired by a light or power company which is now
asserted to be in respondent's chain of title. If the 1906
Act be less clear than we believe, nevertheless the construction urged by respondent would be precluded by the
principle that all federal grants are construed in favor of
the Government lest they be enlarged to include more
than what was expressly included. See United States v.
Union Pacific R. Co., 353 U. S. 112, 116.
Respondent argues that since Oklahoma gave it rights
to the waters of the Grand River, it has a compensable
interest in them under the decision in Federal Power
Comm'n v. NiagaraMohawk Power Corp., 347 U. S. 239.

OCTOBER TERM, 1959.

That decision merely held that the Federal Power Act
treats "usufructuary water rights like other property
rights," id., at 251, making it necessary for a licensee to
compensate the claimant for them. Here no licensee
claims under the Federal Act; the United States builds the
project on its own account.
The Court of Claims erred in failing to distinguish between an appropriation of property and the frustration of
an enterprise by reason of the exercise of a superior governmental power. Here respondent has done no more
than prove that a prospective business opportunity was
lost. More than that is necessary as Omnia Co. v. United
States, 261 U. S. 502, holds. In that case the claimant
stood to make large profits from a contract it had with a
steel company. But the United States, pursuant to the
War Power, requisitioned the company's entire steel
production. Suit was brought in the Court of-Claims for
just compensation. The Court, after pointing out that
many laws and rulings of Government reduce the value
of property held by individuals, noted that there the Government did not appropriate what the claimant owned
but Only ended his opportunity to exploit a contract.
"Frustration and appropriation are essentially different
things.." Id., at 513. And see Mitchell v. United States,
267 U. S. 341, 345; United States ex rel. T. V. A. v. Powelson, 319 U. S. 266, 281-283. No more'need be said here.
In conclusion, the United States did not appropriate
any business, contract, land, or property of respondent.
It had the superior right by reason of the Commerce
Clause to build the Ft. Gibson project itself or to license
another to do it. The frustration of respondent's plans
and expectations which resulted when the United States
chose to undertake the project on its own account did not
take property from respondent in the sense of the Fifth
Amendment.
