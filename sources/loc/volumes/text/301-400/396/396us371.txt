whom MR.

JUSTICE

While I am of the view this appeal should be dismissed, I deem it appropriate to explain the basis for
my conclusion since the issue tendered by appellantwhether symbolic expression by displaying a "mutilated"
American flag is protected from punishment by the
Fourteenth Amendment-is one that I cannot regard as
insubstantial. See Street v. New York, 394 U. S. 576,
594 (1969).
The record before us is not in my judgment suitable
for considering this broad question as it does not adequately flush the narrower and predicate issue of whether
there is a recognizable communicative aspect to appellant's conduct which appears to have consisted merely
of wearing a vest fashioned out of a cut-up American
flag. Such a question, not insubstantial of itself, has
been pretermitted in the Court's previous so-called

OCTOBER TERM, 1969

"symbolic speech" cases where the communicative content of the conduct was beyond dispute. See Tinker v.
Des Moines School District, 393 U. S. 503 (1969); Gregory v. City of Chicago, 394 U. S. 111 (1969); Brown v.
Louisiana, 383 U. S. 131 (1966); Bell v. Maryland, 378
U. S. 226 (1964); Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U. S. 157,
201 (concurring in judgment) (1961); West Virginia
State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 632
(1943); see generally Note, Symbolic Conduct, 68 Col. L.
Rev. 1091 (1968). The Court has, as yet, not established
a test for determining at what point conduct becomes so
intertwined with expression that it becomes necessary to
weigh the State's interest in proscribing conduct against
the constitutionally protected interest in freedom of
expression.*
While appellant contends that his conduct conveyed
a symbolic message, the stipulated statement of facts on
which this case comes to us suggests that the issue was
not, in the first instance, determined as a factual matter
by the trial court. Further, there is no indication that
appellant either presented evidence on this question at
trial or urged any standard at trial for determining that
issue. I would therefore dismiss this appeal based on
the inadequacy of the record for deciding the question
presented. Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U. S.
549 (1947); DeBacker v. Brainard,ante, p. 28.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

is of the opinion that probable

jurisdiction should be noted.
*Chief Justice Warren, writing for the majority in United States
v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376 (1968), said: "We cannot accept the
view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled
'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby
to express an idea." The Court went on, however, to take judicial
notice of the symbolic significance of draft-card burning which had
become a recognized way of protesting the draft and American
involvement in Vietnam.
