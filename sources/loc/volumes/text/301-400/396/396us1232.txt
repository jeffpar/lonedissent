OCTOBER TERM, 1969
Opinion in Chambers

396 U. S.

UNITED STATES EX REL. CERULLO v.
FOLLETTE, WARDEN
ON APPLICATION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE PETITION
FOR CERTIORARI; MOTION FOR STAY; AND APPLICATION
FOR BAIL PENDING PETITION FOR CERTIORARI

Decided October 16, 1969
Time extension for filing petition for certiorari denied since sufficient
time remains for that purpose. Stay of Court of Appeals mandate
denied as that mandate has already issued. Application for bail
pending action on petition for certiorari is denied since initial
ruling on such an application should be made by Court of Appeals,
to which request may be made under Fed. Rule App. Proc. 23 (b).
See: 393 F. 2d 879 and 294 F. Supp. 1283.

Memorandum of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, Circuit Justice.
Applicant requests an extension of time to file a petition for certiorari. Since, in the posture of this case,
his time for filing will not expire until December 31,
1969, I perceive no necessity for an extension at this
stage. No reason appears why the time remaining will
not be sufficient for the preparation and filing of a petition for certiorari.
Applicant also requests a stay of the mandate of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and continuance of bail pending determination of his petition for
certiorari. Pursuant to the opinion of the Court of
Appeals, the mandate has already issued. Treating the
papers as an application for bail pending action on the
petition, I note that there is no sign that applicant has
made a request to the Court of Appeals, as he may under
Fed. Rule App. Proc. 23 (b). In my view that court
should have an opportunity to consider applicant's request before it is entertained by a Justice of this Court.
Cf. U. S. Sup. Ct. Rule 27.
