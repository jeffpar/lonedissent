Per Curiam

ALABAMA v. FINCH, SECRETARY OF HEALTH,
EDUCATION, AND WELFARE, ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE BILL OF COMPLAINT

No. 38, Orig.

Decided February 2, 1970

State of Alabama's motion for leave to file complaint invoking
Court's original jurisdiction fails to state claim warranting exercise

of such jurisdiction.
Motion denied.

Albert P. Brewer, Governor of Alabama, Daniel J.
Meador, and Maury D. Smith on the motion.
PER CUTRIAM.

On January 26, 1970, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking leave to file a complaint invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court naming Robert Finch, as Secretary
of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,
and John N. Mitchell, as Attorney General of the United
States, as defendants.
The alleged emergent nature of the claims for relief
led the Court to give expedited consideration to the
motion and proffered complaint and, having examined
the complaint, we conclude it fails to state a claim against
either of the defendants warranting the exercise of the
original jurisdiction of this Court.
Accordingly, the motion for leave to file the said
complaint is denied.
