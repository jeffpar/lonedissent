MISSISSIPPI v. FINCH, SECRETARY OF HEALTH,

EDUCATION, AND WELFARE,

ET AL.

ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE BILL OF COMPLAINT

No. 39, Orig. Decided February 2, 1970
State of Mississippi's motion for leave to file complaint invoking
Court's original jurisdiction fails to state claim warranting exercise
of such jurisdiction.
Motion denied.

John Bell Williams, Governor of Mississippi, A. F.
Summer, Attorney General, and William A. Allain,
Assistant Attorney General, on the motion.
PER CURIAM.

On February 2, 1970, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking leave to file a complaint invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court naming Robert Finch, individually
and as Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and John N. Mitchell, individually
and as Attorney General of the United States, as
defendants.
The alleged emergent nature of the claims for relief
led the Court to give expedited consideration to the
motion and proffered complaint and, having examined
the complaint, we conclude it fails to state a claim against
either of the defendants warranting the exercise of the
original jurisdiction of this Court.
Accordingly, the motion for leave to file the said complaint is denied.
MR. JUsTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration
or decision of this motion.
