N. A. A. C. P. v. BENNETT.
360 U. S.

Per Curiam.

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE, INC., v.
BENNETT, ATTORNEY GENERAL
OF ARKANSAS, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.

No. 757.

Decided June 22, 1959.

Case challenging constitutionality of state statute should not automatically be referred by federal district court to state courts for
construction of statute.

Robert 0. Carter and Herbert 0. Reid for appellant.
PER CURIAM.

When the validity of a state statute, challenged under
the United States Constitution, is properly for adjudication before a United States District Court, reference to
the state courts for construction of the statute should
not automatically be made. The judgment is vacated
and the case is remanded to the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas for consideration in light of Harrisonv. N. A. A. C. P., ante, p. 167.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur, dissenting.

While I agree that the case should be remanded to the
District Court, I think that court should be directed to
pass on the constitutional issues presented without prior
reference to the state courts. My reasons are stated in
my dissent in Harrison v. N. A. A. C. P., ante, p. 179.
