IOANNOU v. NEW YORK

391 U. S.
ET AL.

ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A PETITION FOR REHEARING.

No. 191, October Term, 1962.

Decided June 3, 1968.

371 U. S. 30, motion for leave to file petition for rehearing denied.

Sydney J. Schwartz on the motion.
Louisi J. Lefkowitz, Attorney General of New York,
atnd Daniel M. Cohen, Assistant Attorney General, in
opposition.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to file a petition for rehearing
is denied upon the representation of the Attorney General of New York that the movant may file a new application "to withdraw the funds deposited with the New
York City Treasurer", in the light of changed ciFcumstances. See Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U. S. 429; Goldstein
v. Cox, 389 U. S. 581.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.

Since the only changed circumstances concern the intervening decision of this Court in Zschernig v. Miller,
389 U. S. 429, and since the rationale of that decision
applies to custodial statutes such as New York has as
well as to escheat statutes like Oregon's, I would dispose
of the case hcre and now (either after or without oral
argument) and not require petitioner to retravel once
more the long, arduous, and expensive path from New
York's surrogate court.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN would deny unconditionally the

motion for leave to file a petition for rehearing, substantially for the reasons given in his dissenting opinion in
United States v. Ohio Power Co., 353 U. S. 98, 99.
MR. JUSTICE FORTAS and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL took

no part in the consideration or decision of this motion.
