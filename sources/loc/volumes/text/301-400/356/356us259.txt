v. P. G. LAKE, INC.,

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 108.

Argued March 11, 1958.-Decided April 14, 1958.

1. In each of the five cases here considered together,, the taxpayer
received present consideration for assignment of a so-called oil
payment right (or sulphur payment right) carved out by the
taxpayer from a larger mineral interest producing income taxable
as ordinary income, subject to a depletion deduction. Held: The
consideration received for the assignment was taxable as ordinary
income, subject to a depletion deduction, and not as k long-term
,capital gain under ยง 117 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
Pp. 261-267.
(a) The, present consideration received by the' taxpayer was
paid for the right to receive future income, not for an increase in
the value of-the income-producing property. Pp. 264-267.
(b) An earlier administrative practice (reversed in 1946) contrary to this holding will not be presumed t6 have been known to
Congress and incorporated into the law by re-enactment, because
it was .not reflected in any published iuling or regulation. P. 265,
n. 5.
(c) Moreover, prior administrative practice is.always subject to
change through exercise by the -administrative agency of its
continuing rule-making power. -P. 265, n. 5.
2. In the Fleming case, the taxpayers exchanged 6il payment rights
for fee simple interests in real estate. Held: This did not constitute a tax-free exchange of. property. of like kind within the meaning of ยง 112 (b) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code. of 1939. Pp.
267-268...
241 F. 2d 65, 69, 71, 78, 84, reversed.
