TANK TRUCK RENTALS, INC., v.
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 109.

Argued January 29-30, 1958.-Decided March 17, 1958.

Fines imposed on, and paid/by, the owners of tank trucks (and their
drivers, who are reimbursed by the owners) for violations of state
maximum weight laws are not deductible by the truck owners as
"ordinary and necessary" business expenses under § 23 (a) (1) (A)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, either (a) when commercial
practicalities cause the truck owners to violate such state laws
deliberately at the calculated risk of being detected and fined, or
(b) when the violati-nsare unintentional. Pp. 31-37.
(a) A finding that an expense is "necessary" cannot be made if
allowance of the deduction would frustrate sharply defined national
or state policies proscribing particular types of conduct, evidenced
by some governmental declaration thereof. Pp. 33-34.
(b) The fines here concern the policy of several States, "evidenced" by penal statutes enacted to protect their highways
from damage and to insure the safety of all persons using them.
P. 34.
(c) Assessment of the fines here involved was punitive action
and not' a mere toll for the use of the highways. Pp. 34,36.
(d) In allowing deductions for income tax purposes, Congress
did not intend to encourage" business enterprises to violate the
declared policy of a State. P. 35.
(e) The rule as to frustration of sharply defined national or
state policies is not absolute. Each case turns on its own facts,
and the test of .nondeductibility is the severity and immediacy
of the frustration resulting from allowance of the deduction.
P. 35.
. (f) To permit the deduction of fines and penalties imposed
by
a State for violations of its laws would frustrate state policy in
severe and direct fashion by reducing th6 "sting" of the penalties.
Pp. 35-36.

Opinion of the Court.
(g) Since the maximum weight
statutes make no distinction
between innocent and willful violators, state policy is as much
thwarted in the case of unintentional violations as it iE in the case
of willful violations. Pp. 36-37.
242 F. 2d 14; affirmed.

Leonard Sarner argued the cause for petitioner. With
him on the brief was Paul A. Wolkin.
Solicitor General Rankin argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Assistant Attorney
General Rice, Joseph F. Goetten and Meyer Rothwacks.
MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.

In 1951 petitioner Tank Truck Rentals paid several
hundred fines imposed on it and its drivers for violations
of state maximum weight laws. This case involves the
-deductibility of those payments as "ordinary and necessary" business expenses under' § 23 (a) (1) (A) of the
Int;ernal Revenue Code of 1939.1 Prior to 1950 the Commissioner had permitted such deductions,2 but a change of
policy that year' caused petitioner's expenditures to be
disallowed. The Tax Court, reasoning that allowance of
the deduction would frustrate sharply defined state policy
expressed in the maximum weight laws, upheld the Commissioner. 26 T. C. 427. The Court of Appeals affirmed
on the same ground, 242 F. 2d 14, and we granted
"SEC. 23. DEDUCTIONS FROM GROSS INCOME.

certiorari. 354 U. S. 920 (1957)., In our- view, the
deductions properly were disallowed.
Petitioner, a Pennsylvania corporation; owns a fleet' of
tank trucks which it leases, with.drivers, to motor carriers
for transportation of bulk liquids. The lessees operate
the trucks throughout Pennsylvania and the surrounding
States of New Jersey, Ohio, Delaw.re, West Virginia,
and Maryland, with nearly all the shipments originating
or terminating in Pennsylvania. In 1951, the tax year in
question, each of these States-imposed maximum weight
limits for motor vehicles operating on its highways.'
Pennsylvania'restricted truckers to 45,000 pounds, however, while the other States through which petitioner
operated allowed maximum weights approximating 60,000
pounds. It is uncontested that trucking operations were
Sso hindered by this situation that neither petitioner nor
other 'bfilk liquid truckers could operate profitably. and
also observe the Pennsylvania law. -Petitioner's equipment consisted largely of 4,500- to 5,000-gallon tanks, and
'the industry rate structure generally was predicated on
fully loaded use of equipment of that'capacity. Yet only
one of the commonly carried liquids weighed.ittle enough
that a fully loaded truck could satisfy, the Pennsylvania
statute. Operation of partially loaded trucks, however,
not only wculd have created safety hazards, but also would
have been economically impossible for any carrier so long
as the rest of the industry continued capacity loading.
And the industry as a whole could not operate on a partial
load basis without driving shippers to competing forms

of transportation. The only other alternative, use of
smaller tanks, also was commercially impracticable, not
only because of initial replacement costs but even more
so because of reduced revenue and increased operating
expense, since the rates charged were based on the number
of gallons transported per mile.
Confronted by this dilemma, the industry deliberately
operated its trucks overweight in Pennsylvania in the
hope, and at the calculated risk, of escaping the notice of
the state and local police. -This conduct also constituted
willful violations in- New Jersey, for reciprocity provisions of the New Jersey statute subjected trucks registered in Pennsylvania to Pennsylvania weight restrictions
while traveling in New Jersey.5 In the remainder of the
States in which petitioner operated, it suffered overweight
fines for several 'unintentional violations, such as those
caused by temperature changes in transit. During the
tax year 1951, petitioner paid a total of $41,060.84 in fines
hnd* costs for 718 willful and 28 innocent violations.
Deduction of that amount in petitioner's 1951 tax return'
was disallowed by the Commissioner.
It is clear that the Congress intended the income tax
laws "to tax-earnings and profits less expenses and losses,"
Higgins v. Smith, 308 U.,S. 473, 477 (1940), carrying out
a broad basic policy of taxing "net, not . 2. gross, income ... ." McDonald v. COmmissioner; 323 U.S. 57,
66-67 (1944). Equally well established is the rule that
deductibility under § 23 (a) (1) (A) is limited to expenses
-that are both ordinaryand necessary to carrying on the
taxpayer's business. Deputy v. du Pont, 308 U. S. 488,
497 '(1940). :A finding of "necessity" cannot be made,
however, if allowance of the deduction would frustrate

320 U. S. 467, 473 (1943); see Lilly v. Commissioner, 343
U. S.90, 97 (1952). This ruIe was foreshadowed in Textile Mills Securities Corp. v. Commissioner, 314 U. S.326
(1941), where the Court, finding no congressional intent
to the contrary, upheld the validity of an income tax regulation reflecting an administrative distinction "between"
legitimate business expenses and thiose arising from that
family of contracts to which the law has given no sanction." 314 U. S., at 339. Significant reference was made
in Heininger to the very situation now before us; the
Court stated, "Where a taxpayer has violated a federal or
a state statute and incurred a fine or penalty he has not
been permitted a tax deduction for its payment." 320
U. S., at 473.
Here we are concerned with the policy of several States
"evidenced" by penal statutes enacted to protect their
highways from damage and to insure the safety of all
persons using them.' -Petitioner and its drivers have violated these laws and have been sentenced to pay the fines
here claimed as income tax deductions
It is clear that
assessment of the fines was punitive action and not a mere
toll for use of the highways: the fines occurred only in the
exceptional instance when' the overweight run was detected by the police. Petitioner's -failure to comply with
the state laws obviofisly was based on a balancing of the
6 Because state policy in this .case was evidenced by specific
legislation, it is unnecessary to decide whether the requisite "governmental declaration" might exist other than in an Act of the
Legislature. See Schwartz, Business Expenses Contrary To Public
Policy, 8 Tax L. Rev. 241, 248.
7 Unlike the rest of the States, Pennsylvania imposed the fines on
the driver rather than on the owner of the trucks. In each instance,
however, the driver was petitioner's employee, and petitioner paid
the fines as a matter of course, being bound to do so by its collective
bargaining agreement with the union representing the drivers.

cost of compliance against the chance of detection. Such
•a pourse cannot be sanctioned, for judicial deference to
state action requires, whenever possible, that a State not
be thwarted in its policy. We will not presume hat the
Congress, in allowing deductions for income tax purposes,
intended to encourage a business enterprise to violate
the declared policy of a State. . To allow the deduction
sought here would but encourage continued violations of
state law by increasing the odds in favor of noncompliance. This could only tend to destroy the effectiveness
of the State's maximum weight laws.
This is nct to say that the rule as to frustration of
sharply defined national or state policies is to be viewed
or applied in afiy absolute sense. "It- has never been
thought . . .that the mere fact that an expenditure
bears a remote relation to an illegal act makes it nondeductible." Commissioner v. Heininger, supra, ,t 474.
Although each case must turn on its own facts, Jerry
Rossman Corp. v. Commissioner, 175 F. 2d 711, 713, the
.test of nondeductibility always is'the severity and immediacy of the frustration xesulting from allowance of the
deduction. The flexibility of such a standard isnecessary
if we are to accommodate both the coigressional- intent
to tax only net income, aid the presumption against congressional intent to encourage violation of declared public
policy.,
Certainly the frustration of state policy. is most com-

-

plete anfd direct wheni the expenditure for which deduction is sought is itself prohibited by statute. See Boyle,
Flagg & Seaman, Inc., v. Commissioner, 25 T. C. -43. If
the expenditure is not itself an illegal act, but rather the
payment of a penalty imposed: By tge State because of
such aft act, as in the present case, the frustrati6br attend'
ant upon deduction would-be only slightly less remote,.
And would clearly fall within the line of disallowance.

to frustrate state policy in severe and direct fashion by
reducing the "sting" of the penalty prescribed by the
state legislature.'
There is no merit to petitioner's argument that the fines
imposed lere were not penalties at all, but merely a
revenue toll. It is true that the Pennsylvania statute
provides for purchase of a single-trip, permit by an overweighted trucker; that its provision for forcing removal
of the excess weight at the discretion of the police authorities apparently was never enforced; and that the fines
were devoted by statute to road repair within the'municipality or township where the trucker was apprehended.
Moreover, the Pennsylvania statute was amended in
1955, 9 raising the maximum weight restriction to 60,000
pounds, makingmandatory the removal of the excess, and
graduating the amount of the fine by the number of
pounds that the truck was overweight. These considerations, however, do not change the fact that the truckers
were fined by the State as a penal measure when and if
they were apprehended by the police.
Finally,- petitioner contends that deduction of the fines
at least for the innocent violations will not frustrate state
policy. But since the maximum weight statutes make
no distinction between innocent and willful violators,
state policy is as much thwarted in the one instance as in
the other. Petitioner's reliance on Jerry Rossman Corp.
v. Oommissioner, supra, is misplaced. Deductions were

allowed the taxpayer in that case for amounts inadvertently collected by him as OPA overcharges and tlen
paid over to the Government, but the allowance was based
on the fact that the Admiistrator, in applying the Act,
had differentiated between willful and innocent violators.
No such differentiation exists here, either in the application or the literal language of the state maximum weight
laws.
