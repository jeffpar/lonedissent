PER CURIAM.

It was stipulated by the parties in the District Court
that the sole question for decision is whether petitioner
;s entitled to have his application for suspension of
deportation considered under § 244 (a) (1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 163, 214;
8 U. S. C. § 1254 (a) (1)). We hold that petitioner is'so
entitled. The judgment of the Court of Appeals (244 F.
2d 178) is therefore vacated and the cause is remanded to
the District Court with directiofis to enter an appropriate
judgment declaring that petitioner is entitled to have his
application for suspension- of *deportation. considered
by the United States Immigration and Naturalization
Service under § 244 (a) (1).
So ordered.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR' JUSTICE CLARK joins,
would dismis's the writ for lack of jurisdiction. In his

view the record fails to disclose a justiciable case or controversy because (1) the undisturbed administrative
finding that petitioner "does not meet the requirement
trat his deportation [would] r6sult in exceptional and
extremely unusual hardship to himself," establishes that
petitioner is not entitled to suspension 'of deportation'
under either subdivision (a) (1) or (a)-(5) of, 244 of the
]mmigration and Nationality Act of 1952; and (2) the
parties' stipulation in the District Court is ineffective*to
confer jurisdiction on this Court to decide the question
sought to be preseflted. See Swift & Co.-v. Hocking Valley R. Co., 243 U. S. 281, '289; Aetna Life, Ins. Co..v,
Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 240-241. In holding on.thig.
record that subdivision (a)(1) governs petitioner's oas
he Court has, in his view, rendered what ii effect is an'
advisory opinion.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER would join MR. JusTICE
HARLAN if he read the record to be as clear as the latter

finds it to be. Being in sufficient doubt about the scope
and meaning of the stipulation, he joins the Court's
opinion. This leaves open, on the remand, the administrative determination of the issues under §244 (a)(1).
