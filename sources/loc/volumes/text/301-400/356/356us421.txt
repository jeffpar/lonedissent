PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF UTAH
v. UNITED STATES ET AL.

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM-THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF UTAH.

No. 15. Argued December 9, 1957.-Decided May 19, 1958.
In a proceeding under § 13,(3) and (4) of the Interstate Commerce
Act, the Interstate 'Commerce Commission cofisidered the petition of railroatds operating in Utah for an increase in freight rates
on intrastate traffic in Utah, which had been denied by the Public
Se rvice Commission of Utah. After making findings patterned
after those approved in King v. United States, 344 U, S. 254, the
Interstate Commerce Commission concluded that the intrastaterates caused "undue, unreasonable, and unjust ,discrimination
against interstate commerce," and it issued an oider generally
applying to intrastate traffic in Utah the 15% increase previously granted gerleiJlly for interstate traffic. Appellants sued to
set aside the order but the District Court denied relief. Held:
Certain findings .of the Commission lack sufficidnt support in
the evidence; the judgment is reversed; and the cause is remanded to the District Court with instructions to set aside the
Commission's order and remand the cause to the Commission for
further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. Pp. 422-429.
(a) The Commission's finding that prevailing intrastate rates
were abnormally lo~W and failed to contribute a fair share to over-all
revenue Was not adequately supported by the evidence, since there
was no positive evidence'to indicate that the relative cost of intrastate traffic was as great as that of interstate shipments. Pp. 426427.
(b) To support its finding that intrastate conditions were not
more favorable than those incident to interstate transportation, the'
railroad evidence was far from substantial. Pp. 427-428.
(c) The findings contain no indication that the Commission concerned .itself with the revenues derived from, or the conditions
incident to, intrastate passenger operations, which must be taken
into consideration in arriving at a general intrastate freight level.

This appeal presents another clash between state and

87. The principal contention heie is' that the evidence
before the Commission .was insufficient to support its ultimate finding that existing intrastate rates caused "undue,
unreasonable, and unjust discrimination hgainst interstate commerce.". 297 I. C. C., at 105. A three-judge
District Court found against appellants on this- and
all, subsidiary issues. 146 F. Supp, 803. Upon direct
appeal, 28 U, S. C. § 1253, we noted probable jurisdiction.

Having concluded that certaih
findings of the Commission lack sufficient support in th6.
evidence, we reverse the judgment of the District Court.
The action of the Commission was. limited 'to. freight

State authorities in the enforcement of any provision of this part
or part III.

Opinion of the Court.

3561U. S.

the Commission had increased interstate freight rates on
a national basis by an aggregate of 15%.' The appellee
railroads applied to the Public. Service Commission of
Utah for a like increase in intrastate rates. After a full
hearing, the Utah Commission dismissed the-application
on the ground that the railroads had not produced evidence conicerning their intrastate operations as required
by Utah law. No appeal was taken. Instead, pursuant
to 49 U. S. C. § 13 (3) and (4), the railroads filed a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission which
led to the order under attack here. The Commission.
found the evidence insufficient to establish any undue
or unreasonable advantage, .preference,. or-prejudice as'
between persons or localities in intrastate conimerce;on
the one hand, and intersatt commerce on the other. But
in findings . patterned after those approved in"King v.
United States, 344 U. S. 254 (1952), it concluded that
the intrastate rates caused "undue, unreasonable, and
unjust discrhmintiob against.interstate commerce." 297
I. C. C., at 105. It sought to reniove this burden by generally applying to intrastate traffic the 15% interstate
increase previously granted in Ex Parte No. 175.1
Appellants aftack two findings of the Commission as
not being supported by substantial evidence. 'The first
*is that: existing intrastate rates were abnormally, low and
failed -to contribute their fair share of the revenue needs
of the railroads. Evidence was introduced to show that
some of Utah's intrastate rates were lower than corresponding interstate rates for like distances. No showing
was made, however, *of the comparative costs of perform2

decision on this phase of the case.

ing such services. The second finding under attack is
that the conditions incident to intrastate transportation
were not more favorable than those incident to interstate
movements. The evidence iinderlying this finding indicated only that goods moving intrastate were handled
precisely as were those in interstate transportation, being.
intermingled on the same trains.
Intrastate transportation is primarily the concern of
the State. Federal power exists in this area only when
intrastate tariffs are so low that an undue or unreasonable
advantage, preference, or prejudice is created as between'
persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one
hand and interstate commerce on the other, or whefiilbse
rates cast an undue burden on interstatd commerce.4
Proof of such must meet "a high standard of certainty,"
Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n, 245
U. S. 493, 510 -(1918); before a state rate can be nullified,
the justification for the exercise of federal power must
"clearly appear." Floridav. United Stdtes, 282 U. S. 194,
211-212 (1931). 'The Court pointed out in North Carolina v. United States, 325 U. S. 507, 511 (1945), that the
findings supporting such an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission must enconpass each .of the elements
essential to federal power. ' Thereafter, in King v. United
States, supra, we stressed the necessity of substantial evidence to support the findings, although we held it unnecessary "to establish for each item in each freight rate a
fully developed rate case." 344 U. S., at 275. In King,
however, the insufficiency of the findings rather thdn of
the evidence was urged upon the Court. Those findings,
which we held adequate to support an order increasing
intrastate rates, w'ere, inter alia, (1) that existing intrastate rates wefre abnormally low and did not contribute a
fair share of the railroads' revenue needs; (2) that condi4 See

tions as'to the movement of intrastate traffic were not more.
favorable than those existing'*in interstate commerce;
(3) that the rates cast an undue burden on interstate
commerce; -(4) that the increase ordered by the Commission would yield substantial revenues; and (5) that such
increase would not result in intrastate rates being unreasonable and would remove the existing discrimination
against interstate commerce. 344 U-.S., at 267-268i footnote 13. We also held in King that the Commission
might. give weight to deficits in-passenger revenue when
prescribing intrastate freight rates so as to meet over-all
revenue -needs. In our most recent review of federal
plower in this intrastate area, Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R.
Co. v. Illinois, 355 U. S. 300 (1958), we relied on the'
principles of the above cases in striking down an increase
in intrastate passenger fares for a suburba4 commuter
seryice because the Commission had failed to take into
account "the carrier's other intrastate revenues from
Illinois traffic, freight and passenger." 355 U. S., at 308.
We do not believe that the evidence here met the exact-ing stafidards required by our prior cases, As to the finding thai prevailing intrastate rates were abnormally low
and failed to 'contribute a fair share of over-all revenue,
we discover no positive evidence to indicat& that the
relative cost of intrastate traffic was as great as that of
interstate shipments. The absence of such evidence is
important, for it is not-enough to say that .interstate rates
were higher on similar shipments f6r like distances,
Florida'v. United States, supra, at 212, especially where,
as 'here, there was some indication that intrastate traffic
moved at lower cost than interstate. The annual reports
of the four interstate railroads operating in Utah showed
that their .Utah operating ratios (freight service cost
div ded by freight service revenue) and the Utah density
statistics (ton miles of traffic per mile of maifi track)
were more favorable than comparable system-wide fig-

Opinion of the Court.

ures. The Commission discredited the density statistics
because of the absefice of branch-line inclusion in the
totals. This was true, however, in the case of both Utah
and system-wide computations, leaving no apparent
foundation for the conclusion of unreliability.
Other evidence seemed to indicate that those railroads
with the larger percentages' of total operations within
Utah enjoyed higher rates of over-all return for 1953, the
year just prior to the hearings in this case. The Denver
& Rio Grande, with almost half of its entire operations
within Utah, showed a rate of return of 6.06%. The
Southern Pacific and Union Pacific, with substantially
smaller proportions of Utah operatiois, showed returns of
3.48% and 3.56%, respectively.
Statistics introduced by the railroads as to comparative economic conditions showed recent economic improvement to be greater percentagewise in the Weit and particularly in Utah than in other sections. The emkhasis
recently has switched from agriculture to industrial and
mining activity, with its .resulting increase in traffic-a
factor tending to suggest more favorable railroad operating conditions.
As to the finding that intrastate conditions were not
more favorable than those incident to interstate transportation, ' the railroad evidence on this point was far
from substantial. - In essence, it merbly showed that intrastate and interstate traffic was handled by the same crews
and intermingled in -the same movement.' This evidence
5"Where the conditions under which interstate and intrastate
traffic move are found to be' substantially the same with respect to,
all factors bearing on- the reasonableness of the rate, and the two
classes are shown to be intimately bound together, there is no occasion to *deal with the reasonableness' of the intrastate rates more
specifically, or to separate intrastate and interstate costs, and revenues." Illinois Commerce Comm'n v. United States, 292 U. S. 474,
483-484 (1934); King v. United States, supra, at 273.

OCTOBER TERM, '1957.
Opinion of the Court.

356.U. S.

failed to establish that all material factors bearing on the
reasonableness of rates were substantially the same. As
we have previously noted, appellants offered convincing,
evidence not' only of greater density on intrastate operations, permitting a wider spread of fixed costs, but also
of lower operating ratios and higher returns as the perc6ntage of intrastate'traffic increased. In the face of this
proof the evidence as to general similarity of conditions
falls short of the "high standard of certainty" required.
It is suggested that the. Commission, in granting
general interstate increases, frequently proceeds on the
assumption that intrastate rates will be raised to the
same level. But this assumption i no through ticket
permitting it to 'approach the question of intrastate rates
with partiality for a uniform increase. Rate uniformity
is not necessarily the goal of federal regulation, nor can
the Comm'issiori's wishful thinkirig be substituted for substantial evidence. Section 13 is not cast in terms of
"assumption" or "partiality." As applied to this case, it
contemplates an inquiry into intrastate rates and conditions within Utah, and any conclusion that interstate
operating conditions equally exist there must be ticketed
on more than assumption.
Finally, we note an absence in the findings of any indication that the Commission concerned itself with the
revenues derived from, or 'the conditions incident to,
intrastate passenger operations. While a sweeping inquiry into those operations is not required, we believe
that in light of our opinion in Chicago,"M.,St. P. & P. R.
Co. v. Illinois, supra, the fixidings must reflect consideration of these factors in arriving at a general intrastate
freight level. "A fair picture of the intrastate operation,
and whethef the*intrastate traffic unduly discriminates
against interstate traffic, is not shown . .. by limiting
consideration to. the particular . . .service in disregard

of the revenue contributed by the other intrastate serv-

ices." 355 U. S., at 308. This issue was not argued by
the parties, our opinion in that case having been an-nounced after submission of the instant case. We
.mention it at this point, however, since further proceed ings before the Commission no doubt will ensue.
The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the
cause is remanded to that court with instructions to set
aside the order of the Commission and remand the cause
to the Commission for further proceedings in conformity
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
MR. JuSTIcE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTIcE BuRTON, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, and MR. JUSTICE W'HITTAKER

join, dissenting.
This case involves an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission raising rates on Utah intrastate freight
traffic on the ground that such rates unduly discriminate
against interstate commerce. The Court has found the
evidence insufficient to support the Commission's findings bearing on discrimination, and, although petitioners
do not call them in question, has also concluded that the
findings themselves are inadequate. Our holding in the
recent case of Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co. v. Illinois,
355 U. S. 300, has been extended to require, even in
such a case a this, comprehensive findings concerningall
intrastate operations.
There comes a time in the development of law, especially when it concerns as complex and important a sub-

ject as, that in the present case," when a comprehensive
survey must be made and the cumulative effect of episodic
instances appraised to determine whether or not they
reveal a harmonious whole. Case-by-case adjudication,
without scrutiny of underlying generalizations or resuppositions, must culminate in an effort to determine
whither we- are going, and whether the direction cut by

the specific instances should be further pursued or whether
it represents a deviation from the path demanded by the
purpose of the regulatory legislation. These considerations, and the fact that the sufficiency of the evidence can
only be judged intelligently in the light of the findings,
make it necessary to consider at some length the cases in
which this Court has been concerned with intiastate rate
discrimination against interstate commerce and the findings that have been required of the Commission to justify
an order removing such discrimination.
Federal regulation of intrastate rates originated in cases
involving discrimination as between particular persons
or localities engaged in interstate commerce and particular
persons or localities engaged in intrastate commerce.
The discrimination in the Shreveport case, Houston, E. &
W- T. R. Co. v. United States, 234 U. S. 342, arose from
the fact that interstate shippers were required to pay
more than intrastate shippers although the rate disparity
was not justified by any difference in costs, transportation
conditions, or other factors usually considered in setting
rates. This discrimination was removed in order to protect the interstate commerce of the 1articular shippers
or localities shown to have been prejudiced, the same reason for prohibiting under § 3 (1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, 380, as amended, 49 U. S. C.
§ 3 (1), any "undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person . . . locality . . . or any
particular description of traffic . . ." where two forms

of interstate commerce are involved. It has often been
said that this form of discrimination arises simply from
the relation of rates to each other, but this is true only if
it is understood that the circumstances that enter into the
setting of rates and justify differences between them arealso taken into consideration. Even in a persons-localities case, discrimination is not made out merely from a
disparity in rates, but. as the Court made clear in the

PUB. SERVICE COMM'N v. UNITED STATES. 431
42i'

FRANKFURTER,

J.,,dissenting.

Shreveport case, the disparity must exist under "'substantially similar conditions and circumstances . .
234 U. S., at 347.
The power to remove discrimination thus announced
in the Shreveport case, as between persons and localities
in interstate and intrastate commerce, was given express
statutory basis by § 416 of the Transportation Act of
1920, 41 Stat. 456, 484, 49 U. S. C. § 13 (4), amending
§ 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act. The amepdment
added, however, as part of a much more comprehensive regulation of the Nation's transportation system,
a broad prohibition against "any undue, unreasonable
or unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign
commerce .

. . ."

This provision, taken in conjunction

with § 15a (2), 41 Stat. 456, 488, as amended, 49
U. S. C. § 15a (2), was construed in Railroad Comm'n
of Wisconsin-v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563,
to authorize the Commission to* remove "revenue discrimination" resulting from unjustifiably low .intrastate
rates. The constitutionality of this power was upheld
against claims of unwarranted intrusion into the area
reserved to the States in their control over intrastate
commerce. -"Revenue discrimination" consists, not in
prejudice to particular shippers or localities, hut in the
burden cast on interstate commerce because of the failure
of intrastate commerce to contribute its fair share to meet
the revenue needs of the carrier. Of course interstate
shippers and localities will ultimately be prejudiced by
having to make up revenues properly due from intrastate
commerce or by the collapse of an adequate transportation system, but the immediate purpose of the exercise
of the Commission's power under this head is tb assure
to the carrier needed revenues. The test of what revenues are needed is found in § 15a (2), 41 Stat. 456,
488, as amended, 49 U. S. C. § 15a (2), which instructs
the Commission -in prescribing rates to give due consid-

eration to the need "in the public interest, of adequate
and efficient railway transportation service at the lowest
cost consistent with the furnishing of such service; and
to the need of revenues sufficient to enable the carriers,
under honest, economical, and efficient management to
provide such service." The National Transportation
Policy of 1940, 54 Stat. 899, 49 U. S. C., at pp. 71077108, in turn expanded and supplemented the test of
§ 15 (a) (2). The "dovetail relation," as Mr. Chief Justice Taft termed it in the Wisconsin case, 257 U. S., at
586, between the second part of § 13 (4) and §.15a (2),
thus gave a much broadened purpose to federal regulation. "Theretofore, the effort of Congress had been directed mainly to the prevention of abuses; particularly,
those arising from excessive or discriminatory rates. The
1920 Act sought to ensure, also, adequate transportation
service." New England Divisions Case, 261 U. S. 184,
189..
The order sustained in the Wisconsin case affected intrastate fares on a state-wide basis. The Court expressly
rejected discrimination against, persons or localities as
justification for the order, on the ground that there was
insufficient evidence to support a. finding of state-wide
discrimination of this 'kind. This conclusion may have
been justified in the Wisconsin case itself. However, the
limitation imposed by that case and later cases upon the
effective scope of the persons-localities basis of discrimination, because of stringent evidentiary requirements,
seems to have derived more from the origin of the prohibition in the particular kind of situation presented by
the Shreveport case than from restrictions inherent in
the regulatory scheme contemplated by the statute.
Whether discrimination is directly agaiist shippers or
against the revenues of the carriers, practical considerations require that evidence typical of discriminatory
conditions be sufficient to justify an order that goes

PUB. SERVICE COMM'N v. UNITED STATES. 433
421

FRANYFuRTER, J., dissenting.

beyond the particular instances shown. In revenue
cases evidence of some intrastate rates may be deeM.ed
typical and,:'elied on to show that intrastate rates in
general do not contribute their fair share to revenues.
Likewise it might not have been unreasonable to rely on
evidence of prejudice td certain interstate shippers as
indicative of prejudice throughout the State to interstate
shippers, and thus justify a state-wide order to remove
discrimination against "interstate commerce" without
resort to the question of revenues.
For a tim'ne it appeared that § 13 (4) wohld be construed to authorize the removal of discrimination against
interstate commerce on such a basis. In Georgia Pub.
Serv. Comm'n v. United States, 283 U. S. 765, for example,
the Court sustained a state-wide order niot confined ihtits
effect to traffic directly shown to have been prejudied,
yet attention does not seem to~have beentdirected to the
revenue needs of the carriers. In its opinion the Court
spoke particularly of "undue prejudice and discrimination
to interstate shippers and localities . . . ," 283 U.. S., at
773, and the brief for the Interstate Commerce Commission indicates that the case was not primarily conceived
of as a revenue case. Pp. 38-40. (See also the significance of the Court's reliance, 283 U. S., at 774, on Nashville, C. & St. L. R. v. Tennessee, 262 U. S. 318.) In
Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Texas & N. 0. R. Co.,
284 U. S. 125, an order affecting rates throughout most of
the State was sustained in spite of the fact, as appellants
pointed out, 284 U. S., at 126-128, that there were no
findings in regard to revenue. Finally, in Ohio v. United
States, 292 U. $. 498, the Court sanctioned an unusually
wide application of the persons-localities basis of discrinination in sustaining an order raising coal rates
throughout the 6ntire northeastern part of Ohio.
Nevertheless, the approach suggested by these cases
was not in fact carried forward. The first Florida case,

OCTOBER TERM, 1957.
FRANKFURTER,

J., dissenting.

356 U. S.

Florida v. United States, 282 U. S. 194, 208, strongly reaffirmed the Wisconsin case in its rejection of the personslocalities basis for a statd-wide order, and in the requirement that an order, predicated on such a theory be
restricted to "competitive territory." See American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldoell, 244 U. S. 617,
626. This was perhaps inevitable in view of the fact
that the Shreveport doctrine had been evolved to remedy
a specific situation-prejudice against particular shippers
or localities shown by relatively direct evidence-so that
the evil that gave rise to the legal theory in turn limited its growth. Furthermore, the broad power that
the 'Court found in the r'elation between § 13 (4) and
§15a (2), to protect the carriers' revenues, made it
appear unnecessary to expand the persons-localities
theory- in order effectively to protect interstate commerce.. The result has been that, over the years, the
cases that have come before this Court that have resulted
in significant developments under § 13 (4) have been
almost exclusively revenue cases.
Findings in revenue cases under section 13 (4) .- In
these cases we have been concerned to set forth, with
such precision as the subject matter permits, the findings
required to justify an ultimate conclusion, that there is
a revenue discrimination against interstate commerce.
Such findings need not be, in any particular form of words,
the automatic recitation of a talismanic formula, but
must give ample assurance that the Commission -has
aliplied the standards and engaged in tho process of judgment contemplated by the statute. Only through the
fiuidings can a court know what it is that the Commission
has decided and is to be reviewed..
Since the purpose of the proceeding is to increase the
contribution to revenues from intrastate, traffic, there
must be a finding that higher rates will in fact reslult in
increased revenues. If business is unable to bear the

PUB. SERVICE COMM'N v; UNITED STATES.

J., dissenting.

higher rates, and either production will be curtailed or
traffic diverted to cheaper modes of transport, increased
rates may'actually decrease revenues. The Commission's
finding on this matter must express an informed, expert
judgment about -probabilities. It may not rest simply
on the mechanical application of proposed rates to the
volume of past traffic, but, on the other hand, the fact
that there is uncertainty about the actual revenue outcome will not make the finding insufficient. United
States v. Louisiana,290 U. S.70, 80.
The finding principally required in a revenue case is
that intrastate commerce is not contributing its "fair
share" to the revenues needed to achieve the ends set
forth in § 15a (2) and the National Transportation Policy. What share is a fair share? Intrastate traffic is not
contributing a fair share if it pays lower rates than interstate traffic when, on balance, the circumstances that
usually go to the setting of rates are not substantially
more favorable for intrastate traffic than for, interstate
traffic. As already indicated, this same test is applicable
in cases involving discrimination against persons or localities. A disparity in rates does not alone establish a forbidden discrimination, as the Court has frequently said,
nor, it is equally clear, since conditions surrounding interstate transportation may be more favorable, does identity
of rates alone give assurance that there is not such
discrimination.
The most obvious of the circumstances thus made relevant are the costs that enter into the rendering of the
transportation service. The circumstances that go to the
setting of a rate, however, are not necessarily confined to
such costs, but may include a wide range of other considerations such as the ability of traffic to bear the increase
and the economic condition of an industry. Costs, furthermore, may be considered iridirectly through the factors that generate costs, such as the quality of the service

rendered, the physical characteristics of the area through
which the traffic moves, average loading, average length
of haul, density of traffic, and so forth. In regard to the
average length of haul, for example, if terminal costs are
fixed, the longer the haul the more the carrier will realize
per mile unless the rate is itself graduated to take this
fact into account. Interstate hauls are probably on the
whole longer than intrastate hauls. Where passenger
service is concerned, wholly different factors may become
important in deciding whether fare differentials are justified. For instance, coaches used in intrastate suburban
or commuter service may require more cleaning and average fewer passenger miles per day than through coaches.
See, e. g., In re Intrastate Rates within Illinois, 102

may reasonably be found to enter into costs are inexhaustible in.
number and too changing in significance to
permit a definitive catalogue to be drawn up. Least of
all should such a task be undertaken by courts that
cannot be assumed to have familiarity with, let alone
specialized knowledge of, the practicalities. of the transportation industry, and whose contact with these matters
is necessarily episodic. Understanding in such a complex
area as rate regulation, and the feel for the subject essential to successful administration, come only from saturation in the elements of the problem by those constantly
concerned. Even to the Commission, what one year has
appeared an inconsiderable factor in appraising relative
transportation conditions affecting costs has the next,
in the light of new expierience, been deemed highly
relevant.
It is essential to bear in mind precisely what it is that
the Commission comnpares when it compares the circumst&ces surrounding the movement of interstate and intrastate traffic that go to the setting of rates. In the case of
interstate traffic, one rate set for an entire interstate move-

ment may take into account not only conditions within the
State whose intrastate rates are in question, but also con'ditions in surrounding States. In comparing cost factors,
therefore, it may be necessary to' consider not only whether
interstate and intrastate traffic as they move through the
State move under the same conditions, but'also the conditions under which interstate traffic moves beyond the
borders of the State. The interstate area relevant to this
inquiry may embrace several States, such as the Western
District in the present case, or half the country; it is the
area chosen in setting the interstate rates.
What findings the Commission is required to make
concerning the circumstances surrounding interstate and
intrastate transportation to justify an ultimate finding
that intrastate traffic is not contributing its fair share
to revenues have necessarily been dictated more by the
practicalities of administration than the demands of
abstract logic. The Commission has not been required
to make findings as to revenues and costs attributable
to intrastate traffic or even to make findings specifically
negativing the existence of any factors that might affect
costs. Although such findings would give increased assurance that intrastate commerce was not being made to
bear more than its fair share, an unwillingness to render
nugatory the provisions of § 13 (4) by imposing upon the
Commission-obligations impossible of fulfillment has
precluded the Court from such a requirement.
In Tl ,ois Commerce Comm'n v. United States, 292
U. S.474, a case involving rates in the Chicago Switching
District, the Court clearly laid down what had been
implicit in earlier cases sustaining Commission orders.
In reply to a contention that there had been no finding
separating interstate and intrastate property, revenues,
and expenses, the Court stated: "Where the conditions
under which interstate and intrastate traffic move are
found to be substantially the same with respect to all

factors bearing on the reasonableness of the rate, and the
two classes are shown to be intimately bound together,
there is no occasion to deal with the reasonableness of
the intrastate rates more specifically, or to separate intrastate and interstate costs and revenues." 292 U. S., at
483-484. This statement was quoted with approval and
applied in King v. United States, 344 U. S. 254, 273. The
order in the King case was sustained, although the only
finding respecting the similarity of conditions surrounding
interstate and intrastate transportation was the general
finding that, "the transportation conditions incident to
the intrastate transportation -of freight in Florida are not
more favorable and such conditions in the Florida penin
sula are somewhat less favorable than those (1) within
southern territory and (2) between Florida and interstate
points." 278 I. C. C. 41, 72. See also the second Florida
case, Floridav. United States, 292 U. S. 1, 11.
More elaborate findings have not been required because
of the practical impossibility, at least where -the traffic
is mingled and carried on as one operation, of accurately
segregating costs between interstate and intrastate commerce. Moreover, a general finding of similarity of conditions Was held sufficient because it would tlave been
the height of imprudence for this Court to rquire the
Commission specifically to negative .the existcnce of all
factors that -inight touch on costs when, because of the
changing nature of the transportation industry and the
endless variety of situations giving rise to discrimination,
such fdctors are not precise, fixed, or equal in imliortanbe.
The holding in the King case was'a practical solution
hammered out to meet the alifiost intractable difficulty of
regulating as two systems what is in fact one integrated,.
transportation system of interstate and intrastate commerce, where regulation, if there is to be regulation at all,
must be by approximation and compromise.

Evidence in section 13 (4) cares.-In the present case
the Commission found that, "The conditions incident to
the intrastate transportation of freight in Utah are not
more favorable than those incident to the interstate transportation between Utah and adjoining States." Petitioners attack this finding as not supported by substantial
evidence. The findings necessary to support an order
under § 13 (4) have bee ° considered at- length because
only in the light of them, and the reasons that led the
Court to require these, and not more elaborate, findings,
can the sufficiency of the evidence be appraised. Thus
it would be paradoxical, after deciding that the Commission need not make findings segregating costs because
of the practical impossibility of accurate allocation, to
require that evidence to the same effect be in the record.
Likewise, if individual findings on particular factors :that
may bear on costs need not be made because an authoritative catalogue of such factors cannot be compiled, it would
be inconsistent, and would disregard the criteria governing the findings, to require that the record contain evidence as to all such factors or as to any particular factor.
Since, as cannot too often be pointed out,. the Commission's administration of § 13 (4)- must from the nature
of the case proceed by approximation and estimate, .and
for this reason the possible must have 'a large share in
determining the permissible, it is highly relevant to examine at least some of the § 13 (4) cases that have come
before this Court to determine what evidence has actually
been in the record in support of findings of similarity of
conditions. In determining whether the record in the
present case satisfied the requirement of substantial evidence, we do not (teal with a new problem.

the Commission's order when the substantiality of !he
evidence was squarely in issue. The record contaihnd
testimony that physical characteristics of interstate, and
intrastate service, type of equipment, running time, and
accommodations were similar, and in addition there was
testimony of the most general sort that transportation
conditions within the State did not justify lower rates.

intrastate rates on fertilizer and fertilizer materials. The
issue of the substantiality of the evidence to support
the Commission's findings was squarely presented. The
record contained no evidence of the cost of the intrastate
service. Instead, there was general testimony that the
conditions surrounding intrastate and interstate transportation in Alabama were substantially. siniilar, ,and that
the witnesses knew of no conditions in Alabama that
would justify different in'trastate rates. There was'some
evidence that the tonnage of fertilizer moving intrastate
was much greatdr than that moving interstate, and that
ton-miles per loaded car of- fertilizer were "greater in
Alabama than in the Southern District as a whole.
Evidencewas introduced of competition from wagons on

the same as -those affecting interstate traffic, this Court

the costs of interstate and intrastate transportation
within the State, and there was no evidence of the cost
of transportation in the particular part of Louisiana concerned oi of the particular commodities on which higher
-rates were sought: Evidence was introduced to show
general freight density in the States in the territory considered, interstate and intrastate combined, and, according to the Commission, 155 I. C. C. 247, 253, about ninety
per cent of the movements of the particular commodifies
involved was intrastate, There was also' considerable
evidence that bore indirectly on traffic density in these
commodities: tonnage moved in each of the States;

on the Louisiana highway program and population

there was the usual general testimony on similarity of

of western Louisiana, the area to which the Louisiana
Commission had specifically refused to apply the interstate level of rates.
Another case in which this Court found that there was
substantial evidence was Florida v. United States, 292
U. S. 1, involving intrastate rates on logs. The record
contained evidence bearing on the cost of transporting
logs in Florida, and indicating that existing intrastate
rates did not cover the cost of the service. As to freight
in general, there was evidence that costs per gross tonmile were higher on the carrier's lines in Florida than
for the rest of its system, and that density on its lines in
Florida, intrastate and interstate combined, was less than
for its system as a Whole or its system excluding Florida.
These comparisons involved the question whether evidence of general freight conditions could be used to justify
raising rates on a. particular commodity. The case furnished the best evidence on the probability that increased
rates would increase revenues because the proposed intrastate rates had actually beefi in effect for a period before
the Court set aside an earlier order of the Commission.
In Illinois Commerce Comm'n v. United States, 292
U. S. 474, already referred to in connection with the rule
that there need not be findings segregating interstate and
intrastate expenses, the Court also found that there was
substantial evidence., The Commission relied primarily
on an extensive cost study of the movement of all commodities in the Chicago Switching District, °astudy that
did not, however, make any separation between interstate
and intrastate costs. There was evidence of the physical
characteristics of the service: that interstate and intrastate traffic were, handled-in the same mnanner and carried
on the same trains. On the other hand, it was shown that
average intrastate hauls were shorter than average interstate hauls, yet the Commisgion had set a single rate no

matter what the length of haul. In spite of this evidence
indicating that at least one factor underlying costs favored
intrastate traffic, the Court uplield the Commission's
order.
Mississippiex rel. Rice v. UnitedStates,307 U. S. 610,
concerned intrastate rates on sand, gravel, fertilizer, and
fertilizer materials. This Court affirmed the District
Court per curiam, citing cases to the effect that the. Commission's orders would be sustained when supported by
substantial evidence. The record contained no evidence
segregating costs between intrastate and interstate traffic,
although one witness testified generally that costs were
less in Mississippi than in neighboring States. There was
no evidence on traffic density as such, but considerable
from which conclusions as to density might be inferred.
Thus there was evidence of the tonnage -of the commodities.involved that had been moved by the carriers, intrastate, interstate, and total, during selected annual periods,
and evidence of points of production in Mississippi. The
carriers relied on testimony that the same service was
rendered interstate and intrastate traffic and the usual
general evidence of similarity -of conditions. Against
this was testimony that the bulk of intrastate movements
were single-line, and that, because of extra switching and
inspection of cars at switching points, and because of the
necessity of keeping interchange records, joint-line moveWments were more experlsive than single-line." Dispute
entered principally on whether increased Irates would
increase revenues: Evidence was introduced to show
in ensive truck competition, facilitated by the fact that
shdrt hauls from wayside gravel-pits to all points in
\the tate were possible. Other evidence minimized the
-sriousness of such competition. The record contained
little evidence of conditions surrounding the production
and transportation of the- commodities in other parts of

the South, but the Commission relied to some extent on
its investigation into general conditions in earlier proceedings concerned with interstate rates.
New York v. United States, 342 U. S. 882, affirming
98 F. Supp. 855, another per .curiamaffirmance, raised
intrastate commuter fares to the level of interstate commuter fares. A study had been made of the cost of the
intrastate commuter service, costs being apportioned between that service and other service on the trains studied
'principally on the basis of passenger-mile ratios. The
results of the study were used by the Commission, however, to show that intrastate fares did not cover the cost
of service, rather than to contrast intrastate with comparable interstate costs. Intrastate. commater service
was of much heavier volume than interstate, both in
number of passengers and passenger miles, but the Commission pointed out that increased costs from such density
went far to offset its advantages. Wear' and tear on
equipmefit was increased, and since traffic was concentrated at rush hours, additional crews and 'equipment
needed to handle it were idle during the re't of the day.
There was evidence that intrastate trains "made more
stops than interstate trains and used' coaches that were
older, more crowded, and not air-conditioned. "'Yet these
differences were found not to justify a lower fare.
In King v. United States, 344 U. S. 254, the parties
raised no question as to the sufficiency of the evidence.
The Court observed, however, that evidence supporting
the findings appeared in the xecord and that much of the
material that'had been before the Commission in its
investigations into the interstate rates had also been
before it in the § 13 proceedings.\ 344 U. S., at 272. -The
record did contain evidenc of operating expenses allocated to Florida traffic, int.rstate and intrastate, but it

and that it was impossible accurately to ascertain actual
expenses. However, for one carrier, because of special
bookkeeping,.it was possible to show that actual freight
expenses were higher in Florida than for the rest of its
system. Statistics were introduced to show that the
percentage increase in net railway operating income for
Florida and the carriers operating in Florida had been
greater than for the Southern District as a whole.
As to density, there was evidence that the density of
freight traffic in Florida, at least for some carriers, was
lower than that for their whole systems or their systems
excluding Florida. Against this the State Comniission
introduced Evidence showing that there had been a greater
relative increase in tonnage originated in Florida than on
the entire systems of the three principal carriers serving
Florida.. There was evidence that intrastate movements
were mostly by local trains on branch lines, and the percQentage of branch lines in Florida was greater than for
the rest 'of the carriers' systems. Because of overtime
wages, shorter hauls, more switching, the necessity of frequently making and breakingup trains such local trains
were shown to be more expensive to operate than through
trains. The Court left it to the Commission to weigh the
competing claims of all this evidpce on the question of
similarity of conditions.
In recent years the Court has, by per curiam affirmance,
disposed, of a number of 'cases involving challenges to
§ 13 (4) orders. In Tennessee v. United States, 346
U. $ 891, affirming 113 F. Supp. 634, a case involving
intrastate rates on coal and wood, the District Court had
found that there was substantial evidence. The Commission's report, Tennessee IntrastateRates and Charges,
286 I. C. C. 41, stated the principal evidence relevant -to
the finding. that intrastate conditions were not more
favorable than interstate conditions. The results of a
traffic study, separately listing interstate and intrastate

terminations of the commodities involved, bore indirectly
on density. A greater proportion Qf intrastate than
interstate traffic was handled in costly local trains. A
cost study based on waybills showing average load, haul,
and rates charged was introduced to show that intrastate
rates provided a greater return above cost than rates on
interstate movements; the Commission rejected this evidence on the ground that the information in the waybills
was unreliable.
In LouisianaPub. Serv. Coznm'n v. United States, 348
U. S. 885, affirming 125 F. Supp. 180, the District Court
had also found that there was substantial evidence. The
,Commission in its report, Louisiana Intrastate Freight
Rates and Charges, 291 I. C. C. 279, relied on evidence
that generally intrastate traffic was carried in the same
trains with the same crews as interstate traffic and under
no more favorable operating conditions, and that in fact
considerable intrastate traffic moved in-expensive local
trains. There was also evidence separately stating, as
between intrastate and interstate commerce, the tonnage
of the various commodities terminated during a test
period.
In Illinois Central R. Co. v. Mississippi Pub. Serv.
Comm'n, 349 U. S. 908, affirming Mississippi Pub. Serv.
Comm'n v. United States, 124 F. Supp. 809, the principal
question before the District Court had been the sufficiency of the evidence. Among the considerations that
that court reliedson in setting aside the Commission's
order was the fact that the passenger deficit in. Mississippi
was lower than for the entire systems of the Mississippi
carriers, for the rest of the South, or for the country as a
whole. It found the evidence too -unsubstantial, furthermore, to support the Commission's judgment that,
in spite of competition from other forms of transportation, increased rates would increase revenue.

FRANKFURTER,

J., dissenting.

From this review of the cases in this Court, and from
a consideration of others in the District Courts and before
the Commission, certain conclusions emerge that 'should
be decisive in .disposing of the case now before us. In
the first place, there has been in many cases only the
slightest direct evidence of, the cost of moving intrastate
traffic, and in other cases the record is wholly devoid of
such evidence. As is clear from Illinois Commerce
Comm'n v. United States, 292 U. S. 474, and King v.
United States, 344 U. S. 254, such evidence is not
required when intrastate and interstate traffic are
intimately bound together. The records in many cases
contained evidence of factors affecting costs, but, according to the traffic involved and the character of the investigation, what has been deemed an important factor in one
case has been passed over in silence in another. Reliance
on general testimony concerning similarity of conditions
'has been almost universal and, in some of the cases
consideed, such evidence, appears to have provided the
principal, if not exclusive, support for the Commission's
1'1
finding.
The evidence introduced before the Commission to
support a finding of similarity of conditions varies with
the purpose and scope of the proceeding. Thus, an
investigation under § 13 (4) may involve intrastate rates
on a single commodity or on all freight traffic; i6 may
involve the rate of a single carrier or all the carriers in the
State; it may be confined to rates in a certain part of the
State or extend to rates and fares throughout the State.
Obviously a single, comprehensive, easily applied formula
for testing the evidence required in all these cases cannot
be devised without closing one's eyes to the rich and shifting variety of situations presented by the Nation's transportation system, and without unduly confining the Commission in its responsibility to deal with the intermingled
interstate and intrastate transportation of a single system.

Finally, it is of importafice to distinguish § 13 proceedings, such as those in the present, case, that accompany or
follow regulation'of interstate rates on comparable traffic.
In these cases, -in determning the level at which interstate ratep should be st in order to dssure a given rev'enue, the Commission often proceeds on the assumption
that intrastate rates will be raised to the same level or
proportionately increased. Of course uffiif4lity of rates
is not the goal of federal regulation, and the Commission's
conclusions in the interstate proceedings do not justify
foregoing the inquiry into intrastate rates and conditions
required by § 13. But the manner in which the Commission customarily proceeds is strong evidence of what is
practically pbssible in performing the difficult regulatory
task imposed by the statute. It should be respected by
this Court in prescribing standards for the Commission's
guidance. When a § 13 proceeding follows regulation of
rates on comparable interstate traffic, furthermore, evidence introduced in the interstate proceedings, whether
they are general revenue proceedings or directed to specific rates-, will, to a greater or 4ess extent, also bear on
conditions surrounding the movement of intrastate traffic,
and it may not be unreasonable for the Commission to
assume, -,n the absence of persuasive evidence to the
contrary, that the conclusions it has drawn from such
evidence about general conditions are equally applicable
to a particular State. As was stated in King v. United
States, 344 U. S. 254, 272, "In the absence of any showing
that it is not applicable'to Florida, the evidence which
forms the basis of the Commission's nationwide order
becomes the natural basis for its Florida order."
The evidence in the present case.-The present case
concerns, with exceptions not now relevant, all Utah
intrastate freight rates. It follows a general revenue
proceeding raising interstate rates, and seeks to apply
the same increase there granted to intrastate traffic.

The validity of the Commission's state-wide order was
not impaired because as to particular traffic or carriers
in the State a rate increase might not be justified. It
may be that an increase in, rates on certain traffic will
decrease revenues, or the operations of one -carrier may already be exceptionally profitable. Factors affecting costs
may vary throughout the State. In New York v. United
States, 257 U. S. 591, the fact that evidence indicated that
one carrier had a more favorable route with greater
density than others did not preclude an order raising
passenger fares on a state-wide basis. If general orders
are to be possible at all, and § 13 (4) necessarily implies
them, the Commission must be able to proceed on. evidence typical of general conditions, ee GeorgiaPub. Serv.

R. Co., 257 U. S. 563, 591; New England Divisions Case,

The evidence in the present case said to bear on the
conditions surrounding, the movement of interstate and
intrastate traffic included evidence of the following:
economic conditions in Utah, the rate of return on the
carriers' net property investment, net railway operating
income, revenue per ton-mile, freight service ratio, density, operatifig efficiency, the character 'of the service
rendered interstate and intrastate traffic, and general
similarity of operating conditions.
There was general testimony from a number of qualified witnesses that interstate and intrastate traffic in Utah
moved under substantially similar conditions, were carried on the same trains, handled by the same crews, and
accounted for in the same manner, and that generally
no better service was given interstate than intrastate
traffic. There was evidence that so-called "piggyback"

service was used exclusively for interstate traffic, and that
traffic in Utah was more heavily weighted in favor of
mine products moving in cheap gondola cars than in
neighboring States, but there was no indication that these
considerations, insofar as they affected costs, were not in
fact taken into account in setting rates on the particular
commodities involvgd
The average rate of return on net property investment
for the five Class I carriers serving Utah, and their net
railway operating income, were shown to have declined
steadily since 1950. Since these figures were not broken
down between interstate and intrastate operations within
Utah, however, nor between operations in Utah and other
States, but instead embraced the carriers' entire systems,
the showing of a decline is of no probative value on similarity of conditions surrounding the movement of interstate and intrastate traffic. The decline may be attributable as much to one traffic as to the other. It goes
instead to establish the carriers' need for additional revenue from one source or another. The same may be said
.of the evidence of particular costs entering into the rendering of freight service. There was evidence that wages
on the entire systems of the five Utah Class I carriers
had risen 45.89% from 1948 to 1953, that they were generally higher in-the Western District than in the States
further east, and that average unit prices for materials
and supplies in that District had risen 24.7% from 1949 to
1954. In none of these statistics' were costs attributable to initerstate and intrastate traffic segregated and
compared.
.
As in most §.13 (4) cases, the record here contained
numerous statistics showing revenue per ton-mile. 'Revenue per ton-mile on all freight traffic in Utah, interstate
and intrastate, had increased less between 1939 and 1952
than revenue per ton-mile for the Western District and
for the country as a whole. On the other hand, the re-

-

PUB. SERVICE COMM'N v. UNITED STATES. 451

FRANKFURTER,

J., dissenting.

sults of a waybill study introduced by the Utah Commission showed that in 1952 the revenue per ton-mile from
Utah intrastate shipments was greater than that from
interstate shipments that had originated in Utah. But,
as the Interstate Commerce Commission pointed out in
its report, revenue per ton-mile tends to be less on interstate traffic because average hauls are longer. In any
event, since differences in revenue per ton-mile are often
simply a reflection of the fact that there are differences
between interstate and intrastate rates, they are not probative of the relative cost factors affecting interstate and
intrastate traffic.
I turn now to the evidence that the Court finds, contrary to the Commission, establishes that on the whole
conditions surrounding intrastate traffic are substantially
more favorable than those surrounding interstate traffic,
and require overruling the District Court and setting aside
the Commission's order. This evidence, according to the
Court, so preponderates over the general testimony on
similarity of conditions, referred to above, that the Commission was bound to accept it as decisive.
There was evidence such as, increase in population,
automobile registrations, and income payments to individaals that justified a conclusion that economic conditions in Utah had improved relatively more than in the
Western District and the United States as a whole.
Although this evidence may be relevant to the density
of traffic in Utah as compared with other States, or the
density of intrastate and interstate traffic within Utah,
it is so remote that it cannot reasonably be argued that
it compels a conclusion one way or another.
The Court suggests that Utah intrastate transportation conditions must be more favorable because the rate
of return on the Denver and Rio Grande Western, with
almost half of its operations in Utah, is greater than the
rate of return for the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific.

For this Court to draw such an inference presupposes a
natural law of railroading within the Court's knowledge
or to which it can gain ready access. There is nothing in
the record to indicate that the higher rate of return for
the D&RGW is due to the fact that a substantial part of
its traffic isUtah intrastate traffic. It may be due to any
one of a number of factors: the railroad as a whole may
be more efficiently operated than the UP or the SP; its
routes may be more favorably situated or the operations
on other parts of its system particularly profitable; the
lower rate for the UP and the SP may be due to circumstances present anywhere in their far-flung empires.
The Court finds that there was no justification for the
Commission's conclusion that density figures introduced
by petitioners were unreliable. Such a.judgment by the
Court on the basis of these statistics is indeed puzzling.
Exhibit 64 compares, for four Class I carriers in Utah,
freight density (ton-miles per mile of main-line track)
for "intrastate" operations with this density for each carrier's system as a whole. In each case the "intrastate)'
density is greater than the system density. It is inportant to understand just what is being compared in this
exhibit. As was admitted by petitioners, the "intratate"
density in the exhibit is not limited to traffic that, under
§ 1 (2) (a) of the Act, 24 Stat. 379, as amended, 49 U. S. C.
§ 1 (2) (a), moves "wholly within one State." Yet it is
the cost of moving only such intrastate traffic, traffic
wholly within the State, that must be ascertained and
compared with the' cost of moving interstate traffic,
because only this kind of intrastate traffic is subject in the
first ihstance to regulation by the State. Irstead, "intrastate' density in the exhibit includes also that portion 6f
interstjate movements that lies within Utah, whether such
movements -originate or terminate there or bridge the
State.

The comparison in this exhibit, therefore, is by no
means probatively the best when the purpose is to show
that the cost of moving one ton one mil. on an intrastate
journey is less than it would be on an interstate journey.
The most persuasive comparison would be between the
average density of interstate traffic in the region taken
for the purposes of setting the interstate rates and the
average density of intrastate traffic that moves wholly
within the State. The interstate density properly taken
into consideration, because it is the density that affects
the interstate rates, is the average density for the entire
interstate journey including that part that lies in other
States, but not including the intrastate density in those
States. There is some, although less, probative value in
a comparison between the density of interstate traffic
confined to interstate traffic within the State and the
density of intrastate traffic. For this comparison to be
reliable, density of interstate traffic for the -entire region
for which the interstate rates have been set must be
assumed to" be substantially the same as the density of
interstate traffic within the State.
The comparison in Exhibit 64, between interstate and
intrastate density on the carriers" entire systems and
interstate and intrastate density in Utah, is of considerably less probative value than these two comparisons.
It does not show whether Utah intrastate densityVis in
fact greater or less than interstate density.either in Utah
or on the carriers' entire systems. It has some' evidentiary valie, of course, since, if over-all system density
is less than over-all density within the State, there are
probably factors in the State generating traffic that do
not exist in neighboring States. That'these factors generate more intrastate than' interstate traffic, h6wever, is
a matter -of speculation, and average regional. interstate
density may still be higher than intrastate density within

Utah. A comparison somewhat similar to that in
Exhibit 64, and in fact relied on in the second Florida
case, Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Atlantic C. L. R. Co.,
186 L C. C. 157, 164, is a comparison between combined
interstate and intrastate density within one State and
combined interstate and intrastate density on the balance
of the carrier's system in surrounding States. It is impossible to tell from such a comparison whether or not
region-wide interstate density is less than intrastate
density in the particular State involved,' although that
it is may be a permissible judgment for the Commission
to make but hardly for this Court to impose upon it.
These distinctions are necessary because the bearing
of density on the cost of interstate and intrastate traffic
is unlike that of many other factors. Thus road conditions, wages, and cost of fuel in a State are likely to fall
with equal effect on intrastate traffic and interstate traffic
as it passes through the State. As to these conditions,
a comparison between those .prevailing in one State and
surrounding States is highly relevant. Since interstate
rates take into account average conditions throughout
the region, if conditions are more favorable in one State,
intrastate traffic moving only under those more favorable
conditions should not have to pay the same rate as interstate traffic.
The Commission itself discounts the importance of the
density figures because comparisdn is made of density-on.
main-line track only and that on branch lines is excluded.
However, the Court finds that, since branch-line density
is excluded both from Utah and system figures, the omission does not render tle evidence unreliable. This is
right if, and only if, the proportion of branch line to
main line in Utah is the same as for the carriers' systems
as a whole. If there is proportionately more low-density.
branch-line track in Utah, Utah density will be relativelkr
lower. The possibility that such is in fact the case was

mentioned at the hearings (R. 294), and petitioners
introduced no evidence to supply the deficiency in their
exhibit.
Thus it is clear that there were good reasons for rejecting the evidence in Exhibit 64,1 but even if the comparison offered were the best, the Commission surely would
not be compelled to accept the density evidence as conclusive. Density is only one of a multitude of factors
affecting costs, and what is gained by high density may
The record also contains evidence that in 1952 and 1953 density
for the Denver and Rio Grande Western was higher on its lines
in Utah than on its lines in Colorado or for its system as a whole.
Such a comparison, as already pointed out, does not show that Utah
intrastate density fbr the D&RGW is in fact higher than interstate
density over the carrier's entire system. Furthermore, the system of
the D&RGW is confined almost completely to Utah and Colorado,
and there was no showing that the density figures could not be
explained on the basis of special conditions in Colorado, rather than
by more favorable conditions in Utah cofnpared with the Western
District as a whole. The same criticism can be made of the evidence
that operating efficiency on the D&RGW-tons per freight car loaded,
tons per train, tons per locomotive, etc.-is more favorable in Utah
than Colorado.'
,There was also considerable evidence, taken from actual freight
bills, of tonnage terminated in.Utah during a four-month test period
in 1953-1954, in some instances segregated between interstate and
intrastate movements. However, since all interstate movements
during the period were admittedly not included, the evidence provides
no basis for reliable conclusions about density.
Evidence of the relative volume of interstate and intrastate movements of particular commodities, such as coal, ores, and concentrates,
are no necessary indication of over-all freight density, and therefore
of little assistance on this question in a proceeding to raise all freight
rates. When the § 13 (4) proceeding is concerned with rates on
certain commodities only, it is for the -Commission to decide, what
density comparisons are significant, whether of over-all freight
traffic, movements of the particular commodities, or movements restricted to a/particular region. See, e. g., Indianapolis Chamber of
Commerce r. Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. R. Co., 60 I. C. C. 67, 74.

be lost because of some other factor. High density
itself, as was shown in New York v. United States, 342
U. S. 882 (see 279 I. C. C. 151, 161), is not always- an
unmitigated blessing, and low interstate density may be
the result of rate discrimination rather than a justification
for it.
The Court also ,relies. on evidence that the freight
service operating ratio of four Class I carriers operating
in Utah for 1950-1953 was more favorable for operations
described in the exhibit as "intrastate" than for the carriers' entire systems. The "intrastate" traffie included,
in this comparison was the same as that used in the
density statistics.' Moreover, the Commission itself rejected the evidence because of an even more fundamental
criticism of the method used to segregate eipenses attributable to intrastate traffic. Since it was impossible in
many instances to ascertain actual expenses, allocation
had been to a large extent simply on the basis of the number of train miles in the State. The carriers had long
attacked this method of allocation as artificial and -not
reflecting the actual cost of service, and there is no justification for overriding the Commission's judgment on the
matter.
The upshot is that petitioners produced no evidence of
dissimilar conditions that was not open to serious criticism and that the Commission was not justified in reject.ing or severely restrictihg in effect. There remained to
support the Commission's findingthe general testimofiy
that interstate and intrastate" traffic in Utah did in fact
move under substantially similar conditions, and also the
evidence in the earlier general rev'enue proceeding to
adjust interstate rates that, as we recognized in King v,
United States, .344 U. S. 254, 272, becomes the natural
basis for the intrastate order in the absence of any-showing that it is not applicable. This Court has never before
overturned an order of the Commission under § 13 (4)

on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to
sustain a finding of revenue discrimination, although that
question has been squarely presented on a -number of
occasions. The evidence in the present case was as substantial as that in many of these other cases, .and, under
an interpretation of .the Act that respects the practical
difficulties facing the Commission, should be enough.
The Court objects -that there was* "no positive evidence" to support the Commission's finding, but'it does
not say what evidence on what factors affecting costs,
beyond that in the record, was required. Should there
have been evidence on length of haul,.average loading,
cars per train, grade conditionp, volume of intrastate
traffic handled by local trains, size of crews? This Court,
cannot say in each case what -factors would be significant
enough to necessitate evidence, and to require tlfat the
record contain evidenc6 negativing all possible factors
would be as paralyzing as to require findings to that effect.
Once there is evidence of the general nature here introduced, it is for those who contend that intrastate conditipns are dissimilar to come forward with convincing
evidence showing what specific factors affecting costs are
more favorable. Statements in earlier opinions of the
Court indicate that such is in fact present law.2 It is the
only workable.solution. As-Mr. Justice Brandeis. said in

Commission, could be performed."
Intrastatepassenger operations.-Thisconsideration of
the findings the Court has required in § 13 (4) cases, and
the evidence necessary to support them, bears on the
far-reaching consequences, not adverted to in the Court's
opinion, of holding that our decision in Chicago, Milwaukee, St. P. & P. R. Co. v. Illinois, 355 U. S. 300, in
some manner applies to the present case. It is not clear
from the Court's opinion -whether on the remand the
Commission will be required to make findings on the
profitableness of intrastate passenger operations, such as
were required in the Milwaukee case for all intrastate
operations, or only on the similarity of conditions surrounding intrastate and interstate passenger traffic.,
It was settled in Kiing v. United States, 344 U. S. 254,
that interstate freight traffic could be made to support
interstate passenger traffic, and intrastate freight traffic
to support intrastate passenger traffic. Left open, because there was no indication in the record that the deficits
arising from the two kinds of passenger traffic significantly
differed, was the question whether intrastate freight traffic
could be made to support an interstate passenger deficit.
Such support would be the practical effect if interstate
freight rates are set to compensate for an interstate passenger deficit, and intrastate freight rates are raised to
the same level although intrastate passenger operatiois
are profitable or result in a smaller loss than interstate
passenger operations. The question was presented in
Mississippi Pu& Serv. Comm'n v. United States,-124 F.
Sunp.:.809, where the failure of the Commission to take
into account a lower passenger deficit in Mississippi was
ono'ground for the District Court's setting aside the order.

on-the question. Illinois Central R. Co. v. Mississippi

furthermore, was not clearly settled by the general holding in the Milwaukee case that there should be findings
"which reflect the commuter service deficit in the totality
of intrastate revenues . . . ," 355 U. S. 300, 308, nor,
strictly speaking, must the question be answered at this
point in the present case though doubtless it will arise
under the Court's disposition on the remand.
There is no apparent reason why a lower passenger
deficit, like any other favorable circumstance surrounding
intrastate transportation, would not justify a lower rate
on intrastate freight traffic. If intrastate traffic taken asa whole contributes its fair share to needed revenues and
does not, from a revenue standpoint, discriminate against
interstate commnerce, what justification can there be for
a finding of discrimination that is possible only because
a segment of intrastate traffic is considered in isolation?
Raising rates in this situation may have the effect of compelling intrastate commerce to contribute more than its
fair share.
It does not necessarily follow that the Commission
should be required to make findings, supported by evidence in the record, that the intrastate passenger deficit
is not lower than the interstate, or about the profitableness of, or circumstances surrounding, any segment of
intrastate operations with which it is not immediately
concerned. Indeed, the consequences that follow in the
train of such a requirement demonstrate that it exalts
formal consistency over sound policy. In the first place,
if the Commission must determine the profitableness of
intrastate passelger operations, it will of course be compelled to segregate revenues and costs attributable to
intrastate and interstate traffic. Yet it is precisely this
that in Illinois Commerce Comm'n v: United States, 292

interstate and intrastate traffic were mingled together.
Another consequence of the Court's decision appears
to be that every case involving an intrastate rate claimed
to result in a revenue discrimination must be broadened
into a general inquiry into all intrastate rates and'the
profitableness of, or circumstances surrounding, all intrastate traffic.. The result would zbe a radical, and -in all

By being compelled to make findings reflecting a broader
view of the profitableness of intrastate operations, the
Cormmission is made to give assurance that intrastate
commerce has in fact been compared with interstate commerce and discrimination found. A broad comparison
between interstate and intrastate operations is necessary
because, in this special situation, a narrow comparison
is not possible.'
It is a very different- matter when there is comparable
interstate traffic and intrastate rates are raised to the
level of rates on that traffic already determined to be reasonable. This was the case in New York v. United
States, 342 U. S. 882, affirming 98 F. Supp. 855, also
involving intrastate suburban fares, and there was no
suggestion that the Commission was- bound to look to
the totality of intrastate operations. The -fact that a
comparison of rates on similar traffic is possible gives a
greater 'degree of assurance- than was possible in the Milwaukee case that intrastate traffic is not being compelled
to contribute more than its fair share to needed revenues,
and that it is discrimination rather than simply unreason'ableness that the Commission seeks to remedy. In this
situation the Commission is justified in considering
whether a particular segmeat of intrastate commerce is
contributing its fair share to revenues.
Of course, those who contend that intrastate traffic as
a whole is not discriminating against interstate traffic
may come forward and show,, as they may in respect to
any claimed dissimilarity of conditions surrounding interstate 'and intrastate traffic, some favorable aspect of intrastate operations that the Commission. should take into
account. In the absence of such a showing, however, the

Commission-should be able to'assume that discrimination
shown to exist as to the particular segments of intrastate
and interstate traffic with which the § 13 (4) proceeding
is concerned is not offset by other conditions that this
Court speculates may affect wholly different segments
of intrastate commerce. The record in the present case
is devoid of the remotest suggestion that the Utah intrastate passenger deficit is any less than the interstate passenger deficit, and the Commission should not be required
to seek out such evidence itself and make findings beyond
those it has already made.
This is a solution that accommodates imponderables
and does not demand precision where the nature of the
subject can yield only approximations. It is a solution
responsive to the difficult regulatory problems posed by
§ 13 (4). Embedded in it are some of the advantages in
simplicity of administration that. would follow if this
Court had expanded, as it might well have done, the
doctrine of discrimination against persons or localities
to permit state-wide orders protecting all interstate
shippers against discrimination without reference to revenues. -At the same time, there remains an opportunity
for intrastate shippers or a state commission to show
to the Interstate Commerce Commission's satisfaction
the existence of specific factors favoring intrastate traffic
in general that should not wisely be ignored. It is the
solution that seems best designed to achieve the purposes of the Act without interposing insurmountable
obstacles to the effective regulation of the national
transportation system, the.responsibility for which rests,
after all; predominantly with the Interstate Commerce
Commission.
