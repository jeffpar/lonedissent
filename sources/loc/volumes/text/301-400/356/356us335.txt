ET AL.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 619.

Decided April 28, 1958.

On May 10, 1955, the Federal District Court dismissed petitioners'
first amended complaint in this case and granted petitioners 20
days from that date to file an amended complaint. On May 27,
1955, the Court overruled petitioners' motion to vacate that order
but granted petitioners leave to file an amended complaint within
20 days from that date. Petitioners did not file an amended complaint; but, on March 25, 1957, filed a paper electing to stand
on their first amended complaint. On the same day, the Court
dismissed the cause of action. On April 16, 1957, i'etition~rs filed
notice of appeal "from final judgment entered in this action on
March 25, 1957." -The Court of Appeals held that the-District
Court's order of May 27, 1955, became its final judgment when
petitioners failed to file an amended complaint within the 20 days
allowed thereby, and it dismissed the appeal as untimely. Held:
The final judgment in the case was the District Court's order of
March 25, 1957, dismissing the cause of action, and the appeal was
timely under Rule 73 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Pp. 335-338.

to have been worthless and fraudulently sold to them by
respondents in violation of § 12 of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (48 Stat. 84, 15 U. S. C. § 771), and
of § 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S."C. § 78j (b)). Respondents moved to dismiss petitioners' first amended
complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief
could bc granted. On May 10, 1955, the District Court
sustained the motion, dismissed the complaint, and
granted- petitioners "twenty- days from this date within
which to file an amended complaint." On May 27, 1955,
petitioners moved to vacate the order of May 10 dismissing the first amended complaint or, in ,the alternative, to
extend the time to file an amended complaint. On that
date (May 27, 1955) the Court overruled petitioners' motion to vacate the order of May 10, but granted leave to
petitioners to file an amended complaint within 20 days
from May 27, 1955. Petitioners did not file an amended
coniplaint. 'On March 25, 1957, petitioners filed an instrument in the case by which they elected to stand on their
first amended complaint. On that day (March 25, 1957)
the Court ordered that "this cause of action be and it
hereby is dismissed without costs." On April 16, 1957,
petitioners filed notice'of appeal "from final judgment
entered in this action on March 25, 1957." Respondent
moved in the Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeal as
untimely. The Court of Appeals, holding that the order
of May 27, 1955, became the District Court's final judgment in the case when petitioners failed to file an amended
complaint within the 20 days thereby allowed for that
'purpose, sustained the motion and dismissed the appeal
of April 16, 1957, as not taken within 30 days from the
entry Of the judgment. 246 F. 2d 281. We think that the District Court's order of May 27,
.1955, denyii'g petitioners' motion to vacate the order of

May 10, 1955, but-grahting further leave to petitioners to
amend their complairn did not constitute the final judgment in the case. 'It did not direct "that all relief be
denied" (Rule 58 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure)
but left the suit pending for further proceedings "either
by amendment of the [complaint] or entry 9f a fiial !udgment." Missouri & Kansas InterurbanR. Co. v. City of
Olathe, 222 U. S. 185, 186. The situation did "not differ
from an order sustaining a demurrer with leave to amend;
another order of absolute dismissal after expiration of the
time allowed for amendment is required to makea final
disposition of the cause." "Chry Bros. & Co., Ltd., v.
United States, 47 F. 2d 607. Cf. United States v' F. & M.
Schaefer Brewing Co., 356 U. S. 227; 'Clark v. Kansas
City, 172 U. S. 334; Crutcher v. Joyce, 134 F. 2d 809;
Western Electri.-Co. v. Pacent Reproducer Corp., 37 F.
2d 14, and Riverside Oil &. Rig. Co. v. Dudley, 33 F. 2d
749.
Although to e sure nearly two years elapsed between
the time petitioners were given leave to file an amended
complaint and their motion of March 25, 1957, the
defeidants also did not, as they so easily could have done,
nor did the District Court exercising power sua sponte
over its own calendar, take any step to put a definitive
end to the case and thereby fix an unequivocal terminal
date for appealability. The undesirability of useless
delays in litigation is more than offset by the hazardi
of .confusion or misunderstanding as to the time for
appeal.
It wat the District Court's order of March 25, 1957, dismissing "this cause of action," that constituted the final
judgment in the case. It directed "that all relief be
denied" and required "the clerk [to] enter judgment"
accordingly (Rule 58). The appeal of April 16, 1957, was
taken within 30 days from the date of entry of the judg-

ment and hence was timely under 73 (a) of Federal Rules.
of Civil Procedure.
The writ of certiorari is granted and the judgment of
the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded
to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion.
So or'dered.
