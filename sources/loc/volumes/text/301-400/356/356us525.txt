BYRD v. BLUE RIDGE RURAL ELECTRIC
COOPERATIVE, INC.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 57. Argued January 28, 1958.-Restored to the calendar for
reargument March 3, 1958.-Reargued April 28-29,
1958.-Decided May 19, 1958.
Basing jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship, petitioner sued in the
Federal District Court to recover for injuries allegedly caused by
respondent's negligence. Respondent asserted as an affirmative
defense that petitioner was respondent's employee for purposes of
the State Workmen's Compensation Act and that the Act provided
petitioner's exclusive remedy. After hearing respondent's evidence
on this issue, the trial judge struck the defense without hearing
petitioner's evidence. The Court of Appeals, holding that under
state law respondent had established its defense, reversed and
directed that judgment be entered for respondent. Held: Judgment reversed and cause remanded. Pp. 526-540.
1. The Court of Appeals erred in directing judgment for respondent without allowing petitioner an opportunity to present evidence
on the issue of respondent's affirmative defense. Pp. 528-533.
2. Notwithstanding state decisions holding that this statutory
defense must be decided by the judge alone, petitioner is entitled
in a federal court to have the factual issues raised by the defense
presented to the jury. Pp. 533-540.
(a) The state rule requiring judge determination of this defense
is not so bound up with state-created rights and obligations as to
require its application in federal courts under Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64. Pp. 535-536.
(b) Although jury determination of the issue may substantially affect the outcome of the case, the policy of Guaranty Trust
Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, does not invariably prevail over an
affirmative federal policy favoring jury determination of disputed
factual questions. Pp. 536-539.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case was brought in the District Court for the
Western District of South Carolina. Jurisdiction was
based on diversity of citizenship. 28 U. S. C. § 1332.
The. petitioner, a resident of North Carolina, sued
respondent, a South Carolina corporation, for damages
for injuries allegedly caused by the respondent's negligence. He had judgment on a jury verdict. The Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and directed
the entry of judgment for the respondent. 238 F. 2d
346. We granted certiorari, 352 U. S. 999, and subsequently ordered reargument, 355 U. S. 950.
The respondent is in the business of selling electric
power to subscribers in rural sections of South Carolina.
The petitioner was employed as a lineman in the constructioh crew of a construction contractor: The contractor, R. H. Bouligny, Inc., held a contract with the
respondent in the amount of $334300 for the buiiding
of. some -24 miles of new power lines, the reconversion tohigher capacities of about 88 miles of existing lines, and
the cohstruction of 2 new substations and a breaker sta-

tion. The petitioner was injured while connecting power
lines to one of the new substations.
One of respondent's affirmative defenses was that,
under the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Act,1
the petitioner-because the work contracted to be done
by his employer was work of the kind also done by the
respondent's own construction and maintenance crewshad the status of a statutory employee of the respondent
and was therefore barred from suing the respondent at law
because obliged to accept statutory compensation benefits as the exclusive remedy for his injuries.2 Two ques'S. C. Code, 1952, provides:
"§ 72-111. Liability of owner to workmen of subcontractor.
"When any person, in this section and §§ 72-113 and 72-114
referred t8 as 'owner,' undertakes to perform or execute any work
which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts
with aniy other person (in this section and §§ 72-113 to 72-116
referred to as 'subcontractor') for the execution or performance by
or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work
undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any
workman employed in the work any compensation under this Title
which he would have been liable to pay if the worlman had been
immediately employed by him."
"§ 72-121. Employees' rights under Title exclude all ohers against
employer.
"The rights and remedies granted by this Title to an employee
when he and his employer have accepted the provisions of this Title,
respectively, to pay and accept compensation on account of personal
injury or death by accident, shall exclude all other rights and remedies
of such employee, his personal representative, parents, dependents or
next of kin as against his employer, at common law or otherwise, on
account of such injury, loss of service or death."
"§ 72-123. Only one remedy available.
"Either the acceptance of an award under this Title or the procurement and collection of a judgment in an action at law shall be
a bar to proceeding further with the alternate remedy."
2 In earlier proceedings the case was dismissed on the ground that
the respondent, a nonprofit corporation, was immune from tort liability under South Carolina law. 118 F. Supp. 868. The Court of
Appeals reversed and remanded the case for trial. 215 F. 2d 542.

tions concerning this defense are before us: (1) whether
the Court of Appeals erred in- directing judgment for
respondent without a remand to give petitioner an opportunity to introduce further evidence; and (2) whether
petiioner, state practice notwithstanding, is entitled to a
jury determination of the factual issues raised by this
defense.
I°.

The Supreme Court of South Carolina has held that
there is no particular formula by which to determine
whether an owner is a statutory employer under § 72-111.
:In Smith v. Fulmer, 198 S. C. 91, 97, 15 S. E. 2d 681, 683,
t;he State Supreme Court said:
"And the opinion in the Marchbanks case [Marchbanks v. Duke Power Co., 190 S. C. 336, 2 S. E. 2d
825, said to be the "leading case" under the statute]
reminds us that. while the language of the statute is
plain and unambiguous, there are so many different
factual situations which may arise that no easily
applied formula can be laid down for the determination of all cases. In other words, 'it is often a matter
of extreme difficulty to decide whether the Work in a
given case falls within the designation of the statute.
It is in each case largely a question of degree and of
fact.'"
The respondent's manager testified on direct examination that three of its substations were built by the
responddnt's own construction and maintenance crews.
When pressed on cross-examination, however, his answers
left his testimony in such doubt as to-lead the trial judge
to say, "I understood he changed his testimony, that they
had *notbuilt three." But the credibility of the manager's testimony, and the general question whether the
eyidence in support of the affirmative defense presented

Opinion of the Court.

a jury issue, became irrelevant because of the interpretation given § 72-111 by the trial judge. In striki-ag
respondent's affirmative defense at the close of all the
evidence 3 he ruled that the respondent was the statutory
employer of the petitioner only if the construction work
done by respondent's crews was done for somebody el3e,
and was not the statutory employer if, as the proofs
showed, the crews built facilities only for the respbr.dent's own use. "Myidea of engaging in the business is
to do something for somebody else. What they [the
respondent] are doing-and everything they do about
-repairing lines and building substations, they do it ror
themselves." On this view of the meaning of the statute, the evidence, even accepting the manager's teEtimony on direct examination as true, lacked.,proof of an
essential element of the affirmative defens, and th re
was thus nothing for the petitioner to meet wiih proof of
his own.
The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District
Court's construction of § 72-111. Relying on the decisions of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, among
others, in Marchbanks v. Duke Power Co., 190 S. C.
336, 2 S.E. 2d 825, and Boseman v. Pacific Mills, 193
S. C. 479, 8 S.E. 2d 878, the Court of Appeals held that
the statute granted -.-spondent immunity from the action
if the proofs established that the respondent's own crews
had constructed lines and substations which, like the work
contradted to the petitioner's employer, were necessary
for the distribution of the electric power which the
respondent was in the business of selling. We ordinarily
accept the interpretation of local law by the Court of

Appeals, cf. Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., 337 U. S.
530, 534, and do so readily here since neither party now
disputes the interpretation.
However, instead of ordering a new trial at which the
petitioner might offer his own proof pertinent to a determination according to the correct interpretation, the
Court of Appeals made its own determination on the
record and directed a judgment for the respondent. The
court noted thatithe Rural Electric Cooperative Act of
South Caroiina I authorized the respondent to construct,
acquire, maintain, and operate electric generating plants,
buildings, and equipment, and any and all kinds of
property which might be necessary or convenient to
accomplish the purposes for which the corporation was
organized, and pointed out that the work contracted to the
petitioner's employer was of the class which respondent
was empowered by its charter to perform.
The court resolved tle uncertainties in the manager's
testimony in a manner largely favorable to the respondent: "The testimony with respect to the construction of
the substations of Blue Ridge, stated most favorably to
the . . . [petitioner], discloses that originally Blue Ridge
built three substations with its own facilities, but that all
of the substations which were built after the war, including the six it was operating at the time of the accident,
were constructed for it by independent contractors, and
that at the time of the accident it.had no one in its direct
employ capable of handling the technical detail of substation construction." 238 F. 2d 346, 350.
The court found that the respondent financed the work
contracted to the petitioner's employer with a loan from
the United States, purchased the materials used in the
work, and entered into an engineering service contract
with :an independent engineering company for the design

and supervision of the work, concluding from these findings that "the main. actor in the whole enterprise was the
Cooperative itself." Ibid.
Finally, the court held that its findings entitled the
respondent to the direction of a judgment in its favor.
".. . [T]here can be no doubt that Blue Ridge was not
only in the business of supplying electricity to rural
communities, but also in the business of constructing the
lines and substations.necessary for the distribution of the
product . . . ." Id., at 351.
While the matter is not adverted to in the court's
opinion, implicit in the direction of verdict is the holding
that the petitioner, although having no occasion to do so
under the District Court's erroneous construction of the
statute, was not entitled to an opportunity to meet the
respondent's case under the correct interpretation. That
holding is also implied in the court's denial, without opinion, of petitioner's motion for a rehearing sought on the
ground that ". . . [T]he direction to enter judgment for
the defendant instead of a direction to grant a new trial
denies plaintiff his right to introduce evidence in contradiction to that of the defendant on the issue of defendant's
affrmative defense, a right which he would have exercised if the District Judge had ruled adversely to him
on his motion to dismiss, and thus deprives him of hifconstitutional right to a jury trial on a factual issue."
We believe that the Court of Appeals erred. We do
not agree with the petitioner's argument in this Court
that the respondent's evidence was insufficient to withstand the motion to strike the defense and that he is
entitled to our judgrment reinstating the judgment of the
District-Court. But the petitioner is entitled to have th.-question determined in the trial court. This would be
necessary even if petitioner offered no proof of his own.
Although the respondent's evidence was sufficient to
withstand the motion under the meaning given the

356 U. S.

statute by the Court of Appeals, it presented a fact
question, which, in the circumstances of this case to be
discussed infra, is properly to be decided by a jury. This
is clear not only because of the issue of. the credibility of
the manager's vital testimony, but also because, even
should the jury resolve that issue as did the Court of
Appeals, the jury on the entire record--consistent with
the view of the South Carolina cases that this question
is in each case largely one of degree and of fact-might
reasonably reach an opposite conclusion from the Court
of Appeals as to the ultimate fact whether the respondent
was a statutory employer.
At all events, the petitioner is plainly entitled to have
an opportunity to try the issue under the Court of
Appeals' interpretation. His motion to dismiss the affirmative defense, properly viewed, was analogous to a
defendant's motion for involuntary dismissal of an action
after the plaintiff has completed the presentation of his
evidence. Under Rule 41 (b) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, in such case "the defendant, without
waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion
is not granted, may move for dismissal on the ground that
upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right
to relief." The respondent argues, however, that before
the trial judge ruled on the petitioner's motion, the petitioner's counsel, in effect, conceded that he had no other
evidence to offer and was submitting the issue of whether
-the respondent was a statutory employer on the basis
of the evidence already in the case. The judge asked
petitioner's counsel: "fn the event I overrule your motion,
do you contemplate putting up any'testimony in reply?"
Counsel answered: "We haven't discussed it, but we are
making that motion. I frankly don't know at this point
of any reply that is necessary. I don't know of any evidence in this case-." The interruption which prevented
counsel's completion of the answer was the trial judge's

comment: "I am inclined to think so far it is a question of
law but I will hear from Mr. Walker [respondent's co6unsel] on that. I don't know of any issue of fact to submit
to the jury. It seems to me under the testimony here
there has been-I don't know of any conflict in the testimony., so far as that's concerned, so far." The judge
turned to respondent's counsel and there followed a long
colloquy with him,5 at the conclusion of which the judge.
dismissed the defense upon the ground that under his
interpretation of the statute the defense was not sustained
without evidence that the respondent's business involved
the doing of work for others of the kind done by the
petitioner's employer for the respondent. Upon this record it plainly cannot be said that the petitioner submitted
the issue upon the evidence in the case and conceded that
he had no evidence of his own to offer. The petitioner
was fully justified in that circumstance in not coming
forward with proof of- his own at that stage of the proceedings, for he had nothing to meet under the District
Court's view of the statute. He thus cannot be penalized
by the denial of his day in court to try the issue under the
correct interpretation of the statute. Cf. Fountain v.
Filson, 336 U. S. 681;" Weade v. Dichmann, Wright &
Pugh, Inc., 337 U. S. 801; Globe Liquor Co. v. San Roman,

U. S. 212.

A question is also presented as to whether on remand
the factual issue k to be decided by the judge or by the
jury. The respondent argues on the basis of the decision
of the Supreme Court of South Carolina in Adams v. Da5The only renmarks thereafter made by the petitioner's counsel

affirmative defense.

vison-Paxon Co., 230 S. C. 532, 96 S. E. 2d 566, that the
issue of immunity should be decided by the judge and
not by the jury. That was a negligence action brought in
the st.te trial court against a store owner by an employee
of an independent contractor who operated the store's
millinery department. The trial judge denied the store
owner's motion for a directed verdict made upon the
ground that § 72-111- barred the plaintiff's action. The
jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The South Carolina Supreme Court reversed, holding that it was for the.
judge and not the jury to decide on the evidence whether
the owner was a statutory employer, and that the store
owner had sustained his defense. The court rested its
holding on decisions, listed in footnote 8, infra, involving
judicial review of the Industrial Commission and said:
"Thus the trial court should have in this case resolved the conflicts in the evidence and determined
the fact of whether . . [the independent contractor] was performing a part of the 'trade, business
or occupation' of the department store-appellant and,
therefore, whether . . . [the employee's] remedy is
exclusively under the Workmen's Compensation
Law." 230 S. C., at 543, 96 S. E. 2d, at 572.
The respondent argues that this state-court decision
governs the present diversity case and "divests. the jury
of its normal function" to decide the disputed fact question of the respondent's immunity under § 72-111. This
is to contend that the federal court is bound under Erie
R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, to follow the state
court's holding to secure uniform enforcement of the
immunity created by the State.7

The decision came down several months after the Court of Appeals

Opinion of the Court.

First. It was decided in Erie R Co. v. Tompkins that
the federal courts in diversity cases must respect tlfe definition of state-created rights and obligations by the state
courts. We must, therefore, first examine the rule in
Adams v. Davison-Paxon Co. to determine whether it is
bound up with these rights and obligations in such a way
that its application in the federal court is required.
Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, 308 U. S. 208.
The Workmen's Compensation Act is administered in
South Carolina by its Industrial Commission. The South
Carolina courts hold that, on judicial review of actions of
the Commission under § 72-111, the question whether the
claim of an injured workman is within the Commission's
jurisdiction is a matter of law for decision by the court,
which makes its own findings of fact relf.ting to that jurisliction.8 The South Carolina Supreme Court states no
-easons in Adams v. Davison-Paxon Co. why, although
the jury decides all other factual issues raised by the cause
of action and defenses, the jury is displaced as to the factuil issue raised by the affirmative defense under § 72-111.
The decisions cited to support the holding are those listed
in footnote 8, which are concerned solely with defining-the scope. and method of judicial review of the Indus313 U. S. 487; Guaranty Trust Co. '. York, 326 U. S. 99; Angel v.

trial Commission. A State may, of course, distribute the
functions of its judicial machinery as it sees fit. The
decisions relied upon, however, furnish no reason for
selecting the judge rather than the jury to decide this
single affirmative defense in the negligence action. They
simply reflect a policy, cf. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.
22, that administrative determination of "jurisdictional
facts" should not be final but subject to judicial review.
The conclusion is inescapable that the Adams holding is
grounded in the practical consideratioR that the question
had theretofore come before the South Carolina courts
from the Industrial Commission and the courts had
become accustomed to deciding the- factual issue of
immunity without the aid of juries. We find'no.thing. to
suggest that this rule was announced as an integral part
of the special relationship created by the statute. Thus
the reqiirement appears to be merely a form and- mode
of enforcing the immunity, Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,
326 U. S. 99, 108, and not a rule intended to be bound up
with the definition of the rights and obligations of the
parties. The situation -ls therefofe not -analogous to
that in Dice v. Akron, C. & Y. R. Co., 3.42 U. 8. 359,
where this Court held that the right to trial by jury is so
substantial- a part of the cause .of action created by the
Federal Employers' Liability Act that the Ohio courts
-could not apply, in an action under that statute, the Ohio
rule, that the question of fraudulent release was for
determination by a judge rather than by a jury.
Second. But' cases following Erie have evinced a
broader policy to the effect that the federal courts-should
conform as near as may be-in the absence of other considerations--to state rules even of form and mode where
the state rules may bear substantially on the question
wheiher the litigation would come out one way in the
federal court and another way in the state court if the fed-

eral court failed to apply a particular local rule.? E. g.,
Gu(.ranty Trust Co. v. York, supra; Bernhardt v. PolygraphicCo., 350 U. S. 198. Concededly the nature of the
tribunal which tries issues may .be important, in the
enforcement of the parcel. of rights niaking up a cause of
action or defense, and bear significantly upon achievement of uniform enforcement of the right. It may well
be that in the instant personal-injury case the outcome
would be substantially affected by whether the issue of
immunity is decided by a judge or a jury. Therefore,
were "outcome" the only consideration, a strong case
might appear for saying that the federal court shduld
follow the state practice.
But there are affirmative countervailing considerations
at work here. The federal system is an independent system for. administering justice to litigants who properly
invoke its jurisdiction. An essential characteristic of that
system is the manner in which, in civil conimon-law actions, it distributes trial functions between judge and jury
and, under the influence-if not the command -- of the
Seventh Amendment, assigns the decisions of disputed
questions of fact to the jury. Jacobv. New York, 315 U. S.

York, supra, cannot in every case exact compliance with
a state rule '2 -not bound up with rights and obligationswhich disrupts the federal system of allocating functions
between judge and jury. Herron v. Southern Pacific
Co., 283 U. S. 91. Thus the inquiry here is whether the
federal policy favoring jury decisions of disputed fact
questions should yield to the staterule in the interest of
furthering the objective that the litigation should not
come out one way in the federal court and another way
in the state court.
We think that in the circumstances of this case the federal court should not follow the state' rule. It cannot be
gainsaid that there is a strong federal policy against allowing state rules to disrupt the judge-jury relationship in
the federal courts. In Herron v.Southern Pacific Co.,
supra, the trial judge in a personal-injury negligence
action brought in the District Court for Arizona on
diversity grounds directed a verdict for the defendant
when it appeared as a matter of law that the plaintiff was
guilty of contributory negligence. The federal judge
refused to be bound by a provision of thie Arizona Constitution which made the jury the sole arbiter of the quesMcSweeney v. Prudential Ins. Co., 128 F. 2d 660 (C. A. 4th Cir.

tion of contributory negligence. 3 This Court sustained
the action of the trial judge, holding that "state laws
cannot alter the essential character or function of a federal court" because that function "is not in any sense a
local matter, and state statutes which would interfere
with the appropriate performance of that function are
not binding upon the federal court under either the
Conformity Act or the 'rules of decision' Act." Id., at
94. Perhaps even more clearly in light of the influence
of the Seventh Amendment, the function assigned to the
jury "is an essential factor in the process for which the

Polygraphic Co., supra. There are factors present here'
which might reduce that possibility. The trial judge in
the federal system has powers'deniefrthe judges of many
States to comment on the weight of evidence and credibility of witnesses and discretion to grant a new trial if the
verdict appears to him to be against the weight'of the
evidence. We do not think the likelihood of a different
result is so strong as to require the federal practice of
jury determination of disputed factual issues to yield to
the state rule in the interest of uniformity of outcome.15
The Court of- Appeals did not consider other grounds
of appeal raised by the respondent because the ground*
taken disposed of the case. We accordingly remand the
case to the Court of Appeals for the decision of the other
questions, with instructions that, if not made unnecessary
by the decision of such questions, the Court of Appeals
shall remand the case to the District Court for a new trial
of such issues as the Court of Appeals may direct.

In 1936 the South Carolina Legislature passed an Act
known as "The South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Law." S. C. Code, 1952, Tit. 72. It created a new,

It was there held that the federal court should follow the state rule
defining the evidenue sufficient to raise a jury question whether the
state-created right was established. But the state rule did not have
the effect of nullifying the funetion of the federal judge to control a
jury submission as did the Arizona constitutional provision which
was denied effect in Herron. The South Carolina rule here involved
affects the jury function as the Arizona provision affected the function
of the judge: The rule entirely -displaces the jury without regard to
the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury finding of immunity.

injuries sustained by the latter which arise "by accident

with or without fault of the employer. § 72-14. The
Act also prescribes the measure and nature of the remedy,2
which "shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such

otherwise, on account of such. injury" (§ 72-121), and
vests exclusive jurisdiction in the South Carolina Industrial Commission over all claims falling within the purview of the Act (§ 72-66), subject to review'by appeal to
the State's courts upon "errors of law." § 72-356.
Section 72-111expands the definition of the terms
"employee" and "employer" (note 1) by providing in
substance, that when an "'owner'" of premises "undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of
his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any
other person [called "subcontractor"] for the execution
or performance by or under such subcontractor of the
whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner,

in the work any compensation under this Title which he
would have been liable to pay if the workman had been
immediately employed by him." (Emphasis supplied.)
Employees of such subcontractors are commonly called
"statutory employees" of the "owner."
Petitioner, a lineman employed by a "subcontractor"

dent which arose out of and in the course of that employment. Subsequent to his injury he sought and received
the full benefits provided by the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Law.
Diiersity existing, petitioner then brought this common-law suit in a Federal District Court in South
Carolina against the "owner," the respondent here, for
damages for his bodily injury, which, he alleged, had.
resulted from the "owner's" negligence. The respond-'
ent-"bwner" answered setting up, among other defenses,.
the affirmative claim that petitioner's injury arose by
accident outof and in the course of his employment, as a
'lineman, by the subcontractor while executing the contracted work "which [was] a part of [the owner's] trade,
business or occupation." It urged, in consequence, that
petitioner was its "statutory employee" and that, thereford, his exclusive remedy was under the South Carolina
Workmen's Compensation Law, and that exclusive jurisdiction of the subject matter of his claim was vested in
the State's Industrial Commission and, hence, the federal
court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of this
common-law suit.
At the trial petitioner adduced evidence upon the issue
of negligence and rested his case in chief. Thereupon
respondent, in support of its affirmative defense, adduced
ev.,dence tending to show (1) that its charter, issued
under the Rural Electric Cooperative Act of South Carolina (S. C. Code, 1952, § 12-1025), authorized it to
construct and operate electric generating plants and
transmission lines essential to its business of generating
and distributing electricity; (2) that it had (before the
Second World War) constructed substations with its own
direct employees and facilities, although the six substations which it was operating at'the time petitioner was
injured had been built by contractors, and that when

petitioner was injured it did not have in its direct employ
any person capable of constructing a substation; 1 (3) that
it regularly employed a crew of 16 men-8 linemen and
8 groundmen-two-thirds of wlose time was spent in
constructing new transmission lines and extensions, and
that such was "a part of [its] traae, business [and)
occupation." This evidence stood undisputed when
respondent rested its case.
At the close of respondent's evidence petitioner moved
to strike respondent's affirmative jurisdictional defense,
and all evidence adduced in support of it. Respondent
made known to the court that when petitioner had rested
it wished to move for a directed verdict in its favor.

Court sustained petitioner's motion and struck respondenVs affirmative jurisdictional defense and its supporting evidence from the record. His declared basis for that
action was that the phrase in § 72-111 "a part of his
trade, business or occupation" related only to work being
performed by the "owner" "for somebody else." ThereFURTER'S

3 As I see it, thv evidence referred to in "(1)" is only collaterally
i:Aterial, and that referred to in "(2)" is wholly immaterial, to the
issue of whether petitioner was respondent's statutory employee
at the time of the injury, because tLat question, under the South
Carolina Workmen's Compensation Law, does not depend upon what
particular trade, business er occupation the "owner" lawfully might
pursue, or lawfully might have pursued in the past. Rather, it
depends upon what work he is engaged in at the time of the
injury-i. e., whether the contracted work "is a part of [the owner's]
trade, business or occupation." Ihe statute thus speaks in the
present tense, and, hence, the relevant inquiry here is limited to
whether the work being done by petitioner for the "owner" at the
time of the injury was a part of the trade, business, or occupation
of the "owner" at that time.

after, the district judge heard arguments upon and overruled respondeni's motion f(r a directed verict,4 and
submitted the cas6 to the jury which returned a verdict
for petitioner.
Qn appeal, the Court of Alppeals found that the district judge's construction of § 72-111 was not supportable
under controlling South Carolina decisions. It further
found that respondent's evidence disclosed that respondent "was not only in the business of supplying electricity
to rural communities, but [was] also in the business of
constructing the lines and substations necessarf for the
distribution of the product," and that the contracted work
was of like nature and, hence, was "a part of [respondent's] 'trade, business or occupation," within the meaning
of § 72-111, and, therefore, petitioner was respondent's
statutory employee, and, hence, the court was without
jurisdiction over the subjdct matter of the claim. Upon
this basis, it reversed the judgment of the District Court

with directions to enter judgment for respondent. 238 F.

This Court now vacates the judgment of'the Court

Court of Appeals, respondent's evidence was ample, prima
facie, to sustain its affirmative jurisdictional defensepetitioner had not waived his. right to adduce evidence
in rebuttal upon that issue, in other words had not
"rested," at the time the district judge erroneously struck
respondent's jurisdictional defense and supporting evidence from the record. In these circumstances, I believe
that the judgment of the Court of Appeals, insofar as it
directed the District Court to enter judgment for respondent, would deprive petitioner of his legal right,
which he had not waived, to adduce evidence which he
claims to have and desires to offer in rebuttal of respondent's prima facie established jurisdictional defense. The
p-ocedural situation then existing was not legally different from a case in which a defendant, without resting,
moves, at the close of the plaintiff's case, for a directed
verdict in its favor which the court erroneously sustains,
.and, on appeal, is'reversed for that error. It could not
fairly be contended, in those circumstances, that the appellate court might properly direct the trial court to enter
judgment for the plaintiff and thus deprive the defendant,
who had not rested, of his right to offer evidence in defense
of plaintiff's case. Rule 50, Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. It is'
urged by respondent that, from the colloquy between the
district judge and counsel, which, as stated, is set forth
in substance in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTE!R'S dissenting
opinion, it appears that petitioner had "rested," and thus
had waived his right to adduce rebuttal evidence upon
the issue of respondent's jurisdictional defense, before
the district judge sustained his motion to strike 'that
defense and the supporting evidence. But my analysis
of the record convinces me that petitioner, in fact, never
did so. For this reason I believe that so much of the
judgment of the Court of Appeals as directed the District
Court-to enter judgment for respondent deprives petitioner of his right to adduce rebuttal evidence upon the

issue of respondent's prima facie established jurisdictional
defense, and, therefore, cannot stand.
But the Court's opinion proceeds to discuss and determine the question whether, upon remand to the District
CourtT if such becomes necessary, the jurisdictional issue
is to be determined by the judge or by the jury-a question which, to my mind, is premature, not now properly
before us, and is one we need not and should not now
reach for or decide. The Court, although premising its
conclusion "upon the assumption that the outcome of the
litigation may be substantially affected by whether the
issue of immunity 5 is decided by a judge or a jury," holds
that the issue is to be determined by a jury-not by the
judge. I cannot agree to this conclusion for the following reasons.
As earlier shown, the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Law creates a new, complete, detailed and
exclusive bundle of rights respecting the compensation
by an "employer" of his "employee" for bodily injuries
sustained by the latter which arise by accident out of and
in the course of the employment, regardless of fault, and
vests exclusive jurisdiction in the State's Industrial Commission over all such claims, subject to review by appeal
in the South Carolina courts only upon "errors of law."
Consonant with § 72-66, which vests exclusive jurisdiction over such claims in the Commission, and with
§ 72-356, which allows judicial review only upon "errors
of law," the Supreme Court of the State has uniformly
held that the question, in cases like the present, whether
5 Here, as at other places in its opinion, the Court treats with
the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Law as an "immunity"
of the employer from liability. To me, the question is not one . of
immunity. Rather, it is which of two tribunals--the Industrial
Commission or the court of general jurisdiction-has jurisdiction,
to the exclusion of the other, over the subject matter of the action,
and, hence, the power to award relief upon it.

jurisdiction over such claims is vested in the Industrial
Commission or in the courts presents a question of law
for determination'by thle court, not a jury. In Adams v.
Davison-PaxonCo., 230 S. C. 532, 96 S. E. 2d 566 (1957),
which appears to be the last case by the Supreme Court'
of the State on the question, plaintiff, an employee of a
concessionaire operating the millinery department in defendant's store, was injured, she claimed by negligence,
while using a stairway in the store. She brought a common-law suit for damages against the owner of the store.
The latter defended upon the ground, among others, that
the operation of the millinery department, though under
a contract with the concessionaire, plaintiff's employer,
was "a part of [its] trade, business or occupation," that
the plaintiff was therefore its statutory employee under
§ 72-111 and exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter
of plaintiff's claim was vested in the Industrial Commission, and that the court was without jurisdiction over the
subject matter in her common-law suit. It seems that
the trial court submitted this issue, along with others, to
the jury which returned a verdict for plaintiff. On appeal
the Supreme Court of the State reversed, saying:
"It has been consistently held that whether the
claim of an injured workman is within the jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission is a matter of law
for decision by the Court, which includes the finding
of the facts which relate to jurisdiction. Knight v.

It thus seems to be settled under -the South Carolina
Workmen's Compensation Law, and the decisions of the
highest court of that State construing it, that the question
whether exclusive jurisdiction, in cases like this, is vested
in its Industrial Commission or in its courts of general
jurisdiction is one for decision by the court, not by a jury.
The Federal District Court, in this diversity case, is bound
to follow the substantive South Carolina law that would
be applied if the trial were to be held in a South Carolina
court, in which State the Federal District Court sits.
Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S.64. A Federal District
Court sitting in South Carolina may not legally.reach a
substantially- different result than would have been
reached upon a trial of the same case "in a State court
a block away." Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S.
99, 109.
The Court's opinion states: "Concededly the nature
of the tribunal which tries issues may be important in the
enforcement of the parcel of rights making up a cause of
action or defense, and bear significantly upon achievement of uniform enforcement of the right. It may well
be that in the instant personal-injury case the outcome

Opinion of WrrTAm, J.

would be substantially affected by whether the issue of
immunity is decided by a judge or a jury." And the
Court premises its conclusion "upon the assumption that
the outcome of the litigation may-be substantially affected by whether the issue of imminity is decided'by a
judge or a jury." Upon that premise, the Court's con-.
clusion, to my mind, is contrary to our cases. "Here [as
in Guaranty 'Trust Co. v. York, supra] we are dealing
with a right to recover derived not from the United States
but from one of the States. When, because the plaintiff
happens to be a non-resident, such a right is enforceable
in a federal as well as in a State court, the forms and
mode of enforcing the right may at times, naturally
enough, vary because the two judicial systems are not
identic. But since a federal court adjudicating a Statecreated right solely because of the diversity of citizenship
of the parties is for that purpose, in effect, only another
court of the State, it cannot afford recovery if the right
to recover is made unavailable by the State nor can it substantially affect the enforcement of the right as given by
the State." Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra, at 108109. (Emphasis supplied.)
The words "substantive" and "procedural" are mere
conceptual labels and in no sense talismanic. To call a
legal question by one or the other of those terms does not
resolve the question otherwise than as a purely authoritarian performance. When a question though denominated "procedural" is nevertheless so "substantive" as
materially to affect the result of a trial, federal courts, in
enforcing state-created rights, are not free to disregard
it, on the ground that it is "procedural," for such would
be to allow, upon mere nomenclature, a different result
in a state court from that allowable in a federal court
though both are, in effect, courts of the State and "sitting
side by side." Kaxon Co. v. Stentor Co., 313 U. S. 487,

by rules of procedure which it has acquired from the
Federal Government and which therefore are not identical
with those of the state courts. Yet, in spite of that dif-ference in procedure, the federal court enforcing a statecreated right in a diversity case is, as we said in Guaranty
Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 108, in substance 'only
another court of the State.' The federal court threfore
may not 'substantially affect the enforcement of the right
as given by the State.' Id., 109." Bernhardt v. Poly'graphic Co., 350 U. S. 198; 202-203. (Emphasis supplied:) "Where local law qualifies or abridges [the right],
.the federal court must follow suit. Otherwise there is a
different measure of the cause of action in one court than
in the other, and the principle of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins is transgressed.". Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co.,
337 U. S. 530, 533. "It is therefore immaterial whether
[state-created rights] are characterized either as 'sub-.
stantive' or 'procedural' in State court opinions in any
use of those terms unrelated to the specific issue before
us. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins was not an endeavor. to
formulate scientific legal terminology. It expressed a
policy that touches vitally the proper distribution of judicial power between State and federal courts. In essence,
the intent of that decision was to insure that, in all cases
where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely
because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the
outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be
substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the
outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in :a State
court. The nub of the policy that underlies Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins is that for the same transaction the accident
of a suit by a non-resident litigant in a federal court
instead of in a State court a block away should not lead'
to a substantially different result. And so, putting to
one side abstractions regarding 'substance' and 'procedure,' we have held that in diversity cases the-federal

courts must follow the law of the State . . . ." Guaranty
Trust Co. v. York, supra, at 109. (Emphasis supplied.)
Inasmuch as the law of South Carolina, as construed.
by its highest -ort, requires its courts---not juries-to
determine whether jurisdiction over the subject matter
of cases like this is vested in its Industrial Commission,
and inasmuch as the Court's opinion concedes "that in'
the instant personal-injury case the outcome would be
substantially affected by whether the issue of immunity
is decided by a judge or a jury," it follows that in this
diversity case the jurisdictional issue must be determined
by the judge-not by the jury. Insofar as the Court
holds that the question of jurisdiction should be determined by the jury, I think the Court departs from its
past decisions. I therefore respectfully dissent from
part II of the opinion of the Court.

This is a suit for common-law negligence, brought in a
United States District Court in South Carolina because
of diversity of citizenship, 28 U. S. C. § 1332. Respondent is a cooperative, organized and operating under the
South Carolina Rural Electric Cooperative Act, S. C.
Code, 1952, § 12-1001 et seq., engaged in distributing
electric power to its members, and extending the availability of power to new users, in rural areas of the State.
Incident to the expansion of its facilities and services, it
had made a contract with R. H. Bouligny, Inc., whereby
the latter was to construct 24.19 miles of new power lines,
to rehabilitate and convert to higher capacity 97.69 miles
of existing lines, and to construct two substafions and a
breaker station. In the execution of this contract, petitioner, a citizen of N orth Carolina, and a lineman for
Bouligny, was seriously burned when he attempted to
make a connection between the equipment in one of the

a mistake on the part of another of Bouligny's employees,
current was. running. Petitioner filed a claim against
Bouligny pursuant to the South Carolina Workmen's
Compensation Law, S. ,C. Code, 1952, § 72-1 et seq.,
under which both Bouligny and respondent operated, and
recQvered the full benefits under the Law. He then
brought this suit.
Respondent defended on the ground, among others,
that, since petitioner-was injured in the eiecution of his
true employer's (Bouligny's) cohtract with respondent to
perform a part of its "trade, business or occupation,"
respondent was petitioner's "statutory employer" -and

therefore liable to petitioner undr§ 72-111 of the State's
Workmen's Compensation -Law.' It would follow from
this that petitioner, by virtue of his election to proceed
against Bouligny, was barred from proceeding against
respondent, either under the statute or at common law
(§§ 72-121, 72-123).' After all the evidence was in, the

.court granted petitioner's motion to strike the defense,
on the ground that an activity could not be a part of a
firm's "trade, business or occupation" unless it was being
performed "for somebody else." The court also denied
respondent's motion for a directed verdict and submitted the case to the jury, which returned a verdict for
petitioner in the amount-of $126,786.80.
On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit found the District Court's construction of
§ 72-111 unsupportable under controlling South Carolina
decisions.3 In concluding that respondent had sustained,
its defense, the appellate -court cited the following evidence elicited at trial. Respondent employed-a sixteenman "outside crew," two-thirds of whose time was spent
in such construction work as building new power lines
and extensibns; since World War II the demand for electrical service- had been so great that independent contractors had to be employed to do much of the necessary
construction work. All of respondent's construction
work, regardless of who was actually performing it,. was
done under the supervision of an engineering firm with
which respondent -has an engineering service contract.
Testimony as to the construction of substations was not
altogether consistent; however, stated most favorably to
petitioner-and that is the light in which the Court of
Appeals considered it-that evidence was to the effectdependents or next of kin as against his employer, at common law
or otherwise, on account of such injury, loss of service or death.
"§ 72-123. Only one remedy available.

"Either the acceptance of an award under this Title or the procurement and collection of a judgment in an action at law shall be
a'bar to proceeding further with the alternate remedy."

that respondent had with its own facilities .constructed

itwas operating at the time-petitioner was injured, nor
was respondent at that time employing personnel capable
of constructing substations. The construction work in
connection with which petitioner was injured was clearly

respondent's duty to serve the area in which if operated.
Finally, respondent was the 'main actor" in this particular construction project: it secured the necessary
financing; its consulting engineer prepared the plans
(approved by respondent) and supervised the construction; it purchased the materials of which the substations
were constructed; it had the responsibliity of de-energizing and re-energizing existing lines that were involved in
the work. From this evidence the Court of Appeals was
satisfied that "there can be no doubt that Blue Ridge was
not only in the business of supplying electricity to rural
communities, but also in the business of constructing the
lines and substations necessary for the distribution of the
product," 238 F. 2d 346, 351. The Court of Appeals, having concluded that respondent's defense should have been
sustained, directed the District Court to enter judgment
for the respondent. The-District Court-had decided the
question of whether or -n6i respondent was g-statutb6ry
employer without submittifig it to the jury. It is not
altogether clear whether it did so because it thought it
essentially a nonjury issue, as it is in the South Carolina
courts under Adams .'. Davison-Paxon Co., 230 S. C. 532,
96 S. E. 2d 566, or because there was no controverted
question of fact to submit to the jury.
The construction of the state law by the Court of Appeals is clearly supported by the decisions of the Supreme
Court of South Carolina, and s- .e need not rest on the

usual respect to be accorded to a reading of a local statute by a Federal Court of Appeals. Estate of Spiegel v.
Commissioner, 335 U. S. 701, 708. It is clear from the
state cases that a determination as to Whether a defendant is an "employer" for purposes of § 72-111 will depend
upon the entire circumstances of the relationship between
such defendant and the work being done on its behalf;
no single factor is determinative. Both the approach of
the Court of. Appeals and the conclusions that it reached
from the evidence in this case are entirely consistent with
prior declarations of South Carolina law by the highest
court of that State.'
In holding respondent a statutory employer, the Court
of Appeals was giving the South Carolina Workmen's
Compensation -Law the liberal construction called for by
the Supreme Court of that State. In Yeomans v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 198 S. C. 65, 72, 15 S. E. 2d 833, 835,
that court said:
"[T]he basic purpose of the Compensation Act is
the inclusion of employers and employees, and not
their exclusion; and we add that doubts of jurisdiction must be resolved in favor of'inclusion rather
than exclusion."
It would be short-sighted to overlook the fact that exclusion of an employer in a specific case such as this one
For example, whether or not the defendant had ever itself performed the work contracted out has not been thought to be a conclusive criterion. In fact, in Boseman v. Pacific Mills, 193 S. C. 479,
8 S. E. 2d 878, the.court rejected the defendant's contention that,
because it had never performed the work in question, it could not
be held an employer. See also Hopkins v. Darlington Veneer Co.,
208 S. C. 307, 38 S. E. 2d 4; Kennerly v. Ocmulgee Lumber Co.,
206 S. C. 481, 34 S. E. 2d 792. Nor is the question whether or not
the accomplishment of the work involved requires specialized skill
determinative. See Marchbanks v. Duke Power Co., 190 S. C. 336,
2 S. E. 2d 825.

.When, after the evidence was in, petitioner moved
to strike respondent's defense based on § 72-111, the
following colloquy ensued:

may wish to move for a directed verdict on that
ground since it is a question of law. But that is his
prerogative after all the evidence is in. Of course,

"Mr. Hammer: We are moving at this time in the
nature of a voluntary dismissal.
"Jhe Court': You move to dismiss that defense?
"Mr. Hammer: Yes, sir, at this stage of the
game."
After argument by counsel, the court made its ruling,
granting petitioner's motion. Respondent having indicated its-intention to move for, a directed verdict, the
court then said, "I will allow you to include ii that
Motion for Directed Verdict your defense which-I have
stricken, if you desire ... " 'Respondent's motion was
overruled.
It is apparent that petitioner had no intention of introducing any evidence on the issue of whether respondent
was his statutory employer and that he was prepared
to-and did-submit the issue to the court on that basis.
Clearly petitioner cannot be -said 'to have relied upon,
and thus to have been misled by, the court's erroneous
construction of the law, for it was before the court had
disclosed its view of the law that petitioner made
apparent his willingness to submit the issue to it on the
basis of respondent's evidence. If petitioner could have
cast any doubt on that evidence or could have brought
in any other matter relevant to the issue, it was his duty
to bring it forward before the issue was submitted to the
court. For counsel to withhold evidence on an issue submitted for decision until after that issue has been resolved
against him would be an abuse of the judicial process that
this Court surely sliould not countenance, however strong
the philanthropic appeal in a particular case. Nor does.

it appear that petitioner had any such "game" in mind.
He gave not the slightest indication of an intention to
introduce any additional evidence, no matter how the
court might deeide the issue. It seems equally clear
that, had the trial court decided the issue-on any construction-in favor of the respondent, the petitioner was
prepared to rely solely upon his right of appeal.
We are not to read the record as though we are making
an independent examination of the trial proceedings.
We are sitting in judgment on the Court of Appeals'
review of the record, That court, including Chief
Judge Parker and Judge Soper, two of the most experienced and esteemed circuit judges in -the federal
judiciary, interpreted the record as it did in light of its
knowledge of local practice and of the ways of local
lawyers. In ordering judgment entered for respondent,
it necessarily concluded, as a result of its critical examination of the record, that petitioner's counsel chose to
have the issue decided on the basis of the record as it then
-stood. The determination of the Court of Appeals can
properly be reversed only if it is found that it was baseless. Even granting that the record is susceptible of two
interpretations, it is to disregard the relationship of this
Court to the Courts of Appeals, especially as to their
function in appeals in diversity cases, to substitute our
view for theirs.
The order of the Court of Appeals that the District
Court enter judgment for the respondent is amply sustained on either theory as to whether or not the issue was
one for the court to decide. If the question is for the
court, the Court of Appeals has satisfactoily resolved .
it in accordance with state decisions. And if, on -the
other hand, the issue is such that it would have to be
submitted to the jury if there were any crucial facts in
controversy, both the District Court and the Court of
Appeals agreed that there was no conflict as to the rele-

vant evidence-not, at any rate, if such inconsistency as
existed was resolved in favor of petitioner. According
to the governing view of South Carolina law, as given us
by the Court of Appeals, that evidence would clearly have
required the District Court to grant a directed verdict
to the respondent. Accordingly, I would affirm the
judgment.

ion, but desire to add two further reasons why I believe
the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
As I read that court's opinioi, it held that under South
Carolina law the construction of facilities needed to transmit electric power was necessarily a part of the business
of furnishiig power, whether such cofstruction was performed by the respondent itself or let out to others, and
that in either 6ase respondent would be liable to petitioner for compensation as his statutory employer. Since
there is no dispute that respondent at the time of the
accident was engaged in the business of furnishing power
and that petitioner was injured while engaged in construction in furtherance of that business, I do not perceive how any further evidence which might be adduced
by petitioner could change the result reached by the
Court of Appeals. In any event, in the circumstancesdisclosed by the record before us, we should at the very
least require petitioner to make some showing here of the
character of the further evidence he expects to introduce
before we disturb the judgment below.
