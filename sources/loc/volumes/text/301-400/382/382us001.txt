dissenting.

Appellant is a Kentucky corporation engaged in a mailorder loan business in thirty-two States. It has no
offices, no agents, no employees, and no property in California. It solicits loans from California residents by
mail; after a credit report is prepared by a local independent contractor, the loan application is passed on by
appellant's officers in Kentucky. If the loan is approved,
the check is mailed to the borrower from Kentucky.

Because appellant failed to obtain a license from the State
of California and pay the annual $200 fee, appellee
sought and obtained an injunction barring appellant
from conducting its out-of-state small-loan business until
the requisite California license was obtained. In order
to obtain a license, the lender must display "the financial
responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness . . . such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant belief that the business will be
operated honestly, fairly, and efficiently . . . ." Cal.
Fin. Code ยง 226
Our decisions have heretofore precluded a State from
exacting, a license of a firm doing an exclusively interstate
business as &condition of entry into the State. See, e. g.,
Robbins;v. Shelby County Taxing District,120 U. S. 489;
Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47; Eli Lilly & Co. v.
Sav-On-Drugs, 366 U. S. 276, 278-289; see also id.,
at 288, 289-292 (DouGLAS, J., dissenting). Appellee
wou d characterize these California statutes as primarily
of a regulatory nature, invoking Robertson v. California,
328 U. S. 440, in which the majority of the Court held
that a State might exclude an interstate insurance company which failed to meet certain minimum reserve
requirements designed to assure that the insurer is,
financially solvent.
But here California exacts a $200 annual fee as a condition of obtaining and maintaining a license. As we
recognized in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105,
112: "The power to tax the exercise of a privilege is the
power to control or suppress its enjoyment." The California District Court of Appeal viewed the fee as one
designed to offset the expenses of administering the
licensing system itself. From California's characterization of the fee* it is not one to "defray the cpst of purely

Because I believe that this case presents substantial
and important constitutional questions, I would note
probable jurisdiction and set this case down for argument.
