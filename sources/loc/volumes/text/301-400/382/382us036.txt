JAMES v. LOUISIANA.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF LOUISIANA.

No. 23, Misc. Decided October 18, 1965.
After petitioner's arrest, he was driven by police to his home, more
than two blocks away, where an intensive search without a war-

rant yielded the narcotics and equipment which were the basis for

his conviction for possession of narcotics. Held: The search was
not incident to the arrest which occurred more than two blocks
away and it was constitutional error to admit. the fruits of the
illegal search into evidence.
Certiorari granted; 246 La. 1033, 169 So. 2d 89, reversed and
remanded.

G. Wray Gill, Sr., for petitioner.
Jack P. F. Gremillion, Attorney General of Louisiana,
M. E. Culligan, Assistant Attorney General, and Jim
Garrison for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

The petitioner was convicted by a Louisiana jury of
possession of narcotics and was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years. The Supreme Court of Louisiana
set aside the conviction on the ground that it was based
upon evidence seized without a warrant during an illegal
search. 246 La. 1033, 169 So. 2d 89. Upon rehearing,
however, that court affirmed the conviction by a divided
vote. 246 La. 1053, 169 So. 2d 97. We grant the motion to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for
certiorari and reverse the judgment.
Police officers arrested the petitioner near the intersection of Camp Street and Jackson Avenue in the City
of New Orleans, after he had alighted from an automobile driven by another man. The officers then drove the
petitioner to his home, more than two blocks away.
