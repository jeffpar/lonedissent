SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. GALLAGHER ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 212. Argued December 12, 1938.-Decided January 30, 1939.
1. California tax on storage and use-i. e., upon retention and exer.
cise of ownership-may be applied consistently with the commerce clause and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to an interstate railroad company in respect of supplies purchased outside of the State and brought in for prompt application
in the operation of its road, such as office supplies, and rails,
equipment, machinery, tools, etc., used in replacements, repairs and
extensions, and including articles ordered out of the State on specifications suitable only for use in the transportation facilities and
installed immediately upon arrival at the Califotnia destination.
P. 172.
2. There is an interval after the articles have reached the end of
their interstate movement and before their consumption in interstate operation has begun when the "use and storage" are subject
to local taxation. Helson & Randolph v. Kentucky, 279 U. S. 245,
distinguished. P. 176.

Argument for Appellant.

306 U. S.

Mr. Harry H. McElroy for appellant.
A state excise tax imposed directly upon the privilege
of using instrumentalities in carrying on and conducting
interstate and foreign commerce by a railroad common
carrier, is a direct burden on such commerce, contrary to
the Commerce Clause. Bingaman v. Golden Eagle Lines,
297 U. S. 626; Helson & Randolph v. Kentucky, 279 U. S.

A state excise tax can not validly be applied indiscriminately and withovt apportionment to an instrumentality (.)mmon to interstate and intrastate commerce. Cooney v. Mountain States Tel. Co., 294 U. S.
384; Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, 304 U. S. 307, 314; Colorado v. United States, 271 U. S. 153; Railroad Commission v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563.
The case at bar is distinguished by its facts from the
cases in which the privileges taxed were not acts of conducting interstate, transportation. Distinguishing Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, 289 U. S. 249; 61 F. 2d
319; Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S.

a narrow distinction of facts exists between the tax held
invalid in the Helson case and the tax considered valid

Argument for Appellant.

in the Nashville case. That narrow distinction of facts
is the distinction which exists between the taxation of
an event separable and completed before use in interstate commerce begins and the taxation of an event
which is an inseparable part and act of carrying on interstate commerce.
The unconstitutionality of state excise taxation burdening interstate commerce is not avoided by imposing state
taxes at an equal rate on intrastate commerce or other
intrastate privileges.
Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S.
250, cited by the lower court, cites many cases and illustrations exemplifying the rule that "even interstate business must pay its own way," but not a single one of them
deals with a tax upon action sanctioned and protected
by the commerce clause where the manner of imposition
of the tax has been direct. They do not modify or criticize the long established rule that where the tax is
directly imposed on an interstate privilege the burden is
ipso facto direct and therefore unconstitutional. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429; James v. Dravo
Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134; Galveston, H. & S. A.
Ry. Co. v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217, 227.
It can be said of the tax in question in the case at bar,
amounting to more than $300,000, and continuing to accrue in large amounts, as was said by this Court in U. S.
Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, 247 U. S. 321, that "conceivably
it may be sufficient to make the difference between profit
and loss, or to so diminish the profit as to impede or discourage the conduct of the commerce." Helvering v.
Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376, distinguished.
See Pacific Telephone & T. Co. v. Henneford, 81 P. 2d

The tax is discriminatory in its operation and effect,
and if the decision of the lower court is sustained the
way will be open for serious discriminatory abuses in state

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The California Use Tax Act of 1935 1 is assailed as violative of the commerce clause and the Fourteenth
Amendment, when imposed upon tangible personal property, bought outside of the state by the Southern Pacific
Company, an interstate railroad, and installed on importation, or kept available for use, as a part of its transportation facilities.
The attack comes by means of a bill of the Southern
Pacific Company seeking, before a three-judge district
court,' an interlocutory and final injunction against the
State Board of Equalization of California, its members
and the Attorney General of the state, to restrain them
from enforcing the Use Tax Act.' The trial court granted

an interlocutory injunction and denied a motion to dismiss 4 but later refused a permanent injunction and sustained the motion to dismiss.5 The case comes here by
appeal.'
The Use Tax Act is complemental to the California
Retail Sales Tax Act of 1933.! The latter levies a tax
upon the gross receipts of California retailers from sales
of tangible personal property; the former 8 imposes an
excise on the consumer at the same rate for the storage,
use or other consumption in the state of such property
when purchased from any retailer. As property covered
by the sales tax is exempt under the use tax, all tangible
personalty sold or utilized in California is taxed once
for the support of the state government. Definitions in
the Use Tax Act of taxpayer, retailer, storage and use
are designed to make the coverage complete. A retailer
is "every person, engaged in the business of making sales
for storage, use or other consumption"; use is the exercise of any right or power incident to ownership, except
sale in the regular course of business; storage is any
"keeping or retention" with a similar exemption; and a
taxpayer includes everyone "storing, using or otherwise
consuming" the property subject to the use tax.9
The principle of the use tax as applied to property
brought into the state after its retail purchase for intrastate use has been upheld in Henneford v. Silas Mason
Co.,10 against the charge that it was a tax upon the operations of interstate commerce or a tax upon a foreign

sale, violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under
the Washington statute, there considered, discrimination
against interstate commerce, arising from a second exaction for use after a foreign tax on sale, could not exist
as provision was made for a credit against the local tax of
any such foreign levy. No such problem arises here by
evidence, finding or assignment of error 11 even though
the California Act does not have this provision. It will
be time enough to resolve that argument "when a taxpayer paying in the state of origin is compelled to pay
again in the state of destination." 1 A discrimination
against goods of out-of-state origin on the face of the
sales and use acts is suggested because the local retailer
may absorb the sales tax while the consumer of an imported article must pay the use tax." But this is not a
discrimination in the law. California's exaction for the
distribution of tangible personal property is the same,
whether purchased within or without her borders or
whether paid by the retailer or consumer. There is an
equal charge against what is used, whatever its source.
In this case we have a distinctly different application of
a use tax. The tax is not sought from personal property
used in transactions entirely disassociated from any
agency connected with interstate transportation, as
builders' supplies for local work in the Silas Mason case,
but from tangible personalty purchased out of the state
for immediate or subsequent installation in an interstate
railway facility.
The appellant, the Southern Pacific Company, a Kentucky' corporation, handles intrastate, interstate and
foreign commerce over its railroad system which traverses
a number of states and connects with the lines of carriers

Opinion of the Court.

covering the continent. The findings and stipulation of
facts show continual extrastate purchases of tangible personalty for the operation of the road; rails, equipment,
machinery, tools and office supplies. Some of the purchases are used in the general offices of the corporation,
located in California, for the supervision of the wide-flung
activities; others are for material kept in readiness as a
stand-by supply to replace or repair equipment damaged, destroyed or worn out in the operation of the road;
and still others are to make improvements, replacements
or extensions pursuant to previously determined plans
and specifications. Few, if any, of the supplies are stored
for long term needs. Storage is merely incidental to protection until use, as office supplies in a closet or an extra
frog at a section tool house. For construction or reconstruction upon a large scale, special orders are given and
arrangements made, so that the material is fabricated for
a particular use in the transportation ficilities, shipped
to its California destination and installed upon arrival.
To avoid delay and cost the movement from loading to
final placement is as nearly continuous as managerial efficiency can contrive. While some articles are capable of
general use, the major purchases of rails, repair parts and
supplies for the maintenance and operation of the system
are adapted only to railroad use. The purchases are paid
for out of railroad operating capital and move on company material waybills, without transportation charge.
All purchases may be said to be dedicated to consumption
in the interstate transportation business of appellant. No
new rolling stock is involved. Subsequent to repairing
and reconditioning, rolling stock moves again in interstate transportation, as do cars after being stocked with
supplies. The California tax on storage or use, it is said,
cannot apply to these articles, as such a tax would be an
unconstitutional burden upon the facilities of interstate
.ommercf of which the articles are a part.

174

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

306 U. S.

There is agreement upon the principle involved. Appellant states that an excise tax imposed directly upon
the privilege of using instrumentalities in carrying on interstate transportation is a direct-and unconstitutional
burden on commerce. Appellees do not dispute the
premise but contend that the tax is on intrastate storage
and use. They point to the definition of use as the exercise of a right of ownership, and of storage as any keeping or retention. By the definitive terms themselves, it
is urged, the taxable events are retention and installation,
not such stoiage as warehousing connotes, or use in the
sense of consumption or operation. If we conclude retention and installation, under the circumstances here developed, are intrastate taxable events, viewed apart from
commerce, we must still inquire whether taxes laid upon
them are not, in effect, upon commerce, and forbidden.1 4
Two lines of authority aid in considering the effect of
this tax on commerce. The first makes it quite clear that
a state tax upon the privilege of operating in, or upon
carrying on, interstate' commerce is invalid. States cannot tax interstate telegraph messages,1 5 or freight shipments.' A license tax on sales by samples burdens one
selling only goods from other states." A tax act as applied to the business of interstate communication 18 is
unconstitutional. Where a similar levy by other states
may be imposed, with consequent multiplicity of exaction
on commerce for the same taxable event, local tax of a
privilege, measured by total gross receipts from interstate
transactions, is considered identical with an exaction on

the commerce itself.19 This rule is applicable to a tax on
gross receipts from interstate transportation; 20 an occupation tax measured by gross receipts from radio broadcasting,2 and a general tax at specified rates upon the
gross income of every resident, construed as "a tax upon
gross receipts from commerce" 22 "without apportionment." "2 The measurement of a tax by gross receipts
where it cannot result in a multiplication of the levies it
upheld. 4
Appellant selects from this line the Helson case 2 as
determinative of the contention that a tax on use of
supplies or equipment is a tax on the commerce. A state
tax of three cents per gallon was imposed on all gasoline
"sold at wholesale." This phrase was defined to include
gasoline bought out of the state and used within the
state. There was no definition of the word use or used.
The taxpayers operated an interstate ferry, purchased
gasoline in Ohio and used that portion sought to be taxed
in propelling their craft in the territorial waters of Kentucky. The court considered the tax on the consumpti"
of the gas the same as a tax on the operation of the fer.

boat and therefore invalid under the rule discussed in the
preceding paragraph.
The second line of authority supports the view that
use and storage as defined in the California act are taxable
intrastate events, separate and apart from interstate
commerce. A recent discussion of the topic sets out the
precedents in support of a ruling that a tax upon the
production of power by the use of which compressors drove
natural gas in interstate commerce is valid. Such production is a taxable event distinct from its consumption
in commerce."' Particular attention is called by the
state to the Wallace case.2 7 There the tax was on "selling or storing or distributing gasoline." It became due
on withdrawal from storage. The tax was held applicable to gasoline, purchased out of the state and stored in
the state, "when all is withdrawn and used . . .as a
source of motive power in interstate railway operation"
and valid against the objection that "it is in effect a tax
upon the use" in interstate commerce.28 The invalidity
of such a tax arises from a levy on commerce itself or its
gross receipts, not upon events prior to the commerce. "
The principle illustrated by the Helson case forbids a
tax upon commerce or consumption in commerce. The
Wallace case, and precedents analogous to it, permit state
taxation of events preliminary to interstate commerce.
The validity of any application of a taxing act depends
upon a classification of the facts in the light of these
theories. In the present case some of the articles were
ordered out of the state under specification suitable only
for utilization in the transportation facilities and installed

immediately on arrival at the California destination. If
articles so handled are deemed to have reached the end
of their interstate transit upon "use or storage," no
further inquiry is necessary as to the rest of the articles
which are subjected to a retention, by comparison, farther
removed from interstate commerce. We think there was
a taxable moment when the former had reached the end
of their interstate transportation and had not begun to
be consumed in interstate operation. At that moment,
the tax on storage and use-retention and exercise of a
right of ownership, respectively-was effective. The interstate movement was complete. The interstate consumption had not begun. Champlain Co. v. Brattleboro8o
and Carson Petroleum Co. v. Vial 81 are therefore inapplicable. Bacon v. Illinois,2 where taxation of grain
during stoppage in transit was validated, presents a closer
analogy. "Practical continuity" does not always make
an act a part of interstate commerce."
This conclusion
does not give preponderance to the language of the state
act over its effect on commerce. State taxes upon national commerce or its incidents do not depend for their
validity upon a choice of words but upon the choice of
the thing taxed. It is true, the increased cost to the interstate operator from a tax on installation is the same
as from a tax on consumption or operation. This is not
significant. 4 The prohibited burden upon commerce between the states is created by state interference with that
commerce, a matter distinct from the expense of doing

business. A discrimination against it, or a tax on its
operations as such, is an interference. A tax on property
or upon a taxable event in the state, apart from operation,
does not interfere. This is a practical adjustment of
the right of the state to revenue from the instrumentalities of commerce and the obligation of the state to
leave the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce
to the Congress.
But it is urged by the appellant that our former opinions make this conclusion a departure from precedent;
the events are so close to or so inseparably intertwined
with interstate commerce, as to be a part of it."" Cooney
v. Mountain States Telephone Co. 6 is cited to show that
a "state excise tax cannot be validly applied indiscriminately and without apportionment to an instrumentality common to interstate and intrastate commerce."
The Telephone Company was taxed a sum on each telephone in use. As the instrument was employed part of
the time in interstate commerce, this Court held the tax
to be upon that commerce and invalid. Since there was
no apportionment the entire tax fell. Unless the taxable events here, all of which are intrastate, are in effect
a part of interstate commerce, our previous discussion
of their separable character would render the Cooney
case inapplicable. For this point we are referred to
Puget Sound Co. v. Tax Commission' 7 and Ozark Pipe
Line Corp. v. Monier.8
In the former case, the distinction in the opinion between stevedoring in loading and unloading interstate
cargoes, held non-taxable as a burden upon commerce,
and the business of supplying longshoremen for others
to load and unload, held taxable as a local business, is

applicable here. The invalid tax in the Puget Sound
case was on the business of stevedoring, measured by a
percentage of gross receipts from interstate activity.
The valid tax was a similar percentage on the local activity as an employment agency. Here, under our analysis, we find only intrastate events taxed29
In the Ozark case, Missouri sought to justify a franchise tax on a company engaged in the operation of an
interstate pipe line by suggesting the tax was upon certain intrastate events, such as operation of communications, repair and purchase of supplies. The tax was forbidden because on the privilege of doing an exclusively
interstate business. The opinion is to be read in the light
of the statement by the Court of its interpretation of the
facts and legal deductions which control its decision.
The Missouri Act called for a franchise tax of a percentage of the par of its stock, apportioned to its assets
in that state. This Court said that "the tax is one-upon
the privilege or right to do business," and as the taxpayer
"is engaged only in interstate commerce" the tax "constitutionally cannot be imposed." There was then added
this paragraph:
"The maintenance of an office, the purchase of supplies, employment of labor, maintenance and operation
of telephone and telegraph lines and automobiles, and
appellant's other acts within the State, were all exclusively in furtherance of its interstate business; and the
property itself, however extensive or of whatever character, was likewise devoted only to that end. They were
the means and instrumentalities by which that business
was done and in no proper sense constituted, or conUnder the commerce clause the regulatory power of the Congress
is customarily exercised on transactions taking place within the state
on the principle that such acts are an essential part of interstatc
commerce. See Currin v. Wallace, ante, p. 1, and cases cited. Cf.

tributed to, the doing of a local business. The protection against imposition of burdens upon interstate commerce is practical and substantial and extends to whatever is necessary to the complete enjoyment of the right
protected." 40
This Court pointed out that the corporation had a
license to engage exclusively in interstate business." The
language just quoted shows that this Court interpreted
the transactions in Missouri as merely a part of the interstate commerce and the tax on the franchise an interference therewith because a tax directly upon it.42 ".
nothing was done in Missouri except in furtherance of
transportation." "' It was this conclusion of the Court
on the factual situation which brought about the Ozark
decision. Where there is also intrastate activity, an apportioned state franchise tax on foreign corporations
*doing an interstate business is upheld.44 A franchise tax
on an exclusively interstate business is a direct burden;
proportioned to an intermingled business, it is valid."
Since the incidence of the California tax as here interpreted is upon events outside of interstate commerce, the
Ozark opinion is not applicable. There the Missouri tax
was upon activities found wholly interstate.
Finally, appellants urge that the tax violates the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because exacted for consumption of office and car suppliesoutside
