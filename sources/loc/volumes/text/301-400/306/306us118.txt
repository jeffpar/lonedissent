MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

306 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case presents the same question as that involved in
No. 328, Helvering v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., ante,
p. 110. Certiorari was granted because of a conflict in the
decisions below. The statutory provision under which
this case arises is § 22 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1932,
which is the same as the corresponding section of the
Revenue Act of 1928. The regulations, original and
amended, have the same relation to this controversy as
to that in No. 328. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained
a determination of a deficiency in the petitioner's tax for
the calendar year 1933 and the Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the Board's ruling.1
For the reasons given in No. 328 the judgment must be
Reversed.

TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.

No. 27.

Argued November 14, 15, 1938.-Decided January 30, 1939.

1. The principle permitting suit against an agent of the Government
to restrain execution of an unconstitutional statute protects only
legal rights. P. 137.
2. Franchises to be a corporation and to function as a public utility
and non-exclusive franchises to occupy and use public property
and places for service of the public, do not grant freedom from
competition. P. 138.
3. The validity of a statutory grant of power can not be challenged
merely because its exercise results in harmful competition. The
damage is damnum absque injuria. P. 139.
t97 F. 2d 22.

Argument for Appellants.

4. State laws requiring electric power companies to obtain certificates of convenience and necessity as a condition to doing business do not confer upon those possessing such certificates a standing
to enjoin operations of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which,
though it has no such certificate, operates with consent of the
State. P. 141.
5. The appellant power companies may not raise, in this case, any
question of discrimination forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment
involved in state exemption of the Tennessee Valley Authority from
commission regulation. Frost v. Corporation Commission, 278
U. S. 515, distinguished. P. 143.
6. The competition of the Tennessee Valley Authority in underselling
the power comlpnies and in fixing resale rates by contract, does
not amount to regulation of their rate., in violation of the Tenth
Amendment, and gives rise to no cause of action under that
Amendment or under the Ninth Amendment. P. 143.
7. The findings and evidence in this case do not sustain the charge
of a conspiracy between the Tennessee Valley Authority and the
Public Works Administrator to intimidate the appellant power
companies into selling their existing systems where the Authority
desires to seize the market for electricity. P. 144.
Cobperation by two federal officials, one acting under a statute
whereby funds are provided for the erection of municipal plants,
and the other under a statute authorizing the production of
electricity and its sale to such plants, in competition with the
appellants, does not spell conspiracy to injure their business.
P. 146.
21 F. Supp. 947, affirmed.

APPEAL from a decree of a District Court of three judges
which dismissed a bill filed by numerous electric power
companies wherein they sought to enjoin the Tennessee
Valley Authority and its three executive offieers and directors, from generating, distributing and selling electric
power and from other injurious and allegedly unconstitutional activities in harmful and destructive competition with the appellants.
Messrs. Raymond T. Jackson and John C. Weadock,

with' whom Messrs. Charles C. Trabue and Charles M.
Seymour were on the brief, for appellants.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Argument for Appellants.

306 U. S.

The water power is not being, and will not be, constitutionally created. The Federal Government will acquire no title to such water power.
The electricity will not result incidentally to an exercise of the implied power to improve navigation. Power
development is an independent, if not the primary, purpose. This is plain on the face of the Act.
Considered as a whole, the appellees' Unified Plan is
plainly a power project.
In any event the water power created by the tributary
reservoirs is not incidental to the improvement of
navigation.
Both the statutory scheme and the administrative plan
are plainly attempts, in the guise of exercising the implied
power to improve streams for navigation, to exercise
power not granted but forbidden to the Federal Government. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 423;
Linder v. United States, 268 U. S. 5; Carter v. Carter
Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 291; Child Labor Tax Case, 259
U. S. 20, 37.
The trial court did not recognize that the question is
whether the water power is to be the incidental result
of the operation of structures which have a real, substantial and bona fide relation to the improvement of navigation. Apparently, it deemed the controlling question
to be whether power development would be "inconsistent"
with or obstructive of navigation, and thought that under the euphonious title of a "multiple purpose project"
the Government may yoke together constitutional and
unconstitutional enterprises. Constitutional limitations
may not be so evaded. Retirement Board v. Alton R.
Co., 295 U. S. 330, 362; Employers' Liability Cases, 207
U. S. 463, 501.
None of the commercial water power is created by the
operation of any flood control structures included in the
Unified Plan.

TENNESSEE POWER CO. v. T. V. A.
118

Argument for Appellants.

Flood control is minor, if not pretensive, and any attempt to sustain that plan as a flood control project fails
as an attempt to accomplish a forbidden object under
the pretense of exercising a constitutional power.. United
States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 289. It is plain on
the face of the Act that power development is not incidental to flood control. The federal power over flood control does not extend beyond the protection of navigation
channels and works. Cf. Jackson v. United States, 230
U. S. 1, 18, 23; Cubbins v. Mississippi River Comm'n,
241 U. S. 351; 204 F. 299; Leovy v. United States, 177
U. S. 621; Manigault v. Springs, 199 U. S. 473; Orr v.
Allen, 248 U. S. 35; St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. v. Board of
Directors, 207 F. 338.
The electricity will not be produced as an incident of
the exercise of the war or national defense power, and it
has never been held that in time of peace the Federal
Government may carry on all of the businesses which
might be commandeered or which might produce articles
essential or convenient in the prosecution of a war.
Neither the statutory nor the administrative method
of disposing of the electricity is within the constitutional
power of the Federal Government. Each violates the
Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments.
The power to dispose of federal property does not include any power of regulation, or the power to engage
in the conduct or management of a business having no
relation to the purposes for which the Federal Government was established. See Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S.
46, 89, 92; South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S.
437, 457-459; Van Brocklin v. Anderson, 117 U. S. 151,
158; Florida v. United States, 282 U. S. 194, 211-212;
Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n,

United States, 295 U. S. 495, 546-548; United States v.
Butler, 297 U. S. 1.
It surely may not be used for the purpose, or with the
direct and necessary effect, of governing concerns reserved
to the States and the people or of upsetting the balance
of our dual system.
The distribution and sale of electricity within the State
is a local public service, subject to full and complete
regulation by the State under its police powers. Union
Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corp., 248 U. S.
372, 374; Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 124; Nebbia v.
New York, 291 U. S. 502, 524; Slaughter-House Cases,
83 U. S. 36. Federal interference in this field "is plainly
repugnant to the exclusive power of the State over the
same subject," License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 471; for
the exercise of state police power "is not subject to national supervision." South Carolina v. United States,
199 U. S. 437, 453.
Under the Ninth Amendment, the people have the
right to earn a livelihood, and acquire and use property
by engaging in the electric business, subject only to state
regulation. Cf. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S.
548; New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262;
Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 121; Duplex Co. v.
Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 465; Buchanan v. Varley, 245
U. S. 60, 74; Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, 278 U. S. 105, 111;
Truax v. Corrigan, 257 U. S. 312, 327.
To the extent that federal statutory and administrative
methods of disposing of property are constitutional, they
are supreme. If not held within their proper limitations
they will destroy reserved powers and rights of State
and people. See Butler v. United States, 297 U. S. 1, 74.
Both the Act and the Unified Plan must be judged by
their natural and reasonable effect in the situation in
which they operate. Collins v. New Hampshire, 171

Goods Co. v. Lewis, 294 U. S. 550, 555; Minnesota v.
Barber, 136 U. S. 313, 319.
Pursuant to the intent and purpose of the Act the
Authority is engaging in the business of supplying electricity to the public within the States, and regulating
its own rates and service, the rates and service of distributors of its power, and the rates of privately owned and
state-regulated utilities. If this is valid, the powers of
the States and the rights of the people to engage in the
business, are pro tanto destroyed. Cf. Walla Walla City
v. Walla Walla Water Co., 172 U. S. 1, 11; United States
v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 70-71; Frost v. Railroad Commission, 271 U. S. 583; Panama Refining Co. v. United
States, 293 U. S. 388.
There is no real or substantial relation between the
power to dispose of federal property and the regulation
of local electric rates or the establishment within the
States of a federal policy of having the local electric business carried on by public or non-profit organizations.
The natural and reasonable effect of the operation of
the Act, by bringing about a federal monopoly of the
local electric business, is to deprive the States of important tax revenues.
The Federal Government may not exercise its power of
taxation so as substantially to burden or interfere with
the functions of the States. Collector v. Day, 11 Wall.

138, 144; New York v. Miln, 11 Pet. 102, 139.
The principles laid down in the Ashwander Case, 297
U. S. 288, condemn the method of disposal authorized by
the Act and adopted by the Unified Plan.
One threatened with direct and special injury through
the application of a federal statute or the act of a federal
officer may maintain a suit to determine whether the
statute is constitutional or the act is authorized.
Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488; Philadelphia
Co. v. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 621-622; Alabama Power
Co. v. Ickes, 302 U. S. 464.
The legal rights which appellants seek to protect are:
(1) the right to be free from illegal competition and
(2) the right to engage in and carry on the business of
supplying electricity to the public within the States free
from displacement by the Federal Government and free
from federal interference, regulation or control. These
rights are entitled to protection both from injury produced by the operation of an unconstitutional statute and
from injury produced by unauthorized action of federal
officials or agencies.
A non-exclusive franchise is property. It is exclusive
as against all persons attempting to engage in the business illegally, without a franchise or under a void franchise. It follows that, there being no adequate remedy

TENNESSEE POWER CO. r. T. V. A.
118

Argument for Appellants.

at law, the holder of a non-exclusive franchise has a
standing in equity to protect his property against such
an injurious invasion. Frost v. CorporationCommission,
278 U. S. 515, 521; Corporation Commission v. Lowe,
281 U. S. 431, 435; Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302
U. S. 464, 484-485; City of Campbell v. Arkansas-Missouri Power Co., 55 F. 2d 560, 562; Gallardo v. Porto
Rico Ry. L. & P. Co., 18 F. 2d 918, 922; Arkansas-Missouri Power Co. v. City of Kennett, 78 F. 2d 911; Iowa
Southern Utilities Co. v. Cassill, 69 F. 2d 703; Kansas Gas
& Electric Co. v. City of Independence, 79 F. 2d 32. This
means that the holder of a non-exclusive franchise has a
right to invoke a judicial determination of whether any actual or threatened competition with him is legal and, if that
involves the constitutionality of a statute or the existence of official authority, then a determination of the
constitutional question or of the extent of the official
authority. And for the purpose of determining the rights
of appellants to sue, it must be assumed that the appellees
are attempting to engage in the business illegally, without a franchise or under a void franchise.
The appellants have a right to engage in and carry on
the business of supplying electricity to the public within
the several States subject only to state regulation and
free from ouster, interference, regulation or control by
the Federal Government. They have a right to be free
from displacement or supersession, in carrying on that
business, by the operation of federal statutes or the acton
of federal agencies which result in taking over the business as a federal enterprise.
It is plain that the appellants are severally threatened
with the most severe and destructive sort of competition.
That a threat of competition is a threat of irreparable
damage is established by the decisions of this Court.

Frost v. Corporation. Commission, 278 U. S. 515, 521;
Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U. S. 464.
The right to be free from illegal competition includes
competition for future or unattached business. It includes competition for business handled by the Authority
through municipal and co6perative distributors. See
Citizens Electric Co. v. Lackawanna & TV. P. Co., 255 Pa.
145; Chicago v. Mutual Electric Light Co., 55 Ill. App.
429.
While th~ existence of such a relationship is not essential to appellants' right to sue, the municipalities and cooperatives are in reality mere agents for the distribution
of Tennessee Valley Authority power; and in any event,
the Authority so far controls and participates in the sales
by distributors that the validity of its participation may
be tested at the suit of an injured party. See United
States v. General Electric Co., 272 U. S. 476; Mitchell
Wagon Co. v. Poole, 235 F. 817; In re United States Electrical Supply Co., 2 F. 2d 378; In re Wright-Dana Hardware Co., 211 F. 908; Rudin v. King-Richardson Co., 37

24 F. 2d 35; In re Renfro-Wadenstein, 47 F. 2d 238; Butler Bros. Shoe Co. v. U. S. Rubber Co., 156 F. 1.
Appellants have a clear right to sue. See United
States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1; Carter v. Carter Coal Co.,
298 U. S. 238; Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., 259 U. S.

259 U. S. 44; Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U. S. 464.
Unless appellants are entitled on the record as made
to a reversal of the decree with directions to issue an injunction, then the decree of the trial court should be reversed for serious errors in matter of procedure and in
rulings on evidence.

TENNESSEE POWER CO. r. T. V. A.
118

Argument for Appellees.

Messrs. James Lawrence Fly and John Lord O'Brian,
with whom Solicitor General Jackson, and Mr. Paul A.
Freund, Mr. William C. Fitts, Jr., and Bessie Margolin
were on the brief, for appellees.
The Act sets forth as its basic purposes the improvement of navigation, the control of destructive floods in the
Tennessee and Mississippi River basins, and the promotion of national defense. The whole record confirms the
legislative judgment that the projects are appropriate
means for the accomplishment of the functions prescribed
in the statute.
The power generated is lawfully acquired, since these
are the only projects capable of providing flood control on
the Tennessee and the Mississippi in conjunction with a
nine-foot navigation channel on the Tennessee. That
the projects will create and maintain a continuous ninefoot waterway throughout the 650-mile length of the
Tennessee is undisputed. Not only the main-stream
dams, but the two tributary dams as well, will provide
substantial benefits to navigation both on the Tennessee
and the Mississippi, by virtue of releases of stored water
in low-water season.
While the relative advantages and disadvantages of
alternative systems are not legally material, the record
demonstrates and the trial court found that.the projects
of the Authority will provide a navigation channel superior to that which could be provided by any alternative
system.
Even if the power to construct flood-control works must
be rested on the power to improve navigation, the test
is met by these projects, since their operation for floodcontrol purposes results in substantial benefits to navigation. Jackson v. United States, 230 U. S. 1, 23; Cubbins
v. Mississippi River Comm'n, 241 U. S. 351, 368-369.
But Congress has power to promote and protect interstate commerce on land as well as on water, and accord-

ingly to engage in flood-control measures, where, as on
the Tennessee and the lower Mississippi, there is a serious
flood menace to all forms of interstate commerce. Cf.
Wilson. v. New, 243 U. S. 332; National Labor Relations
Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1. In
addition, its power to cope with the recurring threat of
floods can be rested on its power to make expenditures
for the general welfare. Cf. Steward Machine Co. v.
Davis, 301 U. S. 548.
The interest of national defense is substantially served
by the tributary dams which release water during the
low-water season and so enhance the value and usefulness
of the Government-owned properties at Muscle Shoals.
In providing works which appropriately serve as navigation and flood-control structures, Congress may determine the size of the projects and the mode and manner
of their use, and the power which is thus acquired is the
lawful property of the United States. Arizona v. California, 283 U. S. 423, 456; Green Bay & M. Canal Co. v.
PattenPaper Co., 172 I. S. 58, rehearing denied, 173 U. S.
179; United States v. Chandler-DunbarWater Power Co.,
229 U. S. 53.
The water power created by these projects is the prop7
erty of the United States, may be converted into electric
energy, and, under the property clause of the Constitution all of' the electricity so acquired may be disposed of by transmission to the market and by sales to
municipalities, rural cooperatives, and industrial customers. Ashtwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297
U. S. 288, 340.
The Authority is now selling power to the same classes
of customers as those served by the lines purchased under
the contract approved in the Ashwander case. And, as
found by the trial court, all of the marketing facilities
constructed and operated by the Authority, namely,
transmission lines, substations, and rural lines, are sim-

118

ilar in character and function to the facilities purchased
under that contract.
In this case, as in that, the method of disposition is
necessary to avoid a private monopoly of the Government's property, to prevent waste, and to secure a widespread distribution of benefits pursuant to the statute.
As authorized by the Act, the Authority's contracts
with municipalities and co6peratives establish the resale
rates to be charged by the distributors (§ 10). Appellants have no standing to challenge these provisions,
since they were voluntarily entered into by the municipalities and co6peratives, which are empowered to do so
by valid state law. Any advantage or disadvantage to
appellants resulting from the rates adopted by the municipalities and co6peratives is merely the incidental result of the exercise of the rights vested in them by the
laws of the States of their creation to set their own rates
and to contract with respect to them. Edward Hines
Trustees v. United States, 263 U. S. 143, 148; Sprunt &
Son v. United States, 281 U. S. 249, 254-256; Wilbur v.
Texas Co., 40 F. 2d 787 (App. D. C., 1930), cert. denied,
282 U. S. 843; Georgia Power Co. v. Tennessee Valley
Authority, 14 F. Supp. 673 (N. D. Ga., 1936).
In any event, these provisions of the contracts are
valid. The Government is selling at wholesale. The demand for the Government property will be influenced by
the rates charged to the ultimate consumer. The Congress, in the position of a trustee of Government property,
may therefore authorize this means to assure a widespread diffusion of the benefits to the people. Cf. Oregon & CaliforniaR. Co. v. United States, 238 U. S. 393;
United States v. Gratiot, 26 Fed. Cas. 12 (C. C. D. Ill.,
1839), aff'd, 14 Pet. 526.
There is no invasion of the rights reserved to the States
under the Tenth Amendment, even if it be assumed thai
the Amendment constitutes an independent limitation

on the exercise of granted powers. The denial of the power
of the Congress to construct the necessary transmission
facilities and to enter into the necessary contracts for
the sale of the power would limit the Authority's market
to sales at the dam sites where the Commonwealth and
Southern companies are, practically, the only available
purchasers.
The conclusive answer to the invocation of the Tenth
Amendment is that the means of disposition do not impair the exercise of the States' police power. The Authority is dealing with municipalities and co6peratives
who are subject at all times to the complete control of the
States, and the state courts have determined that there
is no abdication of state powers. Memphis Power &
Light Co. v. Memphis, 172 Tenn. 346 (1937); Oppenheim v. Florence, 229 Ala. 50 (1934). An arrangement
by which the State authorizes its agencies, at their election, to purchase property from the Government, still retaining in the State the right of regulation and control,
can give rise to no questions under the Tenth Amendment. Cf. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra;.United
States v. Bekins, 304 U. S. 27. The States may authorize
municipalities to construct and operate electric plants in
competition with the appellant companies even though
the result is harmful to the business of the companies.
Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U. S. 464. To the extent that this competition is related to the wholesale
service of the Authority, the case is one of the federal
exercise of the granted power to dispose of public property by sales to local public agencies who themselves engage in an enterprise authorized by the States. Such
co6peration is permitted by the Constitution and not forbidden by the Tenth Amendment. Duke Power Co. v.
Greenwood County, 91 F. 2d 665, 673 (C. C. A. 4th,
1937); cf. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra; United
States v. Bekins, supra.

TENNESSEE POWER CO. v. T. V. A.
118

Argument for Appellees.

Moreover, any effect of competition upon appellants'
rates does not constitute regulation and is only the collateral effect of the exercise of a granted power. Duke
Power Co. v. Greenwood County, supra; cf. Sonzinsky v.
United States, 300 U. S. 506, 513-514; United States v.
Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144.
The scope of the projects necessary for the disposition
of public property is a question for Congress to determine.
Cf. Arizona v. California, supra; United States v. Hanson, 167 F. 881 (C. C. A. 9th, 1909).
The resale-rate provisions of the contracts do not deprive the States of their power to regulate intrastate rates
and are not in violation of the Tenth Amendment. There
cannot be any impairment of state sovereignty where, as
here, the States have authorized the contracts and have
reserved a continuing power to revoke the authorization.
Cf. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra; United States
v. Bekins, supra.
The sale of power by the Authority and its wholesale
customers does not constitute regulation, and the loss of
appellants' business, if any, is not a "taking" of their
property under the Fifth Amendment. Sonzinsky v.
United States, supra; Standard Scale Co. v. Farrell, 249
U. S. 571; PennsylvaniaR. Co. v. United States R. Labor
Board, 261 U. S. 72; United States v. Los Angeles R. Co.,

U. S. 150; Helena Water Works Co. v. Helena, 195 U. S.
383; Puget Sound Co. v. Seattle, 291 U. S. 619.
Appellants have no standing to maintain this suit.
Their municipal and county street franchises, licenses, or
easements, at the most, confer only the right to enjoin the
use of the streets and highways by one competing with
appellants without a like franchise, license, or easement.
No showing has been made that the Authority's facilities
occupy the public streets and highways.
Moreover,

whatever the nature of the rights conferred by local street
franchises, licenses, or easements, it is conceded that the
Authority has been granted such rights by the local
authorities in the areas in which it operates.
The only so-called "state franchises" which appellants,
as a class, possess are corporate privileges derived under
the general state laws governing incorporation and the
qualification of foreign corporations. Such corporate
"franchises" obviously confer no immunity from competition. Cf. Railroad Co. v. Ellerman, 105 U. S. 166.
Appellants have not been required to obtain certificates
of convenience and necessity to serve in the area in, which
the Authority is operating. Consequently, appellants are
not within the protection of Frost v. Corporation
Comm'n, 278 U. S. 515.
In any event, the statutes in all the States in which
the Authority is under contract to sell electricity within the claimed territory of appellants have exempted the
Authority from the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions and from the requirement of certificates of convenience and necessity. The validity of these exemptions is not challenged as unlawfully discriminatory. The
decision of this Court in the Frost case (278 U. S. 515)
merely holds that one who is required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity may enjoin competition by one who is subject to the same statutory
provisions and has failed to comply with their terms.
Carolina Power & Light Co. v. South Carolina Public
Service Authority, 94 F. 2d 520 (C. C. A. 4th, 1938),
cert. denied, 304 U. S.578. It is insufficient answer that
the powers of the Federal Government may not be enlarged by state enactments. The validity of these state
statutory exemptions (which is not challenged by appellants) may be supported without regard to the constitutional validity of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act.

TENNESSEE POWER CO. v. T. V. A.
118

Argument for Appellees.

In addition to their lack of the necessary franchises,
nine of the appellant companies are not shown to be
threatened with damage by any concrete act of the appellees. In the claimed territory of these appellants the
Authority neither owns electric facilities nor has it negotiated any contracts for the sale of power. As to these
appellants, obviously no justiciable controversy is presented. Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, supra.
Four other appellants, all members of the Commonwealth and Southern system, have purchased a large proportion of the total amount of the power developed and
generated at the projects of the Authority, both at the
switchboard and, in the case of the Alabama Power Company, at the end of the Authority's transmission line;
and all of them have received many other benefits under
the provisions of the Act now challenged. Acceptance of
these benefits estops these appellants from questioning
the validity of the provisions of the Act under which the
benefits were received. Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Attorney
General, 124 U. S. 581; Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper
Co., 244 U. S.407; St. Louis Co. v. Prendergast Co., 260
U. S. 469. The decision in the Ashwander case held
merely that the purchase of power at the dam site under
the circumstances of that case did not preclude an attack
on separable provisions of the statute authorizing the
acquisition of transmission facilities and is clearly
distinguishable from the case at bar.
Finally, the competition of which the appellants complain is the competition of the municipalities and cooperatives and not of the Authority, and under the
decision in Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, supra, the appellants cannot challenge the validity of the contracts
between the Authority and these municipalities and
co6peratives. Appellants' legal interest is the same
whether the permanent electric supply of the municipal

and co6perative distribution system is generated by facilities owned by the United States or by facilities owned by
the distributor but constructed by means of federal loans
and grants.
The potential damage alleged to result from the loss
of the wholesale municipal and co6perative markets served
by the Authority is wholly speculative and unreal.
Neither the municipalities nor the co6peratives were potential customers of the appellants. The same is true of
the large electrochemical and electrometallurgical industries under contract with the Authority which have located in the claimed territory of the Commonwealth and
Southern companies.
On the whole record, appellants have failed to show a
sufficient legal interest to maintain this suit, and the case
presented does not admit of judicial determination.
The trial was fair and exhaustive. On the whole record, it is clear that the rulings of the trial court on
evidence and procedure were well within its discretion,
and, in any event, appellants have failed to show any
prejudicial error sufficient to justify or even to permit the
remand of a case of this character.

which transmits electricity in Tennessee and Alabama,
filed a bill in equity, in the Chancery Court of Knox
County, Tennessee, against the Authority and its three
executive officers and directors. The prayers were that
the defendants be restrained from generating electricity
out of water power created, or to be created, pursuant
to the Act and the Authority's plan of construction and
operation; from transmitting, distributing, supplying or
selling electricity so generated, or to be generated, in
competition with any of the complainants; from constructing, or financing the construction of, steam or hydroelectric generating stations, transmission lines or means
of distribution, which will duplicate or compete with any
of their services; from regulating their retail rates
through any contract, scheme or device; and from substituting federal regulation for state regulation of local
rates for electric service, more especially by incorporating
in contracts for the sale of electricity terms fixing retail
rates. The defendants removed the cause to the United
States District Court for Eastern Tennessee and there
answered the bill. As required by the Act of August 24,
1937,2 a court of three judges was convened which, after
a trial, dismissed the bill.'

prove navigation and control floods in the navigable waters of the nation. They affirm that the statutory plan
is a plain attempt, in the guise of exerting granted powers, to exercise a power not granted to the United States,
namely, the generation and sale of electric energy; that
the execution of the plan contravenes the Fifth, Ninth,
and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution, since the
sale of electricity on the scale proposed will deprive the
appellants of their property without due process of law,
will result in federal regulation of the internal affairs of
the states, and will deprive the people of the states of
their guaranteed liberty to earn a livelihood and to acquire and use property subject only to state regulation.
The appellees contest these contentions. For reasons
about to be stated we do not consider or decide the issues
thus mooted.
The Authority's acts, which the appellants claim give
rise to a cause of action, comprise (1) the sale of electric
energy at wholesale to municipalities empowered by state
law to maintain and operate their own distribution systems; (2) the sale of such energy at wholesale to membership corporations organized under state law to purchase and distribute electricity to their members without
profit; (3) the sale of firm and secondary power at wholesale to industrial plants.
The appellants are incorporated for the purpose and
with the authority to conduct business as public utilities.
Several do so only within the states of their incorporation; those chartered elsewhere have qualified as foreign
corporations under the laws of the states in which they
manufacture, transmit, or distribute electricity. Most
of them have local franchises, licenses, or easements
granted by municipalities or governmental subdivisions
but it is admitted that none of these franchises confers
an exclusive privilege.

TENNESSEE POWER CO. v. T. V. A.
118

Opinion of the Court.

While the Authority has not built or authorized any
transmission line, has not sold or authorized the sale of
electricity, or contracted for, or authorized any contract
for, the sale of electricity by others, in territory served by
nine of the appellants, it has done some or all of these
things in areas served or susceptible of service by five
of the companies; and it plans to enter in the same way
the territory of other appellants. It is clear, therefore,
that its acts have resulted and will result in the establishment of municipal and co6perative distribution systems competing with those of some or all of the appellants in territory-which they now serve, or reasonably expect to serve by extension of their existing systems, and
in direct competition with the appellants' enterprises
through the sale of power to industries in areas now
served by them or which they can serve by expansion of
their facilities. The appellants assert that this competition will inflict substantial damage upon them. The appellees admit that such damage will result, but contend
that it is not the basis of a cause of action since it is
damnum absque injuria,-adamage not consequent upon
the violation of any right recognized by law.
The appellants invoke the doctrine that one threatened
with direct and special injury by the act of an agent of
the government which, but for statutory authority for
its performance, would be a violation of his legal rights,
may challenge the validity of the statute in a suit against
the agent.5 The principle is without application unless
the right invaded is a legal right,-one of property, one
arising out of contract, one protected against tortious invasion, or one founded on a statute which confers a priv5 Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 619; Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U. S. 495, 512; Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488.

ilege.6 The appellants urge that the Tennessee Valley
Authority, by competing with them in the sale of electric
energy, is destroying their property and rights without
warrant, since the claimed authorization of its transactions is an unconstitutional statute. The pith of the
complaint is the Authority's competition. But the appellants realize that competition between natural persons
is lawful. They seek to stigmatize the Authority's present and proposed competition as "illegal" by reliance on
their franchises which they say are property protected
from injury or destruction by competition. They classify
the franchises in question as of two sorts,-those involved
in the state's grant of incorporation or of domestication
and those arising from the grant by the state or its subdivisions of the privilege t6 use and occupy public property and public places for the service of the public.
The charters of the companies which operate in the
states of their incorporation give them legal existence
and power to function as public utilities. The like existence and powers of those chartered in other states
have been recognized by the laws of the states in which
they do business permitting the domestication of foreign
corporations. The appellants say that the franchise to be
a public utility corporation and to function as such, with
incidental powers, is a species of property which is directly taken or injured by the Authority's competition.
They further urge that, though non-exclusive, the local
franchises or easements, which grant them the privilege
to serve within given municipal subdivisions, and to occupy streets and public places, are also property which
the Authority is destroying by its competition. Since

Opinion of the Court.

what is being done is justified by reference to the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, they say they have standing to challenge its constitutionality.
The vice of the position is that neither their charters
nor their local franchises involve the grant of a monopoly
or render competition illegal. The franchise to exist as a
corporation, and to function as a public utility, in the
absence of a specific charter contract on the subject, creates no right to be free of competition,' and affords the
corporation no legal cause of complaint by reason of the
state's subsequently authorizing another to enter and
operate in the same, field.8 The local franchises, while
having elements of property, confer no contractual or
property right to be free of competition either from individuals, other public utility corporations, or the state or
municipality granting the franchise.' The grantor may
preclude itself by contract from initiating or permitting
such competition, 10 but no such contractual obligation is
here asserted.
The appellants further argue that even if invasion of
their franchise rights does not give them standing, they
may, by suit, challenge the constitutionality of the statutory grant of power the exercise of which results in competition. This is but to say that if the commodity used
by a competitor was not lawfully obtained by it the corporation with which it competes may render it liable in

damages or enjoin it from further competition because of
the illegal derivation of that which it sells. If the thesis
were sound, appellants could enjoin a competing corporation or agency on the ground that its injurious competition is ultra vires, that there is a defect in the grant of
powers to it, or that the means of competition were acquired by some violation of the Constitution. The contention is foreclosed by prior decisions that the damage
consequent on competition, otherwise lawful, is in such
circumstances damnum absqve injuria, and will not support a cause of action or a right to sue."
Certain provisions of state statutes regulating public
utilities are claimed to confer on the appellants the right
to be free of competition. Each of the states in which
any of them operates, save Mississippi,"2 has established
a commission to supervise and regulate public utilities.
While the statutes 3 differ in their provisions, all but that
of Virginia require a public utility to obtain a certificate
of convenience and necessity as a condition of doing business. The appellants commenced business in the various
states prior to the adoption of the requirement of such
certificates and, so far as appears, they have none covering their entire operations. They have, however, obtained certificates for extensions made since the passage
of the statutes; and they claim that, in any event, these

laws afford them protection from the Authority's competition since any utility now seeking to serve in their territory must obtain a certificate, and hence they have standing to maintain this suit against the Authority which ha,
none. The position cannot be maintained. Whether
competition between utilities shall be pruhibited, regulated or forbidden is a matter of state policy. That
policy is subject to alteration at the will of the legislature. 4 The declaration of a specific policy creates no
vested right to its maintenance in utilities then engagexd
in the business or thereafter embarking in it.
Moreover, the states in which the Puthority is now
functioning have declared their policy in respect of its activities. Alabama has enacted that federal agencies, instrumentalities, or corporations shall not be under the
jurisdiction of its Public Service Commission; "5 that
municipalities and improvement authorities may own and
operate electric generating and distributing systems and
may contract with a federal agency such as the Authority
for the purchase of energy, and stipulate as to the use of
the energy, including rates of resale; 16 that nonprofit
membership corporations may be formed for the distribution among their members of electricity with like
power to contract with the Authority for the required
energy. 7 Tennessee has amended § 5448 of its Code,
which defines public utilities, so as to exclude federal corporations such as the Authority from the jurisdiction of
the State Utilities Commission; 18 has authorized municipalities to own and operate electric generating transmission and distribution systems. and to contract for power

with the Authority on terms deemed appropriate, including the fixing of resale prices; "9has authorized the formation of nonprofit membership electric corporations with
like powers to contract."0 Kentucky has authorized
municipalities to establish and maintain light, heat, and
power plants; 21 and has provided for the organization of
nonprofit coperative electric corporations which may
contract with the Authority for purchase of energy and
stipulate as to resale prices. 22 Mississippi, which has no
state law for regulation of utilities, has empowered
municipal and county governments to establish and maintain electric distribution systems which may buy power
from the Authority and contract as to resale prices; 2.
has created a rural electrical authority and authorized the
formation of power districts and nonprofit competitives,
all competent to purchase energy- from the Authority and
distribute it and to contract with the Authority as to
resale rates to consumers. 24 The Authority's action in
these states is consonant with state law, but, as has been
shown, if the fact were otherwise, the appellants would
have no standing to restrain its continuance.
As the Authority has not acted in any way in North
Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia or West Virginia, the
appellant's contention that its proposed entry into some
or all of them confers a right to sue for an injunction
against injury thereby threatened has even less support.25

TENNESSEE POWER CO. v. T. V. A.
118

Opinion of the Court.

The appellants may not raise any question of discrimi-

nation forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment involved in state exemption of the Authority from commission regulation. For this reason Frost v. Corporation
Commission, 278 U. S. 515, on which they rely, is inapplicable. Manifestly there can be no challenge of the
validity of state action in this suit.
A distinct ground upon which standing to maintain the
suit is said to rest is that the acts of the Authority cannot
be upheld without permitting federal regulation of purely
local matters reserved to the states or the people by the
Tenth Amendment and sanctioning destruction of the
liberty said to be guaranteed by the Ninth Amendment
to the people of the states to acquire property and employ it in a lawful business. The proposition can mean
only that since the Authority sells electricity at rates
lower than those heretofore maintained by the appellants such sale is an indirect regulation of appellants'
rates. But the competition of a privately owned company authorized by the state to enter the territory served
by one of the appellants would, in the same sense, constitute a regulation of rates. The contention amounts to
saying that competition by an individual or a state corporation is not regulation but competition by a federal
agency is. In contracting with municipalities and nonprofit corporations the Authority has stipulated respectchase and use of power created by the Authority. In all of them
municipalities may establish and operate their own distribution systems: North Carolina Code (1935) § 2807; South Carolina Code
(1932) §§ 7278-7280, 8262; Virginia Code (1936) § 3031; West
Virginia Code (1937) §§ 494, 591 (86). North Carolina and Virginia
have statutes permitting the formation of coperatives which may
buy power from the Authority under contracts fixing resale rates:

ing the price at which the energy supplied shall be resold
by its vendees. That is said to be a regulation of the appellant's business. But it is nothing more than an incident of competition; it is but a method of seeking and
assuring a market for the power which the Authority has
for sale, and a lawful means to that end 2 The sale of
government property in competition with others is not a
violation of the Tenth Amendment. As we have seen
there is no objection to the Authority's operations by the
states, and, if this were not so, the appellants, absent uhe
states or their officers, have no standing in this suit to
raise any question under the amendment. 27 These considerations also answer the argument that the appellants
have a cause of action for alleged infractions of the Ninth
Amendment.
Finally, it is asserted that the right to maintain this
suit is sustained by certain allegations of concerted action
by the officials of the Authority and the Public Works
Administrator. The bill alleges that having adopted an
unlawful plan the defendants have coiperated, and
threaten to continue to co~perate in its execution, with'
Harold L. Ickes, as Administrator of the Federal Administration of Public Works, in a systematic campaign to
coerce and intimidate the complainants into selling their
existing systems in municipalities or territory in which
the Authority desires to seize the market for electricity;
that, in order to make this coercion effective, Ickes has,
in coiperation with, or on request of, the Authority, announced loans and grants of federal funds to municipalities; that the Authority and Ickes have co~perated, and
continue to do so, to force municipalities to purchase the

Authority's power under threats that, unless they do, proposed loans and grants for municipal systems will not be
made. The bill states that, though Ickes "confederated
and acted with the defendants in some of its illegal acts
and is, therefore, a proper party, he is not a necessary
party and is not joined as a defendant because he is beyond the jurisdiction of the court." There is a prayer
that the defendants be restrained from confederating and
acting in concert with Ickes for the described ends.
The District Court finds that the Authority has not
indulged in coercion, duress, fraud, or misrepresentation
in procuring contracts with municipalities, co6peratives
or other purchasers of power; has not acted with any
malicious or malevolent motive; and has not conspired
with municipalities or other purchasers of power. The
record justifies these findings. It is claimed, however,
that they are inconclusive since the court erroneously excluded much proffered evidence tending to sustain the
charge. An examination of the record discloses that certain of the evidence offered was properly excluded, and
that in other instances the rejection of that offered constituted, at most, harmless error.
Error is assigned to the trial court's refusal to permit
the taking of the deposition of the Public Works Administrator. In view of the prior opportunity which the
claimants had to take this deposition, the lateness of the
application, and other factors, permission to take the
deposition was a matter within the court's discretion and
it does not appear that the discretion was abused.
The remaining assignments of error directed to the exclusion of evidence of co6peration between the two federal agencies go to the rejection of evidence consisting
largely of correspondence between them and press releases or announcements by officers of one or the other.
The record contains all but a few of these rejected docu133096°-:19-10

ments, those omitted apparently not being thought of
importance. Scrutiny of them compels the conclusion
that if the rejected evidence had been admitted, the trial
court's holding that a conspiracy had not been proved
should not be overruled.
The only findings on this subject requested by the appellants were to the effect that the Public Works Administration has coperated with and assisted the Tennessee
Valley Authority in the furtherance of the latter's power
program and that the former has made contracts and allotments for loans and grants to twenty-three municipalities in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee,
amounting to about fourteen million dollars, for the purpose of constructing municipal systems to distribute the
Authority's power in competition with the appellants;
that the applications for loan and grant in some instances
specify that the municipal system will duplicate a privately owned system; in others that a large business will
be done by the municipal plants because of the low promotional rates of the Authority; that some of the applications state they were filed to take advantage of the
low rates offered by the Authority and that, with few
exceptions, they state that the electricity to be distributed in the city will be purchased from the Authority.
A futther requested finding is that the applications of
certain Alabama cities recite that they have secured written contracts from practically all consumers; that these
contracts refer to lower rates to be secured, provided the
rates charged by the city shall be thus prescribed by the
Authority for resale at retail. The court refused to make
the requested findings and error is assigned to this re-fusal. It is apparent that if the court had made the
findings no conclusion of confederation or conspiracy, with
malicious intent to harm the appellants or to destroy
their business, would thereby have been required.

plants, in competition with the appellants, does not spell

from the courts complainants seeking constitutional protection of their property against defendants acting, as
it is alleged, under invalid claim of governmental authority in setting up and carrying on a program calculated to destroy complainants' business. The issues
joined by the parties, tried below and fully presented to
thiis Court, include the question whether, when construed
to authorize the things done and threatened by defendants, the challenged enactment is authorized by the Constitution or repugnant to the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth
Amendments. The issues also include the question
whether, as being applied, the Act is void because the
execution of defendants' program will deprive complainants of their property without due process of law in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. This Court holds
complainants have no standing to challenge the validity
of the Act and puts aside as immaterial their claim that
by defendants' unauthorized acts their properties are
being destroyed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
BUTLER, J., dissenting.

306 U. S.

The opinion states: "The Authority's acts which the
appellants claim give rise to a cause of action, comprise
(1) the sale of electrical energy at wholesale to municipalities empowered by state law to maintain and operate
their own distribution systems; (2) the sale of such energy at wholesale to membership corporations organized
under state law to purchase and distribute electricity to
their members without profit; (3) the sale of firm and
secondary power at wholesale to industi-ial plants."
That the substance of complainants' case may not be
so compressed is disclosed by the summary of their bill
that follows:
Complainants are 19 public utilities. Each, authorized
by law, is engaged in generating and selling electricity
within the political subdivisions of various States. Some
have long-term contracts under which they furnish large
quantities of electricity. They are more than able to
fill the needs of the territories in which they operate
and are ready to supply such additional facilities as may
be needed in the future. Their properties are modern
and economically operated and possess great value as
going concerns. Their rates yield no more than a reasonable return and are fully regulated by the States in which
they serve.
Defendants are the Tennessee Valley Authority, a body
corporate created by the Act of May 18, 1933, with the
right to sue and be sued, and its three directors, charged
with the duty of exercising the powers of the Authority.
Harold L. Ickes, the Administrator of the Public Works
Administration, has confederated with defendants in
some acts charged to-be illegal; he is not sued because
beyond the jurisdiction of the court. From its principal office at Knoxville, Tennessee, the Authority carries on a proprietary business as a public utility for the
generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama.

BUTLEP,

J., dissenting.

On its face, the Act discloses purpose to authorize a
large and indeterminate number of great works for the
primary purpose of creating a vast supply of electric
power, to use this power to establish the United States
in the business of producing, transmitting, and selling
electric power, and to dispose of this power in a manner
inconsistent with the principles of our dual system and so
as to govern the concerns reserved to the States. Any
references in the Act to navigation or to any other constitutional objective are unsubstantial and mere pretenses or pretexts under which it is sought to achieve
an object reserved to the States. Except with respect to
power available at Wilson Dam prior to the acts complained of, the program is one of creating an outlet for
power deliberately produced as a commercial enterprise to
be sold in unlawful and destructive competition with
power now available in adequate quantities.
The program contemplates ultimately the development
of all power sites on the Tennessee River and all its
tributaries as an integrated electric power system, the
construction and operation of hydro-electric plants at
these sites, the use of auxiliary steam plants, the interconnection of all plants, and the elimination of existing
privately owned utilities.
In the area of over 40,000 square miles, there are 149
water power sites which, with auxiliary steam plants, will
produce 25 billion k. w. h. annually. Present consumption of the area is 56% of that quantity. The electric
power to be produced by defendants can only be sold
through displacement of the complainants. Execution
of the programn will necessarily destroy all or a substantial part of the business and property of each of the
complainants.
Defendants have taken over Wilson Dam and the nitrate plant and have commenced, or recommended to
Congress, the construction of I0 other damns; their pro-

gram calls for 11 completed dams by July 1, 1943. They
have prepared plans for the construction of high-tension
transmission lines from the dams to at least 14 cities

and indeed to the whole area. They have purchased or
are attempting to purchase distribution systems in at
least 15 cities. They have entered into contracts to sell
power to various communities and industries for a 20year period and have agreed to supply firm power to
other and larger cities.
The avowed purpose of the program is to effect a federal regulation of intrastate electric rates and service by
a so-called "yardstick" method - or "regulation by competition." The yardstick for wholesale rates is the wholesale rate charged by the Authority. It is unreasonable
and confiscatory as a measure of complainants' rates
in that it excludes the cost of the major part of the investment necessary to render the service and excludes
necessary operating expenses. The yardstick for retail
rates is the sum of the wholesale rate and the amount
which the Authority aJlows municipalities to add to the
wholesale rate to cover cost of local distribution; it excludes many items of necessary cost of rendering the
service.
Pursuant to a plan promulgated in 1933, defendants
are conducting a systematic campaign for the purpose of
disrupting the established business relations between complainants and their customers, destroying the good will
built up by complainants, seizing their markets and inciting the residents of communities served by them to
co6perate with defendants in their scheme to develop an
absolute monopoly.
With full knowledge of the noncompensatory and confiscatory character of the yardstick rates, they have represented to the inhabitants of communities served by complainants that these "yardsticks" were fair measures of
-reasonable rates and have thereby attempted to incite the

inhabitants to build publicly owned systems using power
furnished by the Authority, to lead them to believe that
they are being charged unreasonable rates, to stir up political agitation against privately owned utilities and to
bring complainants into disrepute and disfavor.
The defendants attempt to coerce complainants to sell
distribution systems and transmission lines, in territories
which defendants intend to appropriate, at prices far below fair value by threatening that, unless complainants
accede, they will construct, or cause to be constructed,
duplicate facilities subsidized in construction and operation by federal funds and render complainants' properties
wholly valueless. The Administrator of the Public
Works Administration has co6perated with defendants.
Defendants inform the owners that, unless they sell,
either the Authority or the municipalities will build duplicate systems with federal funds. At defendants' request, the Administrator authorizes and announces a gift
to the municipality of from 30% to 45% of the cost of
the duplicate system and agrees to lend the balance, repayable out of earnings, if any, of the duplicate plant,
upon condition that the municipality will agree to use
power of the Authority and will, as soon as possible, oust
the existing utility. If the utility agrees to sell, the allotments are canceled without regard to the will of the
municipality. This policy has already been applied in
certain cities. The defendants and Administrator also
coperate to force municipalities to agree to purchase
power furnished by the Authority by threats that otherwise federal allotments for public works will be canceled
or denied.
Defendants have caused bills, designed to forward their
power program, to be submitted to the legislatures of
various States in the area and have lobbied for and
brought about their passage. They have installed Authority personnel throughout the area to disseminate

propaganda in behalf of the program. Thc Electric
Home and Farm Authority, a corporation set up as a governmental agency of which the individual defendants are
directors, finances sale of electrical devices, prints and circulates costly advertising in praise of the Authority program. Defendants have offered to supply electricity to
large industrial customers of some of the complainants
at noncompensatory and discriminatory rates. They
have attempted to persuade complainants' customers to
break existing contracts. Complainants cannot meet
this competition because of the noncompensatory rates
and because they are forbidden by state la,- to make discriminatory rates.
The bill prays invalidation of the Act as unconstitutional and injunction and other relief against defendants.
Unquestionably. the bill shows that complainants are
not asserting a right held, or complaining of an injury sustained, in common with the general public. They allege
facts that unmistakably show that each has a valuable
right as a public utility, non-exclusive though it is, to
serve ini territory covered by its franchise, and that, inevitably the value of its business and property used will
suffer irreparable diminution by defendants' program and
acts complained ol. If, because of conflict with the Constitution, the Act does not authorize the enterprise formulated and being executed by defendants, then their conduct is unlawful and inflicts upon complainants direct and
special injury of great consequence. Therefore, they are
entitled to have this Court decide upon the constitutional
questions they have brought here. See Massachusetts v.
Mellon, 262 U. S. 447. 488; Frost v. CorporationCommission, 278 U. S. 515, 521.
