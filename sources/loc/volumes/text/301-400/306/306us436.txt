FAIRBANKS v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 65. Argued February 28, 1939.-Decided March 27, 1939.
1. The redemption before maturity of corporate bonds is not a
"sale or exchange" of capital assets within the meaning of § 208
(a) (1), Rev. Act 1926, and § 101 (c) (1), Rev. Act 1928, and
the gain so realized by the bondholder is not a "capital gain,"
to be taxed at the 121/2% rate, but is taxable at the normal and
surtax rates. P. 437.
2. In providing expressly that amounts received by the holder upon
the retirement of corporate bonds shall be considered as amounts
received in exchange therefor, the Rev. Act of 1934 did not interpret, but changed the prior law. P. 438.
95 F. 2d 794, affirmed.

CERTIORARI, 305 U. S. 667, to review the affirmance of
a judgment for the United States in an action in the
District Court brought under § 610 of the Rev. Act 1928
to recover money erroneously refunded to a taxpayer.

Mr. William Stanley argued the cause, and Mr. Arthur
F. Driscoll was on a brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Andrew D. Sharpe, with whom Solicitor General
Jackson, Assistant Attorney General Morris, and Messrs.
Sewall Key and Maurice J. Mahoney were on the brief,
for the United States.
By leave of Court, Messrs. Carroll N. Perkins and
Leonard A. Pierce filed a brief on behalf of Frances M.
Averill, as amica curiae, in support of petitioner.
MR.

JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
Both courts below ruled that gain derived by the petitioner from redemption of bonds during 1927, 1928 and

FAIRBANKS v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

1929 was not "capital gain" within the meaning of the
controlling statutes.
No contest now exists concerning the facts. The narrow point as counsel agree is this-Must the redemption
of bonds before maturity by the issuing corporation be
treated as tantamount to a sale or exchange of capital
assets within the meaning of § 208 (a) (1), Revenue Act
1926, and § 101 (c) (1), Revenue Act 1928.'
If redemption amounts to sale or exchange, the petitioner's gain was subject to taxation at the twelve and
one-half per cent rate; otherwise, under normal and surtax
rates.
Payment and discharge of a bond is neither sale nor
exchange within the commonly accepted meaning of the
words. The courts below found no sufficient reason for
disregarding this and rightly applied the statutes under
that view.
The Tax Acts of 1921, 1924, 1926, 1928 and 1932 contain like definitions of capital gain. From 1921 to 1929
the Commissioner held that such gain did not arise from
redemption. In 1929 the Board of Tax Appeals held
otherwise. Werner v. Commissioner, 15 B. T. A. 482.
But in 1932 it definitely overruled that determination.
Watson v. Commissioner, 27 B. T. A. 463.
1

Revenue Act 1921 (November 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 232)

provides"Sec. 206. (a) That for the purpose of this title:
(1) The term 'capital gain' means taxable gain from the sale or
exchange of capital assets consummated after December 31, 1921."
This provision without material change was reenacted by Revenue
Act 1924 (June 2, 1924, c. 234, § 208 (a) (1), 43 Stat. 253, 262);
Revenue Act 1926 (February 26, 1926, c. 27, § 208 (a) (1), 44 Stat. 9,
19); Revenue Act 1928 (May 29, 1928, c. 852, § 101 (c) (1), 45 Stat.
791, 811); Revenue Act of 1932 (June 6, 1932, c. 209, § 101 (c) (1),

47 Stat. 169, 191).

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

306 U. S.

The Revenue Act 1934 (May 10, 1934, c. 277, 48 Stat.
680, 714-715) provides"SEC.

117. CAPITAL GAINS Am LOSSES.

(a) General Rule.-In the case of a taxpayer, other
than a corporation, only the following percentages of the
gain or loss recognized upon the sale or exchange of a
capital asset shall be taken into account in computing
net income: . . .
(f) Retirement of Bonds, Etc.-For the purposes of
this title, amounts received by the holder upon the retirement of bonds, debentures, notes, or certificates or other
evidences of indebtedness issued by any corporation (including those issued by a government or political subdivision thereof), with interest coupons or in registered
form, shall be considered as amounts received in exchange
therefor."
What we regard as the correct meaning of the definition
of capital gain in the Revenue Act 1921 and its four
successors is accentuated by long-continued executive construction, also the last conclusion of the Board of Tax
Appeals.
The Circuit Court of Appeals below was right in holding that by the Act 1934 Congress did not attempt to construe the prior Acts and purposely made a material addition thereto.- In Averill v. Commissioner, 101 F.2d 644,
the Circuit Court of Appeals First Circuit acted upon a
different view. This conflict caused us to bring up the
present cause notwithstanding the application for certiorari had been denied earlier in the term.
The challenged judgment must be
Affirmed.
