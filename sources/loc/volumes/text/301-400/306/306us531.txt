APPEAL

Mr. Harvey H. Smith for appellants.
Mr. J. J. Leary, with whom Messrs. Hubert Meredith,
Attorney General of Kentucky, Clifford E. Smith, and
Samuel M. Rosenstein were on the brief, for appellees.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE

HUGHES delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The Commonwealth of Kentucky, acting through its
Commissioner of Revenue, brought suit in the Franklin
Circuit Court of that State to recover the amount of a
tax claimed to be due *fromthe Central Distributing Company, a Kentucky corporation. A writ of attachment
was issued and levied upon certain whiskey which appellants claimed was subject to their lien under a chattel
mortgage executed by the company. The mortgagor was
in default' and appellants had taken possession of the
property.

Opinion of the Court.

306 U. S.

Contending that the statutes under which the tax was
assessed and sought to be enforced (Alcohol Control Act,
effe.ctive March 17, 1934, Alcohol Beverage Tax Act,
effective May 1, 1936, and Alcohol Beverage Control Law,
effective March 7, 1938) were invalid under the state
constitution and also under the commerce clause, the contract clause, and the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, of the Federal Constitution, appellants
brought this suit in the federal court against the Commonwealth, on relation of the Commissioner of Revenue,
and the Sheriff, to restrain the proceedings to collect the
tax and to prevent the defendants from disposing of the
property which had been attached.
Defendants moved to dismiss the petition upon the
ground that the plaintiffs had an adequate legal remedy
and that the court was without jurisdiction to grant the
relief sought.
On hearing of the application for a temporary and permanent injunction, the District Court, composed of three
judges, dismissed the petition. The court stated that it
was its opinion that § 12 of the Alcohol Control Act of
1934 "furnishes petitioners an adequate remedy . . . to

contest the validity of said Act and to recover any taxes
collected from them by the State of Kentucky" thereunder. The case comes here on appeal. Jud. Code,
§ 266, 28 U. S. C. 380.
Appellants contest the ruling of the District Court, asserting that under § 12 of the Act of 1934-the text of
which is set forth in the margin 1-the remedy is given
Section 12 of the Act of 1934 (Carroll's Kentucky Statutes, Baldwin's 1936 Revision, § 4214a-23) is as follows:
"No suit shall be maintained in any court to restrain or delay the
collection or payment of the tax levied by this Act. The aggrieved
taxpayer shall pay with or without protest the tax as and when required and may at any time within two years from the date of such
payment sue the Commonwealth through its agent, the Auditor of

only to the taxpayer and is not available to appellants,
the taxpayer's mortgagees. The Commonwealth urges
the contrary, but points to no decision of the state court
which is decisive of that point.
Apart from that question, the Commonwealth insists
that appellants had a plain and adequate remedy by appearing in the attachment suit in the Franklin Circuit
Court where all issues as to the validity of the tax and
the propriety of the proceedings for enforcement could
be litigated and determined, with the ultimate right of
review in this court of any federal question raised and
decided. The Commonwealth points to the provision of
the Civil Code of Practice of Kentucky, § 29,2 under
which any person claiming an interest in property which
has been attached may file his petition stating his claim
Public Accounts, in an action at law in any court, state or federal,
otherwise having jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter, for
the recovery of the tax paid with legal interest thereon from the
date of payment. If it is finally determined that said tax or any part
thereof was wrongfully collected, for any reason, it shall be the duty
of the Auditor of Public Accounts to issue his warrant on the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the amount of such tax
so adjudged to have been wrongfully collected together with legal
interest thereon. The Treasurer shall pay the same at once out of
the general expenditure fund of the State in preference to other
warrants or claims against the Commonwealth. A separate suit need
not be filed for each individual payment made by any taxpayer, but
a recovery may be had in one suit for as many payments as may
have been made."
, The text of § 29 of the Civil Code of Practice is as follows:
"In an action or proceeding for the recovery of real or personal
property, or for the subjection thereof to a demand of the plaintiff
under an attachment or other lien, any person claiming a right to, or
interest in, the property or its proceeds, may, before payment of the
proceeds to the plaintiff, file, in the action, his verified petition stating his claim and controverting that of the plaintiff; whereupon the
court may order him to be made a defendant; and upon that being
done, his petition shall be treated as his answer. But if he be a
non-resident he must give security for costs."

and controverting that of the plaintiff in the attachment
whereupon he may be made a defendant, his petition being treated as an answer. See, also, Carroll's Kentucky
Statutes, Baldwin's 1936 Revision, § 950-1.
Appellants assert that the Franklin Circuit Court was
without jurisdiction of the attachment suit, but that
question, appropriately one for the decision of the state
court, could manifestly be presented and determined in
that action.
Appellants also state that in the present suit they
asked the federal court to exercise its equity powers in
their aid in the foreclosure of their mortgage, but it is
apparent that this relief is merely incidental and that the
main object of the suit is to restrain the proceedings in
the Franklin Circuit Court which had been brought to
enforce the collection of the tax.
This endeavor, aside from the application of the general principle governing the equity jurisdiction, encounters two positive statutory prohibitions; (1) that of
§ 265 of the Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. 379) providing
that an injunction shall not be granted to stay proceedings in a state court (Essanay Film Co. v. Kane, 258
U. S. 358, 361; Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, 292 U. S.
86, 97; Hill v. Martin, 296 U. S.393, 403); and (2) the
provision of the Act of August 21, 1937 (c. 726, 50 Stat.
738) amending the first paragraph of § 24 of the Judicial
Code to the effect that "no district court shall have jurisdiction of any suit to enjoin, suspend, or restrain the
assessment, levy, or collection of any tax imposed by or
pursuant to the laws of any State where a plain, speedy,
and efficient remedy may be had at law or in equity in
the courts of such State,"

The jut!-ment is
Affirmed.
