H. P. WELCH CO. v. NEW HAMPSHIRE.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.
No. 295.

Argued January 3, 1939.-Decided January 30, 1939.

A statute of New Hampshire forbids the owner of any motor vehicle used on the highways of the State in the transportation of
property for hire, to require or permit to operate such vehicle
a driver who has been continuously on duty for more than 12
hours. Registration certificates, without which no common or
contract carrier may lawfully operate over the highways of the
State, may be suspended or revoked for violations. The statute

exempts: those transporting products of their own manufacture
or labor; motor vehicles not principally engaged in the transportation of property for hire; and carriers operating exclusively,
in a city or town or within 10 miles thereof, or beyond the 10
mile limit on not more than two trips in 30 days. Held:
1. As applied to a carrier which-was not exempt, the statute
was not by reason of its exemptions repugnant to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 82.

2. Enforcement of the statute against an interstate motor carrier
for violations committed subsequently to the passage of the federal Motor Carrier Act, 1935, but prior to the effective date (and
the date of issue) of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant thereto, prescribing maximum hours of service
of employees of such carriers, was valid. P. 83.
3. Congress will not be deemed to have intended that state
regulatory measures relating to safety on the highways should be
superseded prior to the effective date of similar federal regulation.
P. 85.

APPEAL from a judgment dismissing an appeal from an

order of the Public Service Commission of New Hampshire suspending the registration certificates of a motor

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the
Court.
A statute of New Hampshire'

declares unlawful the

operation on its roads of motor vehicles for specified
transportation by drivers who have been continuously

on duty for more than 12 hours. By this appeal we are
called on to decide whether, as applied in this case, §§ 3,
4, and 8 are repugnant to the equal protection clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment, and whether § 8 and 11
Laws 1933, c. 106 as aniended by c. 160,

were superseded by the federal Motor Carrier Act, 1935,
§ 204,2 and regulations prescribed under it by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The New Hampshire Act declares that the number of
motor vehicles operated by carriers for hire has made
regulation necessary .to the end that its highways may be
safer for use by the general public. § 1. It requires
common and contract carriers between points within the
State to register their trucks with the public service commission. § 2. Contract carriers include those, other
than common carriers, who haul for hire by motor vehicle
on any road of the State. § 3. Exempted from the challenged regulation are those transporting products of their
own manufacture or labor (§ 3), and motor vehicles not
principally engaged in the transportation of property for
hire or operating exclusively in a city or town or within
10 miles of its limits or beyond the 10-mile limit on not
more than two trips in 30 days. § 4.
Section 8 declares that "It shall be unlawful for any
driver to operate, or for the owner thereof to require or
permit any driver to operate, any motor vehicle for the
transportation of property for hire on the highways of
this state when the driver has been continuously on duty
for more than twelve hours, and after a driver has been
continuously on duty for twelve hours it shall be unlawful for him or for the owner of the vehicle to permit him
to operate any such motor vehicle on the highways of
this state until he shall have had at least eight consecutive hours off duty." Section 11 provides that for violations of the Act the commission shall have authority
after notice and hearing, to susrend or revoke any registration certificate.

carrier of freight for hire by motor vehicles over public
highways in that State and in New Hampshire. Approximately 99 per cent of its business is interstate. It has
terminals at Boston in Massachusetts, and at Manchester,
Concord, and Claremont in New Hampshire. In 1937 it
obtained from the New Hampshire commission registration certificates for 20 trucks. After notice and hearing,
the Commission, in a decision filed as of December 11,
1937, held appellant had violated the provisions of § 8
and ordered that its certificates be suspended for five
days. Appellant appealed to the state supreme court.
That court upheld the challenged provisions and dismissed the appeal. 89 N. H. 428; 199 A. 886.
1. Sections 3, 4, and 8 are not repugnant to the equal
protection clause. The state court found that the purpose of § 8 is "to protect users of the highways of this
State from the danger likely to result to them from the
operation thereon of trucks under the control of drivers
suffering from the effects of fatigue." Appellant's contention is that the discrimination between drivers of
motor carriers for hire subject to § 8 and those exempted
by § § 3 and 4, has no fair or substantial relation to highway safety. It suggests, and we may assume, that the
roads of New Hampshire are extensively used for transportation by trucks not regulated by § 8'; that drivers of
them are just as susceptible to fatigue from long hours
of continuous operation as are those operating the trucks
used by appellant and other common carriers for hire,
and that the dangers attributable to fatigued drivers are
the same in one class of service as in another. Appellant
has failed to show that, in operations to which § 8 applies, continuous driving for more than 12 hours is not
so much more prevalent than in those exempted (§ § 3, 4)
as to constitute a reasonable basis for the differentiation.
We are of opinion that, for reasons given above, those
stated by the state supreme court in this case and by

Opinion of the Court.

this Court in Dixie Ohio Express Co. v. Georgia Comm'n,
ante, p. 72, the classification in question does not conflict
with the rule of equal protection.
2. As applicable to the violations of the state law found
to have been committed by appellant, §§ 8 and 11 were
not superseded by the federal Motor Carrier Act, 1935,
or the regulations made under it by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
That Act became law August 9, 1935. Under the caption "General Duties and Powers of the Commission,"
§ 204 (a) declares: "It shall be the duty of the Commission . . . to regulate" common and contract carriers by
"motor vehicle ... and to that end the Commission may
establish reasonable requirements with respect to . . .
qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment." By order made under authority of that section December 29,
1937, the Commission prescribed regulations as to maximum hours of service of drivers of motor vehicles operated in interstate commerce by common and contract
4
carriers.' These regulations were modified July 12, 1938
and their effective date has been postponed to January
31, 1939.' With exceptions that need not be stated here,
tley declare that no common carrier shall permit or require any driver to remain on duty for more than 60
hours a week or more than 10 hours in any period of 24
consecutive hours."
Appellant does not suggest that prior to congressional
action the State was without power, for protection of
persons and property, to regulate use of its roads as provided in § 8, and to enforce obedience in accordance with
§ 11. Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 320.

Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465. Cleveland, C., C. &
St. L. Ry. Co. v. Illinois, 177 U. S. 514. The violations for
which the state commission suspended appellant's registration certificates occurred after the effective date of
the federal Act and before the Interstate Commerce Commission made its order. Without so deciding, we assume,
so far as concerns the periods of continuous service condemned by the state commission, that when the federal
regulations take effect they will operate to supersede the
challenged provisions of the state statute. Then, the
sole question is whether Congress intended that from
the time of the federal enactment until effective action
by the Commission, there should be no regulation of
periods of continuous operation by drivers of motor vehicles hauling in interstate commerce. Our decisions
I
ide no formula for discovering implied effect of federal statutes upon state measures such as that under
consideration. Here, the way is made clear by the language and context considered in connection with existing conditions. Section 204 (a) definitely imp'oses upon
the Commission the duty to "regulate" but merely
authorizes it to establish reasonable requirements with
respect to, inter alia, qualifications and maximum hours
of service of employees and safety of operation and equipment. The distinction intended between duty imposed
and action permitted is more striking in view, of the
matters that, along with qualifications and hours of service of drivers, are committed to the discretion of the
Commission. They include transportation of baggage
and express, uniform systems of accounts, records, and
reports, and preservation of records.
The roads belong to the State. There is need of local
supervision of operation of motor vehicles to prevent
collisions, to safeguard pedestrians, and the like. Unquestionably, reasonable regulation of periods of continuous driving is an appropriate measure. In view of the

Opinion of the Court.

efforts of governmental authorities everywhere to mitigate the destruction of life, limb and property resulting
from the use of motor vehicles, it cannot be inferred that
Congress intended to supersede any state safety measure
prior to the taking effect of a federal measure found suitable to put in its place. Its purpose to displace the
local law must be definitely expressed. Mintz v. Baldwin,
289 U. S. 346, 350. The rule applicable is clearly stated
in Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n, 245
U. S. 493, 510: "In construing federal statutes enacted
under the power conferred by the commerce clause of
the Constitution . . . it should never be held that Congress intends to supersede or suspend the exercise of the
reserved powers of a State, even where that may be done,
unless, and except so far as, its purpose to do so is clearly
manifested." We have frequently applied that principle.
See e. g. Reid v. Colorado, 187 U. S. 137, 148. Missouri
Pacific Ry. Co. v. Larabee Mills Co. 211 U. S. 612, 621,
et seq. Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Harris,234 U. S.
412, 418-419. Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 282
U. S. 133, 139. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Nebraska
Ry. Comm'n, 297 U. S. 471, 478. Kelly v. Washington,
302 U. S. 1, 10, et seq. Appellant cites Northern Pacific
R y. Co. v. Washington, 222 U. S. 370, 378; Erie Railroad
Co. v. New York, 233 U. S. 671; Oregon-Washington Co.
v. Washington, 270 U. S. 87; Napier v. Atlantic Coast
Line, 272 U. S. 605, 613; and Missouri Pacific R. Co. v.
Porter, 273 U. S. 341, 345. In each, the facts differ so
widely from those of the case before us that no discussion
is required to show that it is not in point.
Plainly Congress by mere grant of power to the Interstate Commerce Commission did not intend to supersede
state police regulations established for the protection of
the public using state highways.
Affirmed.
