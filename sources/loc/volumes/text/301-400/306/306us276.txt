UNITED STATES v. BERTELSEN & PETERSEN
ENGINEERING CO.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 416.

Argued February 3, 1939.-Decided February 27, 1939.

1. A taxpayer having overpaid internal revenue taxes for 1917, the
Commissioner ordered a refund of part of the overpayment and
credited the balance to a deficiency in 1918 taxes, although assessment of the latter was then barred by limitations. The taxpayer
sued the United States to recover judgment in the amount so
credited. The collector who had wrongfully collected the excess
1917 taxes was dead or out of office at the time this proceeding
was begun. Held:
(1) The Circuit Court of Appeals correctly ruled that timely
and proper claim for the overpayment for 1917 had been made
as required by R. S.3226, as amended and reenacted by Revenue
Act of 1926, and that the suit was brought "to recover that part
of a claim for refund of the 1917 over-payment which had been
disallowed by improperly applying it to an invalid assessment of a
deficiency tax for 1918." P. 279.
(2) The certificate of overassessment issued by the Commissioner, ordering refund of part of a disclosed overpayment for 1917
and crediting the balance to a deficiency for 1918, did not constitute
an account stated between the Government and the taxpayer, who
did not assent. P. 280.
(3) The suit was within the jurisdiction of the District Court
under Jud. Code § 24 (20), as amended. Distinguishing Lowe

2. A suit brought by a taxpayer to recover admitted overpayments of
internal revenue taxes for 1922 to 1925, made to a collector who at
the beginning of the suit was out of office, which overpayments the
Commissioner undertook to credit against alleged deficiencies of
taxes for 1926 to 1928, held not a suit to recover payments on
account of taxes for 1926 to 1928, but one for the recovery of
overpayments for 1922 to 1925, in respect of which timely claims
for refunds had been filed; and that the suit was within the juris*Together with No. 437, United States v. Jaffray, et al., Trustees.

MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In each of these causes counsel for the United States
maintain the District Court was without jurisdiction to
determine the issues. The Circuit Courts of Appeal ruled
otherwise and approved judgments for respondents. The
collectors who received the excess taxes in question were
either dead or out of office when the proceedings to recover were commenced. The question of jurisdiction only
is open for our consideration.

Ten Thousand Dollars.
The Acts of 1921, 1924, 1925 and 1926 1 enlarged the
jurisdiction of District Courts by adding the following to
§ 24 (20) Judicial Code:
"Concurrent with the Court of Claims, of any suit or
proceeding, commenced after the passage of the Revenue
Act of 1921, for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax
alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or
collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been
excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, under
the internal-revenue laws, even if the claim exceeds
$10,000, if the collector of internal revenue by whom such
tax, penalty, or sum was collected is dead or is not in
office as collector of internal revenue at the time such suit
or proceeding is commenced."
Section 3226 Revised Statutes as amended and renacted by Revenue Act 1926, c. 27, § 1113 (a), 44 Stat. 9,

Section 3226 was further amended by Act June 6, 1932,
c. 209, § 1103 (a), 47 Stat. 169, 2S6, so as to read as shown
in the margin.4
No. 416.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue undertook to
deduct more than Ten Thousand Dollars from an admitted overpayment by respondent upon 1917 taxes and
to apply this to a declared deficiency for 1918 taxes
then barred by the Statute of Limitations. By this suit
respondent seeks a judgment for the amount so deducted.
The Circuit Court of Appeals properly held "this action
was brought to recover that part of a claim for refund of
the 1917 overpayment which had been disallowed by
in'lproperly applying it to an invalid assessment of a

deficiency tax for 1918." Also, rightly we think, that
timely and proper claim for the overpayment for 1917
had been made as required by § 3226 Revised Statutes as
rebnacted 1926.
And we accept the conclusions stated in the following
excerpt from its opinion"The certificate of overassessment issued by the Commissioner on July 27, 1926, disclosed an overpayment by
the taxpayer of the 1917 tax of $91,570.34, of which the
Commissioner ordered refunded to the taxpayer approximately $55,000, and on July 27, 1926, credited $34,555.68
to a deficiency tax for 1918. It cannot be said that the
certificate of overassessment constituted an account stated
between the government and the taxpayer, since the taxpayer refused to assent to the application of any part of
the overpayment to a deficiency tax for 1918. To constitute an account stated there must be an agreement
as to liability and the amount due. Goodrich, Admr. v.
Coffin, 83 Me. 324. That the taxpayer's petition was not
based on an allowance of an overpayment for 1917, and
an implied promise by the government to refund, is
equally clear, since the taxpayer refused to assent to the
application of $34,555.68 to a deficiency tax of 1918. The
application by the Commissioner on July 27, 1926, of a
part of the overpayment for 1917 to a deficiency tax for
1918, against the protest of the taxpayer, constituted a
disallowance of so much of the petitioner's original claim
for refund. .

.

. the suit was one which could have been

brought against a Collector, if living, but who is now
dead or out of office."
Lowe Bros. Co. v. United States, 304 U. S. 302, 303, is
not controlling. There the suit was begun in the District
Court to recover an overpayment of 1917 taxes the alleged
result of a credit made by the Commissioner from an
admitted overpayment for 1918. For this no action could
have been maintained against the collector-he did not

make or authorize the credit. Therefore, the amendment
to § 24 (20) Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. § 41 (20)) enlarging the jurisdiction of the District Court had no application. Here the collector might have been sued since
he wrongly received payment on account of 1917 taxes.
The present cause falls within the very words of the
amendment.
No. 437.
Respondents overpaid internal revenue taxes in sums
exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars for 1922, 1923 and 1924;
and for 1925, $7,800. The Commissioner issued certificates to that effect August 16, 1933. He refused to repay
these sums but undertook to credib them to deficiencies
which he assessed against respondents for 1926, 1927,
1928.
Thereupon this suit was brought to recover the oveVpayments for 1922 to 1925 under § 24 (20) Judicial Code
as amended (U. S. C. Title 28, § 41 (20)) which gives
District Courts jurisdiction in respect of taxes erroneously
received by a collector out of office. Respondents maintain that, in fact, there were no deficiencies for 1926, 1927,
1928, and that by attempting to credit overpayments for
1922 to 1925 against non-existing deficiencies the Commissioner in effect denied their claims for refund.
On the other hand petitioner insists that the Commissioner's action in allowing the overpayments and crediting them against alleged deficiencies amounted to payments on account of taxes assessed for 1926 to 1928. And,
as it was the Commissioner and not the collector who
caused such credit of overpayments to deficiencies, the
District Court was without jurisdiction.
The Circuit Court of Appeals held the suit was one to
recover overpayments admittedly made to the collector
and in respect of which timely claims for refund had
been filed.

It said"The crediting of the overpayments, by the Commissioner, against taxes due from the taxpayer for other
years was a matter of defense, a justification for the failure to refund, and not a matter which destroyed the taxpayer's cause of action or ousted the court of jurisdiction."
This conclusion we think is correct. Other points suggested, so far as presently important, are sufficiently answered by what has been said in No. 416.
Both of the challenged judgments must be

TITUS v. WALLICK.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO.

No. 188.

Argued January 30, 1939.-Decided February 27, 1939.

1. The right to enforce in a state court a judgment recovered in a
court of another State is one arising under Article IV, § 1 of the
Constitution and under a statute of the United States, t. S. § 905;
28 U. S. C. § 687. Since the existence of this right depends upon
the legal effect of the proceedings, and the validity of the judgment,
in the State in which it was rendered, the rulings upon those matters
by the court in which the judgment is sued upon are reviewable by
this Court. P. 287.
2. By the law of New York, an assignment of a chose in action for
the purpose of suit only and obligating the assignee to account for
the proceeds to another enables the assignee to sue in his own
name. P. 288.
3. This effect of an assignment in New York is not altered by adding
to the assignment a power of attorney to bring the suit. P. 289.
4. After recovering a judgment as lawful assignee of the original
cause of action the judgment creditor resisted a claim upon contract for a share of the judgment, made in another suit, by
representing that his interest had been assigned to others before
the contract and by concealing the fact that the cause of action
