plicable regulation. As the petitioner points out, Congress has, in the Revenue Acts of 1936 and 1938, retained
ยง 22 (a) of the 1928 Act in haec verba. From this it is
argued that Congress has approved the amended regulation. It may be that by the passage of the Revenue
Act of 1936 the Treasury was authorized thereafter to
apply the regulation in its amended form. But we have
no occasion to decide this question since we are of opinion
that the reenactment of the section, without more, does
not amount to sanction of retroactive enforcement of the
amendment, in the teeth of the former regulation which
received Congressional approval, by the passage of successive Revenue Acts including that of 1928.
The judgment is
Affirmed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Syllabus.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

306 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case presents the same question as that involved in
No. 328, Helvering v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., ante,
p. 110. Certiorari was granted because of a conflict in the
decisions below. The statutory provision under which
this case arises is ยง 22 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1932,
which is the same as the corresponding section of the
Revenue Act of 1928. The regulations, original and
amended, have the same relation to this controversy as
to that in No. 328. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained
a determination of a deficiency in the petitioner's tax for
the calendar year 1933 and the Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the Board's ruling.1
For the reasons given in No. 328 the judgment must be
Reversed.

TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.

No. 27.

Argued November 14, 15, 1938.-Decided January 30, 1939.

1. The principle permitting suit against an agent of the Government
to restrain execution of an unconstitutional statute protects only
legal rights. P. 137.
2. Franchises to be a corporation and to function as a public utility
and non-exclusive franchises to occupy and use public property
and places for service of the public, do not grant freedom from
competition. P. 138.
3. The validity of a statutory grant of power can not be challenged
merely because its exercise results in harmful competition. The
damage is damnum absque injuria. P. 139.
