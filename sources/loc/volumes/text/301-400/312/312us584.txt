UNITED STATES v. SHERWOOD.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 500.

Argued March 6, 7, 1941.-Decided March 31, 1941.

A New York court, acting under authority of § 795 of the New York
Civil Practice Act, made an order authorizing a judgment creditor
to sue under the Tucker Act, to recover damages from the United
States for breach of its contract with the. judgment debtor, the
order directing that out of the recovery the judgment creditor should
be entitled to a sum sufficient to satisfy his judgment with interest,
costs, etc. The state law cited makes the judgment debtor a necessary party and authorizes him in any suit so brought to attack the
validity of the order and of the judgment on which it is founded.
Held:
1. That a suit brought accordingly against the United States and
the judgment debtor was not within the jurisdiction of the federal
court. P. 588.
2. A court has no jurisdiction of a suit against the United States
to which the United States has not consented. P. 587.
3. Jurisdiction of a federal court to award damages for breach
of contract by the United States is defined by the Tucker Act and
is restricted to suits against the Government alone; if adjudication
of the plaintiff's right to maintain the suit as against a private
party is prerequisite to its prosecution against the United States,
the suit must bedismissed. P. 588.
4. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not authorize any
suit against the United States to which it has not otherwise consented.
P. 589.
5. The Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 28 U. S. C. 723,
authorizing this Court to prescribe rules of procedure in civil actions
gave it no authority to modify, abridge or enlarge the substantive

rights of litigants or to enlarge or diminish the jurisdiction of federal
courts. P. 590.
6. The concurrent jurisdiction of the'District Court under the
Tucker Act does not extend to any suit which could not be litigated
in the Court of Claims. P. 590.
7. Waivers of sovereign immunity from suit are strictly construed.
P. 590.

CERTIORARI, 311 U. S. 640, to review the reversal of a
judgment of the District Court dismissing for want of
jurisdiction a suit against the United States and a private
party.
Mr. Sidney J. Kaplan, with whom SolicitorGeneralBiddle, Assistant Attorney GeneralShea, and Messrs. Melvin
Siegel and Richard H. Demuth were on the brief, for the
United States.
Mr. Milton U. Copland, with whom Mr. David Morgulas was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The New York Supreme Court, acting under authority
of § 795 of the New York Civil Practice Act, made an
order authorizing respondent, as a judgment creditor,
to maintain a suit under the Tucker Act of March 3, 1887,
24 Stat. 505, § 24 (20) of the Judicial Cc,.4-, 28 U. S. C.
§ 41 (20), to recover damages from the Tnited States
for breach of its contract with the judgment debtor. The
question for decision is whether a United States District
Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
The order authorized respondent, who had recovered
a judgment against Kaiser in the New York Supreme
Court for $5,567.22, to bring suit against the Government to recover for breach of its contract with Kaiser
for the construction of a postoffice building. The order

586

312 U. S.

directed that out of the amount recovered respondent
should be entitled to a sum sufficient to satisfy his judgment with interest "as well as costs, disbursements and
expenses which may be allowed by the court."
Respondent brought the present-suit against the United
States and Kaiser in the District Court for Eastern New
York. By his complaint he set up the judgment and the
order of the state court, the breach of contract by the
United States, and the consequent damage to Kaiser in
the sum of $14,448.49, and prayed judgment in the sum
of $10,000. The order of the District Court dismissing
the complaint for want of jurisdiction was reversed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
112 F. 2d 587, which held that under Rule 17 (b) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure respondent's "capacity
to sue" was governed by the law of New York, which
was his domicile; and 'that the order of the state court
had conferred authority upon respondent to maintain
the suit, the United States being a "person indebted"
within the meaning of § 795 of the 'Civil Practice Act,
which sanctions orders by the state court authorizing a
suit by a judgment creditor against a "person . . . indebted to the judgment debtor." We granted certiorari,
311 U. S. 640, the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court under the Tucker Act being of public
importance.
The United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit
save as it consents to be sued, United States v. Thompson,
98 U. S. 486; United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196; Kansas
v. United States, 204 U. S. 331,; Minnesota v. United States,
305 U. S. 382, 387; Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., 306 U. S. 381, 388; United States v. Shaw,
309 U. S. 495 (see cases cited in The Pesaro, 277 F. 473,
474, et seq.), and the terms of its consent to be sued in any
court define that court's jurisdiction to entertain the suit.

UNITED STATES v. SHERWOOD.
584

Opinion of the Court.

Minnesota v. United States, supra, 388 and cases cited;
cf. Stanley v. Schwalby, 162 U. S. 255, 270. Jurisdiction
to entertain suits against the United States to recover
damages for breach of contract and certain other specified
classes of claims was conferred on the Court of Claims by
Act of February 24, 1855, 10 Stat. 612. With additions
not now material, the jurisdiction was continued by paragraph First of the Tucker Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat.
505, which, as supplemented and reenacted, is now § 145
of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 250. Section 2, which,
as supplemented and reenacted, is now § 24 (20) of the
Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 41 (20), confers jurisdiction
on the district courts "Concurrent with the Court of
Claims, of all claims not exceeding $10,000 founded . . .
upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or
unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect to
which claims the party would be entitled to redress against
the United States, either in a court of law, equity, or
admiralty, if the United States were suable . . ."
The Court bf Claims is a legislative, not a constitutional,
court. Its judicial power is derived not from the Judiciary
Article of the Constitution, but from the Congressional
power "to pay the debts . . . of the United States," which
it is free to exercise through judicial as well as non-judicial
agencies. See Williams v. United States, 289 U. S. 553,
569, 579; Ex parte Bakelite Corporation,279 U. S. 438,
452, et seq. It is for this reason, and because of the power
of the sovereign to attach conditions to its consent to be
sued, that Congress, despite the Seventh Amendment,
may dispense with a jury trial in suits brought in the Court
of Claims. McElrath v. United States, 102 U. S. 426;
Williams v. UnitedStates, supra,570, 571; Ex parte Bakelite Corporation,supra, 453.

diction in the Court of Claims more than in any other
court to entertain suits against the United States, or
for the review of its decisions by appellate courts.
Luckenbach Steamship Co. v. United States, 272 U. S.
-533, 536, et seq. For that reason it has been uniformly
held, upon a review of the statutes creating the court
and defining its authority, that its jurisdiction is confined to 'the rendition of money judgments in suits
brought for that relief against the United States, United
States v. Alire, 6 Wall. 573; United States v. Jones, 131
U. S. 1, and if the relief sought is against others than
the United States the suit as to them must be ignored
as beyond the jurisdiction of the court, United States v.
Jones; supra; Lynn v. United States, 110 F. 2d 586, 588;
Leather & Leigh v. United States, 61 Ct. Cls. 388, or if
its maintenance against private parties is prerequisite to
prosecution of the suit against the United States the
suit must be dismissed. Jackson r.United States, 27 Ct.
Cls. 74, 84; *Waite v. United States, 57 Ct. Cls. 546;
Leather & Leigh v. United States, supra; cf. Turner v.
United States, 248 U. S. 354; Green v. Menominee Tribe,
233 U. S. 558. See Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co.
v. United States, 44 F. 2d 887, 888.
We think it plain that the present suit could not have
been maintained in the Court of Claims because that
court is ivithout jurisdiction of any suit brought against
private parties and because adjudication of the right or
capacity of respondent to 'proceed with the suit upon
the contract of the judgment debtor with the United
States is prerequisite to any recovery upon the Government contract. As the court below recognized, the
judgment debtor, who is made a necessary party by § 795
of the Civil Practice Act, in any suit brought pursuant
to the order of the state court is entitled to attack the
Validity of the order and of the judgment on which it

Opinion of the Court.

is founded. See Nankivel v. Omsk All Russian Government, 237 N. Y. 150, 158; 142 N. E. 569. Adjudication
of that issue is not within the jurisdiction of the Court
of Claims, whose authority, as we have seen, is narrowly.
restricted to the adjudication of suits brought against
the Government alone.
But the question remains whether such a suit is nevertheless within the jurisdiction conferred by the Tucker
Act on the district courts. The Court of Appeals
thought that the obstacles to joining privalte parties, as
parties defendant, in suits against the Government are
procedural only, and that while no procedure is provided
whereby the Court of Claims can adjudicate the rights
of private parties in suits against the Government, that
court is nevertheless free to adopt such a procedure. Cf.
28 U. S. C. § 263. In any case it.thought such procedure
has now been made applicable to suits in the district
courts. by the new rules of civil practice. It concluded
that since the District Court under the Tucker Act has
jurisdiction to adjudicate claims against the United
States and by virtue of other provisions of the Judicial
Code has jurisdiction to adjudicate the issues between
respondent .and the judgment debtor, the Rules of CivilProcedure authorize the exercise of both jurisdictions in
a single suit.
This conclusion presupposes that the United. States,.
either by the rules of practice or by the Tucker Act or
both, has given its consent to be sued in litigations in
which issues between the plaintiff and. third persons are
to be adjudicated. But we think that nothing in the
new rules of civil practice so far as they may be applicable in suits brought in district courts under the T ucker
Act authorizes the maintenance of any suit against the
United States to which it has not otherwise consented.
An authority conferred upon a court to make rules of

312 U. S.

procedure for the exercise of its jurisdiction is not an
authority to enlarge that jurisdiction; and the Act of
June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 28 U. S. C. 723b, authorizing this Court to prescribe rules of procedure in civil
actions gave it no authority to modify, abridge or enlarge
the substantive rights of litigants or to enlarge or diminish the jurisdiction of federal courts.
Nor with due regard to the words of § 2 of the Tucker
Act and to its legislative history can we say that the
United States has consented to the maintenance of suits
against the Government in the district courts which
could not be maintained in the Court of Claims. The
section must be interpreted in the light of its function
in giving consent of the Government to be sued, which
consent, since it is a relinquishment of a sovereign imnunity, must be strictly interpreted. Schillinger v.
United States, 155 U. S.163; Price v. United States, 174
U. S.373; United States v. Michel, 282 U. S.656; United
States v. Shaw, 309 U. S.495; United States v. U. S. Fidelity & GuarantyCo., 309 U. S.506; cf. FederalHousing
Administration v. Burr, 309 U. S.242, 247. Section 2,
authorizing suits against the Government in district
courts, is an integral part of the statute, other sections
of which revised and enlarged the classes of clainms
against the United States which could be litigated in
the Court of Claims. It was the jurisdiction thus defined and established for that court which was extended
by the section to the district courts in the specified instances, for in consenting to suits against the Government in the district courts, Congress prescribed that the
jurisdiction thus conferred should be "concurrent" with
that of the Court of Claims.
Construing the statutory language with that conservatism which is appropriate in the case of a waiver of sovereign immunity, and in the light of the history of the

UNITED STATES v. SHERWOOD.
584

Opinion of the Court.

Court of Claims' jurisdiction to which we have referred,
we think that the Tucker Act did no more than authorize
the District Court to sit as a court of claims and that the
authority thus given to adjudicate claims against the
United States does not extend to any suit which could not
be maintained in the Court of Claims. See United States v.
Jones, supra, 19; United States v. Pfitsch, 256 U. S. 547,
550; cf. Bates Mfg. Co. v. United States, 303 U. S. 567,
571. The matter is not one of procedure but of jurisdiction whose limits are marked by the Government's consent
to be sued. That consent may be conditioned, as we
think it has been here, on the restriction of the issues to
be adjudicated in the suit, to those between the claimant
and the Government. The jurisdiction thus limited is
unaffected by the Rules of Civil Procedure, which prescribe the methods by which the jurisdiction of the federal courts is to be exercised but do not enlarge the
jurisdiction.
The present litigation well illustrates the embarrassments which would attend the defense of suits brought
against the Government if the jurisdiction of district
courts-were not deemed to be as restricted as is that of
the Court of Claims. The Government, to protect its
interests, must not only litigate the claim upon which it
has consented to be sued, but must make certain that
respondent's right, as against the judgment debtor, to
maintain the suit is properly adjudicated. And since. the
alieged claim for damages is larger than the $10,000 jurisdictional amount the Government must either be subjected
to successive suits for partial recoveries of the amount due
or must make certain that respondent has legal authority
to relinquish the judgment debtor's claim in excess of
$10,000, and that this has been accomplished by the limitation of his demand for judgment to that amount. See
Franklin v. United States, 308 U. S. 516; Otis Elevator

No. 535. Argued March 10, 11, 1941.-Decided March 31, 1941.
1. A railroad company whose road traverses an embankment built
up from low-water mark in the bed of a navigable stream to a
level above that of ordinary high water is not entitled, under the
Fifth Amendment, to claim compensation from the United States
for additional cost of protecting the embankment necessitated by
the action of the Government in raising the water level above
natural high-water mark, by means of a dam, for the purpose
of improving navigation. So held, although the embankment was
remote from the natural channel and from the course of navigation
through the pool formed by the dam and did not obstruct navigation. Pp. 593, 596.
2. United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, in part overruled. P. 597.
3. The power of the Government over navigation covers the entire
