to retain those benefits without paying for them.

Such

classification of expenses, at times difficult, rests in the
sound discretion of the bankruptcy court. The District
Court drew no such distinction but proceeded on the

theory that reimbursement for all expenses must be denied.

But it is not apparent that all of them fall within

the prohibited category.
The other points raised by petitioner are so plainly
without merit that they do not warrant mention.
For the reasons stated we reverse the judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals and remand the cause to the
District Court for further proceedings in conformity with

this opinion.
Reversed.

MARYLAND CASUALTY CO. v. PACIFIC COAL &
OIL CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 194.

Argued January 9, 1941.-Decided February 3,1941.

1., To support a suit under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the facts
must show a substantial controversy, real and immediate between
parties having adverse legal interests. P. 273.
2. An insurer issued a policy covering liability of the insured for
personal injuries caused by automobiles "hired by the insured."
Under the policy and the state law, an injured party could keep
the policy from lapsing by serving notice of the accident, etc., if
-the insured failed to do so; and, if successful in obtaining judgment against the insured, could enforce it by supplementary proceedings against the insurer. The insured having been sued in the
state court for personal injuries sustained in a collision between
a truck driven by an employee of the insured and the automobile of the claimant, the insurer brought suit in the federal court
against the insured and the claimant, alleging that the truck was
not "hired by the insured" and contending that it was not bound to
defend the state court suit or to indemnify the insured. Held:

Opinion of the Court.

(1) That diverse citizenship and jurisdictional amount being
present, the insurer's suit involved an "actual controversy" cognizable under the Declaratory Judgment Act. P. 273.
(2) An injunction to restrain the proceedings in the state court
is prohibited by § 265 of the Judicial Code. P. 274.

CERTIORARI, 311 U. S. 625, to review the affirmance of
a decree in a suit for a declaratory judgment.
Mr. Parker Fulton, with whom Mr. Paca Oberlin was
on the brief, for petitioner.
No appearance for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Petitioner issued a conventional liability policy to the
insured, the Pacific Coal & Oil Co., in which it agreed to
indemnify the insured for any sums the latter might be
required to pay to third parties for injuries to person and
property caused by automobiles hired by the insured.
Petitioner also agreed that it would defend any action
covered by the policy which was brought against the insured to recover damages for such injuries.
While the policy was in force, a collision occurred between an automobile driven by respondent Orteca and a
truck driven by an employee of the insured. Orteca
brought an action in an Ohio state court against the insured to recover damages resulting from injuries sustained in this collision. Apparently this action has .not
proceeded to judgment.
Petitioner then brought this action against the insured
and Orteca. Its complaint set forth the facts detailed
above and further alleged that at the time of the collision the employee of the insured was driving a truck sold
to him by the insured on a conditional sales contract.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

312 U. S.

Petitioner claimed that this truck was not one "hired by
the insured" and hence that it was not liable to defend
the action by Orteca against the insured or to indemnify
the latter if Orteca prevailed. It sought a declaratory
judgment to this effect against the insured and Orteca,
and a temporary injunction restraining the proceedings
in the state court pending final judgment in this suit.
Orteca demurred to the complaint on the ground that
it did not state a cause of action against him. The District Court sustained his demurrer and the Circuit Court
of Appeals affirmed. 111 F. 2d 214. We granted cer.tioraxi,.311 U. S. 625, to resolve the conflict with the de-cisions of other Circuit Courts of Appeals cited in the
note.'
The question is whether petitioner's allegations are
sufficient to entitle it to the declaratory relief prayed
in its complaint. This raises the question whether there
is an "actual controversy" within the meaning of the Declaratory Judgmerit Act (Judicial Code § 274d, 28 U. S.
C. § 400), since the District Court is without power to
grant declaratory relief unless such a controversy exists.

MD. CASUALTY 00. v. PACIFIC CO.
270

Opinion of the Court.

The difference between an abstract question and a
"controversy" contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of degree, and it would be
difficult, if it would be possible, to fashion a precise test
for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy. Basically, the question in each case is whether
the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that
there is a substantial controversy, between parties having
adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality
to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment. See
Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 239-242.
It is immaterial that frequently, in the declaratory judgment suit, the positions of the parties in the conventional
suit are reversed; the inquiry is the same in either case.
Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, supra, p. 261.
That the complaint in the instant case presents such
a controversy is plain. Orteca is now seeking a judgment
against the insured in an action which the latter claims
is covered by the policy, and §§ 9510-3 and 9510-4
of the Ohio Code (Page's Ohio General Code, Vol. 6,
§§ 9510-3, 9510-4) give Orteca a statutory right to proceed against petitiofier by supplemental process and action if he obtains a final judgment against the insured
which the latter does not satisfy within thirty days after
its rendition. Compare Maryland Casualty Co. v. United
Corporation,111 F. 2d 443, 446; Central Surety & Insurance Corp. v. Norris, 103 F. 2d 116, 117; U. S. Fidelity
& Guaranty Co. v. Pierson,97 F. 2d 560. 562. Moreover,
Orteca may perform the conditions of the policy issued to
the insured requiring notice of the accident, notice of
suit, etc., in order to prevent lapse of the policy through
failure of the insured to perform such conditions. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Randall, 125 Ohio St.
581; 183 N. E. 433; see also, Lind v. State Automobile
Mutual Insurance Assn., 128.Ohio St. 1; 190 N. E. 138;

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

312 U.S..

State Automobile Mutual Insurance Assn. v. Friedman,
122 Ohio St. 334; 171 N. E. 591.
It is clear that there is an actual controversy between
petitioner and the insured. Compare Aetna Life Ins. Co.
v. Haworth, supra. If we held contrariwise as to Orteca
because, as to him, the controversy were yet too remote,
it is possible that opposite interpretations of the policy
might be announced by the federal and state courts. For
the federal court, in a judgment not binding on Orteca
might determine that petitioner was not obligated under
the policy, while the state court, in a supplemental proceeding by Orteca against petitioner, might conclude
otherwise. Compare Central Surety & Insurance Corp. v.
Norris, supra, p. 117; Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v.
Yeatts, 99 F. 2d 665, 670.
Thus we hold that there is an actual controversy between petitioner and Orteca, and hence, that petitioner's
complaint states a cause of action against the latter.
However, our decision does not authorize issuance of the
injunction prayed by petitioner. Judicial Code § 265,
28 U. S. C. § 379; see Central Surety & Insurance Corp.
v. Norris, supra, p. 117; Maryland Casualty Co. v. Consumers Finance Service, Inc., 101 F. 2d 514, 516; Aetna
Casualty.& Surety Co. v. Yeatts, supra, p. 670.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings
in conformity with this opinion.
Reversed.
