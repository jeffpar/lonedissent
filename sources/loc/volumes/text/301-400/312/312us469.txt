CERTIORARI,

Mr. Lowell M. Birrell, with whom Mr. Charles A. Van
Patten was on the brief, for petitioners.
It is not the plan of the Guild, but "design piracy"
itself, which is unfair competition. International News

which the Commission itself has condemned as unfair
and which was also condemned as unfair in some seventeen codes under N. R. A., it is difficult to see how the
plan could amount to a violation of the Federal Trade
Commission Act.
The sole reason assigned by the court below was that
the plan was said to violate the Sherman Act. Virtually
any contract is in some respect a restraint of trade,
Board of Trade v. U. S., 246 U. S. 231, 238, and. yet not
all agreements between two or more parties are within
the prohibition of the Sherman Act. See Apex Co. v.
Leader, 310 U. S. 469. A proper analysis of the question
is, therefore, this: Does the plan present any. of the evils
which the Sherman Act was designed to prevent? The
answer is clearly, no.
The plan does not contemplate price-fixing. The mere
hope for fairer price levels through voluntary regulation
does not render the regulation unlawful; and: this Court
has likewise encouraged business men to "clean house"
without recourse to the courts. Sugar Institute v. United
States, 297 U. S. 553, 597-598; United States v. Socony
Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 215; Appalachian Coals v.
United States, 288 U. S. 344; Anderson v. United States,
171 U. S. 604; Chicago Board of Trade v. United States,
246 U. S. 231, 238; Cement Mfrs. Protective Assn. v.
United States, 268 U. S. 588; Maple Flooring Assn. v.
United States, 268 U. S. 563; National Assn. of Window
Glass Mfrs. v. United States, 263 U. S. 403. Wolfenstein
v. Fashion Originators'Guild, 244 App. Div. 656. Nor is
any other factor of illegal restraint present in this situation.
Finally, the plan shows no likelihood of resulting in
deterioration of quality. In fact, quite the reverse may
be expected. Johnston & Fitch, N. R. A. Work Materials
Div. (1936) Bulletin No. 52, pp. 199-200, and Worthy,.

Opinion of the Court.

Nystrom, Fashion Merchandising, p. 223.
The plan is not monopolistic in character. There is
no attempt to obtain the exclusive right or power to sell
millinery in any market or part of a market. There is
no attempt to concentrate the millinery industry or any
part of it in the hands of a few. Everyone, whether a
member of the Guild or not, may obtain the protection
it affords. Anyone who can design a hat may compete
for the common prize; and they do compete vigorously.
All that the Guild asks is that they compete by their
own skill and organization rather than by merely. appropriating the skill and organization of others. XX Boston
Law R ev. 365.
The record shows no tendency to crowd anyone .out
of the industry. Our clients merely attempt to see to
it that their own designs, and those of firms registering
with them, be not filched and thereby ruined and that
their competitors enjoy no unfair and unearned advantage.
Solicitor General Biddle, with whom Assistant Attorney General Arnold and Messrs. Charles H. Weston and
W. T. Kelley were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case presents virtually the same issues as Fashion
Originators'Guild of America v. Federal Trade Comm'n,
ante, p. 457. Here, as in that case, the Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed a Federal Trade Commission decree
ordering the petitioners to cease and desist from certain
practices found to have been done in combination and
to constitute "unfair methods of competition" tending
to monopoly.'

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

312 U. S

The members of the Guild involved in this case are designers and manufacturers of women's hats. Their Guild
operates a plan modelled after that of the Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc.
It was stipulated by the parties that "The capacity,
tendency, purpose, and result of the plan . . . and the
acts and practices performed thereunder . . . have been,
and now are, to restrain commerce by eliminating manufacturers of stylish hats . . . as to the outlets of their
products and by limiting the retail dealers . . . as to
their source of supply, and to deprive the public of the
benefits, if any, of competition as to price or otherwise
among retailers of stylish hats in this respect ... "
Pursuant to the evidence and to the stipulation containing this statement, the Commission found that the effect
of the plan was "unduly to hinder competition and to
create monopoly in the sale of women's hats in interstate cammerce."
The respects in which the plan of the Millinery Creator's Guild differs from that of the Fashion Originators'
Guild are not material, and need not be set out in detail.
Nor need the findings of the Commission be enumerated
here. The Commission did find that the Millinery Creator's Guild had tended to hinder competition and create
monopoly "By depriving the public of the benefits of
normal price competition among retailers of stylish hats
for women," a finding not made in the other case, but
the presence or absence of such a finding is not determinative here. On the authority of Fashion Originators'
Guild of America v. Federal Trade Comm'n, the decision
below is
Affirmed.
