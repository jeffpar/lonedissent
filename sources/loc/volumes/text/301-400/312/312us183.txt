HURON HOLDING CORPORATION ET AL. V.
LINCOLN MINE OPERATING CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 212.

Argued January 13, 1941.-Decided February 3, 1941.

Pending appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals from a judgment of
the federal District Court for Idaho, a third party sued the judgment creditor in a state court in New York and a warrant of
attachment was issued attaching the judgment debt in the hands
of the judgment debtor in New York. After the Circuit Court of
Appeals had affirmed the judgment of the District Court, but
before the mandate issued, the New York court rendered judgment
against the judgment creditor and execution was had against the
attached debt. Held:
1. The validity of the attachment was governed by the law of
New York, and by that law the attachment was valid. P. 188.
2. Having paid the judgment debt under 'compulsion of the
execution, the judgment debtor was entitled to have the judgment of the federal. court for Idaho marked satisfied; and the
surety was not chargeable on its supersedeas bond. Pp. 189, 194.
111 F. 2d 438, reversed.

the nonresident judgment creditor, Lincoln, to the extent
of Lincoln's interest in the judgment debt attached.
The state court proceedings were regular in form, and
fully authorized by the statutes and decided law of the
State of New York.
The procedural regularity of the state court attachment, judgment and execution, was found below as a
fact, and is admitted by respondent.
The law of New York authorized the attachment of a
debt.evidenced by a judgment obtained in a federal court
in another state.
The money judgment in the District Court was an adjudication of Huron's debt to Lincoln and remained binding upon both parties during appeal; although execution
was stayed in the District Court, the judgment was not
vacated, and could be sued upon in a foreign court.
The Circuit Court's failure to judge the validity of the
state court attachment in accordance with the state law,
and its application of a general federal rule instead, is
contrary to the principles laid down by this Court in Erie
R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64.
The District Court in deciding that its judgment was
satisfied by Huron and that no judgment should issue
against the Surety Company, correctly adjudged the issues before it and gave due weight under its own law to
the facts proved, including the validity of the state court
proceedings and Huron's prior payment of the judgment
debt pursuant thereto.
Messrs. D. Worth Clark and William H. Langroise
submitted for respondent.
The jurisdiction of the state court in the action against
Lincoln depended solely upon attachment proceedings.
The attachment proceedings in New York were void
for the reason that when the proceedings were initiated
and when the attachment was levied, the judgment debt

was not attachable because (a) it was not absolutely
payable at the time or in the future, and (b) payment
of the debt was dependent upon a contingency which
had not then happened.
The jurisdiction of the District Court of the United
States and the right of the plaintiff to prosecute his suit
in that court having attached, that right cannot be arrested or taken away by any proceedings in another

The judgment of the District Court was final for the
purpose of appeal, but it was not final in the sense that
it constituted the final liquidation of a tort claim, the

Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, has not changed

Congress has provided for appeals, for cost and supersedeas bonds (28 U. S. C. 869, 874), for executions (28

federal courts with power and authority necessary for

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case involves the effect a federal District Court
should give to state court proceedings attaching, while
appeal is pending, a judgment previously rendered by the
federal court.
Respondent, Lincoln Mine Operating Company, obtained judgment against petitioner, Huron Holding Corporation, in the federal District Court for Idaho. Pending appeal of this judgment to the Circuit Court of Appeals, a New York creditor of Lincoln brought suit on a
promissory note against Lincoln in a state court of New
York. Upon a showing that Lincoln was an Idaho corporation, the New York court caused a warrant of attachment to issue against Lincoln's New York property.'
In accordance with New York law,2 summons upon Lincoln was served by a Deputy Sheriff of Ada County,
Idaho. Huron, a New York corporation, answered
the warrant of attachment served upon it in New
York and admitted that it was the defendant against
which judgment in favor of Lincoln had been en'Sections 902 and 903 of Art. 54 of the New York Civil Practice
Act authorize courts to issue warrants of attachment against defendants shown to be foreign corporations in actions against them based
on "Breach of contract, express or implied, . . ."
Section 233, Art. 25, New York Civil Practice Act.

HURON CORP. v. LINCOLN CO.

tered in the Idaho District Court, and that the judgment was still unpaid, subject to its right on an
appeal then pending. After the Circuit Court of Appeals had affirmed the Idaho District Court judgment,
but before the mandate had been sent down, the New
York court rendered judgment against Lincoln, execution
was issued, and under the warrant of attachment the
New York Sheriff was commanded to obtain satisfaction
out of the judgment obligation of Huron to Lincoln.
Under compulsion of the New York execution Huron paid
and then filed a motion in the Idaho court asking that
the federal court's judgment be marked satisfied. Lincoln countered with a motion against National Surety
Company, the guarantor on Huron's supersedeas bond in
the original action, asking that judgment against the
surety be entered in favor of Lincoln. After a hearing
on both motions, the District Court made findings of fact
and conclusions of law, held that the judgment had been
fully satisfied, and declined to enter judgment against
the surety.8 The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.'
Because the issues involved are important to the orderly
administration of justice in the relationship of state and
federal courts, we granted certiorari.
Petitioner contends that the attachment was valid
under the New York law, and should have been given
full effect by the federal court. It is respondent's contention that (1) the attachment proceedings were void;
and (2) even if not void, the District Court should not
have given effect to them, for the reason that this would
be tantamount to an improper deprivation of Lincoln's
right to prosecute its suit in the District Court to full
payment of the judgment.

312 U. S.

First. Here, New York law clearly governed the
.validity of the attachment proceedings. The Idaho District Court found, and it is not denied, that those proceedings complied with the formal requirements of
New York's attachment statutes. But it is contended
that at the time of the levy the New York' court, under
New York law, was without jurisdiction because the
Idaho judgment was then pending on appeal and therefore contingent. Respondent points to certain New York
cases which lay down the general proposition that "an
indebtedness is not attachable unless it is absolutely payable at present, or in the future, and not dependable
upon any contingency." I But both the District Court
and the Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument. And indeed the New York court itself necessarily passed upon this question, adversely to respondent's contention. The garnishee's answer in the New
York court disclosed that the judgment was pending
on appeal, and the New York court's final judgment was
not rendered, nor execution issued, until the Idaho judgment had been affirmed. By its action the New York
court necessarily decided that the judgment debt was
within the scope of New York's attachment laws. And
none of the New York authorities to which the respondents direct our attention militate against the soundness
of the New York court's ruling. On the contrary, other
decisions of the New York courts lead to the conclusion
that the judgment-even though on appeal-was sufficiently definite and final to bring it within the New York

'Herrmann & Grace v. City of New York, 130 App. Div. 531;
114 N. Y. S. 1107, 1110, affirmed, 199 N. Y. 600; 93 N. E. 376.
Other cases cited by respondent which set out the same general
principle are: Fredrick v. Chicago Bearing Metal Co., 221. App.
Div. 588; 224 N. Y. S. 629, 630; Reifman v. Warfield Co., 170 Misc.

statute.' To the same effect, in the federal courts the
general rule has long been recognized that while appeal
with proper supersedeas stays execution of the judgment,
it does not-until and unless reversed-detract from its
decisiveness and finality.'
Second. Respondent's next contention is that even
though Huron was compelled to pay the New York judgment as a result of attachment proceedings fully authorized by the New York statutes, the Idaho federal court
not only can but should require a second payment of the
same amount. The Circuit Court of Appeals so held.
But since Huron, owing a judgment debt to Lincoln,
paid it to a creditor of Lincoln under a valid New York
judgment, it certainly should not be required to pay it a
second time, except for the most compelling reasons.
"It ought to be and it is the object of courts to prevent
the payment of any debt twice over." I
It has not been urged here, nor was it urged in the
courts below, that Huron was guilty of any negligence,
misconduct or fraud in connection with the New York
judgment. It has not been claimed that there was a
failure to give Lincoln notice of the New York suit
against it. No federal statute or constitutional provision
is invoked as supporting the contention that the Idaho
federal court was under a duty to disregard the effect
of the payment made by Huron under the compulsion

312; 219 N. Y. S. 628, affirmed, 245 N. Y. 567; 157 N. E. 859. In
determining what is the law of a state, we look to the decisions of
lower state courts as well as to those of the state's highest court,
and follow the same line of inquiry recently pointed out in West v.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 311 U. S. 223. And see Erie
Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64.

of the valid New York judgment. What is contended
is that historically federal courts have carved out a rule
to protect themselves from interference by state courts,
and that a plaintiff in a federal court proceeding has
an absolute right to prosecute his suit and collect his
judgment in that court-a right which would somehow be
arrested or taken away by giving effect to the New
York attachment. This contention rests primarily upon
a statement of this Court in Wallace v. M'Connell, 13
Pet. 136, 151. That case, a suit on a promissory note,
was begun in the federal District Court for Alabama.
While it was pending, a suit for collection of the note,
based on its attachment, was instituted in an Alabama
state court. In the state court action, though tentative
judgment was rendered against the federal court defendant as garnishee, the matter was then stayed for six
months because no judgment had yet been rendered
against the state court defendant. At this point, therefore, actions involving the same issues were concurrently
pending in both the state and tfe federal court without
final determination in either. Before final determination
of the state proceedings, the case came on for decision
in the federal court. That court overruled defendant's
plea based on the'state court attachment. On appeal,
this Court said: "The plea shows that the proceedings
on the attachment were instituted after the commencement of this suit. The jurisdiction of the District Court
of the United States, and the right of the plaintiff, to
prosecute his suit in that Court, having attached, that
right could not be arrested or taken away by any proceeding in another Court. This would produce a collision in the jurisdiction of Courts, that would extremely
embarrass the administration of justice . . . [The doctrine here announced] is essential to the protection of
the rights of the garnishee." The concrete question presented to the Court there appears to have been nothing

HURON CORP. v. LINCOLN CO.

Opinion of the Court.

more than a situation in which two courts were called
upon to litigate the same issues at the same time."
Such is not true in this case.
Another case relied on by respondent is Wabash Railroad Co. v. Tourville, 179 U. S. 322. But that case, in-

volving actions in the courts of two states rather than in
a state and a federal court, as here, does not support respondent's contention. In that case this Court did not
hold that state laws with reference to attachment and
garnishment should not be given effect. On the contrary
it based its decision upon a holding by the Missouri appellate court that the Illinois garnishment was void for

failure to comply with statutory requirements, and- upon
a ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court "that the judgment was foreign to Illinois, and therefore not subject
to garnishment there." " After basing its judgment on
these grounds, the Court added a last statement to the

effect that "This Court has held that to the validity of a
plea of attachment the attachment must have preceded
the commencement of the suit in which the plea is made.

Wallace v. M'Connell, 13 Pet. 136."

Whatever may be

the present day effect of the principle announced in Wallace v. M'Connell and reasserted in the Tourville case,
"'Cf. Princess Lida v. Thompson, 305 U. S. 456, 466; Insurance
Company v. Harris,97 U. S. 331.
"'If by this the Court meant that under Illinois law such a judgment was not subject to garnishment, the case is nothing more than

a holding that one state need not give full faith and credit to a void
act of a sister state. But both the Missouri Supreme Court (148
Mo. 614, 624; 50 S. W. 300) and this Court (179 U. S. 322, 327)
cited Drake on Attachments (7th ed. 1891) ยง 625 for the proposition
that by the weight of authority a judgment of one court was not
subject to attachment in another court. This citation of the "weight
of authority" might indicate that this Court was deciding the issue
as a question of "general law," under Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1.
If so, this aspect of the decision is no longer of any weight. Erie

that principle has no application here. But it is said
that a broader principle, stemming from those cases, is
here applicable. And it is true that some courts, both
state and federal, have adopted the broader rule for which
respondent contends.'
The leading federal case on the
subject is Thomas v. Wooldridge, 23 Fed. Cas. 986, No.
13,918. The rule in that case, as announced by Justice
Bradley on circuit, was that "judgments of state and federal courts should not be subject to attachments issued
by each other." The reasons there given to support this
rule-were: the debt was quasi in custodia legis; attachments of it would therefore interfere with the court's
dignity and prerogatives, excite jealousies and bring
about conflicts of jurisdiction; many rights axe still left
for adjustment after judgment and therefore attachment
of a court's judgment would be an inconvenient, dangerous and potentially fraud-ridden interference with judicial proceedings. Justice Bradley was also of opinion
that recognition of this rule was practically compelled
by Wallace v. M'Connell.
It is our opinion that no such broad general rule
exists. This does not, however, mean that a court which
has rendered a judgment is without power to exercise
jurisdiction, when properly invoked, to adjudicate newly
asserted rights related to the judgment debt. It does
mean that later opinions of this Court have undermined
the basic reasoning upon which Justice Bradley relied
in declaring that judgments in a federal court were never

subject to attachment elsewhere. For it is now settled
that attachment is wholly the creature of, and controlled
by, the law of the state; property and persons within
the state can be subjected to the operation of that local
law; power over the person who owes a debt confers
jurisdiction on the courts of the state where the writ
of attachment issues; and by reason of the constitutional
requirement that full faith and credit be given the valid
actions of a state, courts of one state must recognize valid
attachment judgments of other states."3 And under congressional enactment federal courts must also give full
faith and credit." These later decisions are but a recognition of the greatly developed statutory use of attachment by the states, a development brought about by the
increased mobility of persons and property and the expanded area of business relationships. Whatever may
have been the necessity for the rule in other times, it
does not fit its present day environment.
Further, we do not here, as in Wallace v. M'Connell,
have a case in which two courts are proceeding in the
same matter at the same time. The New York court
has proceeded under New York law to final judgment.
It has compelled obedience to its judgment. The New
York proceedings did not arrest or take away the right
of Lincoln to try out its issues with Huron in the federal
court for Idaho. Those issues had already been tried
and determined in that court, and its jurisdiction to adjust and adjudicate newly asserted rights relating to the
judgment had not been invoked. There was therefore
no possibility of collision between the two courts, for
similar issues were not pending before them at the same

time. In fact, far from colliding with the Idaho court,
the New York court accepted as final that court's determination of the issues that it had passed on. For the
suit in New York was based on the Idaho judgment, and
not on the original cause of action, and "A cause of action
on a judgment is different from that upon which the
judgment was entered." "
Both the Idaho federal court and the New York state
court decided matters within the respective authority of
each. To give effect to the judgment rendered in the
New York attachment proceedings cannot, in any manner, interfere with the jurisdiction of the Idaho court.
While the Idaho court did have authority to issue an execution for the collection of an unpaid judgment, it would
not have enforced an execution for the benefit of Lincoln
if the judgment had previously been paid directly to Lincoln. Nor should it issue an execution when the money
was paid to Lincoln's creditors by reason of valid attachment proceedings. For this would be to exercise the jurisdiction of a federal court to render ineffective that protection which a garnishee should be afforded by reason
of having obeyed a judgment rendered by a state in the
exercise of its constitutional power over persons and property within its territory. 6 To take such a step would
constitute a denial of that full faith and credit which a
federal court should give to the acts of a state court.'
The District Court properly ordered that its judgment
be marked satisfied, and correctly refused to render judg-ment on the supersedeas bond. The judgment of the.
Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the judgments
of the District Court are affirmed.
