POWERS v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 486.. Argued January 7, 1941.-Decided February 3, 1941.
Detdrmination of the criterion of "value" for the purposes of the
gift tax under the Revenue Act of 1932 is a question of law,
and a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals that in the case of
single-premium policies of life insurance, irrevocably" assigned as
gifts shortly after issuance, the value of the gifts was the cash
surrender value of the policies, was properly reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals as "not in accordance with law." Guggenheim v. Rasquin, ante p. 254. P. 260.
115 F. 2d 209, affirmed.
CERTIORARI,*311

U. S. 640, to review the reversal of a

decision of the Board of Tax Appeals setting aside a
determination of a deficiency in a gift tax.
Mr. Ralph G. Boyd for petitioner.
Mr. J. Louis Monarch,. with whom Solicitor General
Biddle, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Messrs.
Sewall Key, Arnold Raum, and Joseph M. Jones were
on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.'
The issue in this case is the same as that in Guggenheim v. Rasquin, ante, p. 254. Petitioner in November
and December, 1935, purchased single-premium policies
of insurance on her own life and late in December, 1935,
irrevocably assigned them as gifts. The Commissioner
determined a deficiency, claiming that the value of the
policies for gift-tax purposes was the cost of duplicating
them at the dates of the gifts, not the cash-surrender

value as reported by petitioner. The Board of Tax Appeals held that the value of the gifts was their cashsurrender value. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.
115 F. 2d 209. That judgment must be affirmed on the
authority of Guggenheim v. Rasquin, supra, unless as
claimed by petitioner the court below was precluded from
substituting its judgment of value for that of the Board.
Helvering v. Rankin, 295 U. S.123, 131. But the question of what criterion should be employed for determining the "value" of the gifts is a question of law.' See
Lucas v. Alexander, 279 U. S. 573. Accordingly, the Circuit Court of Appeals was justified in reversing the decision of the Board as "not in accordance with law." Int.
Rev. Code 1939, ยง 1141 (c) (1); 53 Stat. 164.
Affirmed.
UNITED STATES v. RYERSON ET AL., EXECUTORS.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 494.

Argued January 7, 1941.-Decided February 3, 1941.

The lapse of time between the issuance of single-premium policies
of life insurance and their assignment as gifts, held not to justify
the substitution of cash surrender value, instead of replacement
cost at the date of the gift, as the criterion of value for the
purposes of the gift tax under the Revenue Act of 1932.
P. 261.
114 F. 2d 150, reversed.

Sewall Key and Edward First were on the brief, for the
