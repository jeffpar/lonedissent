after this Court's decision in the Tipton case established
that the compensation remedy could be made exclusive,
but still the Legislature took no action. Under these
circumstances we are of the opinion that the interpretation of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania of its own
Workmen's Compensation Act and of the jurisdiction
of its courts over claims arising under the Safety Appliance Act is binding upon the federal courts and should
be followed.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS is of the opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

delivered the olinion of the

Court.
Petitioner, a citizen of New Hampshire, was injured
when the respondent's car, in which she was a passenger,
collided with another on a country road in Vermont.
Diversity of citizenship gave jurisdiction to the District
Court and petitioner recovered a verdict under the Vermont guest occupant law,' which required her to prove
gross negligence on the part of the respondent. The
Circuit Court of Appeals, however, considering the evidence of gross negligence insufficient to go to the jury,
reversed and dismissed the complaint.2 We granted certiorari to examine whether there had been sufficient compliance with Rule 50 (b) to authorize dismissal of the
complaint,' but our view of the merits makes it unnecessary to discuss this question.
The result is determined by a consideration of the
facts in the light of the Vermont law. The accident
occurred in broad daylight in the late morning of an
August day. If the facts most favorable to the petitioner were accepted, the jury might have concluded
properly that the defendant's car approached from the
south a covered bridge on a little-used country road at
a speed of fifteen miles per hour. Respondent who was
the driver and owner sat on the front seat with another.
The petitioner and another lady occupied the rear seat.
The bridge spanned Williams River which at that point

for judgment n. o. v.

ran eastwardly to join the Connecticut. As another car
emerged from its southern end the collision happened.
The road- along which respondent was driving ran
parallel with the southernly bank of the river for a short
distance and then turned "abruptly," in a "sharper
curve than any on the road," at a s'ixty degree angle
down a nine per cent grade towards the bridge. Bushes
and small trees cut off the view of a car "coming out of
the bridge" until the respondent's car was "probably 30
feet" away.
As respondent's light car came into this curve, he cut
in to the left without slackening speed or blowing a horn
and suddenly found himself face to face with a larger
car coming out of the bridge on its right hand side of
the road at two miles per hour. The collision knocked
the heavier car backward several feet 'and through a
guard rail on the west side of the bridge approach. The
road approaching the bridge "at this blind corner" was
sandy, from fourteen to seventeen feet wide. Respondent testified he had known the spot "all- my life" and
knew cars could pass only "at a snail's pace."
The "Law of the Road" in Vermont is to round curves
"as far to the right . . . as reasonably practicable '"
and to "signal with bell or horn" "in going around a
C.Urve."
Under these circumstances we are of the opinion that
the Vermont law requires the submission of the question
of gross negligence to the jury. As a matter of law it
seems quite plain that a jury might find a driver of a
car familiar .ith the locality grossly negligent, when
with three guests and without a signal he rounds a
blind, sharp curve at fifteen miles per hour on the wrong
side into a narrow bridge entrance. The accepted Ver'Vermont Public Laws (1933) ยง 5110-IX.

CONWAY v. O'BRIEN.

Opinion of the Court.

mont definition of gross negligence is found in Shaw v.
Moore: '
"Gross negligence is substantially and appreciably
higher in magnitude and more culpable than ordinary
negligence. Gross negligence is equivalent to the failure to exercise even a slight degree of care. It is materially more want of care than constitutes simple inadvertence. It is an act or omission respecting legal duty
of an aggravated character as distinguished from a mere
failure to exercise ordinary care. It is very great negligence, or the absence of slight diligence, or the want of
even scant care. It amounts to indifference to present
legal -duty, and to utter forgetfulness of legal obligations so far as other persons may be affected. It is a
heedless and palpable violation of legal duty respecting
the rights of others. The element of culpability which
characterizes all negligence is, in gross negligence, magnified to a high degree as compared with that present in
ordinary negligence. Gross negligence is manifestly a
smaller amount of watchfulness and circumspection
than the circumstances require of a prudent man. But
it falls short of being such reckless disregard of probable
consequences as is equivalent to a wilful and intentional
wrong. Ordinary and gross negligence differ in degree of
inattention, while both differ in kind from wilful and
intentional conduct which is or ought to be known to
have a tendency to injure."
This has been repeated many times in later cases.7 The
application creates the difficulties. The latest cases say
"each case must be judged according to its own facts." 8

Admittedly there are instances among the Vermont cases
which might be logically cited to support a refusal to
submit this case.' About as many are upon the other
side. 10 We think the District Court correctly appraised
the law and facts.
We reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals and affirm that of the District Court.

RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS ET AL. V.
PULLMAN COMPANY ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.

No. 283. Argued February 4, 1941.-Decided March 3, 1941.
A railroad company, some of whose trains in Texas had each but
one Pullman sleeping Par and that in charge of a colored porter.
subject to the control of the train conductor, assailed in the federal court, as unauthorized by Texas statutes and as violative of
the Federal Constitution, a regulation by a state commission which
would require that such cars be continuously in charge of an
employee "having the rank and position of a Pullman conductor."
Pullman porters, intervening, also attacked the order, adopting
the railroad's objections but urging mainly that it discriminated
against Negroes in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Pullman porters being Negroes and the conductors white. Held:
