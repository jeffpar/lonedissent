UNITED STATES v. GILLILAND ET

AL.*

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.

No. 245. Argued January 10, 1941.-Decided February 3, 1941.
1. On an appeal under the Criminal' Appeals Act the Court is concerned with the construction of the criminal statute involved and
not with interpretation of the indictment as a pleading. P. 89.
2. That part of § 35 of the Criminal Code, as amended by the Act
of June 18, 1934, which makes it a crime knowingly and willfully
to cause to be made or used any false affidavit, etc., knowing
the same to contain any fraudulent statement, "in any matter
within the jurisdiction of any departinent or agency of the United
States," is not restricted to cases involving pecuniary or property
loss to the United States. P. 91.
3. The language and history of the amending Act show that it was
intended to protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversion which might result
from the deceptive practices described. P. 93.
4. Section 35 of the Criminal Code, as amerled by the Act of
June 18, 1934, embraces verified reports falsely and fraudulently
stating the amount of petroleum produced from specified wells
or received from other producers, which reports were filed with a
Federal Tender Board in purported compliance with executive
regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior, with
the approval of the President, under the "Hot Oil" Act oi February 22, 1935. P. 95.

Argument for Appellees.

By the Act last mentioned the transportation in interstate commerce from any State of "contraband" oil produced therein-i. e.,
oil produced, transported or withdrawn from storage in excess of
the amounts permitted under the laws and regulations of the
State-was prohibited, and the President was authorized to prescribe enforcement regulations.
5. Section 35 of the Criminal Code as so applied is not invalid for
indefiniteness. P. 91.
6. The rule of ejusdem generis gives no warrant for narrowing alternative provisions which the legislature has adopted with the
purpose of affording added safeguards. P. 93.
7. The fact that the maximum penalty prescribed by § 35 of the
Criminal Code was greater than that fixed by the Act of February
22, 1935, for violations of its provisions, is of no significance in
the construction and application of the former. P. 95.
8. The Act of February 22, 1935, supra, did not operate to supplant
§ 35 of the Criminal Code in its application to affidavits, documents,
etc., relative to the subject of excluding "hot oil" from interstate
commerce. P. 95.

States v. Keitel, 211 U. S. 370; United States v. Salen,
235 U. S. 236.
The second clause should not be lifted out of the
statute and be made to stand alone. This would create
a multitude of new offenses that are entirely dissociated
and distinct from the offenses enumerated in the Act.
So treated, it would not be valid as a penal statute.

v. Brewer, 139 U. S. 278; United States v. Resnick, 299
U. S. 207; Connally v. General Construction Co., 269
U. S.385.
Assuming that by the 1934 amendment Congress intended to prohibit the presentation and use of false papers in connection with the shipment of "hot" oil, that
part of the Act was repealed by implication when Congress later enacted what is known as the Connally Act,
§ 715, Tit. 15, U. S. C., which is a self-sustained and organic whole, covering ,indetail the entire subject of the
shipment of "hot" or excessively produced oil in interstate commerce. See Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan,
293 U. S. 388; United States v. Powers, 307 U. S. 214;
United States v. Yuginovich, 256 U. S.450.
The Connally Act is clearly inconsistent with the Act
under which the indictment is brought. United States
v. Windham, 264 F. 376; State v. Tate, 171 So. 108.
Many other decisions from other jurisdictions are to the
same effect.
Otherwise, we have the same offense created and punished by two distinct enactments; and at the election of
the prosecuting officer the offender may receive as punishment not more than six months, in jail and two thousand dollars fine, or ten years in the penitentiary and ten
thousand dollars fine. As to which, see United States v.
Stever, 222 U. S.157..

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The District Court sustained a demurrer to ten counts
of an indictment and the Government appeals. 18 U. S.
C. 682.
There were eleven counts in the indictment, the first
of which, a conspiracy count, the District Court found
good. The other counts now before us were based on
§ 35 of the Criminal Code. 18 U. S. C. 80.' Eight of
these counts charged in substance that defendants had
willfully caused to be made and used verified reports
falsely and fraudulently stating the amount of petroleum
produced from certain oil wells, and the other two counts
made a similar charge with respect to verified reports as
to the amount of petroleum received from certain producers.
The District Court held that these substantive counts
did not state an offense under § 35 of the Criminal Code
as amended by the Act of June 18, 1934. 48 Stat. 996.
The court plainly rested its decision upon its construction
of the statute and hence direct appeal to this Court is
properly brought. We are concerned only with the correctness of this construction and not with the mere interpretation of the indictment as a pleading. United States
v. Patten, 226 U. S. 525, 535; United States v. Birdsall,
233 U. S.223, 230; United States v. Kapp, 302 U. S.214,
217; United States v. Borden Co., 308 U. S.188, 195.
Section 35, as amended, makes it a crime knowingly
and willfully to "make or cause to be made any false
or fraudulent statements or representations," or to "make
or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt,
'See Act of April 4, 1938, c. 69, 52 Stat. 197.

voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent
or fictitious statement or entry, in any matter within
the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the
United States." The reports containing the alleged false
and fraudulent statements in this instance were charged
to have related "to a matter within the jurisdiction of
the Department of the Interior, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Federal Tender Board No. 1, Kilgore,
Texas."
By the Act of February 22, 1935, 49 Stat. 30, 31,2
the so-called "Hot Oil" Act, the transportation in interstate commerce from any State of "contraband oil" produced therein was prohibited, such oil being that "produced, transported, or withdrawn from storage" in excess
of the amounts permitted under the laws of the State
or regulations duly made by its agencies. The President
was authorized to prescribe regulations for the enforcement of the Act, including the requirement of "reports,
maps, affidavits, and other documents relating to the
production, storage, refining, processing, transporting, or
handling of petroleum and petroleum products." Under
this authority the President designated the Secretary of
the Interior as his agent, and the latter promulgated
regulations which the President approved. There was
thus set up Federal Tender Board No. 1, to be located
at Kilgore, Texas, for the East Texas Field and monthly
reports on forms approved by the Secretary were
required to be filed with the Board.'
If the provision of § 35, under which the indictment
is laid, be construed according to its literal and natural
import, it is manifest that the statute covers the offenses
'15 U. S. C. 715--715d.
'Executive Orders No. 6979, issued February 28, 1935; No.
6980-B, Regulation XIV, approved March 1; 1935; No. 6980-C,
approved March 1, 1935.

charged in the substantive counts. The affidavits and
reports, as described in the indictment, containing statements alleged to be false and fraudulent, were made and
used in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department
and agency of the United States. Nor can the statute
be deemed to be invalid because of indefiniteness. The
affidavits and reports required had been sufficiently described and the duty enjoined had been adequately defined. Any one presenting the required affidavits and
reports to the Board set up under the pertinent regulations was suitably charged with notice of the consequence of knowingly and willfully including therein any
false and fraudulent statements.
Defendant's contention, which the District Court sustained, is that the broad language of the statutory provision here involved should be restricted by construction
so as to apply onlyto matters of a nature similar to those
with which other provisions of § 35 deal, "such as claims
against, rights to, or controversies about funds involved
in 'operations of the Government,' " that is, to matters in
which the Government has some financial or proprietary
interest. This contention is sought to be supported by
the doctrine of ejusdem generis and the construction
given to § 35 prior to the amendment of 1934, and by
reference to the incongruity of the penalty prescribed
for violation of § 35 as contrasted with the penalty prescribed by the Act of February 22, 1935, to the enforcement of which the requirements in question were directed. Defendant also presents the contention, upon
which the District Court did not pass, that the Act of
February 22, 1935, was intended to cover the entire subject of the exclusion of "hot oil" from interstate commerce and consequently operated as a repeal of all other
provisions dealing with that matter.
Before the amindment of 1934, § 35, after referring to
the presentation of claims against the government which
were known to be false or fraudulent, provided:

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

312 U. S.

"or whoever, for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to
obtain the payment or approval of such claim, or for the
purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling
or defrauding the Government of the United States, or
any department thereof, or any corporation in which
the United States of America is a stockholder, shall
knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by
any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make
or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements
or representations, or make or use or cause to be made
or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll, account,
claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the
same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement or
entry; . . . shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both." 4
Distinguishing that provision from § 37, the conspiracy
section of the Criminal Code which by its terms extended
broadly to every conspiracy "to defraud the United States
in any manner or for any purpose," ' this Court held
that § 35 which used the word "defrauding" in connection
with "cheating and swindling" should be construed "as
relating to the fraudulent causing of pecuniary or property loss" to the Government. And that meaning was
deemed to be emphasized by the context found in other
provisions of § 35. United States v. Cohn, 270 U. S.
339, 346, 347.
The Act of June 18, 1934,6 amended § 35 so that in
place of the portion quoted above there were substituted
these words:
"or whoever shall knowingly and willfully falsify or
conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a
material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or
' 40 Stat. 1015.

Opinion of the Court.

fraudulent statements or representations, or make or
use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt,
voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or
fictitious statement or entry, in any matter within the
jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United
States or of any corporation in which the United States
of America is a stockholder; . . . shall be fined" etc.

The amendment eliminated the words "cheating and
swindling" and broadened the provision so as to leave
no adequate basis for the limited construction which had
previously obtained. The statute was made to embrace
false and fraudulent statements or representations where
these were knowingly and willfully used in documents
or affidavits "in any matter within the jurisdiction of
any department or agency of the United States." In
this, there was no restriction to cases involving pecuniary
or property loss to the government. The amendment
indicated the congressional intent to protect the authorized\functions of governmental departments and agencies
from the perversion which might result from the deceptive practices described. We see no reason why this
apparent intention should be frustrated by construction.
The rule of ejusdem generis is a familiar and useful
one in interpreting words by the association in which
they are found, but it gives no warrant for narrowing
alternative provisions which the legislature has adopted
with the purpose of affording added safeguards. "The
rule of 'ejusdem generis' is applied as an aid in ascertaining the intention of the legislature, not to subvert
it when ascertained." Texas v. United States, 292 U. S.
522, 534.
If the language of the amended section could be
deemed ambiguous, the legislative history of the amendment would dispel any doubt as to the congressional
purpose. Legislation had been sought by the Secretary

of the Interior to aid the enforcement of laws relating
to the functions of the Department of the Interior and,
in particular, to the enforcement of regulations under
§ 9 (c) of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933'
with respect to the transportation of "hot oil." The
Secretary's effort was due, as he stated, to the lack of a
law under which prosecutions might be had "for the presentation of false papers." ' The bill which was passed
by Congress, however, was amended in its final stages
so as to require "intent to defraud the United States." '
This bill was returned by the President without his approval for the reason that the offense as defined was covered by existing law which provided for more severe punishment than that proposed by the bill.'" Another measure was then proposed by the Secretary of the Interior
which would obviate these objections and accomplish
the purpose of reaching the presentation of false papers
in relation to "hot oil." A bill was then passed and approved which included, with other amendments of § 35
the provision now before us, omitting the limiting words
which had been deemed to make the former provision applicable only to cases where pecuniary or property loss to
the government had been caused.11 The report of the
Judiciary Committee of the Senate stated that the
amendment in question had been proposed by the Department of the Interior with the purpose "of reaching
a large number of cases involving the shipment of 'hot'

oil, where false papers are presented in connection therewith." 12
The fact that the Secretary of the Interior was then
seeking aid in the enforcement of § 9 (c) of the National
Industrial Recovery Act, which this Court later found
to be invalid (Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S.
388), in no way affects the present application of the
statute. Its provisions were not limited to the enforcement of § 9 (c) of the National Industrial Recovery
Act but were enacted with appropriate breadth so that
they at once applied to the presentation of affidavits,
reports, etc., required by the subsequent Act of February 22, 1935, ar:d the regulations duly prescribed thereunder. In the light of the text of the Act of 1934,
amending § 35, and its legislative history, it is also clear
that the fact that the penalty prescribed by § 35 was
greater than that fixed by the Act of February 22, 1935,
has no significance in connection with the construction
and application of the former. The matter of penalties
lay within the discretion of Congress. Section 35 covered a variety of offenses and the penalties prescribed
were maximum penalties which gave a range for judicial
sentences according to the circumstances and gravity of
particular violations.
Similarly lacking in merit is the contention that the
Act of February 22, 1935, operated to repeal § 35 as
amended in 1934, so far as the latter applied to affidavits,
documents, etc., presented in relation to "hot oil." There
was no express repeal and there was no repugnancy in
the subject matter of the two statutes which would justify an implication of repeal. The Act of 1934, with its
provision as to false and fraudulent papers, has its place
as a fitting complement to the Act of 1935 as well as to
other statutes under which, in connection with the au'2 S. Rep. No. 1202, 73d Cong., 2d sess.
