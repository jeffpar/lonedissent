The appeal brings here the correctness of the ruling by
the Court of Claims which allows interest on a claim
- against the appellant, the United States. The cross appeal raises an issue that the compensation awarded is inadequate because the court failed to consider certain

Opinion of the Court.

This controversy had its inception on March 25, 1923.

At that time Edward F. Goltra was the lessee of four
tug boats and 19 steel barges belonging to the United
States. While tied up -for the winter on the Mississippi
at the Port of St. Louis, they were repossessed, because of
an alleged breach of the lease, by Colonel Ashburn, Chief'
of the Inland and Coastwise Waterways Service, under
orders from the Acting Secretary of War. Apparently
some unloading facilities were also seized. In severalcourt proceedings to recover possession Mr. Goltra was
defeated.' It-would be futile to examine as to whether
these adjudications determined all, or any controversies
between the parties, since the jurisdictional act opened
the doors of the Court, "notwithstanding the lapse of
time or the bar of any statute of limitations or -previous
court decisions." Suing under this special legislation
Mr. Goltra' sought damages for the wrongful taking of
the fleet and facilities and recovered $350,000 with six
per cent interest from March 25, 1923, to the date of
payment. The Government assigns error only to the
allowance of interest and the executors only to the refusal
to consider certain proffered evidence.
. By a contract of 1919, with a supplement of 1921, Mr.
Goltra. leased the fleet of river boats for governmentally
Provided, That separate suits may be brought with respect to the
vessels and the unloading apparatus, but no suit shall be brought

Provided further, That either party may appeal as of right to the

case at any time within ninety days after the rendition thereof, and
any ,judgment rendered in favor of the claimant shall be paid in the
same manner as other judgments of said Court of Claims are paid."

supervised operation as conmon carriers on the Mississippi
and its tributaries from the Chief of Engineers as lessor.
The lessor was acting for the War Department, the executive agency in charge of the boats. The term of the
lease was five years from the delivery of the first unit
of the fleet, which occurred on July 15, 1922. All net
earnings were sequestered during the term for- application upon the purchase of the fleet at cost or appraised
valie as detailed in the lease, with provision for subsequent installment payments over sixteen years. Section 8 provided for termination by the lessor upon "the
lessee's.noncompliailce "in his judgment with any of the
terms and conditions" and for the 'return to the lessor
of the plant, barges, and -towboats.
On March 4, 1921, the Secretary of War consented, in
accordance with the lease, that Mr. Goltra's tariffs should
be 80 per cent of the prevailing rail tariffs. This consent was withdrawn in May, 1922, before the delivery .of
the boats, and a consent limited to specific articles substituted. A control over the amount of grain to be
carried was delegated to ,the Federal Manager of the
Mississippi-Warrior River Service, a governmental corporation which operated a competing line. The enterprise got under way in the summer of 1922 and was immediately entangled in the ordinary viscissitudes of river
transportation. The towboats had mechanical deficiencies; the open barges were not suitable for grain or. other
perishables; low water seriously interfered with navigation. After a few months towing by one tug, the fleet
went into wiiter quarters late in the fall. Before business was resumed, Mr. Goltra 'was notified on March 4,
1923, by the Secretary of War that the lease was terminated and- he'was directed to turn over the towboats,
barges and unloading facilities to Colonel Ashburn,
Obedience -to this order was refused and on March 25,
1923, Colonel Ashburn, under orders from the Acting.

UNITED STATES v. GOLTRA.
203

Opinion of the Court.

Secretary of War, took possession of the fleet without
the consent of Mr. Goltra or his employees, for the use
and benefit of the United States.
The seizure was without the knowledge of the Chief
of Engineers, who was the lessor empowered by its terms
to terminate the lease, and that officer had not reached
any conclusion to the effect that Mr. Goltra had in any
manner failed in his obligations under the contract. Subsequently, in April,. the Chief of Engineers terminated
the lease pursuant to § 8. The action did not represent
his judgment but was done under direction of his superior, the Secretary of War.
The Court of Claims fixed the damages as of the time
of seizure, with interest to the date of payment "not as
interest but as a part of just compensation."
Interest. By statute, 5 derived from the Act of March
3, 1863, no interest is allowed on any claim up to the
time of the rendition of judgment by the Court of Claims.
This accords with the traditional immunity of the Government from the burden of interest unless it is specifically agreed upon by contract or imposed by legislation.'
Without controverting this general rule, the executors find
authority for the allowance of interest in the provision
of the jurisdictional act for "just compensation . . . for
certain vessels and unloading apparatus, taken, whether
tortiously or not . . . , for the use and benefit of the
United States." Their argument is that the words "just
compensation" have within themselves the same legal
significance of interest on the award or damages from the
date of the taking as has been given to these same words

.in the Fifth Amendment. They further urge that this
interpretation is required by the phrase in the act "for
the use and benefit of the -United States" and' the accept6i finding that Colonel Ashburn's taking was for that
purpose,. In support of this position, the ruling of this
Court. in Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States 7
and subsequent similar authorityI is relied upon.
In the Seaboard case, § 10 of the Lever Act authorizing the taking by eminent domain of property for the
public use on payment of just compensation was under
,examination., It contains no specific provision for 'interest. This Court held that a taking under the authority of § 10 required the just compensation "provided for
by the' Constitution" and that such compensation is
payable "as of the time when the owners were deprived
of their property." . This case, however, and the others
cited in the preceding paragraph, involve the requisitioning or taking of property by eminent domain under
,authority of legislation. The distinction between prop-erty taken under authorization of Congress and property
appropriated without such authority has long been recognized. ° Acts of government officials in taking property
without authorization of Congress confer no right of
recovery upon the injured citizen.1' There are two instances of Congressional ratification of takings which

Opinion of the Court.

eminent domain and placed upon the Government the
duty to make "just compensation," including sums in the
nature of interest. These are United States v. Creek
Nation 12 and Shoshone Tribe v. United States." In both
cases there was a special jurisdictional act. In neither
case was interest expressly allowed. In both this Court
found Congressional confirmation of the previously unauthorized acts; in the Creek case, by disposition of the
wrongfully acquired lands and failure to seek cancellation of the disposals after "full knowledge of the facts" '"
and in the Shoshone case by "the statutes already summarized, recognizing the Arapahoes equally with the Shoshones as occupants of the. land, accepting their deeds
of cession, assigning to the tribes equally the privilege
of new allotments and devoting to the two equally the

award of future benefits."

15

In the case now before us, however, there is neither the
requisite Congressional authority before the taking nor
any ratification or confirmation of the tort after the taking, which would justify a conclusion that the fleet was
acquired by eminent domain. The jurisdictional act in
itself is not an exercise of the power of eminent domain."6
As the lease required action by the Chief of Engineers,
the attempt to cancel it by the letter of the Secretary of
War of March 3, 1923, and the order of the Acting Secretary of March 22, 1923, to take possession was unauthorized. The lower court found the taking tortious."

Opinion of the Court.

312 U. S.

Nor can it be said that the continued possession and use
by the United States indicated any confirmation or ratification of the tortious act, so as to' bring this case within

the rule of the Creek or Shoshone cases. A reading of
the reports of the prior litigation 8 makes abundantly
clear that the United States relied upon the termination
of the lease by the Chief of Engineers which was practically contemporaneous with, though subsequent to, the
taking, as their justification for possession of the fleet and
property. This reliance found complete support in the
various cited decisions of the courts, even though Mr.
-Goltra's petition for rehearing in this Court pointed out
that the ,letter of the Chief of Engineers was written to
justify the seizure. 9 Notwithstanding these definite judicial decisions upon the rights of the parties, Congress
felt that Mr. Goltra may not have had fair treatment.
It passed the present, jurisdictional act and to that the
executors are relegated to find authority to allow interest.
0 In the preSuch acts are to be strictly construed.?.
s See note 3 supra.

'Brief filed July 16, 1926, pp. 33-34: "The opinion violates the
elementary common-law rule that a trespass cannot be justified by
an act subsequent. It appears from the record that counsel for
defendant caused this letter to be written for the sole purpose of
justification of a prior trespass. It was not the act, therefore, of
Major-General Beach for the purpose of canceling the contract, but
the act of counsel for defendant to excuse the illegal act. We quote
from the record: 'Mr. Hocker: I caused this letter to be executed
and delivered to Mr. Goltra for the purpose of meeting that objection. The Court: You caused a letter to be written a month after
the seizure to justify the seizure and an attempted cancellation
which had already been had? Mr. Hocker: Yes, I did.' Certainly
bad faith is shown here."

Opinion of the Court.

ceding paragraphs we have demonstrated that this unauthorized taking and judicially approved retention was
in no sense an exercise of the power of eminent domain.
We see no ground to read into this act of grace, which
was apparently drawn to rectify what Congress felt might
be a wrong, an authority to allow interest as a part of
just compensation. If interest was to be allowed for
so long a period upon an ordinary claim, and contrary to
established governmental practice, Congress would have
so declared.2
Evidence. The main issue raised by the appeal of
Mr. Goltra's executors relates to the evidence. In its
opinion the Court of Claims said:
"It is contended by the plaintiff that, in arriving at
just compensation, an offer to rent the fleet made years
after the fleet had been seized and the rental value of
similar vessels on the Mississippi River should be taken
into consideration. These contentions cannot be sustained." 91 Ct. Cls. 42, 73.
Assuming that these items of evidence were competent,
we cannot say that the Court of Claims, making a .jury
award, was bound to give them weight. The actual damages suffered by Mr. Goltra were highly speculative,
especially since the contract was subject to lawful cancellation whenever the Chief of Engineers rightly or
wrongly but in good faith determined that Mr. Goltra
was violating its provisions. Mr. Goltra's operation under the lease had been a losing venture. Under these
circumstances, the Court of Claims may have believed
that an offer to purchase, made in May, 1925, was too
remote to influence its judgment and that the rental
value of other vessels on the Mississippi, not subject to
the same restrictions as those taken by the GovernCf. Tilison v. United States, 100 U. S. 43, 46; Boston Sand Co.

ment, was too unreliable to afford a useful comparison.
It was for the Court of Claims to decide what weight
such facts deserved, and we construe its opinion only
as holding that under the circumstances of this case the
evidence Was not considered to be- of any assistance in
reaching a conclusion.
Mr. Goltra's executors also complain of the failure of
the Court of Claims to make certain findings, but there
is no indication that the Court of Claims did not consider
the facts which were embodied in the proposed findings.
