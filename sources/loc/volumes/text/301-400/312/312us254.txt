Oil & Refining Co., 311 U. S. 578.
Had a timely appeal been taken to the circuit court of
appeals the decree below could have been reviewed there,
though rendered by three judges. Healy v. Ratta, 289
U. S. 701; 67 F. 2d 554; 292 U. S. 263. While this
Court cannot hear the merits, it will, where the question
of jurisdiction was not obviously settled by prior decisions, enforce the limitations of § 266 by an order framed
to save appellants their proper remedies. Oklahoma
Gas Co. v. Packing Co.,. 292 U. S. 386, 392. We therefore vacate the decree and remand the cause to the
court which heard the case so that it may enter a fresh
decree from which appellants may, if they wish, perfect
a timely appeal to the circuit court of appeals.
Decree vacated.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 92.

Argued January 6, 7, 1941.-Decided February 3, 1941.

1. Under § 506 of the Revenue Act of 1932, which provides that
for the purposes of the gift tax the amount of a gift is "the
value thereof at the date of the gift," the "value" in the case
of single-premium policies of life insurance, irrevocably assigned
simultaneously with issuance, is the cost to the donor and not
the cash surrender value of the policies. P. 256.
2. Article 2 (5) of Treasury Regulations 79, which provided that
the "irrevocable assignment of a life insurance policy . . . constitutes a gift in the amount of the net cash surrender value, if
any, plus the prepaid insurance adjusted to the date of the
gift," applied.,only to policies upon which current premiums
were still being paid at the date of the gift, not to single-premium
policies. P. 258.
110 F. 2d 371, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

CuamoRAI, 311 U. S. 628, to review the reversal of
a judgment for the petitioner, 28 F. Supp. 322, in a suit
for a tax refund.
Mr. John G. Jackson, Jr., with whom Mr. Paul B. Barringer, Jr. was on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. J. Louis Monarch, with whom Solicitor General
Biddle, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Messrs.
Sewall Key, Arnold Raum, and Joseph M. Jones were on
the brief, for respondent.
Messrs. J. Merrill Wright and David R. Shelton filed
a brief on behalf of Martha F. Mason, as amicus curiae,
urging reversal.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
It is provided in the Revenue Act of 1932 (47 Stat.
169, 248) that for gift-tax purposes the amount of a gift
of property shall be "the value thereof at the date of
the gift." § 506. This controversy involves the question
of whether such "value" in case of single-premium life
insurance policies, which are irrevocably assigned simultaneously with issuance, is cost to the donor or cash-surrender value of the policies. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted because of a conflict
among the Circuit Courts of Appeals 1 as respects the
proper method for valuation of such gifts made prior to
1936.2
1 In

conflict with the decision below are Commissioner v. Haines,

104 F. 2d 854 (C. C. A. 3d); Helvering v. Cronin, 106 F. 2d 907
(C. C. A. 8th); United States v. Ryerson, 114 F. 2d 150 (C. C. A.
7th), discussed in Paul, Studios in Federal Taxation (3d series) pp.
403, et seq.
'Art. 19 (9), Treasury Regulations 79, promulgated February 26,
1936, provides that replacement cost at the date. of the gift is the
measure of value of a single-premium life insurance policy.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

312 U. S.

In December, 1934, petitioner purchased, at a cost of
$852,4,38.50, single-premium life insurance policies on her
own life in the aggregate face amount of $1,000,000. At
substantially the same time she assigned-them irrevocably
to three of her children. Her gift-tax return listed the
policies at their asserted cash-surrender value I of $717,344.81. The Commissioner determined that the "value"
of the policies was their cost and assessed a deficiency
which petitioner paid. This is a suit for a refund. Judgment for petitioner in the District Court was reversed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 110 F. 2d 371.
We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that cost
rather than cash-surrender value is the proper criterion
for valuation of such gifts under § 506 of the Act.
Cash-surrender value is the reserve less a surrender
charge. And in case of a single-premium policy the reserve is the face amount of the contract discounted at a
specified rate of interest on the basis of the insured's
expected life. If the policy is surrendered, the company
will pay the cash-surrender value. It is asserted that
the market for insurance contracts is usually the issuing
companies or the banks who will lend money on them;
that banks will not loan more than the cash-surrender
value; and that if policies had an actual realizable value
in excess of their cash-surrender value, there would arise
a business of purchasing such policies from those who
otherwise would surrender them. From these facts it
is urged that cash-surrender value represents the amount
which would be actually obtained for the policies in a
willing buyer-willing seller market--the test suggested
'The government asserts that none of the policies had a cashsurrender value prior to the expiration of one year. In view of our
disposition of the case we do not stop to decide whether, in view of
the pleadings and the stipulation, that position can be maintained
here.

by Treasury Regulations 79, Art. 19 (1), promulgated
October 30, 1933.'
That analysis, however, overlooks the nature of the
property interest which is being valued. Surrender of a
policy represents only one of the rights of the insured
or beneficiary. Plainly that right is one of the substantial legal incidents of ownership. See Chase National
Bank v. United States, 278 U. S. 327, 335; Vance on
Insurance (2d ed.) pp. 54-56. But the owner of a fully
paid life insurance policy has more than the mere right
to surrender it; he has the right to retain it for its investment virtues and to receive the face amount of the policy
upon the insured's death. That these latter rights are
deemed by purchasers of insurance to have substantial
value is clear from the difference between the cost of
a single-premium policy and its immediate or early cashsurrender value-in the instant case over $135,000. All
of the economic benefits of a policy must be taken into
consideration in determining its value for gift-tax purposes. To single out one and to disregard the others
is in effect to substitute a different property interest for
the one which was the subject of the gift. In this situation as in others (Susquehanna Power Co. v. State Tax
Comm'n, 283 U. S. 291, 296) an important element in the
value of the property is the use to which it may be put.
Certainly the petitioner here did not expend $852,438.50
to make an immediate gift limited to $717,344.81. Presumptively the value of these policies at the date of the
'Art. 19 (1) provided: ". . . The value of property is the price
at which such property would change hands between a willing buyer
and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or
to sell. Where the property is sold within a reasonable period after
the date of the gift, and it is shown that the selling price reflects
the fair market value thereof as of the date of the gift, the selling
price will be accepted as the amount of the gift. All relevant facts
and elements of value should be considered in every case."

gift was the amount which the insured had expended to
acquire them. Cost is cogent evidence of value. And
here it is the only suggested riterion which reflects the
value to the owner of the entire bundle of rights in a
single-premium policy-the right to retain it as well as
the right to surrender it. Cost in this situation is not
market price in the normal sense of the term. But the
absence of market price is no barrier to valuation.' Lucas v. Alexander, 279 U. S. 573, 579.
Petitioner, however, argues that cash-surrender value
was made the measure of value by Art. 2 (5), Treasury
Regulations 79, promulgated October 30, 1933, which provided that the "irrevocable assignment of a life insurance
policy . . . constitutes a gift in the amount of the net
cash surrender value, if any, plus the prepaid insurance
adjusted to the date of the gift." The argument is that
under this regulation the reserve in case of a single-premium policy covers the prepaid insurance and represents
the entire value of the policy. The regulation is somewhat ambiguous. But in our, view it applied only to policies upon which current premiums were still being paid
at the date of the gift, not to single-premium policies.
Accordingly, the problem here involves an interpretation
of the meaning of "value" in § 506 unaided by an interpretative regulation.
Affirmed.

In this connection it should be noted that Art. 19 (1), supra, note
4, did not establish market price as the sole criterion of value.
