It was for the Court of Claims to decide what weight
such facts deserved, and we construe its opinion only
as holding that under the circumstances of this case the
evidence Was not considered to be- of any assistance in
reaching a conclusion.
Mr. Goltra's executors also complain of the failure of
the Court of Claims to make certain findings, but there
is no indication that the Court of Claims did not consider
the facts which were embodied in the proposed findings.
The judgment in No. 191 is modified as indicated in
the opinion and, as modified, affirmed; the judgment in
No. 192 is affirmed.

it should, not be assumed that Congressional reenactment of language so construed by rulings of the Board was an adoption of the

and regularity, is supported by no fixed administrative construction.

CERTIORARI, 311 U. S. 626, to review the affirmance of a
ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals, 39 B. T. A. 1005,
which sustained the Commissioner's refusal to allow certain deductions in an income tax return.
Mr. Selden Bacon,,with whom Mr. Orwill V. W. Hawkins was on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr.'Arnold Raum, with whom Solicitor General Biddle,
Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Messrs. Sewall
Key and Lee A. Jackson were on the brief, for respondent.
Messrs. Rollin Browne, John G. Jackson, Jr., and
George Craven filed a brief, as amici curiae, urging reversal.
MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner, the taxpayer, with extensive investments
in real estate, bonds and stocks, devoted a considerable
portion of his time to the oversight of his interests and
hired others to assist him in offices rented for that purpose. For the tax years in question, 1932 and 1933, he
claimed the salaries and expenses incident to looking
after his properties .were deductible under § 23 (a) of

the Revenue Act of 1932.' The Commissioner refused
the deductions. The applicable phrases are: "In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions:
(a) Expenses.-All the ordinary and necessary expenses
paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on
any trade or business . . ." There is no dispute over
whether the claimed deductions are ordinary and necessary expenses. As the Commissioner also conceded
before the Board of Tax Appeals that the real estate
activities of the petitioner in renting buildings 2 constituted a business, the Board allowed such portions of
the claimed deductions as were fairly allocable to the
handling of the real estate. The same offices and staffs
handled both real estate and security matters. After
this adjustment there remained for the year 1932 over
twenty and for the year 1933 over sixteen thousand dollars expended for managing the stocks and bonds.
Petitioner's financial affairs were conducted through
his New York office pursuant to his personal detailed
instructions. His residence was in Paris, France, where
he had a second office. By cable, telephone and mail,
petitioner kept a watchful eye over his securities. While
he sought permanent investments, changes, redemptions,
maturities and accumulations caused limited shiftings in
his portfolio. These were made under his own orders.
The offices kept records, received securities, interest and
dividend checks, made deposits, forwarded weekly and
annual reports and undertook generally the care of the
investments as instructed by the owner. Purchases were
made by a financial institution. Petitioner did not participate directly or indirectly in the management of the
corporations in which he held stock or bonds. The
method of handling his affairs under examination had
been employed by petitioner for more than thirty years.

Opinion of the Court.

No objectioni to the deductions had previously been made
by the Government.
The Board of Tax Appeals' held that these aotivities
did not constitute Carrying on a business and that the
expenses were .capable of apportionment between the real
estate and the investments. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,' and we granted certiorari because .of
conflict.5
Petitioner urges that the "elements of continuity, constant repetition, regularity and extent" differentiate his
activities from the occasional like actions of the small
investor. His activity is and the occasional action is
riot "carrying on business." On the other hand, the respondent urges that "mere personal investment activities
never constitute carrying on a trade or business, no matter how much of one's time or of, one's employees' time
they may occupy."
Since the first income tax act, the provisions authorizing business deductions have varied only slightly. The
Revenue Act of 1913 ' allowed as a deduction "the necessary expenses actually.paid in carrying on any business."
By 1918 the present form was fixed and has so continued.1
No regulation has ever been promulgated which interprets the meaning of "carrying on a business," nor any
rulings approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, i. e.,
Treasury Decisions.' Certain rulings of less dignity, favorable to petitioner,' appeared in individual cases but

they are not determinative." Even acquiescence" in
some Board rulings after defeat does not amount to settled administrative practice."2 UnlEss the administrative
practice is 16ng. continued and substantially uniform.in
the Bureau and without challenge by the Government in
the Board and courts, it should not be assumed, from rulings of this class, that Congressional reenactment of the
language which they construed was an adoption of their
interpretation.
While the Commissioner has combated views similar
to petitioner's in the courts, sometimes successfully 1
and sometimes unsuccessfully, 1' the petitioner urges that
the Bureau accepted for years the doctrine that the management of one's own securities might be a business
where there was sufficient extent, continuity, variety and
regularity. We fail to find such a fixed administrative
construction in the examples cited. It is true that the
decisions are frequently put on the ground that the
taxpayer's activities were sporadic but it does not followthat had those activities been continuous the Commissioner Would, not have used the argument advanced here,
i. e., that no amount of personal investment management
would turn those activities into a business. Evidently
such was the Government's contention in the Kales

case, 5 where the things the taxpayer did met petitioner's
tests, and in Foss v. Commissioner 8 and Washburn v.
Commissioner 17 where the opinions turned on the extent of the taxpayer's participation in the management
of the corporations in which investments were held. 8
Petitioner relies strongly on the definition of business
in Flint v. Stone Tracy Company: '" "'Business' is a
very comprehensive ,term and embraces everything about
which a person can be employed." This definition was
given in considering whether certain corporations came
under the Corporation Tax law which, levies a tax on
corporations engaged in business. The immediate issue
was whether corporations engaged principally in the
"holding and management of real estate" " were subject to the act. A definition given for such
an issue is
2
not controlling in this dissimilar inquiry. '

To determine whether the activities of a taxpayer are
"carrying on a business" requires an examination of the
facts in each case.

As the Circuit Court of Appeals ob-

served, all expenses of every business transaction are not
deductible. Only those are deductible -which relate to
carrying on a business. The Bureau of Internal Revenue
has -this duty of determining what is carrying on a business, subject to reexamination of -the facts by the Board of
Tax Appeals 22 and-ultimately to review on the law by the

courts on which jurisdiction is conferred.2 ' The Commissioner and the Board appraised the evidence here as
insufficient to establish petitioner's activities as those of
carrying on a business. The petitioner merely kept records and collected interest and dividends from his securities, through managerial attention for his investments. No matter how large the estate or how continuous or extended the work required may be, such facts are
not sufficient as a matter of law to permit the courts to
reverse the decision of the Board. Its conclusion is.adequately supported by this record, and rests upon a conception of carrying on business similar to that expressed
by this Court for an antecedent section.2"
The petitioner makes the point that his activities in
managing his estate, both realty and personalty, were
a unified business. Since it was admittedly a business
in so far as the realty is concerned, he urges, there is no
statutory authority to sever expenses allocable to the
securities. But we see no reason why expenses not attributable, as we have just held these are not, to carrying
on business cannot be apportioned. It is not unusual
to allocate expenses paid for services partly personal and
partly business."
