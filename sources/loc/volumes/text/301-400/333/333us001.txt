MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Section 205 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief
Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1178, as amended, 56 Stat. 769, 770,
50 U. S. C. App. Supp. V, § 525, provides in part that no
portion of the period of military service1 which occurs
after October 6, 1942,2 shall.be included "in computing
any period now or hereafter provided by any law for the
redemption of real property sold or forfeited to enforce
any obligation, tax, or assessment."
Petitioner owned land in Florida on which taxes became
delinquent April 1, 1940, Under Florida statutory procedure ' the tax collector after notice sells the land at
public sale and issues a tax certificate to the purchaser.
At any time after two years from the date of the certificate
the holder thereof may apply for a tax deed. Notice is
given, a public sale is had, 'and a tax deed is issued. The
owner may redeem the land at any time after issuance
of the certificate and before issuance of the tax deed.
'The term is defined in § 101 (2) of the Act as follows:
"For persons in active service at the date of the approval of this
Act it shall begin with the date of approval of this Act; for persons
entering active service after the date of this Act, with the date of
entering active service. It shall terminate with the date of discharge
from active service or death while in active service, but in no case
later than the date when this Act 6eases to be in force." "
2 That was the effective date of the amendment which added this
provision to § 205.3 Fla. Stats.. cc. 193, 194 (1941).

LE MAISTRE v. LEFFERS.
Opinion of the Court

In accordance with this procedure a tax certificate on
petitioner's lands was issued August 5, 1940. Petitioner
was on active duty in the Navy from August 18, 1942, until his discharge on December 18, 1945. Application for a
tax deed was made by one Conrod in January, 1943, and
the deed issued to him on March 1, 1943. It is through
him that respondents claim by mesne conveyances.
Petitioner filed this suit in equity on March 25, 1946,
seeking to set aside the tax deed by reason of § 205 of
the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act. The Florida
Supreme Court affirmed a judgment denying the relief,
159 Fla. 122, 31 So. 2d 155, on the authority of its earlier
decision in De Loach v. Calihan, 158 Fla. 639, 30 So. 2d
910. The case is here 6n a petition for a writ of certiorari
which we granted because the construction given to the
federal Act seemed to us not only a dubious one but also
at variance with Illinois Nat. Bank v. Gwinn, 390 111; 345,
61 N. E. 2d 249.
Under Florida law petitioner concededly could have
redeemed any time between August 5, 1940, when the
certificate was issued, and March 1, 1943, when the tax
deed was issued. The prolVision of the federal Act with
which we are here concerned became effective during that
period-October 6, 1942. At that time petitioner was in
the Navy and at once became a beneficiary of it. That
means that the running of the time granted him under
Florida law to redeem was tolled as long as he was in the
military service. Since he would have had from October
6, 1942, to March 1, 1943, to redeem, the effect of the
Act was to give him the same length of time after his
discharge for that purpose. His present action being
timely, there is thus no barrier to hisrecovery so far as the
Act is concerned.
Two reasons, however, are advanced against it. First,
it, is argued that § 205 applies only where state law provides for transfer of title to the purchaser subject to de-

feasance by redemption. The Florida procedure is said to
be not covered by § 205 since title passes only on issuance
of the deed, which ends the period of redemption.. We
do not think § 205 deserves such a technical reading.
The provision in question was added in 1942 to remedy
what this Court had held to be a casus omissus in a preceding Act.' Ebert v. Poston, 266 U. S. 548, 554. Its
language does not compel the narrow reading that is suggested; and the spirit of the amendment repels any such
restriction. It covers "any period . . . provided by any
law for the redemption of real property sold or forfeited,"
etc. We see neither in that language nor in the legislative
history of the provision any purpose to restrict its application to cases where redemption follows passage of
title.
The second reason urged against petitioner is the one
adopted by the Supreme Court of Florida in De Loach v.
Calihan, supra. It held that § 205 is limited by § 500.
The latter section gives added protection to a person in
military service by providing that no sale for taxes or
assessments shall be made except upon leave of court
"in respect of . . . real property owned and occupied for
dwelling, professional, business, or agricultural purposes,"
and by granting a given period for redemption.' The
4The
purpose was stated as follows: "The running of the statutory
period during which real property may be redeemed after sale to

enforce any obligation, tax, or assessment is likewise tolled during
the part of such period which occurs after the, enactment of the
Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act Amendments of 1942. Although
the tolling of -such periods is now within the spirit of the law, it has
not been held to be within 'the letter thereof (I. R. .269 C. B.,
June 1922, p. 311; Ebert V. Poston, 266 U. S. 549)." Sen. Rep. No.

1558, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 4.

assessments, whether general or special (other than taxes on income),
whether falling due prior to or during the period of military service,

LE MAISTRE v. LEFFERS.

Opinion of the Court.

Supreme Court of Florida held that § 500 describes the
class of real property on which a soldier or sailor is granted
indulgence, while § 205 indicates the period of the indulgence. Under that view petitioner would fail because
the property in question does not appear to be land
"owned and occupied for dwelling, professional, business,
or agricultural purposes."
We do not, however, read the Act so restrictively, The
two sections-205 and 500-supplement each other.
Section 500, applicable to restricted types of real property, gives greater protection than § 205. It restrains the
sale for taxes or assessments of specified types of real
property except upon leave of court and prescribes for
them a specified time within which the right to redeem
may be exercised if the property is sold. Section 205
in respect of personal property, money, or credits, or real property
owned and occupied for dwelling, professional, business, or agricultural purposes by a person in military service or his dependents at
the commencement of his period of military service and still so
occupied by his dependents or employees are not paid.
"(2) No sale of such property shall be made to enforce the collection
of such tax or assessment, or any proceeding or action for such
purpose commenced, except upon leave of court granted upon application made therefor by the collector of taxes or other officer whose
duty it is to enforce the collection of taxes or assessments. The
court thereupon, unless in its opinion the ability of the person in
military service to pay such taxes or assessments is not materially
affected by reason of such service, may stay such proceedings or
such sale, as provided in this Act, for a period' extending not more
than six months after the tenrmination of the period of military
service of such person."
"(3) When by law such property may be sold or forfeited to enforce
the collection of such tax or ass( ssment, such person in military service
shall have the right to redeem or commence an action to redeem such
property, at any time not later than six months after the termination
of such service, but in no case later than six months after the date
when this Act ceases to be in 'orce; but this shall not be taken to
shorten any period, now or heceafter provided by the laws of any
State or Territory for such redemption."

extends in terms to all land and only tolls the time for
redemption for the period of military service. The other
construction attributes to Congress a purpose to protect
only certain classes of real property owned by those in the
armed services. We cannot do that without drastically
contracting the language of § 205 and closing our eyes to
its beneficent purpose. But as we indicated on another
occasion, the Act must be read with an eye friendly to
those who dropped their affairs to answer their country's
call. Boone v. Lightner, 319 U. S. 561, 575.

DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 370. 'Argued January 8-9, 1948.-Decided February 2, 1948.
1. Section 19 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as hiended, which
provides that an alien who is "sentenced more than once" to imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction of a
crime involving moral turpitude committed after entn, shall be
deported, does not apply to an alien who, in a single trial, has been
convicted on two different counts of a single indictment for murdering two different persons and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Pp. 7-10.
2. This provision of the statute authorizes deportation only where an
alien, having committed a crime involving moral turpitude and having been convicted and sentenced, once again commits a crime of
that nature and is convicted and sentenced for it. P. 9.
3. Because deportation is a drastic penalty equivalent to banishment
or exile, this section should be given the narrowest of several possible meanings of the words used. P. 10.
