OCTOBER TERM, 1968.
Per Curiam.

393 U. S.

BERGER v. CALIFORNIA.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,

TO THE COURT OF

SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT.

No. 221, Misc.-Decided January 13, 1969.
The holding in Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719, that the absence of
a witness from the jurisdiction would not justify the use at trial
of preliminary hearing testimony unless the State had made a
good-faith effort to secure the witness' presence, should be given
retroactive application.
Certiorari granted; 258 Cal. App. 2d 622, 66 Cal. Rptr. 213, vacated
and remanded.

Thomas C. Lynch, Attorney General of California,
William E. James, Assistant Attorney General, and Marvin A. Bauer, Deputy Attorney General, for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

Petitioner was convicted of robbery and kidnaping
for the purpose of robbery. The victim, one Carl Arthur
Dunston, testified against petitioner at a preliminary
hearing; there was evidence that at the time of the trial
Dunston was in Colorado. A state investigator tried to
contact Dunston on the telephone; he got through to
some of Dunston's relatives and to his employer, but
not to Dunston himself. Although two telegrams were
received, allegedly from Dunston, no subpoena was
served. At trial, the transcript of Dunston's preliminary
hearing testimony was introduced into evidence. On
appeal, the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate
District of California held that this procedure did not
deny petitioner his Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him since Dunston
was absent from the State of his own free will and since
petitioner's counsel had had an adequate opportunity to

cross-examine Dunston at the preliminary hearing. 258
Cal. App. 2d 622, 66 Cal. Rptr. 213 (1968). The California Supreme Court denied petitioner a hearing on
April 4, 1968. Nineteen days later we held in the case
of Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719, that the absence of a
witness from the jurisdiction would not justify the use
at trial of preliminary hearing testimony unless the
State had made a good-faith effort to secure the witness'
presence. The sole question in this case is whether the
holding of Barber v. Page should be given retroactive
application. We think that it should.
Clearly, petitioner's inability to cross-examine Dunston
at trial may have had a significant effect on the "integrity
of the fact-finding process." Linkletter v. Walker, 381
U. S. 618, 639 (1965); cf. Roberts v. Russell, 392 U. S.
293 (1968); McConnell v. Rhay, ante, p. 2 (1968). As
we pointed out in Barber v. Page, one of the important
objects of the right of confrontation was to guarantee
that the fact finder had an adequate opportunity to assess
the credibility of witnesses. 390 U. S., at 721. And
California's claim of a significant countervailing interest
based upon its reliance on previous standards, see Stovall
v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 297 (1967), is most unpersuasive.
Barber v. Page was clearly foreshadowed, if not preordained, by this Court's decision in Pointer v. Texas,
380 U. S. 400 (1965), which was handed down more than
a year before petitioner's trial. Accordingly, we can see
no reason why Barber v. Page should not be given fully
retroactive application.
The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and
the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated and the case is
remanded for reconsideration in light of this Court's
decision in Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719 (1968).
It is so ordered.
