393 U. S.

FULLER v. ALASKA.
ON PETITION

FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF ALASKA.

No. 249.

Decided October 28, 1968.

Lee v. Florida,392 U. S. 378, which held inadmissible in state criminal
trials evidence violative of § 605 of the Federal Communications
Act, is to be applied only to trials in which such evidence is
sought to be introduced after the date of that decision.
Certiorari granted; 437 P. 2d 772, affirmed.

George Kaufmann for petitioner.
PER CURIAM.

Petitioner was convicted of shooting with intent to
kill or wound and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Over petitioner's objection that it was obtained in violation of § 605 of the Federal Communications Act, 48
Stat. 1103, 47 U. S. C. § 605, the prosecution introduced
in evidence a telegram allegedly sent by petitioner to
an accomplice. The Supreme Court of Alaska affirmed,
holding that it did not need to decide whether § 605 had
actually been violated since the evidence was in any
event admissible in state trials under Schwartz v. Texas,
344 U. S. 199.
In Lee v. Florida,392 U. S. 378, we overruled Schwartz
v. Texas and held that evidence violative of § 605
is not admissible in state criminal trials. The decision of
the Alaska Supreme Court cannot stand, therefore, if Lee
is to be applied retroactively. We hold, however, that
the exclusionary rule of Lee is to be given prospective
application, and, accordingly, we affirm.

FULLER v. ALASKA.
80

Per Curiam.

Prospective application of Lee is supported by all of
the considerations outlined in Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S.
293, 297.1 The purpose of Lee was in no sense to
"enhance the reliability of the fact-finding process at
trial." Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U. S.719, 729. Like
Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S.643, Lee was designed to enforce
the federal law.2 Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618,
639. And evidence seized in violation of the federal
statute is no less relevant and reliable than that seized
in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Moreover, the States have justifiably relied
upon the explicit holding of Schwartz that such evidence
was admissible.
Retroactive application of Lee would overturn every
state conviction obtained in good-faith reliance on
Schwartz. Since this result is not required by the principle upon which Lee was decided, or necessary to accomplish its purpose, we hold that the exclusionary rule is to
be applied only to trials in which the evidence is sought
to be introduced after the date of our decision in Lee.
The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Alaska is affirmed.

dissents for the reasons set out

in his dissenting opinion in Linkletter v. Walker, 381
1These considerations were more recently applied in DeStefano v.
Woods, 392 U. S. 631, 633, in which we concluded that the right to a
jury trial in state criminal prosecutions under Duncan v. Louisiana,
391 U. S. 145, and Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194, was prospective
only.
2 Lee v. Florida, 392 U. S., at 386-387:
"We conclude, as we concluded in Elkins and in Mapp, that nothing
short of mandatory exclusion of the illegal evidence will compel
respect for the federal law 'in the only effectively available wayby removing the incentive to disregard it.' Elkins v. United States,
364 U. S., at 217."
