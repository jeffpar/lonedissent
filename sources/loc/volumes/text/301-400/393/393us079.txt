CONTINENTAL OIL CO. v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO.

Affirmed.

Solicitor General Griswold, Assistant Attorney General Zimmerman, and Lawrence W. Somerville for the
United States.
PER CURIAM.

Being convinced on the record before us that Malco
Refineries, Inc., was not a "failing company," United
States v. Third NationalBank, 390 U. S. 171, 183 (1968) ;
International Shoe Co. v. FTC, 280 U. S. 291 (1930),
and that the record otherwise supports the decree, United
States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384 U. S. 546 (1966), we
affirm the judgment of the District Court.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, believing that this case involves
issues of fact and law which should not be decided
without plenary consideration, would note probable
jurisdiction and set the case for argument.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL

took no part in the considera-

tion or decision of this case.
