The petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment
of the Supreme Court of Texas is reversed and the case is
remanded. We hold that the proofs justified with reason
the jury's conclusion that employer negligence played a
part in producing the petitioner's injury. Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500; Webb v. Illinois Central R. Co., 352 U. S. 512; Fergusonv. Moore-McCormack

FRANKFURTER is of the view that the writ of certiorari is
improvidently granted.

Memorandum of HARLAN, J.

Memorandum of MR.

JUSTICE HARLAN,

with whom

MR.

and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join.*
For reasons elaborated by MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER
at the last Term, 352 U. S. 524, I think that certiorari
should have been denied in each of these cases. However, I continue in the view, expressed at the last Term,
352 U. S. 559, that once certiorari has been granted in such
cases,. we disbelievers, consistent with the .Court's certiorari procedure, should consider them on the merits.
Further, much as I disagree, 352 U. S. 559, 562-564, with
the reasoning and philosophy of the Rogers case, which
strips the historic role of the judge in a jury trial of all
meaningful significance, I feel presently bound to bow to
it. Applying Rogers to the present cases, I am forced to
concur in judgments of reversal in Nos. 142 and 350.
JUSTICE BURTON
