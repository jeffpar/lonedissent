PER CURIAM.

The petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment
of the St. Louis Court of Appeals of the State of Missouri
is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings in
conformity with this opinion. We hold that the proofs
justified with reason the jury's conclusion that employer
negligence played a part in producing the petitioner's
injury. Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352
U. S. 521; Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500.
MR.

JUSTICE HARLAN,

whom MR.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER

joins, concurs in the result for the reasons given in
his memorandum in Gibson v. Thompson, 355 U. S. 18.
For the reasons set forth in his opinion in Rogers v.
Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524, MR. JUSTICE
FRANKFURTER is of the view that the writ of certiorari
is improvidently granted.
