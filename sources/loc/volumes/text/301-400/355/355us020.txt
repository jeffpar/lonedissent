OCTOBER TERM, 1957.
Per Curiam.

355 U.S.

PALERMO v. LUCKENBACH STEAMSHIP CO., INC.
ON

'PETITION FOR

STATES

WRIT

OF CERTIORARI

TO

THE UNITED

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND

CIRCUIT.

No. 350. Decided October 21, 1957.
A jury awarded damages to petitioner, a longshoreman, for personal
injuries sustained while working on a ship owned and operated
by respondent. The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground
that the trial court had erred in refusing to charge the jury
that petitioner was not entitled to any recovery if he voluntarily
chose to use a passageway known by him to be unsafe and if
there was any other passageway known by him to be safe. Held:
Certiorari is granted, the judgment is reversed and the case is
remanded.
(a) The trial court did not commit reversible error in refusing
to grant such an instruction.
(b) Petitioner's alleged choice of a more dangerous route did
not, under the proofs, operate to bar recovery as a matter of law.
(c) The jury was properly instructed that petitioner's negligence,
'if
any, was to be considered in mitigation of damages under the
rule applicable in actions for personal injuries arising from maritime
torts.
246 F. 2d 557, reversed and remanded.

Philip F. Di Co8tanzo for petitioner.
Eugene Underwood and William M. Kimball for
respondent.
PER CURIAM.

The petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment
of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded.* We hold that the trial court did not commit
reversible error in refusing to charge respondent's request
*[Amended, post, p. 910, to provide for remand of the case to the
Court of Appeals.]
