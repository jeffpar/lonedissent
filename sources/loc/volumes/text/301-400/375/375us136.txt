JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.

No. 35.

Argued October 23, 1963.-Questions certified to Supreme
Court of Florida December 2, 1963.

Considering that there are questions of Florida law answers to which
are necessary to enable this Court to determine its jurisdiction over
this cause, and with respect to which there appear to be no precise
controlling precedents in the decisions of the Supreme Court of
Florida, this Court directs that certain questions be certified to the
Supreme Court of Florida, pursuant to Rule 4.61 of the Florida
Appellate Rules. Pp. 136-139.
For opinion below, see post, p. 139.

Howard Dixon and Carl Rachlin argued the cause for
petitioners. With them on the briefs were Alfred I. Hopkins and Tobias Simon.
Edward J. Hill and Roy T. Rhodes argued the cause
for respondent. With them on the brief was Rivers

PER CURIAM.

Considering that there are questions of Florida law
answers to which are necessary to enable this Court to
determine its jurisdiction over this cause, and with
respect to which there appear to be no precise controlling
precedents in the decisions of the Supreme Court of
Florida, this Court desires to certify to the Supreme Court
of Florida, pursuant to Rule 4.61 of the Florida Appellate
Rules, the questions stated hereafter.
The petitioners have been tried and convicted in the
Municipal Court of Tallahassee for unlawful assembly,
under a municipal ordinance which incorporates by refer-

ence the state unlawful assembly statute.1 The convictions were affirmed in the Circuit Court of the Second
Judicial District, Leon County, Florida.2 The unreI Section 23-38 of the Tallahassee Code, which provides that it
shall be unlawful for any person to commit an act which is or shall
be recognized by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor.
Chapter 61-237, Laws of 1961, Florida Statutes ยง 870.04 provides:
"If any number of persons, whether armed or not, are unlawfully,
riotously or tumultuously assembled in any county, city or municipality, the sheriff or his deputies, or any constable or justice of the
peace of the county, or the mayor, or any commissioner, councilman,
alderman or police officer of the said city or municipality, or any
officer or member of the florida [sic] highway patrol, shall go among
the persons so assembled, or as near to them as may be with safety,
and shall in the name of the state command all the persons so assembled immediately and peaceably to disperse; and if such persons do
not thereupon immediately and peaceably disperse, said officers shall
command the assistance of all persons in seizing, arresting and securing such persons in custody; and if any person present being so
commanded to aid and assist in seizing and securing such rioter or
persons so unlawfully assembled, or in suppressing such riot or unlawful assembly, refuses or neglects to obey such command, or, when
required by such officers to depart from the place, refuses and neglects
to do so, he shall be deemed one of the rioters or persons unlawfully
assembled, and may be prosecuted and punished accordingly."
The State refers in its brief to a Tallahassee ordinance specifically
prohibiting unlawful assembly, which is also included in the record
by stipulation of the parties. This ordinance is similar in substance
to the state statute quoted above. However, all parties seemingly
have proceeded on the premise that the petitioners were charged and
convicted only under the general ordinance which incorporated the
state statute. The Circuit Court plainly decided the case on that
basis. See Appendix, post, p. 139.
2 The petitioners appealed their convictions directly to the Supreme
Court of Florida. The Supreme Court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and ordered the appeal transferred to the Circuit Court. 134
So. 2d 228.
After the convictions were affirmed in the Circuit Court and prior
to the filing of a petition for certiorari in this Court, the petitioners
attempted to file, and subsequently withdrew, a petition for certiorari
in the District Court of Appeal.

ported opinion of that court, a copy of which, taken from
the record, is attached to this certificate as an Appendix,
contains a statement of the facts on which the convictions
rested. The petitioners sought certiorari in this Court,
which the City of Tallahassee opposed on the ground,
inter alia, that the judgment of the Circuit Court was not
"rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had," as required by 28 U. S. C. ยง 1257.
This Court granted certiorari, 372 U. S. 963, and subsequently directed counsel to file briefs on the jurisdictional
issue, which counsel have done.
The questions which this Court desires to certify are:
1. On a timely petition for writ of certiorari or other
process, does the Florida District Court of Appeal or any
other court of Florida have jurisdiction to review a judgment of the Circuit Court affirming a conviction in the
Municipal Court of a violation of a municipal ordinance
which incorporates a state statute by reference, where the
questions presented for review concern the federal constitutionality of the ordinance on its face and as applied?
2. If the District Court of Appeal or any other court of
Florida does have such jurisdiction and had granted review
in this case by way of a writ of certiorari or other process,
would it have been empowered to consider fully each
of the following contentions, all indisputably properly
preserved:
(a) "Petitioners were peaceable and orderly at all
times; hence, there was no evidence whatsoever to
support the convictions below for unlawful assembly,
and therefore Petitioners have been denied due
process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment";
(b) "The convictions constituted a violation of
Petitioners' rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly as guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment";

DRESNER v. CITY OF TALLAHASSEE.

Appendix.

(c) "The arrests and convictions herein constituted an undue burden on interstate commerce in
violation of the interstate commerce clause of the
Federal Constitution";
(d) "The arrests and convictions herein constituted a denial of the equal protection of the laws
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment"?
If not, in what respects would the scope of review have
been limited?
The Clerk of this Court is directed to transmit this
certificate, signed by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and under the
official seal of the Court, to the Supreme Court of Florida,
and simultaneously to transmit copies thereof to the
attorneys for the respective parties.
APPENDIX.
OPINION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND JUDICIAL
CIRCUIT, LEON COUNTY,

FLORIDA.*

Order Affirming Judgments.
This is an appeal from convictions in the Municipal
Court of the City of Tallahassee, Florida of the ten appellants named in the caption who were charged with unlawful assembly. A fine was assessed against each of them
with an alternate jail sentence.
The formal charge is in a single count naming the ten
appellants and three othersI as defendants and alleges
an unlawful assembly on June 16, 1961 "in that, they
being more than three (3) persons, met together to commit a breach of the peace, acting together and concertedly
to occupy and continuously occupy certain chairs and

seating facilities in the Tallahassee Municipal Airport,
making and cancelling group airline reservations on the
two (2) operating airline schedules departing Tallahassee
on said date, and on June 15, 1961, and meeting together
in concert attendant with circumstances calculated to
excite alarm, endanger the public peace and excite fear,
and in such nature as to inspire well-grounded fear in
persons of reasonable courage, of riot, or other breaches
of public peace, and while so unlawfully assembled" were
commanded by a police officer of the city, after identifying himself as such, to immediately and peaceably
disperse, and they refused or neglected to do so.
The appellants contend that the judgments pursuant
to convictions violate their rights guaranteed by the
Florida and United States Constitutions in that they have
been denied the equal protection of the laws and have
been deprived of liberty or property without due process
of law. They contend that the state statute, Chap.
61-237, Laws of 1961, (F. S. 870.04), (which, by reference
adoption in a municipal ordinance,2 is made an ordinance
of the City of Tallahassee) is unconstitutional and void,
either on its face or as it has been applied to the appellants
in this case.
The pertinent portions of the statute, adopted as an
ordinance, are:
"If any number of persons . . . are unlawfully,
riotously or tumultuously assembled in any . . . city
or municipality . . . any . . . police officer of said
city or municipality . . . shall go among the persons
so assembled . . . and shall, in the name of the state
command all the persons so assembled immediately
2 Sec. 23-38, Tallahassee Code, provides that it shall be unlawful
for any person to commit any act which is or shall be recognized
by the laws of the state as a misdemeanor. The penalty is a maximum fine of $500.00 or 60 days imprisonment or both.

DRESNER v. CITY OF TALLAHASSEE.

and peaceably to disperse; and if such persons do not
thereupon immediately and peaceably disperse, said
[officer] shall command the assistance of all persons
in seizing, arresting and securing such persons in
custody; and if any person present . . . when required by such [officer] to depart from the place,
refuses or neglects to do so, he shall be deemed one
of . . . the persons unlawfully assembled and may
be prosecuted and punished accordingly."
The facts in the case are not in dispute and squarely
present the question as to whether or not the conduct of
the appellants was an exercise by them of rights they hold
under state and federal constitutional provisions, which
would preclude their prosecution, conviction and sentence
for unlawful assembly in the trial court.
The appellants are clergymen, two being rabbis and the
others being ordained ministers of several Protestant denominations. They are residents of New Jersey, New
York, Massachusetts or Connecticut. Some of them are
of the white race and some are negroes. About June 12
or 13, 1961 they, together with eight other clergymen
from the same general area, departed from Washington,
D. C. by interstate common carrier bus for a so-called
"Freedom Ride" into Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia,
and Florida. The bus ride terminated in Tallahassee
June 15, 1961. The "Freedom Riders" left their buses
at the Greyhound bus terminal there and went into the
terminal lunch room to obtain food which was served
them.
This trip was sponsored and at least partially financed
by an organization known as C 0 R E (Congress on
Racial Equality) which has been aggressive in promoting racial integration and desegregation. The trip was
well publicized, having been given wide coverage in all
news media including radio and television. The time

OCTOBER TERM, 1963.

375 U. S.

and place of arrival in Tallahassee was heralded and well
known.
The purposes of the "Freedom Ride", as stated by
appellant Collier, who was the spokesman for the group,
were two-fold: (1) To ascertain whether or not there
were facilities available on an integrated basis to interstate passengers in waiting rooms, in rest rooms, in eating
facilities in the terminals through which they would pass;
and (2) To bear witness as ministers, rabbis and clergymen to the struggle to obtain those rights "guaranteed
us by the Constitution."
Shortly prior to the time the buses bearing the "Freedom Riders" were scheduled to arrive at about noon on
June 15, there had gathered in the vicinity of the bus
station a number of persons and groups of persons. Law
enforcement officers, including city police, had been dispatched to the area to prevent any disturbance. It was
suspected that resentment against the "Freedom Riders"
might result in some attempts at violence toward them or
precipitate other disorders. When the buses arrived, law
enforcement personnel moved in and gave protection to
the passengers as they left the bus and entered the lunch
room in the terminal. Apparently they were served in
the lunch room under circumstances and policies satisfactory to them.
In approximately an hour after arrival at the bus terminal the eighteen "Freedom Riders" proceeded to the
Tallahassee Municipal Airport ostensibly for the purpose
of boarding a 3:25 P. M. Eastern Air Lines plane for passage to Washington, Newark, or New York. They were
transported to the airport in private cars presumably furnished by local sympathizers with their objectives.
Upon arrival at the airport they found that the restaurant there had been closed. When the time approached for arrival of the 3:25 plane the ten appellants
cancelled the reservation they had previously made for

DRESNER v. CITY OF TALLAHASSEE.
136

the flight. The other eight boarded the plane when it
arrived and departed for their destinations in the East.
At that time, the airport arrangement provided separate waiting rooms, or areas, for white and negro; also
separate rest rooms; and separate areas for serving food,
the white area being a glassed-in place and the negro consisting of a counter with several stools. However, as
mentioned before, the eating service had been discontinued by the closing of the restaurant facilities. A
sandwich vending machine was in the lobby, but the
prices on same had been marked up from previous prices.
The appellants stayed together in a more or less compact group in the lobby area most of the time and no
attempt was made to enforce separation of the races in
the waiting room. Rest rooms were used by them without observing the designation of the segregated facilities.
After cancelling their reservations for the 3:25 P. M.
flight they sought and ultimately obtained reservations
for a flight the next morning at 8:25 on an E. A. L. plane.
They remained in the airport until about 11:00 P. M.
that evening for the purpose of observing if the restaurant
would open and service be granted to them. The restaurant remained closed.
Law enforcement officers, including city police, were
detailed to keep order. The activities and objectives of
the appellants had been the subject of news reporting and
groups of people were seen to be gathering or attempting
to gather in the vicinity of the airport. There were critical and hostile comments made about the appellants.
The police turned away some of those gathering when it
was apparent such persons had no airport business or
interest. Persons were even screened at the entrance and
turned away by officers if they had no business to transact
at the airport.
The chief of police advised the appellants that the airport terminal would close for the night at approximately

OCTOBER TERM, 1963.

375 U. S.

11:45 P. M. and a spokesman for appellants requested
protection as they moved from the airport into the city
and also on the return to the airport the next morning.
Such protection by escort of law enforcement officers was
provided.
The appellants thus left the airport at about 11:00
P. M. on the 15th to return the next morning prior to the
scheduled departure at 8:25 A. M. of the plane on which
they had obtained reservations. They were given escort
security protection on both the occasions of leaving and
returning to the terminal.
The restaurant was also closed on the morning of June
16. At 8:15 A. M. all ten of the appellants cancelled
their reservations for the 8:25 flight and remained in the
waiting room after that flight had departed. At 8:20
A. M. they sought, and ultimately obtained, reservations
on a National Airlines flight scheduled to depart at 1:47
P. M. that day, but cancelled just prior to noon.
During these periods there continued to be movements
and gatherings of groups of people in cars and there was
a hostility and open resentment against the conduct and
attitudes of the appellants. A considerable number of
police, sheriff's deputies and highway patrolmen had been
detailed to prevent disorder. City, county and state
officials, including the Governor, were apprehensive and
moved to provide necessary law enforcement personnel to
preserve order.
At about 12:15 P. M., Mr. James Messer, Jr., city attorney of Tallahassee and a special police officer of the city,
after conferring with the mayor and chief of police of the
city, approached the appellants who were together and
inquired if there was a leader of the group. Appellant
Collier arose and identified himself and assumed to act
as spokesman. Mr. Messer identified himself and his
official positions, exhibiting his police badge. Others in
the group gathered around Mr. Messer and Rev. Collier

DRESNER v. CITY OF TALLAHASSEE.
136

145

Appendix.

and Mr. Messer read to them a proclamation. He stated
that the assembly of the appellants at the Municipal Airport of Tallahassee will tend to create a disturbance or
incite a riot or disorderly conduct within the City of Tallahassee at its Municipal Airport over which the city had
jurisdiction. He mentioned incidents of the previous
night and fears of more unrest. He then commanded
them in the name of the state and city to immediately
and peaceably disperse, and explained that such meant
from the airport property. He then added that failure
to so disperse would result in arrest for unlawful assembly.
Collier asserted that they were interstate passengers, to
which Messer replied that he did not consider them
to be bona fide passengers in view of their reservation
cancellations.
Several local sympathizers with the appellants dispersed, but appellants failed to do so. After about 11/2
minutes, Mr. Messer turned to the Chief of Police and
remarked "Chief, you can carry out your orders." The
appellants were arrested and taken into custody.
The appellants take the view that the segregation practices with regard to waiting rooms, rest room facilities,
and restaurant or eating facilities at the airport were
violative of constitutional guarantees of equal protection
of the law. They would also inject into the case the
installation of sandwich and cigarette machines, at or just
prior to their arrival, which inflated the prices of merchandise vended to double what it had been. The closing
of the restaurant on the day of their arrival and its opening shortly after their departure is viewed as an important
factor.
These facts are, in the view of this Court, not at all
significant in the legal problems involved in the charge
against the appellants and the disposition of such charge
by the trial court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1963.
Appendix.

375 U. S.

The municipality of Tallahassee operates in a proprietary capacity and in a governmental capacity. Among
its proprietary functions is the ownership and operation
of a municipal airport and supervision over the concessions there. Assuming, but not deciding, that its policies
of segregation of the races in its facilities are unlawful
and did constitute a violation of some duty to the appellants if enforced against them, and further assuming,
without deciding, that the closing of the restaurant under
the circumstances violated some duty to them, do such
circumstances justify a concerted protest demonstration
by appellants of their views and convictions over a protracted period of time during which tensions and tempers
rise in the community which threaten to erupt into disorder and thus render the city, in its governmental capacity, powerless to terminate the demonstration in the
exercise of its police power?
Stated another way, may not a lawful assembly for
the purpose of protesting and demonstrating opposition
to a course of policy practiced by the municipality become
an unlawful assembly when pursued to unreasonable
lengths imposing unreasonable burdens on others, after
the lawful objectives of the demonstration had been fairly
accomplished?
It is fundamental that our constitutions accord to the
citizen of the United States the right of freedom of
speech and of assembly and to peaceably petition for a
redress of grievances. Such freedoms are jealously
guarded and when exercised in good faith and in good
order may not be lawfully interfered with by governmental action. However, it is not a license to take into
one's own hands the enforcement of law or by excessive
harassment, effect coercion and acceptance of one's convictions and interpretations of legal rights by governmental entities whose policies are in conflict. Such procedures wholly ignore the very machinery provided by the

DRESNER v. CITY OF TALLAHASSEE.
136

147

Appendix.

constitutions and laws of the nation and state for the
declaring, securing and enforcement of constitutional and
other legal rights. It is the courts, both state and federal,
to whom resort is readily available for citizens to seek
recognition and enforcement of legal rights and immunities. That such courts may not move as swiftly as the
individual would wish does not authorize pursuit of personal means which unnecessarily create or threaten public
disturbance or disorder, or which substantially interfere
with normal, orderly functions of a public facility.
Such a procedure is a form of anarchy which, if it becomes an accepted practice, can have only the effect of
seriously weakening orderly government.
The appellants, prior to the reading of the riot act to
them, had achieved their announced objectives. They
had observed both at the bus station and the airport the
integration or lack of it of the waiting room, rest room
and restaurant facilities. They had very effectively
borne witness as clergymen and otherwise of their sympathy with the struggle to obtain desegregation of the
various facilities of interstate travel.
To accommodate and facilitate those legitimate objectives the law enforcement agencies of city, county and
state had given protection against potential violence or
other disorder from groups or individuals who resented
the activities of the appellants. This protection was afforded at the bus station, at the airport on the afternoon
of June 15, on the evening of June 15 when the appellants
left the airport to come into town and on the following
morning when they returned to the airport purportedly to
take an early plane. However, instead of using the reservations they had obtained they made a cancellation. This
was thrice they had made last minute cancellations of
reservations for the sole reason that they wished to eat
in the restaurant, which was closed. In the meantime
their conduct and persistence was arousing increased re-

OCTOBER TERM, 1963.

375 U. S.

sentment and anger in the community with threats of
violence and disorder toward the appellants.
Obviously, the conduct of appellants had revealed a pattern. They would make reservations for travel, wait in
the lobby until just before the plane they were scheduled
to take arrived and then cancel, make reservations on a
later flight and then again cancel at the last minute, at all
times remaining in the airport but never taking a plane.
The effect is obvious. The seats and other facilities are
occupied by them and their use denied to those who actually wished to travel. The use of rest rooms and wash
rooms by them partakes more of lodging than a comfort
feature for those whose sole purpose is some airport business. The reservation of space and last minute cancellations prevented the use of that space of the flights involved, resulting in loss and inconvenience to the air line
involved and probable denial to other would-be travelers
of the use of that space. The sole purpose of such a
course of harassment was to goad the municipality and its
restaurant lessee to open the restaurant and gratify the
appellants' wishes that they be served in the style and
manner they deemed to be their right.
Controversies between citizens and governmental units
are not unique. In nearly every instance there is a conflict in what the citizen contends he has a right to claim
and the governmental entity which would deny the validity of such claim. The citizen may freely express his
views and seek to cultivate converts to them with a view
of bringing moral or political pressures on the officers of
the public body to accord his demands. However, such
means must be exercised in a manner that is reasonable
and not harmful to the rights of others or the peace and
good order of the community. Especially is this true
when the controversy is one of public interest in which
there are strong and emotional feelings on the part of a
substantial number of persons in the community.

Appendix.

The courts, both state and federal, are open to resolve
controversies on constitutional issues in duly instituted
and processed civil actions. Indeed, the very issue in the
demonstrations of the appellants was subsequently presented to and adjudicated by .the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Florida. Brooks, et al.
v. Tallahassee, 202 Fed. Supp. 56. When citizens press
their demonstrations in behalf of a cause (however worthy they deem their objectives to be) beyond the bounds
of fully and effectively delivering their message and reach
the stage that they materially and harmfully interfere
with the orderly business and lawful activities of others,
who are acting in public or private capacities, then the
conduct is disorderly and assembly for carrying it out is
unlawful. Such was the case here.
The judgments appealed from are hereby affirmed.
Affirmed.
