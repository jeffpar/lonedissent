STATEMENT OF FACTS.

Petitioner, Marguerite Loretta Aldrich, was granted a
divorce from M. S. Aldrich by the Circuit Court of Dade
County, Florida, by decree entered on May 31, 1945. The
jurisdiction of that court to award the divorce was not
contested then, nor is it contested in this action.

The divorce decree awarded alimony to the plaintiff,
in the following provision:
"4. That the defendant, Moriel Simeon Aldrich,
be and he is hereby ordered and required to pay to
the plaintiff, Marguerite Loretta Aldrich, the monthly
sum of $250.00 as and for her permanent alimony,
said sum to be paid to her monthly at the office of
the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Miami, Dade
County, Florida, and in the event the defendant,
Moriel Simeon Aldrich, shall predecease the plaintiff,
Marguerite Loretta Aldrich, said monthly sum of
$250.00 shall, upon the death of said defendant,
become a charge upon his estate during her lifetime; and this Court retains jurisdiction in respect
thereto . ... "
There was no prior express agreement between the parties
that the estate would be bound. Subsequently, the divorce defendant petitioned the Florida court for a rehearing, which was denied, but the court reduced alimony
from $250 to $215 per month. No appeal was taken by
either party.
M. S. Aldrich died testate, a resident of Putnam County,
West Virginia, on May 29, 1958. His will was duly probated in Putnam County and petitioner filed a claim
against the estate for alimony which accrued after the
death of M. S. Aldrich. The appraisal of the estate
showed assets of $7,283.50. Petitioner commenced this
action in the Circuit Court of Putnam County, West Virginia, in order to have her rights in the estate determined.
She also demanded that certain allegedly fraudulent transfers of real and personal property made by M. S. Aldrich
be set aside and the properties which were the subject
of such transfers administered as a part of the estate, so
as to be subject to her claim for alimony under the
Florida divorce decree.

Per Curiam.

The defendants are identified as follows: William T.
Aldrich is a son of M. S. Aldrich and petitioner, and
Natalie Aldrich is the wife of William T. Aldrich. Angela
Aldrich is the widow of M. S. Aldrich. M. S. Aldrich &
Associates, Inc., is a corporation which petitioner alleges
was principally, if not solely, owned by M. S. Aldrich during his lifetime or until shortly before his death. AldrichSlicer Company is a corporation, one of the organizers of
which was William T. Aldrich. John C. White is executor of the last will and testament of M. S. Aldrich.
On motion for summary judgment by the defendants,
the Circuit Court of Putnam County held that the decree
of the Florida divorce court was invalid and unenforceable insofar as it purported to impose upon the estate of
M. S. Aldrich an obligation to pay alimony accruing after
his death. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Appeals
of West Virginia affirmed the decision of the lower court,
one judge dissenting. The majority and minority opinions of the West Virginia court are reported in Aldrich v.
Aldrich, 147 W. Va. 269, 127 S. E. 2d 385. Review by
this Court was sought and obtained on the basis of Art.
IV, ยง 1, of the Constitution of the United States, which
provides that "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in
each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial proceedings of every other State." The case was heard on
October 24, 1963, and on November 12, 1963, the Court
issued a per curiam opinion, 375 U. S. 75, pursuant to
which the following questions are certified to the Supreme
Court of Florida:
1. Is a decree of alimony that purports to bind the
estate of a deceased husband permissible, in the absence
of an express prior agreement between the two spouses
authorizing or contemplating such a decree?
2. If such a decree is not permissible, does the error of
the court entering it render that court without subject
matter jurisdiction with regard to that aspect of the cause?

3. If subject matter jurisdiction is thus lacking, may
that defect be challenged in Florida, after the time for
appellate review has expired, (i) by the representatives
of the estate of the deceased husband or (ii) by persons
to whom the deceased husband has allegedly transferred
part of his property without consideration?
4. If the decree is impermissible but not subject to such
attack in Florida for lack of subject matter jurisdiction by
those mentioned in subparagraph 3, may an attack be
successfully based on this error of law in the rendition of
the decree?
