Opinion of the Court.

MEMPHIS STEAM LAUNDRY CLEANER, INC. v.
STONE, CHAIRMAN, STATE TAX COMMISSION.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSISSIPPI.

No. 253.

Argued December 3, 1951.-Decided March 3, 1952.

A Mississippi "privilege tax," laid upon each person "soliciting business" for a laundry not licensed in the State, held inyalid under the
Commerce Clause, as applied to appellant, a foreign corporation
operating a laundry and cleaning establishment in Tennessee and
doing no business in Mississippi other than sending its trucks there
to solicit business, pick up, deliver, and collect for, laundry and
cleaning. Pp. 389-395.
1. If the tax be imposed upon the privilege of soliciting interstate
business, it stands on no better footing than a tax on the privilege
of doing interstate business, and it is invalid under the Commerce
Clause. Pp. 392-393.
2. If the tax be imposed on the privilege of conducting intrastate
activities in Mississippi, it is invalid as one discriminating against
interstate commerce--because laundries not licensed in the State
are taxed $50 per truck for such activities, whereas laundries
licensed in the State are taxed only $8 per truck. Pp. 394-395.
53 So. 2d 89, reversed.

The Supreme Court of Mississippi sustained a "privilege tax" levied on appellant under Miss. Laws 1944, c.
138, §§ 3, 45, against a claim that it violated the Commerce Clause. 53 So. 2d 89. On appeal to this Court,
reversed, p. 395.

dry not licensed in that State infringes the Commerce
Clause.'
Appellant operates a laundry and cleaning establisi
ment in Memphis, Tennessee. In serving the area sur
rounding Memphis, appellant sends ten of its trucks into
eight Mississippi counties where its drivers pick up, deliver and collect for laundry and cleaning and seek to
acquire new customers. Appellee, who is Chairman of
the, State Tax Commission of the State of Mississippi,
demanded that appellant pay $500 under the following
provisions of the Mississippi "state-wide privilege tax law
of 1944": 2
"'Sec. 3. Every person desiring to engage in any
business, or exercise any privilege hereafter specified
shall first, before commencing same, apply for, pay
for, and procure from the state tax commissioner or
commissioner of insurance, a privilege license authorizing him to engage in the business or exercise
the privilege specified therein, and the amount of tax
shown in the following sections is hereby imposed for
the privilege of engaging or continuing in the business set out therein."
"Sec. 45. Upon each person doing business as a
transient vendor, or dealer, as defined in this section,
and upon which a privilege tax is not specifically imposed by another section of this act, a tax for each
county according to the following schedules:
"(t) Upon each person soliciting business for a laundry not licensed in this state as such, in each
county ..........
$50.00

Opinion of the Court.

"(y) Provided however, that where any person subject to the payment of the tax imposed in this
section, makes use of more than one vehicle in carrying on such business, the tax herein imposed shall be
paid on each vehicle used in carrying on such
business."
After paying the $500 tax as demanded to prevent arrest
of its drivers and seizure of its ten trucks, appellant sued
for refund in a state court, claiming that the Mississippi
tax act was not applicable to its operations and that, if
so applied, the tax would violate the Commerce Clause.
Judgment was entered for appellant in the trial court but
the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed, holding that
appellant's drivers were "transient vendors or dealers"
within the meaning of the statute and that application
of the tax to appellant did not conflict with the Commerce Clause.' The case is here on appeal. 28 U. S. C.
(Supp. IV) § 1257 (2).
In passing upon the validity of a state. tax challenged
under the Commerce Clause, we first look to the "operating incidence" of the tax.4 The Mississippi Act requires
a "privilege license" and imposes a "privilege tax" upon
appellant's employees "soliciting business." The Mississippi Supreme Court described the tax as follows:
The tax involved here is not a tax on interstate commerce, but a tax on a person soliciting business for a laundry not licensed in this state, a local
activity which applies to residents and non-residents
alike." 5
353 So. 2d 89 (1951). The Mississippi Supreme Court also rejected appellant's claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. We do
not reach these issueg under our disposition of the case.

Opinion of the Court.

342 U. S.

The State may determine for itself the operating incidence
of its tax. But it is for this Court to determine whether
the tax, as construed by the highest court of the State, is
or is not "a tax on interstate commerce. ' 6
It would appear from portions of the opinion of the
court below that the tax is laid upon the privilege of soliciting interstate business on the theory that solicitation
of customers for interstate commerce is a local activity
subject to state taxation. However, the opinion below
may also be read as construing the statutory term "soliciting" more broadly, thereby resting the tax upon appellant's activities apart from soliciting new customers in
Mississippi, namely the pick up and delivery of laundry
and cleaning on regular routes within the State. Each
construction of the statute raises different considerations.
But clarification of the operating incidence of the tax is
not required for disposition of this case since we find that
the tax violates the Commerce Clause under either reading of the statute.

commerce itself.' Whether or not solicitation of interstate business may be regarded as a local incident of interstate commerce, the Court has not permitted state
taxation to carve out this incident from the integral economic process of interstate commerce." As the Court
noted last term in a case involving door-to-door solicitation of interstate business, "Interstate commerce itself
knocks on the local door." '
If the Mississippi tax is imposed upon the privilege of
soliciting interstate business, the tax stands on no better
footing than a tax upon the privilege of doing interstate
business. A tax so imposed cannot stand under the Commerce Clause." Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor,

the ordinance before it as one that was neither an added financial
burden on sales' in commerce nor an exaction for the privilege of
doing interstate commerce, the Court made the following statement
pertinent to the instant case:
"While taxation and licensing of hawking or peddling, defined as
selling and delivering in the state, has long been thought to show no
violation of the Commerce Clause, solicitation of orders with subsequent interstate shipment has been immune from such an exaction."

11In McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U. S. 33, 58 (1940),
the Court sustained a tax "conditioned upon a local activity, delivery
of goods within the state upon their purchase for consumption." It
was in that context that Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District,

II.
On the assumption that the tax is imposed upon, ap-

pellant's Mississippi activities of picking up and delivering laundry and cleaning, the "peddler" cases are invoked
in support of the tax.

Under that line of decisions,12 this

Court has sustained state taxation upon itinerant hawkers
and peddlers on the ground that the local sale and delivery
of goods is an essentially intrastate process whether a retailer operates from'a fixed location or from a wagon.
However, assuming for the purposes of this case that
Mississippi imposes its $50 per truck tax only upon the

privilege of conducting intrastate activities, the tax must
be held, invalid as one discriminating against interstate
3
commerce.
The $50 per truck tax is applicable only to vehicles
used by a person "soliciting business for a laundry not
licensed in this state as such." (Emphasis supplied.)
Laundries licensed in Mississippi pay a fixed fee to the
municipality in which located, plus a tax of $8 per truck
supra, was referred to as resting upon discrimination inherent in
fixed-sum license taxes. 309 U. S. at 56-57; Best & Co. v. Maxwell, note 7, supra, at 455-456; Nippert v. Richmond, note 7, supra,
at 424-425. Compare Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 257-258
(1946).
12 In the leading opinion, Emert v. Missouri, 156 U. S. 296 (1895),
the Court reaffirmed Machine Co. v. Gage, 100 U. S.676 (1880), and
other earlier cases. Subsequent additions to the line of "peddler
cases" include: Baccus v. Louisiana,232 U. S.334 (1914); Wagner v.
Covington, 251 U. S.95 (1919); Caskey Baking Co. v. Virginia, 313
U. S.117 (1941).

upon each truck used in other municipalities. 4 As a
result, if appellant "solicits" business in a Mississippi
municipality, it must pay a tax of $50 per truck while a
competitor located in another Mississippi locality must
pay a tax of only $8 per truck. The "peddler" cases are
inapposite under such a showing of discrimination since
they support state taxation only where no discrimination
against interstate commerce appears either upon the face
of the tax laws or in their practical operation."

To sum up, we hold that the tax before us infringes the

Commerce Clause under either interpretation of the
operating incidence of the tax. The Commerce Clause
created -the nation-wide area of free trade essential to this.
country's economic welfare by removing state lines as im8
pediments to intercourse between the states."
The tax
imposed in this case made the Mississippi state line into
a local obsttuction to the flow of interstate commerce that

cannot stand under the Commerce Clause.
