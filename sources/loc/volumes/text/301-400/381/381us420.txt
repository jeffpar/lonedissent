381 U. S.

squarely required by Lucas v. Forty-fourth General
Assembly, 377 U. S. 713,10 I reluctantly acquiesce in the
'
Court's summary affirmance."
HEARNE ET AL. V. SMYLIE, GOVERNOR OF
IDAHO, ET AL.
FOR THE
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF IDAHO.

No. 617. -Decided June 1, 1965.
Appeal dismissed.

HermanJ.McDevitt for appellants.
Allan G. Shepard, Attorney General of Idaho, and
M. Allyn Dingel, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, for
Williams et al., appellees.
PER CURIAM.

The appeal in this case concerns an order of the United
States District Court for the District of Idaho staying this
reapportionment suit until 30 days after the adjournment
of the 1965 Session of the Idaho Legislature. The Idaho
Legislature, after adopting a new reapportionment plan,
adjourned on March 25, 1965. The stay order now having expired by its own terms and the District Court and
the parties now. being in a position to proceed promptly
with this litigation, the motions to dismiss are granted and
the appeal is dismissed.
1oThe gleam of a distinction between that case and this, which is
suggested by what the Coutt said at p. 731 of its Lucas opinion, is
wholly dissipated by what appears shortly thereafter at pp. 736-737.
11 This affirmance does not of course touch the propriety of any
relief that the District Court'may later grant, or the extent to which
provisions of the CaliforniaConstitution are still binding on the State
Legislature in drafting apportionment legislation, see Forty-fourth
General Asembly v. Lucas, 379 U. S. 693.
