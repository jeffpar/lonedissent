AL. v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 848. Argued April 27, 28, 1942.-Decided May 25, 1942.
1. The findings in this case, supported by substantial evidence, establish that the Mexican grant to Castro, as confirmed by the Board of
Land Commissioners, and conveying Mare Island, in San Pablo
Bay, California, does not include the large area of tule marsh claimed
by the petitioners in this case. P. 358.
2. Under Mexican law the ownership of land bordering on navigable
water extends to the line of the highest high tide. P. 359.
3. The decree of the Board of Land Commissioners confirming the
grant to Castro and fixing the boundary is to be interpreted according
to the common law in force in California at the time it was entered.
Under that law, the boundary would be the line of ordinary high
water mark. P. 359.
4. Where a decree confirming a Mexican grant described the land
confirmed as "a place ..

. called .

..

Mare Island . . .," adding

that being an island it was bounded by the water's edge, evidence
of what was commonly known as Mare Island is admissible, not to
attack the decree but to interpret and apply it in identifying the
boundaries intended. P. 362.

STEWART v. UNITED STATES.
354

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a suit by the United States to quiet its title to a
large area of tule marsh lands lying northwest of the
Mare Island Navy Yard in San Pablo Bay in California.
United States v. O'Donnell, 303 U. S. 501, was a similar
suit to quiet the Government's title to marsh lands lying
between the high land on which the Navy Yard is located
and the lands in controversy, which terminated favorably
to the Government. In both cases, the Government deraigned title through a grant by the Mexican Governor
of California to one Castro, and certain mesne conveyances by Castro and his grantees. In both cases, the defendants claimed title under the State of California, on
the theory that the State acquired the lands under the
Swamp Lands Act of September 28, 1850.1 The O'Donnell case involved the validity of the grant to Castro, the
validity of the decree of the Board of Land Commissioners
confirming that grant, the question of priority of right as
between the United States as purchaser of the land granted
'to Castro and the State of California and its grantees
under the Swamp Lands Act. The decision in that case
settled these questions in favor of the Government.
In the O'Donnell case, it was contended that the lands
there in controversy were not embraced within the grant
to Castro. The District Court found against the contention and the Circuit Court of Appeals approved the finding. We refused to review the concurrent findings of the
lower courts.
In the present case, the petitioners do not contest the
rulings in the O'Donnell case. Their defences are that
their lands, which they hold under patents issued for
swamp and overflowed lands, under the Swamp Lands Act,
were never part of the land granted to Castro by the Mexican Governor; and further that, if they were, the decision

in San FranciscoSavings Union v. Irwin,28 F. 708, affirmed
136 U. S. 578, constitutes a ruling as to their title which
ought now to be followed. In addition, they claim that
the action of the United States is barred by the Act of
March 3, 1891,' which prohibits suit by the United States
to annul any patent after six years from the date of issue.
They also contend that laches, estoppel, and failure to
undertake to do equity as a condition of obtaining the
desired relief requite a decree dismissing the bill.
The case was tried before the same District Judge who
presided at the trial of the O'Donnell case. Upon the
basis of the pleadings and proofs, he made, inter alia, the
following findings of fact bearing upon the defence that
the lands in controversy were not included in the grant to
Castro or the confirmation thereof, and hence never
passed to the United States as ultimate transferee of Castro's title:
That none of the lands involved was ever a part of Mare
Island.
That none of these lands was, either at the time of the
grant to Castro or at the time of the proceedings for confirmation of the grant, a part of the lands known as, or
referred to as, or by the name of, Mare Island.
That none of the lands was embraced in or covered by
the grant of Mare Island to Castro.
That none of the lands was ever occupied by, or in possession of, Castro.
That none of the lands was claimed as a part of, or to
be a part of, Mare Island.
That none of the lands was covered by, or embraced
within, the confirmation proceedings or the order of confirmation of the Board or the decree of the District Court
confirming the order of confirmation of the Board.

Opinion of the Court.

That none of the lands was purchased or acquired by
the United States as part of its purchase of Mare Island.
The judge also further made findings that the petitioners' title was derived from the United States through
the State of California under the Swamp Lands Act. He
concluded that the action was barred by the Statute of
Limitations and that the United States was not the owner
of the lands in suit.3
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree by a
vote of 2 to 1. The dissenting judge said: "The District Court found, in effect, that the 'place' which at the
time of the grant to Castro and at the time of the confirmation to Bissell and Aspinwall was called Isla de la
Yegua or Mare Island, did not include any of the land
here in controversy. The finding is amply supported by
evidence."
The majority of the court did not overrule the findings
of the District Judge above outlined. After making a
reference to the evidence, they said: "But whatever may
be the fact there is no occasion to inquire into the extent
of Castro's occupancy, or into the matter of early repute."
They held that, whatever the extent of the Mexican grant
to-Castro, the decree of the Board of Land Commissioners,
made pursuant to the Act of March 3, 1851,' established a definite boundaryo-the line of ordinary higi
water mark-which was controlling. It is conceded that
a portion of the marsh lands embraced in Survey No. 34,
which are the lands involved in the O'Donnell case, is,
and has been, above ordinary high water mark. The
court held that there was some land above that mark in
the narrow neck of land conveyed by Survey No. 34 and

connecting the high land on which the Navy Yard is constructed with the large tract of about 7500 acres covered
by Survey No. 569, which constitutes the land in this suit.

Construing the decree of the Commissioners in accordance
with the common law of California in force at the time of
the confirmaton of the Castro grant, the Court held that
the tract confrmed to Castro's grantees comprised not
only the high land on which the Navy Yard stands but
the narrow strip to the northwestward embraced in Survey No. 34, and the large tract of tule marsh lying still
farther to the northwestward embraced in Survey No. 569.
On account of the importance of the questions involved,
we granted certiorari.
We are of opinion that, in the light of the District
Court's findings, which are undisturbed, the Circuit Court
of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's judgment. It is evident that the Circuit Court of Appeals
accepted, or at least did not overrule, the findings of the
District Judge. If, as we think, these findings were supported by substantial evidence, there is no principle of
law which requires a decision that the decree of confirmation extended the tract actually granted to Castro so as
to embrace the marsh lands, title to which is in controversy.
The record before the Commissioners shows that, on
October 30, 1840, Castro petitioned that he be granted an
island called "Mare Island," that the Governor ad interim
granted his petition on October 31, 1840, and that on May
2, 1841, the Governor of the Californias, one Alvarado,
confirmed Castro's ownership in fee of the same island
"in all its extent," which he designated as "the Island
named La Yegua." There was no evidence before the
Commissioners, and none in the trial of this case, to the
effect that Castro occupied any portion of the tule marsh
in controversy. The testimony before the Commissioners

Opinion of the Court.

was devoted almost entirely to the question of the authenticity and good faith of the grant to Castro. The only
with respect to the size or extent of the island
evidence
was that given by a witness, Vallejo, who resided
near it.
He testified that the island was two and one-half miles
in length and contained about half a league of land. This
description does not include the marsh land involved in
the present case but covers only the high land where the
Navy Yard is located.
The petition of Bissell and Aspinwall for a confirmation
to them of title to the lands granted to Castro by the Commissioners was filed August 31, 1852. It stated that the
subject of the grant was "the Island called 'Isla de la
Yegua"' and asked that the Commissioners confirm to
them the said "tract of land." The decree of the Commissioners, after stating that the claim was valid and the
application for confirmation should be allowed, continued:
"The,place of which confirmation is hereby given is situate
in the Bay of San Francisco and is called 'Isla de la Yegua'
or Mare Island and being an Island is bounded by the
water's
edge."
it is undisputed
that the original grant to Castro was
governed by the Mexican law and that, under that law,
thetitle of an owner of land bordering on navigable waters
ran to the line of the highest high tide. The record contains evidence indicathig that, at such highest tide, the
neck of land to the northwestward of the high land on
which the Navy Yard is located was covered, at least at
certain -points,by water. This fact could not alter boundaries definitely fixed by the Commission's decree, which is
to be interpreted according to the common law in force
in California at the time it was entered. Under the common law, the boundary would be the line of ordinary high
water. But the boundary of the Mexican grant is of
some significance in determining what the Mexican Gov-

316 U. S.

ernor intended to, and did in fact, grant to Castro, especially as both grant and confirmation referred to the
tract as what is named or called Mare Island.
It is to be observed that the decree of confirmation refers
not to a tract of land but to a "place" and to the place
which "is called" Mare Island.
At the time the decree of confirmation was entered, several early maps of the area existed which, although they
did not designate Mare Island by any name, showed the
high land as entirely surrounded by water. They indicate
a channel across the low neck of marsh land to the westward of the high promontory on which the Navy Yard
is constructed.
Coming to about the date of the grant and confirmation,
we find several significant maps. One of these, made by
an Army lieutenant in 1848, shows an actual break at the
northerly end of the high land and indicates that, at this
point, water covered the land, at least at high tide. The
island thus delimited is marked on the map "Mare Island"
and the low tule marsh to the northwestward is not comprehended in the area so designated. Another, made by
one Ellis in 1852, marks the high land "Mares Island."
All the area to the northwest of the high land, including
the land in controversy, is shown as water. A third, made
by one Ringgold, a Commander of the Navy in 1850, shows
the swamp land to the northwest of what is now the Navy
Yard tract but designates only the latter as Mare Island.
Seven United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Charts,
dated respectively 1851, 1851, 1856, 1859, 1861, 1863, and
1915, designate only the high land by the name of "Mare
Island." The United States Geological Survey prepared
maps of the Napa quadrangle and the Mare Island quadrangle in 1902 and 1916. ' In each, the high land is marked
Mare Island and the land in controversy is marked "Island
No. 1." The State Geological Survey of California pre-

Opinion of the Court.

pared a map in 1873 which applies the name "Mare Island"
to the high land.
San FranciscoSavings Union v. Irwin, supra, was tried
about 1885. The Coast and Geodetic Survey prepared a
map for use in that case which shows only the high land
as constituting Mare Island. In the trial of the instant
case, it was testified that the land in controversy has been
for some years known as "Cross Island."
Shortly before the Government purchased Mare Island,
and as a basis of the purchase, a Board of Officers known
as the Sloat Board reported on the island as a site for a
navy yard. This report was made before the confirmation
proceedings were concluded. One of the plans attached
to the report purports to be a plan of Mare Island, showing
its topography. The plan covers only the high land.
The report states that Mare Island is "bounded on the east
by Mare Island Straits which separates it from the City of
Vallejo on the west by the bay of San Pablo, and on the
north by a large tract of tule land, extending several miles
in the direction of Sonoma." The report speaks of the
"north end" of the island as more uniform than the southerly end, so that it may easily be reduced to a convenient
grade. These remarks cannot well apply to the tule
marsh in question. The report states that the island contains, "including the tule opposite Vallejo, about 900
acres." There is a further statement that the whole
length of the island is about two miles. This describes
only the high land, as the length would be about ten miles
if the tule marsh in controversy were included.
The foregoing facts seem to us to furnish adequate support for a finding that what was granted to Castro was
the high land known at the time as Mare Island, and not
the great extent of tule marsh lying to the northwestward
of the former which was apparently not occupied or
claimed by Castro or commonly understood to be a part

of the land called Mare Island. All that the decree purported to confirm was the title to a "place ... called...

Mare Island." Even if the high land was connected by
a narrow neck with the tule marsh to the northwestward,
that high land might still be called an island either because
the narrow neck of low marsh land to its westward was
sometimes flooded or because the name "island" was
colloquially applied to a piece of land which a geographer
would more accurately call a peninsula.'
The Court of Appeals, however, held, and the Government here urges, that the facts recited are immaterial in
view of the terms of the decree of confirmation. The undoubted principle that, when such a decree defines the
boundaries of a tract with precision, the decree cannot be
attacked on the ground that the boundaries named were
erroneous,7 is invoked. But the question remains,
whether the petitioners' contention in this case amounts to
such an attack. The description in the decree of confirmation is at best but a vague one. It is of a "place
โข . . called . . . Mare Island."

If there were nothing

more, it would be competent to show what was in fact the
place so known or called. The Government's contention
is, however, that, because the Commission added that,
being an island, it was bounded by. the water's edge, this
supererogatory statement gives a fixed and definite
boundary which overcomes any vagueness inherent in the
designation of the place granted. We think no such strict

are sometimes called islands. See, Century Dictionary; Webster's New
International Dictionary; Encyclopedia Brittanica, 14th Ed., Vol. XII,
p. 715; Vol. II, p. 381. And compare California State Geological

rule has been applied in the interpretation of deeds or, indeed, of decrees of confirmation of Mexican grants in like
circumstances. On the contrary, courts have repeatedly
resorted to evidence of what was commonly known and
called a ranch, or lot, or other place, in order to correct
erroneous boundaries stated in a deed description or a decree of confirmation.' Thus to explain the meaning and
extent of a decree is not to attack it fo-error, but to reconcile all of the descriptive language used to designate the
tract title to which is confirmed.
We are of opinion that the evidence in question was of
probative value; that its reception and consideration did
not run counter to the rule that the decree of confirmation was not open to attack by reason of erroneous description of the land confirmed, and that the proofs
furnished a basis for a finding of fact that the land in
controversy was not a part of that granted to Castro and
confirmed to his vendees. This view renders it unnecessary to discuss the other questions presented by the petitioners. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals
is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.
