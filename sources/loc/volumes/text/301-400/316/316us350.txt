PEYTON v. RAILWAY EXPRESS AGENCY, INC.
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH
CIRCUIT.

No. 903.

Submitted May 1, 1942.--Decided May 25, 1942.

1. A suit against a single interstate carrier to recover damages resulting
from a negligent failure to deliver a package shipped interstate by
express is a suit arising under a law regulating commerce, viz., under
the Carmack Amendment, as amended,-of which the District Court
has jurisdiction irrespective of the amount involved. Jud. Code
§ 24 (8). P. 352.
2. Whether a suit arises under a law of the United States must appear
from the plaintiff's pleading, not the defenses which may be interposed to, or be anticipated by it. A pleading that adequately discloses a present controversy dependent for its outcome upon the
construction of a federal statute satisfies this requirement.. P. 353.
124 F. 2d 430, reversed.

PER CURIAM.

Petitioner brought this suit. in the District Court for the
Western District of Texas, alleging that respondent, known
to be an interstate carrier, had negligently failed to deliver
to the addressee in California a package* shipped from
Waco, Texas, and claiming damages in the sum of $750,000. The trial court ordered petitioner to attach to his
complaint a copy of the express receipt which he received

upon delivering the package to respondent. This receipt
contained a $50 valuation. Thereupon the court granted
respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint on the
ground that the amount in controversy was less than the
$3,000 necessary to sustain jurisdiction under 28 U. S.
C. § 41(1), Jud. Code § 24(1). The Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit affirmed. We granted certiorari to inquire whether the suit could be maintained under 28 U. S.
C. § 41(8), Jud. Code § 24(8), granting the district courts
jurisdiction "Of all suits and proceedings arising under
any law regulating commerce," irrespective of the amount
involved.
The pertinent act of Congress is 49 U. S. C. § 20(11),
originally the Carmack Amendment of 1906, 34 Stat. 593,
since amended several times to its present form. The section requires an interstate common carrier receiving property for shipment to issue areceipt or bill of lading. The
carrier is made liable to the holder "for any loss, damage,
or injury to such property caused by it" or connecting carriers. If the injury does not occur on the initial carrier's
line, but it responds in damages, it is entitled to recover
over from the responsible carrier. Further, the initial
carrier is made liable to the shipper for full damages sustained, notwithstanding any limitation of liability in the
receipt or bill of lading, with the exception, important
here, that where a carrier by authority or direction of the
Interstate Commerce Commission maintains rates dependent upon the value of the property declared in writing by the shipper, such declaration also limits liability of
-the carrier for loss or damage to an amount not in excess
of the declared value.
Following the Carmack Amendment, this Court in several cases upheld the power of the receiving carrier to limit
its liability to an agreed valuation, made to obtain the
lower of two or more rates. See Adams Express Co. v.

Croninger,226 U. S. 491; Missouri,K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Harriman, 227 U. S. 657; Pierce Co. v. Wells, Fargo & Co.,
236 U. S. 278. The so-called First Cummins Amendment
of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1196, prohibited in general any
such limitation of liability. By the Second Cummins
Amendment of August 9, 1916, 39 Stat. 441, Congress
adopted the present provisions authorizing limitation of
liability in the manner already noted, and substantially
restored the rule of Adams Express Co. v. Croninger,
8upra.

Respondent, confessing error, asserts that under § 20
(11) as it now stands, a suit brought against a single interstate carrier for its negligent non-delivery, is one not
merely to enforce a common law liability limited by an Act
of Congress; but that petitioner's cause of action has its
origin in and is controlled by such Act, and so "arises
under" it. Any doubts as to the correctness of this position 1 are resolved by the Act of January 20, 1914, c. 11,
38 Stat. 278, 28 U. S. C. § 71, regulating removal to the
federal courts of suits brought under the Carmack Amendment in the state courts.
After the Carmack Amendment a conflict of decisions
had developed in the lower federal courts on the question
whether suits for damages brought against interstate carriers under the amendment were suits "arising under" an
act regulating commerce, so that their removal from state
to federal district courts would be permitted. McGoon v.

Opinion of the Court.

sion in the McGoon case, sustaining removal jurisdiction
irrespective of the amount in controversy, was followed
by'the removal of many small suits against carriers to the
federal district courts. Congress ended this practice by
the Act of January 20, 1914, which forbade removal of suits
under the Carmack Amendment involving less than $3,000.
The report of the House Judiciary Committee on H. R.
9994, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. (which was the same in substance as'S. 3484, which became the 1914 law), expressly
recognized the effect and authority of the decision in the
McGoon case. In prohibiting removals where less than
$3,000 is in controversy, instead of imposing the $3,000
limitation directly-on all suits brought in the federalcourts
under the Carmack Amendment, Congress recognized that
such suits arise under a law regulating commerce within
the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 41 (8), and sanctioned the exercise of original jurisdiction by the district courts in such
cases. See H. Rep. No. 120, 63d Cong., 2d Sess.; also 51
Cong. Rec. 1327, 1544-1548.
Whether a suit arises under a law of the United States
must appear from the plaintiff's pleading, not the defenses
which may be interposed to, or be anticipated by it. Petitioner's pleading, which we have summarized, satisfies
this requirement, since it adequately discloses a present
controversy dependent for its outcome upon the construction of a federal statute. See Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, 152 U. S. 454; Louisville & Nashville Ry. Co. v.
Mottley, 211 U. S. 149; The Fairv.Kohler Die & Specialty
Co., 228 U. 8. 22, 25; Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U. S. 74;
