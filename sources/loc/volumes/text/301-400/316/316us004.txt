COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION.
ON CERTIFICATE FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No 508. Argued March 3, 1942.-Decided April 6, 1942.
Where, pursuant to the provisions of § 402 (b) of the Communications

Act of 1934, an appeal has been taken, to the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia, from an order of the
Federal Communications Commission, that court, in order to
preserve the status quo. pending appeal, has power to stay the
execution of the Commission's order from which the appeal was
taken, pending the determination of the appeal. P. 11.

In response to a question certified by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in respect of an appeal
from an order of the Federal Communications Commission
graniting permission to change the frequency and increase
the power of a radio station.
Mr. Paul M. Segal, with whom Mr. Harry P. Warner
was on the brief, for Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc.
Mr. Thomas E. Harris, with whom Solicitor General
Fahy and Messrs. H. G. Ingraham, Telford Taylor, Harry
M. Plotkin, and Max Goldman were on the brief, for the
Federal Communications Commission.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case is here on certificate from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Judicial Code § 239,
28 U. S. C. § 346. The question certified relates to the
power of the Court of Appeals to stay the enforcement
of an order of the Federal Communications Commission
pending determination of an appeal taken under § 402 (b)
of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 1093.

SCRIPPS-HOWARD RADIO v. COMM'N.

Opinion of the Court.

The circumstances which induced the Court to certify
the question are these: On October 10, 1939, the Commission granted without hearing the application of WCOL,
Inc., licensee of Station WCOL, Columbus, Ohio, for a
construction permit to change its frequency from 1210 to
1200 kilocycles and to increase its power from 100 to 250
watts. The appellant, Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc.,
which is the licensee of Station WCPO, Cincinnati, Ohio,
operating on a frequency of 1200 kilocycles with power
of 250 watts, filed a petition for "hearing or rehearing"
requesting the Commission to vacate its previous order
and set the WCOL application for hearing. The Commission denied this petition on March 29, 1940, and an
appeal followed. In its statement of "reasons for appeal," the appellant claimed that the Commission could
not lawfully grant the WCOL application without hearing; that in granting the application the Commission departed from its rules and standards of good engineering
practice; that the appellant was entitled to a hearing in
order to show that the Commission's action did not serve
the public interest since it would result in materially
reducing the coverage of Station WCPO and thereby deprive a substantial number of listeners of "the-only local
regional non-network service" available to them; and that
in granting the WCOL application without hearing, the
Commission violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment.
The appellant asked the Court of Appeals to stay the
Commission's order pending the disposition of its appeal.
Even though the Court "had consistently over a long
period of years, and without objection on the part of the
Commission, issued stay orders" in cases where such
orders were found to be necessary, the Coromission opposed the issuance of a stay, order in this case on the
ground that the Court was without power to grant-a stay.
The application was heard before the Court sitting with

three judges, which, with one judge dissenting, upheld the
Commission's contention. A motion for rehearing before
all six members of the Court was granted. The judges
being equally divided on the question of the Court's power
to grant a stay, the following question was certified to us:
"Where, pursuant to the~provisions of Section 402 (b)
of the Communications Act of 1934, an appeal has been
taken, to the United States Court of Appeals, from an
order of the Federal Communications Commission, does
the court, in order to preserve the status quo pending
appeal, have power to stay the execution of the Commission's order from which the appeal was. taken, pending
the determination of the appeal?"
The Commission suggests that the certificate should be
dismissed-because of the generality of the question. Lowden v. Northwestern Nat. Bank, 298 U. S.160. Read in
the light of the preliminary statement certifying the facts
which presented the question, Hill v. Wampler, 298 U. S.
460, 464, the question is limited to the type of order
made by the Commission in this case. It is therefore
sufficiently specific.
The Communications Act of 1934 is a hybrid. By that
Act Congress established a comprehensive system for the
regulation of communication by wire and radio. To secure
effective execution of its policy of making available "a
rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and
radio communication service with adequate facilities at
reasonable charges," Congress created a new agency, the
Federal Communications,.Commission, to which it entrusted authority previously exercised by several other
agencies. Under the Radio Act of 1927, 44 Stat. 1162,
the Federal Radio Commission had broad powers over
the licensing and regulatioi of radio facilities. The
Mann-Elkins Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 539, gave the Interstate
Commerce Commission general regulatory authority over
telephone and telegraph carriers. In addition, the Post-

master General was empowered, under the Post Roads Act
of 1866, 14 Stat. 221, to fix rates on government telegrams.'
The Communications Act of 1934 was designed to centralize this scattered regulatory authority in one agency. See
Message from the President to Congress, February 26,
1934, Sen. Doc. No. 144, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.; Seri. Rep.
No. 781, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1; H. Rep. No. 1850, 73d
Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 3-4.
The provisions for judicial review in the Act of 1934
reflect its mixed origins. Section 402 (a)' makes the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913,
38 Stat. 208, 219, pertaining to judicial review of orders
of the Interstate Commerce Commission, applicable to
"suits to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any
order of the Commission under this Act (except any order
oft.the Commission granting or refusing an application
foi a construction permit for a radio station, or for a radio
station license, or for renewal of an existing radio station
license, or for modification of an existing radio station
license)." 48 Stat. 1064, 1093. The Urgent Deficiencies
Act, which is thus incorporated in § 402 (a) of the Communications Act of 1934, provides for review in a specially
constituted district court, with direct appeal to this Court.
That Act authorizes the District Court, in cases "where
irreparable damage would otherwise ensue to the petitioner," to allow a temporary stay of the order under
review, subject to specified safeguards. 38 Stat. 208, 220.
'A summary of the authority vested in the Federal Radio Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Postmaster
General, and of the extent to which such authority was actually
exercised, is contained in Appendix A, Historical Background of the
Communications Act of 1934, of the Monograph of the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure dealing with the Federal, Communications Commission, Sen. Doc. No. 186, 76th Cong.,

3d Sess., pt. 3; see also Herring and Gross, Telecommunications, pp.
210-45.

Section 402 (b) of the Communications Act of 1934
provides for review' of the orders excepted from § 402
(a). It gives an appeal "from decisions of the Commission to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia
in any of the following cases: (1) By any applicant for a
construction permit for a radio station, or for a radio
station license, or for renewal of an existing radio station
license, or for modification Of an existing radio station
license, whose application is refused by the Commission.
(2) By any other person aggrieved or whose interests are
adversely affected by any decision of the Commission
granting or refusing such application." 48 Stat. 1064,
1093. This section follows § 16 of the Radio Act of 1927,
44 Stat. 1162, as amended in.1930,46 Stat. 844, the relevant
portions of which are set forth in the margin.2 See Sen.
Rep. No. 781, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 9; H. Report No.
1918, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 49-50; remarks of Senator
Dill, in charge of the measure in the Senate, 78 Cong. Rec.
8825, and of Representative Rayburn, who occupied the
same role in the House, 78 Cong. Rec. 10314.
Thus, in both the Radio Act of 1927 and the C6mmunications Act of 1934, orders granting or denying applications for construction permits or station licenses and for
renewal or modification of licenses were made reviewable
by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.'
""Any applicant for a construction permit, for a station license,
or for the renewal or modification of an existing station license whose
application is refused by the licensing authority shall have the right to
appeal from said decision to the Court of Appeals of the District
of Columbia. . . ." 44 Stai. 1162, 1169.
'Where the Commission revokes a station license or modifies a
license on its own motion, judicial review is "available only under
§ 402 (a) of the Communications Act. The reason for this differentiation appears in the following satement of Senator Dill, who
steered the bill in the Senate:
* "I desire to call attention to what I think is an important fact
to consider in this appeal provision. Those owners of radio broad-

Opinion of the Court.

And with respect to such appeals, both § 16 of the
Radio Act and §402 (b) of the Communications Act
were silent with respect to the power of the Court of
Appeals to stay orders pending appeal. It is upon this
silence in the Communications Act that the Commission
bases its contention, made for the first time when this
litigation arose in 1940, that the Court is without such
power.
No court can mate time stand still. The circumstances
surrounding a controversy may change irrevocably during
the pendency of an appeal, despite anything a court can do.
But within these limits it is reasonable that an appellate
court should be able to prevent irreparable injury to the
parties or to the public resulting from the premature enforcement of a determination which may later be found
to have been wrong. It has always been held, therefore,
that as part of its traditional equipment for the adminiscasting stations living long distances from the District of Columbia
should not be required to come to Washington to prosecute an appeal
from a decision for which they were not responsible. When I say
'were not responsible' I mean a decision which was granted against
them or affecting them when they did not bring the case into
court. .

.

. So we provide that where the decisions of the com-

mission are made in cases wherein the stations took no part in beginning the suits, appeal may be taken in the three-judge district courts
in the jurisdictions where the stations are located. But in the case
where the applicant for the license or the permit, or whatever it
may be, comes to the commission and asks for a change in his license
or asks for a new license, or asks for something to be done by the
commission, then if the commission makes a decision from which he
desires to appeal he must make his appeal in the courts of the
District of Columbia." 78 Cong. Rec. 8825-26. Cf. Sen. Rep. No.
781, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 9-10.
Section 16 of the Radio Act of 1927 provided for appeals from
revocation orders to either the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia or the District Court of the district in which the station
was located. 44 Stat. 1162, 1169.

tration of justice,' a federal court can stay the enforcement
of a judgment pending the outcome of an appeal. In re
Claasen, 140 U. S. 200; In re McKenzie, 180 U. S. 536.
Generally speaking, judicial review of administrative
orders is limited to determining whether errors of law have
been committed. Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United
States, 307 U. S. 125, 139-40. Because of historical differences in the relationship between administrative bodies
and reviewing courts and that between lower and upper
courts, a court of review exhausts its power when it lays
bare a misconception of law and compels correction.
FederalCommunicationsCommission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 144-45. If the administrative
agency has committed errors of law for the correction of
which the legislature has provided appropriate resort to
the courts, such judicial review would be an idle ceremony
if the situation were irreparably changed before the correction could be made. The existence of power in a
reviewing court to stay the enforcement of an administrative order does not mean, of course, that its exercise should
be without regard to the division of function which the
legislature has made between the administrative body and
the court of review. "A stay is not a matter of right,
even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the
appellant. In re Haberman Manufacturing Co., 147 U.
S. 525. It is an exercise of judicial discretion. The propriety of its issue is dependent upon the circumstances of
Section 262 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 377, empowers
the
federal courts "to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute,
which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions,
and agreeable to the us ages and principles of law." This provision
appeared in the very first Judiciary Act, 1 Stat. 73, 81-82. Compare
District of Columbia Code (1940 ed.) Title 11-208, authorizing the

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia "to issue all necessary
and proper remedial prerogative writs in aid of its appellate jurisdiction." 31 Stat. 1189, 1227.

the particular case." Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States,
272 U. S. 658, 672-73; see Merchants Warehouse Co. v.
United States, 283 U. S. 501, 513-14.
These controlling considerations compel the assumption
that Congress would not, without clearly expressing such
a purpose, deprive the Court of Appeals of its customary
power to stay orders under review. It is urged that such
a manifestation appears in the provisions for judicial review contained in the Communications Act of 1934.
Specifically, the Commission contends that since § 402 (a)
incorporates the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act
of 1913 which explicitly authorize and regulate the issuance of stay orders, the omission of any reference in § 402
(b) to a power to stay orders under review reflects a deliberate Congressional choice to deprive the Court of Appeals
of this power.
The search for significance in the silence of Congress is
too often the pursuit of a mirage. We must be wary
against interpolating our notions of policy in the interstices
of legislative provisions. Here Congress said nothing
about the power of the Court of Appeals to issue stay orders under § 402 (b). But denial of such power is not to
be inferred merely because Congress failed specifically
to repeat the general grant of auxiliary powers to the federal courts. The Commission argues that the silence of
Congress, in view of the legislative history of the Act and
the nature of the orders reviewable under the Act, qualifies
this general authority and is as commanding as if Congress
had expressly withheld from the Court of Appeals the
power to stay orders appealed under § 402 (b).
The legislative history can furnish no support for this
contention. Neither the committee reports nor the hearings nor the debates contain any reference to the power
to stay Commission orders on appeal. Significance is
found in H. R. 7716, 72d Congress, a bill which was passed
by both houses in 1933 but which failed of enactment be-

cause of a pocket veto. That bill proposed to amend § 16 of
the Radio Act of 1927 so as to vest concurrent jurisdiction
(with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia)
ox revocation cases in the circuit courts of appeals, rather
than in the district courts. The bill also provided that the
reviewing court, whether a circuit court of appeals or the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, could enter
a stay order "upon the giving of a bond by the party applying for the stay in such amount and with such terms and
conditions" as the court deemed proper.
It is suggested that if Congress had intended in the Act
of 1934 to authorize the Court of Appeals to issue stay
orders in appeals under § 402 (b), it would not have remained silent when only the year before it had attempted
to enact into law a specific provision conferring that power.
But H. R. 7716 and the Communications Act of 1934 were
not parallel legislative proposals. The former was not
a comprehensive legislative scheme for the unification of
federal regulatory authority over communications. It
proposed merely to amend the Radio Act of 1927 in several
minor particulars. See H. Rep. No. 221, 72d Cong., 1st
Sess., p. 7; Sen. Rep. No. 564, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 7;
Sen. Rep. No. 1004, 72d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 9. The enactment of the Communicatiohs Act of 1934, however, came
after a message to Congress from the President on February 26, 1934, recommending the creation of a single authority over communication by wire and radio. Sen. Doc. No.
144, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. Earlier in 1934 an. interdepartmental committee had made a study of the entire communications situation. Extensive public hearings on the
question of regulating the whole field of communications
were held by both the Senate and House Committees on
Interstate Commerce. It is obvious, therefore, that what
Congress undertook to do by the Communications Act of
1934 was entirely different from what it tried to do the
previous year in H. R. 7716.

We are told that in drafting §402 Congress had before it
and relied extensively upon H. R. 7716, and reference is
made to the citations to that bill in the statement of the
House managers. H. Rep. No. 1918, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.,
pp. 47-49. But whatever reliance was placed upon H. R.
7716 by the framers of the 1934 legislation was without
relation to its provisions for judicial review. For in that
same statement (p. 47) it is said that the "provisions of
the Radio Act of 1927 relating to judicial review have been
included" in the bill. And, as has previously been noted,
even though the Radio Act of 1927 contained no provisions
dealing with the authority of the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia to stay orders of the Commission
on appeal, the Court had been issuing stays as a matter
of course wherever they were found to be appropriate,
without objection by the Commission. Boston Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Radio Commission, 62 App. D. C.
299, 67 F. 2d 505, decided June 19, 1933.
It is indisputable that, at least since 1930, the Court of
Appeals has been staying orders both of the Federal Radio
Commission, under § 16 of the Radio Act of 1927, and of
the Federal Communications Commission, under §402 (b)
of the Communications Act of 1934, whenever stays were
regarded as necessary. To be sure, in only one case, the
Boston Broadcastingdecision, supra, did the Court of Appeals even refer to the granting of a stay order. The explanation is not hard to find. The power to stay was so
firmly imbedded in our judicial system, so consonant with
the historic procedures of federal appellate courts, that
there was no necessity for the Court of Appeals to justify
its settled practice.'
' As late as February 23, 1939, the Commission stated its position as

follows:

"The Commission has not opposed in the past, and does not

propose in the future to oppose the granting of a stay or such interlocutory restraining order by this court as may be necessary to protect
the appellate jurisdiction of the court or preserve the status quo pend-

316 U.S.

The considerations of policy which are invoked are as
fragile as the legislative materials are inapposite. It is
said that the nature of the orders' reviewable under
§ 402 (b) makes the grant of a stay order manifestly inappropriate since a stay would in effect involve the judicial
exercise of an administrative function. An example is
adduced of an appeal from an order denying an application
for a construction permit or a station license, or for modification or renewal of a license. Of course, no court can
grant an applicant an authorization which the Commission
has refused.. No order that the Court of Appeals could
make would enable an applicant to go on the air when the
Commission has denied him a license to do so. A stay of
an order denying an application would in the nature of
things stay nothing. It could not operate as an affirmative authorization of that which the Commission has refused to authorize. But this is no reason for denying the
Court the power to issue a stay in a situation where the
function of the stay is to avoid irreparable: injury to the
public interest sought to be vindicated by the appeal.
The Communications Act of 1934 did not create new
private rights. The purpose of the Act was to protect
the public interest in communications. By § 402 (b) (2)
Congress gave the right of appeal to persons "aggrieved
or whose interests are adversely affected" by Commission
action. 48 Stat. 1064, 1093. But these private litigants
have standing only as representatives of the public inter-est. Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders
Radio Station, 309 U. S. 470, 477. Compare National
Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, 309 U. S. 350, 362-63. That
ing determination of an appeal from an order of the Commission, in
any case where such a stay or restraining order appears reasonably to
be necessary or advisable." Opposition to Petition for Stay Order

Opinion of the Court.

a court is called upon to enforce public rights-and not the
interests of private property does not diminish its power
to protect such rights. "Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much farther both to give and withhold
relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are
accustomed to go when only private interests axe involved." Virginian Ry. Co. v. Federation,300 U. S. 515,
552. An historic procedure for preserving rights during
the pendency of an appeal is no less appropriate--unless
Congress has chosen to withdraw it-because the rights
to be:vindicated are those of the public and not of the private litigants. Unless Congress explicitly discloses such
an intention we should not lightly attribute to it a desire
to withhold from a reviewing court the power to save the
public interest from injury or destruction while an appeal
is being heard. To do so would stultify the purpose of
Congress to utilize the courts as a means for vindicating
the public interest. Courts and administrative agencies
are not to be regarded as competitors in the task of safeguarding the public interest. United States v Morgan,
307 U. S. 183, 190-91; Federal Communications Commission v. PottsvilleBroadcastingCo., 309 U. S. 134. Courts
no less than administrative bodies are agencies of government. Both are instruments for realizing public purposes.
It is urged that the orders reviewable under § 402 (a),
as to which the power to grant stays is undeniable, are
intrinsically different from those reviewable under § 402
(b). But while the two sections route appeals to different
courts, the differentiation was in large measure the product
of Congressional solicitude for the convenience of litigants.
It had no relation to the scope of the judicial function
which the courts were called upon to perform. For example, if the Commission on its own motion modifies a.
station license, review is had under § 402 (a) in the appropriate district court. However, if it grants an application
for modification of a license, an appeal lies under § 402

(b) to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Both cases give rise to the same kind of issues on appeal.
Both orders are equally susceptible of being stayed on
appeal. As the legislative history of the Act plainly
shows, Congress provided the two roads to judicial review
only to save a licensee the inconvenience of litigating an
appeal in Washington in situations where the Commission's order arose out of a proceeding not instituted by
the licensee. I
Judged by its own terms, its history, and the practice
under it; the Communications Act of 1934 affords no warrant for depriving the Court of Appeals of the conventional
power of an appellate court to stay the enforcement of an
order pending the determination ofan appeal challenging
its validity. Indirect light is sometimes cast upon legislation by provisions dealing with the same problem in
related enactments. No such light is shed here. The
numerous laws in which Congress has established administrative agencies for the exercise of its regulatory powers
do not disclose any general legislative policy regarding
the power to stay administrative orders pending review.
Some statutes are wholly silent; 7 some turn a court review
into an automatic stay; 8 some provide that the commencement of a suit shall not operate as a stay unless the court
specifically so provides;" some authorize the reviewing

court to grant a stay where necessary. 0 Significantly, the
recent Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 23,
explicitly denies the power of the reviewing court to enjoin
enforcement of the administrative orders.
The various enactments in which the staying power is
made explicit, as well as the statutes that are silent about
it, afford debating points but no reliable aids in construing
the Act before us. One thing is clear. Where Congress
wished to deprive the courts of this historic power, it
knew how to use apt Words-only once has it done so and
in a statute born of the exigencies of wax.
We conclude that Congress by § 402 (b) of the Communications Act of 1934 has not deprived the Court of
Appeals of the power to stay-a power as old as the judicial system of the nation. We do not of course go beyond
the question put to us. We merely recognize the existence of the power to grant a stay. We are not concerned
here with the criteria which should govern the Court in
exercising that power. Nor do we in any way imply that
a stay would or would not be warranted upon the showing
made by the appellant in this case.
The question certified to us is answered in the affirmative.

316 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
MR. Jus ic, DOUGLAS, dissenting:
Congress has provided through § 402 (a) of the Communications Act of 1934 that in appeals from certain
classes of orders of the Federal Communications Commission the appellate court may issue a stay. The order here
involved is of a class which is expressly excepted from
§ 402 (a). Sec. 402 (b), which provides for an appeal
from this class of order, contains no provision whatsoever
for a judicial stay. Where Congress in one section of an
Act has provided for a stay of certain orders but not of
others, it has not remained silent on the subject. It has
drawn a line. And that line should not be obliterated by
us, in absence of plain and compelling indications that the
purpose of Congress was different from what the face of
the statute reveals. There are no such reasons here.
The legislative history gives no comfort to the view of
the majority. In drafting § 402, Congress had before it
H. R. 7716, 72d Congress. That bill, designed to amend
the Radio Act of 1927, had been passed by both houses in
1933 but had failed of enactment because of a pocket veto.
Under § 16 (f) of that bill, orders of the type here in question could be stayed by the appellate court. Congress
relied extensively on that earlier bill in drafting § 402.
H. Rep. No. 1918, 73d Cong., 2nd Sess., pp. 47-49. If
Congress had intended the appellate court to have the
power to stay this type of order, it hardly seems likely,
as the Commission points out, that Congress would have
failed to include it, when, only the year before, it had
attempted to write into the statute a specific provision
conferring that power. But if we disregard that circumstance and turn to other parts of the legislative history,
there are no'indications that the line which Congress drew

between § 402 (a) and § 402 (b) was inadvertent or
accidental.
Nor are we justified in rewriting the statute to iron out
possible logical inconsistencies in the classification of
orders which Congress has made in § 402 (a) and § 402 (b).
If we were a legislative committee, perhaps we would not
retain in § 402 (a) orders which are made by the Commission on its own motion and which modify a station license,
since such orders if made pursuant to an application are
covered by § 402 (b). But to seize on that lack of symmetry here is to miss the forest for the trees. The nature
of the run of the orders excepted from the stay provisions
of §402 (a) demands respect for the words of the Act.
The instant case is a good illustration. Federal CommunicationsCommission v. SandersBros., 309 U. S. 470, holds
that a competitor such as appellant has no private property interest which may be protected on appeal. "The
policy of the Act is clear that no person is to have anything
in the nature of a property right as a result of the granting
of a license." Id., p. 475. Any injury to an existing station as is alleged here "is not a separate and independent
element to be taken into consideration by the Commission
in determining whether it shall grant or withhold a
license." Id., p. 476. Thus it is manifest that the failure
of Congress to extend the stay provisions of § 402 (a) to
the run of orders of this type makes sense. The Urgent
Deficiencies Act, which is incorporated into § 402 (a),
allows a temporary stay "where irreparable damage would
otherwise ensue to the petitioner." 38 Stat. 208, 220.
But where appeals under § 402 (b) (2), as in the instant
case, are not shown to involve private rights, analogies to
situations where the power to issue a stay is implied because irreparable damage may be done an appellant whose
individual interest has been unlawfully invaded are inapposite. For the same reason, statistics as to the presence
of this power in statutes of other administrative agencies

are irrelevant, in absence of a showing that in the precise
situations there involved no private rights were at stake.
And that leads to a related reason why it will not do to
lean on "the historic procedures of federal appellate
courts" so that an implied power to issue a stay in this
type of case may be found. "The office and jurisdiction
of a court of equity, unless enlarged by express statute,
are limited to the protection of rights of property." In
re Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200, 210. All constitutional questions aside (Muskrat v. United States, 219 U. S. 346), we
should require explicit, unequivocal authorization before
we permitted an appellant who has no individual substantive right at stake in the litigation to obtain a stay
to protect the public interest. Repeated attempts of
private litigants to obtain a special stake in public rights
have been consistently denied. See Massachusetts v.
Mellon, 262 U. S. 447; Sprunt & Son v. United States,
281 U. S. 249; Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U. S.
464; Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. Tennessee Valley
Authority, 306 U. S. 118; Atlanta v. Ickes, 308 U. S. 517;
Singer & Sons v. Union Pacific R. Co., 311 U. S. 295.
The attempt to obtain a stay is but another manifestation, albeit oblique, of that same endeavor. Hence, instead of starting from the premise that an "historic
power" to issue a stay in this type of case will be readily
implied, we should assume just the contrary. Not even
long acquiescence or approval on the part of the Commission should lead us to make such a departure from
those historic, accepted principles. For that reason
alone, § 402 (b) should be read narrowly and restrictively.
But it is said that Congress entrusted the vindication
of the public interest to private litigants. The Sanders
case, properly construed, merely means that the Court
of Appeals has jurisdiction of appeals by a "person aggrieved" or by one "whose interests are adversely affected" by the Commission's decision. § 402 (b). But

that does not mean that an appellant has a cause of
action merely because he has a competing station. Unless he can show that his individual interest has been
unlawfully invaded, there is merely damnum absque
injuria and no cause of action on the merits. Alabama
Power Co. v. Ickes, supra; Greenwood County v. Duke
Power Co., 81 F. 2d 986, 999. And see Duke Power Co.
v. Greenwood County, 302 UT. S. 485. Congress could
have said that the holder of a radio license has an individual substantive right to be free of competition resulting from the issuance of another license and causing
injury. In that event, unlike the situation in Muskrat
v. United States, supra,there would be a cause of action
for invasion of a substantive right. But as we said in
the Sanders case, Congress did not create such a substantive right. And no facts are shown here which would
bring this appeal outside the rule of that case. On that
assumption, I fail to see how an appeal statute constitutionally could authorize a person who shows no case
or controversy to call on the courts to review an order
of the Commission. A fortiori he would have no standing to obtain a stay.
Furthermore, the power to issue a stay in this type of
case cannot be found in the "all writs" statutes. Judicial
Code, § 262; District of Columbia Code (1940 ed.) Title
11-208. As we stated in Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville BroadcastingCo., 309 U. S. 134, the
relationship between the Court of Appeals and the Commission is not that of federal courts inter se. ". .. to assimilate the relation of these administrative bodies and the
courts to the relationship between lower and upper courts
is to disregard the origin and purposes of the movement for
administrative regulation and at the same time to disregard the traditional scope, however far-reaching, of the
judicial process. Unless these vital differentiations between the functions of judicial and administrative tri-

bunals are observed, courts will stray outside their province and read the laws of Congress through the distorting
lenses of inapplicable legal doctrine." p. 144. The Commission, not the courts, is the ultimate guardian of the
public interest under this Act. The appellate court is
limited to a correction of "errors of law." Id., p. 145. The
judgment of the Commission, not the court, determines
whether the public interest will be served by an application. Id., pp. 144-145. Hence, the power of the courts
in this situation to issue writs under the "all writs" statutes
should be limited to the protection of its jurisdiction. If,
as here, construction of a new station is completed pending appeal by another licensee, the court's jurisdiction is
not impaired, though we assume that it has jurisdiction
of the appeal and that appellant has a cause of action on
the merits. If the Commission has committed an error
of law, it must bow to the decree of the court and revise
its order. But to allow the court to go beyond that and
find an implied power to issue a stay in this type of case
is to distort the statutory scheme. 12 Air L. Rev. 224.
Jealous regard for the administrative role and function
in this field will leave to Congress any enlargement, within
constitutional limits, of the judicial power.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY joins in this dissent.
