CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH DISTRICT.

No. 947. Argued April 30, 1942.-Decided May 25, 1942.
Where, in a sale of real estate, current taxes, which are a lien on the
property and for which the vendor is personally liable under the state
law, are apportioned, so that the vendee pays the part proportional
to the fraction of the tax year ensuing after the purchase, the payment is not deductible by the vendee in his income tax return as "taxes
paid" within the meaning of § 23 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1936,
but is part of the purchase price. P. 397.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
During the years 1936 and 1937, respondents purchased
various parcels of real estate in Baltimore, Maryland. In
each instance, the state and city taxes on the real estate
for the current year. had not been paid at the time of

purchase. The various contracts provided far the apportionment of these current real estate taxes, respondents
agreeing to pay the amount of the taxes, and the vendors
undertaking to bear the burden of that portion of the taxes
arithmetically allocable to the fraction of the year that
had expired prior to the date of purchase. Adjustments
were accordingly made in the purchase prices to reflect this
arrangement.
Respondents paid the local authorities the full amounts
necessary to discharge the tax liability. In their 1936
and 1937 income tax returns, which were on the cash basis,
they ueducted that portion of those taxes "allocable" to
the periods after purchase. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled that the amounts in question' were not
deductible under § 23 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49
Stat. 1648, 1659,1 but instead were merely part of the cost
of the properties. Accordingly, he made a deficiency assessment which was paid under protest. This suit for refund followed. The District Court held the amounts were
deductible,2 and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed3 on
the authority of its previous decision in Commissioner v.
Rust's Estate, 116 F. 2d 636. We granted certiorari because of an asserted conflict with Lifson v. Commissioner,
98 F. 2d 508.
The question for decision is whether the amounts apporiloned by respondents on the basis of the fractions of the
taxable years remaining after the several purchases, constitute "taxes paid within the taxable year" within the

The guiding principle for determining whether a payment satisfying a tax liability is a !'tax paid" within the
meaning of § 23 (c) is furnished by the applicable Treasury
regulation, which states that "In general taxes are deductible only by the person upon whom they are imposed."'

pp. 23-24.
To illustrate concretely the workings of the Maryland
tax system with respect to respondents' purchases, the
property bought on May 10, 1936, may be taken as typical
of all the other transactions. The assessment date, or
"date of finality," for both state and city taxes was October
1, 1935.1- These taxes were for the calendar year 1936 'and
'Article 23 (c)-1 of Treasury Regulations 94, promulgated under the
Revenue Act of 1936. This is a regulation of long standing. See
Treasury Regulations 86, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1934,
Article 23 (c)-l; Treasury Regulations 77, promulgated under the
Revenue Act of 1932, Article 151; Treasury Regulations 74, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1928, Article 151; Treasury Regulations 69, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1926, Article 131;
Treasury Regulations 65, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1924,
Article 131.
'Ann. Code of Maryland (Flack, 1939), Vol. 2, Art. 81, § 26 (b), provides that state and local taxes shall have the same date of finality as is
provided by local law, and the date of finality for Baltimore with respect

became due and payable on January 1, 1936,' although the
default date for city taxes was not until July 1, 1936, and
for state taxes January 1, 1937.8 Both the state and the
city had liens against the property from the due date,
January 1, 19362 And, respondents' vendor became personally liable for these taxes before the sale. An action of
assumpsit could have been, brought against him for the
taxes at any time after the due date.' ° Had he sold the
property between October 1, 1935 and January 1, 1936, he
apparently would still have remained personally liable,
and if he had gone into bankruptcy after such sale the taxing authorities would have had a provable claim against
him. In re Wells, 4 F. Supp. 329; cf. Baltimore v. Perrin,
178 Md. 101, 107, 12 A. 2d 261.
It is thus apparent that tax liens had attached against
the properties and that respondents' predecessors in title
had become personally liable for the taxes prior to any of
the purchases. The attachment of a lien for taxes against
property before its sale has been held to prohibit the vento any tax year is October 1 of the preceding year. See Code, Public

dee from deducting, as "taxes paid," amounts paid by
him to discharge this liability. Lifson v. Commissioner,
98 F. 2d 508; Walsh-McGuire Co. v. Commissioner,97 F.
2d 983; Merchants Bank Bldg. Co. v. Helvering, 84 F. 2d
478; Helvering v. Missouri State Life Ins. Co., 78 F. 2d
778, 781. A tax lien is an encumbrance upon the land,
and payment, subsequent to purchase, to discharge a preexisting lien is no more the payment of a tax in any proper
sense of the word than is a payment to discharge any other
encumbrance, for instance a mortgage. It is true that respondents here could not have retained the properties unless the taxes were paid, but it is also true that they could
not retain them without paying the purchase price. It is
no answer therefore to say that the property was burdened
with the taxes and that respondents became obligated to
pay them. There was a burden, but it was contractually
assumed. In discharging this assumed obligation respondents were not paying taxes imposed upon them within
the meaning of § 23 (c). For "only the person owning the
property at that time [i.e., when the tax lien attaches] is
subjected .to the burden which the law imposes; and only
the person who has been thus subjected to the burden of
the tax is entitled to a deduction for paying it. Payment
by a subsequent purchaser is not the discharge of a burden
which the law has placed upon him, but is actually as well
as theoretically a payment of purchase price; for, after the
lien attaches and the taxing authority becomes pro tanto
an owner of an interest in the property, payment of the
tax by a purchaser is nothing but a part of the payment
for unencumbered title." Judge Parker, dissenting in
Commissionerv. Rust's Estate,116 F. 2d 636, 641.
Furthermore, respondents paid taxes for which their
vendors were personally liable. This was clearly the payment of a tax imposed upon another and therefore not
deductible by respondents. Cf. Walsh-McGuire Co. v.
Commissioner, 97 F. 2d 983; Gatens Investment Co. v.

MAGRUDER v. SUPPLEE.
394

Opinion of the Court.

Commissioner, 36 B. T. A. 309; Kohlsaat v. Commissioner,
40 B. T. A. 528. And see Commissioner v. Coward, 110 F.
2d 725, 727.
Thus either a pre-existing tax lien or personal liability
for the taxes on the part of a vendor is sufficient to foreclose a subsequent purchaser, who pays the amount necessary to discharge the tax liability, from deducting such
payment as a "tax paid." Where both lien and personal
liability coincide, as here, there can be no other conclusion than that the taxes were imposed on the vendors.
Respondents simply paid their vendors' taxes; they cannot deduct the amounts, or any portion thereof, paid to
discharge liabilities so firmly fixed against their predecessors in title by the laws of Maryland.
The view of the court below that the parties' contractu&l arrangement for apportionment of the tax burden
was controlling is untenable." Parties cannot change the
incidence of local taxes by their agreement. And it is,
misleading to speak of real estate taxes as "applicable"
to the fractional part of a tax period following purchase.
Such taxes are simply one form of raising revenue for
the support of government. They are not like rent, nor are
they paid for the privilege of occupying property for any
given period of time.
The judgment below is
Reversed.

The opinion below was a per curiam affirmance on the authority
of Commissioner v. Rust's Estate, 116 F. 2d 636. The Court there
relied on the fact that the parties had agreed to apportion the tax
obligation. p. 640.
