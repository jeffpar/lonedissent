Code. The judgment here in question meets that test.
The claim against respondent on the promissory note was
unrelated to the claim on the contract not to change the
will. Those two claims arose out of wholly separate and
distinct transactions or engagements. And the question
as to Hamer's liability to account to petitioner would arise
only in the event that the claim on the contract not to
change the will was sustained. Hence no question is presented here as respects the appealability of a judgment
dismissing a complaint as to one of several defendants
alleged to be jointly liable on the same claim. See Hunteman v. New Orleans Public Service, Inc., 119 F. 2d 465.
After the entry of the judgment on Count II, the claim
based on the contract not to change the will was terminated
and could not be affected by any action which the Court
might take as respects the remaining claims. Nothing
remained to be done except appeal.
The judgment therefore was final.

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

316 U. S.

I
We are of opinion that petitioner, the Seminole Nation,
is entitled to no additional allowance on Items One, Three,
and Four of its claim.
Item One.
This item is a claim for $61,563.42, based on Article VIII
of the Treaty of August 7, 1856, 11 Stat. 699, 702, whereby
the Government promised the Seminole Nation:
"to provide annually-for ten years the sum of three thousand dollars for the support of schools; two thousand dollars for agricultural assistance; and two thousand two
hundred dollars for the support of smiths and smith
shops . . ."
The Court of Claims found that Congress annually made
the necessary appropriation of $7,200 to discharge this
obligation during the fiscal years from 1858 to 1867, inclusive; that only $10,436.58 was actually expended for
the purposes specified in the Treaty; and that the balance
($61,563.42) was diverted and disbursed by the Government prior to June 30, 1866, for the purpose of clothing
and feeding refugee and destitute Indians driven from
their homes during the Civil War because of their loyalty
to the Union.
Petitioner's claim to the diverted balance was properly
disallowed because petitioner released its claim by Article VIII of the Treaty of March 21, 1866, 14 Stat. 755,
759, which provides:
"The stipulations of this treaty are to be a full settlement
of all claims of said Seminole nation for damages and
losses of every kind growing out of the late rebellion, and
all expenditures by the United States of annuities in
clothing and feeding refugee and destitute Indians since

SEMINOLE -NATION v. U. S.
286

Opinion of the Court.

the diversion of annuities for that purpose, consequent
upon the late war with the so-called confederate states.
And the Seminoles hereby ratify and confirm all such
diversions of annuities heretofore made from the funds of
the Seminole nation by the United States. And the
United States agree that no annuities shall be diverted
from the objects for which they were originally devoted
by treaty stipulations with the Seminoles, to the use of
refugee and destitute Indians, other than the Seminoles
or members of the Seminole nation, after the close of the
present fiscal year, June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and
sixty-six."
It is unnecessary to consider petitioner's contention that
by this Article it did not ratify the diversions in question because they were made from the funds of the United
States and not from funds of the Seminole Nation. The
first sentence of Article VIII of Treaty of 1866, quoted
above, constitutes a release to the United States of all
expenditures of annuities diverted for the purpose of
clothing and feeding refugee, Indians. There is no requirement that the annuities there referred to, must be
derived "from the funds of the Seminole nation," and
there is no indication that the releases contained in -the
first sentence of Article VIII are dependent upon the
ratification contained in the second sentence. The payments due the Seminole Nation under Article VIII of the
Treaty of 1856 clearly come within the scope of the release-being annual payments, they were annuities, and
they were diverted for the purpose of clothing and feeding refugee Indians.
Item Three.
This claim for $61,347.20 grows out of Article III of the
Treaty of 1866, in which the Government agreed to estab-

lish %$50,000 trust fund for the Seminole Nation and to
pay thereon annual interest of 5% ($2,500) for the support of schools.
During the period from 1867 to 1874, the Government
only partially discharged this annual obligation, disbursing only $16,902.80 of the $20,000 appropriated for that
purpose. It is here Undisputed that, as the Court of
Claims held, petitioner is entitled to the deficiency of
$3,097.20.
The Court of Claims correctly disallowed the balance of
this Item. During the twenty-three years from 1875 to
1898, the annual payments, amounting in all to $57,500,
were paid directly to the tribal treasurer. Since that official disbursed annually not less than $2,500 in excess of
amounts he was otherwise obligated to expend for the
maintenance of schools,' there is no need to inquire
whether payment to that official was authorized. The
schools actually received the benefit of the money. That
satisfied the obligation of the Treaty and defeats
recovery.
The remainder of this Item, $750, was paid to the
United States Indian Agent for the Seminoles in 1907.
Such payment was proper under § 11 of the Act of April
26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, 141,' and nothing in the
'Petitioner does not question this finding of the Court of Claims.

the part of Congress to override or repeal the Act of 1906.
Item Four.
The Government agreed in Article VI of the Treaty of
1866 to construct, "at an expense not exceeding ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, suitable agency buildings" on the
Seminole reservation. In 1870 and 1872, $931.76 was
expended for agency buildings and repairs. Petitioner's
claims for the difference of $9,068.24 between this sum
and $10,000 is without merit. -In 1872, Congress apfropriated $10,000 to fulfill this treaty obligation; $9,030.15 of
this appropriation was expended for some undisclosed
purpose, as. only $969.85 was returned to surplus. The
Court of Claims found that an agency building was erected
on the Seminole reservation in 1873.10 Petitioner makes
no claim that the building erected was unsuitable. Since
the Government's promise was not to expend $10,000, but
to erect suitable buildings at a cost not in excess of $10,000,
it follows that there was no violation of the treaty provision, and hence no right of recovery.

I
With respect to Items Two and-Five we are of opinion
that the cause rust be remanded to the Court of Claims
for further mat zrialfindings of fact.
Item Two.
This is a claim for $154,551.28 based on one of the provisions of Article VIII of the Treaty of 1856, namely, the

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

316 U. S.

Government's promise to establish a $500,000 trust fund
(originally two funds of $250,000 each), the annual interest therefrom ($25,000) to be paid over to the members
of the Seminole Nation per capita as an annuity. The
findings of the Court of Claims show that, although Congress appropriated $25,000 annually for each of the fiscal
years in controversy (1867-1898, 1907-1909), the Government did in fact fail to make direct per capita disbursements of a portion of the funds appropriated in 1867-1874,
1876, and 1879, the underpayments for those years totalling $92,051.28, and that one-half the appropriation in
1907 and the entire appropriation in 1908 and 1909 ($62,500 in all), instead of being paid directly to the individual
Seminoles, was paid to the United States Indian Agent for
the Seminole Nation.
The Court of Claims reduced petitioner's claim for
$154,551.28, based on these underpayments and alleged
mispayments, to $13,501.10, allowing the Government
three setoffs, consisting of (a) overpayments of $12,127.54
made in 1875, 1877, 1880, 1882, and 1883; (b) payment
of $62,500 made to the United States Indian Agent for
the Seminoles in 1907, 1908, and 1909; and (c) payments
of $66,422.64 made pursuant to requests of the Seminole
General Council during the period from 1870 to 1874.
The overpayments were rightly deducted, cf. Wisconsin Central R. Co. v. United States, 164 U. S. 190, and
petitioner does not contend otherwise. Nor is petitioner
entitled to any part of the $62,500 paid directly to the
Indian Agent, for such payments were proper under the
Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 137, 141, which, as pointed out in
the discussion of Item Three, ante, was not repealed by
the jurisdictional act, 43 Stat. 133. There is thus left
for consideration only the payments from 1870 to 1874
made pursuant to requests of the Seminole General Council and totalling $66,422.64; of this amount, $37,500 was

SEMINOLE NATION v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

paid directly to the tribal treasurer, and the remaining
$28,922.64 to designated creditors.
The Government contends that, since those payments
were made at the request of the tribal council, the governing body of a semiautonomous political entity, possessing the power to enter into treaties and agreements
with the United States, the tribe is not now entitled to
receive payment a second time; and that, despite the fact
that the Treaty of 1856 provided that the payments were
to be made per capita for the benefit of each individual
Indian, these payments at the request of the General
Council discharged the treaty obligation, because the
agreement was one between the United States and- the
Seminole Nation and not one between the United States
and the individual members of the tribe.
The argument for the Government, however sound it
might otherwise be, fails to recognize the impact of -certain equitable considerations and the effect of the fiduciary
duty of the Government to its Indian wards. The jurisdictional act, 43 Stat. 133, expressly confers jurisdiction
on the Court of Claims to adjudicate "all legal and
equitable claims," arising under treaty or statute, which
the Seminole Nation may have against the United States,
and the second amended petition avers:
"That since the passage of said Act of April 15, 1874, it
was reported by the officers of defendant [the United
States] that the Seminole tribal officials were misappropriating the Seminole tribal funds entrusted to them, and robbing the members of the tribe of an equal share of the
tribal income. That the reports of the Dawes Commission
show conclusively that the governments of the Five
Civilized Tribes were notoriously and incurably corrupt,
that every branch of the service was infested with favoritism, graft, and crookedness, and that by such methods
the tribal officers acquired large fortunes, while the other

members entitled to share in the tribal income received
little benefit therefrom."
It is a well established principle of equity that a third
party who pays money to a fiduciary for the benefit of the
beneficiary, with knowledge that the fiduciary intends to
misappropriate the money or otherwise be false to his
trust, is a participant in the breach of trust and liable
therefor, to the beneficiary. Cf. Duncan v. Jaudon 15
Wall. 165; Manhattan Bank v. Walker, 130 U. S. 267.
See Bogert, Trusts.and Trustees (1935), vol. 4, §§ 901, 955;
Scott, Trusts (1939), vol. 3, § 321.1; American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Trusts (1935), § 321.
The Seminole General Council, requesting the annuities
originally intended for the benefit of the individual members of the tribe, stood in a fiduciary capacity to them.
Consequently, the payments at the request of the Council
did not discharge the treaty obligation if the Government,
for this purpose the officials administering Indian affairs
and disbursing Indian moneys, actually knew that the
Council was defrauding the members of the Seminole
Nation.
Furthermore, this Court lias recognized the distinctive
obligation of trust incumbent upon the Government in
its dealings with these dependent and sometimes exploited people. E. g., Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet.
1; United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375; Choctaw
Nation v. United States, 119 U. S. 1; United States v.
Pelican, 232 U. S. 442; United States v. Creek Nation,
295 U. S. 103; Tulee v. Washington, 315 U. S. 681. In
carrying out its treaty obligations with the Indian tribes,
the Government is something more than a mere contracting party. Under a humane and self imposed policy which
has found expression in many acts of Congress11 and
" There .is no better eixmpTe l'. ths lian' the facts of the instant

Opinion of the Court.

numerous decisions of this Court, it has charged itself
with. moral obligations of the highest responsibility and
trust. Its conduct, as disclosed in the acts of those who
represent it in dealings with the Indians, should therefore
be judged by the most exacting fiduciary standards.
Payment of funds at the request of a tribal council which,
to the knowledge of the Government officers charged with
the administration of Indian affairs and the disbursement
of funds to satisfy treaty obligations, was composed of
representatives faithless to their own people and without
integrity would be a clear breach of the Government's
fiduciary obligation. If those were the circumstances,
either historically notorious so as to be judicially noticed
or otherwise open to proof, when the $66,422.64 was paid
over at the request of the Seminole General Council
during the period from 1870 to 1874, the Seminole Nation
is entitled to recover that sum, minus such amounts as
were actually expended for the benefit of the Nation by
the Council.
Having formulated the proper rule of law, we must
examine the facts of this case. Although the Court of

Seminole Nation may have against the United States. And after
an adverse decision by this Court on jurisdictional grounds, 299 U. S.

nAs was well said by Chief Judge (later Mr. Justice) Cardozo in
Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N. Y. 458, 464, 164 N. E. 545, 546:
"Many forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for those
acting at arm's length, are forbidden to those bound by fiduciary
ties. A trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the
market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the
most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior. As to this there

has developed a tradition that is unbending and inveterate. Uncompromising rigidity has been the attitude- of courts of equity when
petitioned to undermine the rule of undivided loyalty by the 'disintegrating erosion' of particular exceptions. . . . Only thus has the
.level of conduct for fiduciaries been kept at a level higher than that
trodden by the crowd:"

Claims had jurisdiction of this issue, for such an action for
breach of fiduciary duty growing out of treaty obligations
is clearly an equitable claim within the meaning of the
jurisdictional act, 43 Stat. 133, the court did not consider,
and hence made no findings on this issue. We think the
issue material. During the period in question, 1870-1874,
the administration of Indian affairs and the disbursement
of Indian moneys were lodged with the Department of the
Interior. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the
general supervision of the Secretary of the Interior, actively supervised these matters.' There are ample indications in the record before us that the Seminole General
Council was mulcting the Nation and that the proper Government officials may well have had knowledge thereof at
the time some; at least, of the payments were rnade. For
about this time the Commissioner of Indian Affairs received several warnings from his subordinates that "injustice to the majority" of the Seminoles existed, 14 that the
chiefs were in the habit "of taking out what amount they
See R. S. §§ 441,444, 445,463, 464, 2089. Cf. Act of April 15, 1874,
c.97, 18 Stat. 29.
On December 6, 1869, the United States Indian Agent for the Seminoles wrote to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs as follows:
"I would state that they are in the habit of calling Councils, for any
little thing that may arise, and spending from 2 to 15 days without
effecting anything whatever, which would be of the least service to the
nation [Seminole], except in expending the funds; which are taken
out of those ordered paid per 'cajita' to the nation.
" find that it has been the custom heretofore for the Chiefs to order
how the payment should be made, but at the same time making return
to the department, upon rolls as if it had been paid per 'capita'.
"I think that it is an injustice to the majority of the people, comprising this nation and the only-way to avoid unnecessary expenditure
of money for Councils, etc. which are of but little benefit to the nation
(for example the last council held cost the nation $700.00 for edibles
alone and did no. business) is for the department to give special orders
in reference as to what amount shall be turned over to the chiefs and
the balance paid to heads of families in person."

chose" from the annuities," that the Seminoles were "in
bad hands," 16 and that the chiefs intended "to 'gobble' the
next money for the purpose of keeping up their government." " And the Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs
was evidently aware, in 1872, of the possibility that the
Council was faithless, for he declined to change the method
of payment at the request of the Seminole Chiefs "until the
" In his annual report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, dated
September 1, 1870, the United States Indian Agent for the Seminoles

said:
"Per capita payments are, in some instances, I think, a great evil;
but as the system cannot be abolished, this nation [Seminole] having
no constitutional government, and until such a form of government be'
adopted, I would recommend that the provisions of the treaty be
rigidly enforced, and no moneys allowed to be paid except to the heads
of families. Heretofore, as I have reported, the chiefs have been in
the habit of taking out what amount they chose, allowing the balance
to be paid per capita. This is an injustice, as few receive the bulk of
their annuities." Report of the Secretary of the Interior, 41st Cong., 3d
Sess. (1870-71), vol. 1, pp. 766-767.
"The report of John P. C. Shanks, Special Commissioner, to the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, dated August 9, 1875, states:
"These claims are enormous inamount, and show too clearly that
the Seminoles are in bad hands. These parties who had these claims
(except Harjo, who is an assignee) are or have been officials in the Nation. Robert Johnson is a negro, and is interpreter to the Chief;
Chupco is present chief; John Jumper was former chief; James Factor, a half breed, is treasurer; E. J. Brown is a white man, formerly
U. S. Indian Agcnt of the Seminole Nation, since has had the address
to procure his admission as a member of the tribe.
"These men have evidently stood together in the wrong, of procuring such allowances, and did stand together in refusing to relinquish

upon claims which did not bear interest."
"On November 20, 1S78, special agent Meacham wrote the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that "Some of the Band Chiefs are tyrants
and despots, holding their people under abject fear and in some
instances of actual servitude." The letter also referred to the intention
of the Chiefs "to 'gobble' the next. money for the purpose of keeping up
their government."

We do not say that all this establishes liability on the
part of the Government, for it is not our function, in reviewing judgments of the Court of Claims, to make basic
findings of fact. When the Court of Claims fails to make
findings on a material issue, it is proper to remand the
case for such findings. Cf. UniversalBattery Co. v. United
States, 281 U. S. 580, 584-585. We do think, however,
that the matter outlined above was sufficient to require the
Court of Claims to make findings on this material issue,
that is, findings as to whether the Seminole General Council, during the years 1870 to 1874, was corrupt, venal, and
false to its trust; whether the appropriate Government
officials, charged with the duty of administering Indian
affairs and disbursing funds to the Seminoles, knew of that
corruption, venality, and faithlessness, if such in fact existed, when any of the payments in question were made
at the request of the Council; and, if so, whether the
Nation received the benefit of any of those payments.
Accordingly, this phase of the case must be remanded
so that the Court of Claims can.consider such relevant evidence and other data as may be brought to its attention,
make the necessary findings of fact, and thus determine
whether this case fits into the rule which we have
enunciated.
On January 5, 1872, the Acting Commissioner of' Indian Affairs
wrote the United States Indian Agent for the Seminoles:
"In reply to your letter of the 20 Dee. last, and to th request of the
Seminole Chiefs that their National funds be hereafter paid to the
Treasurer of the Nation instead of per capita, I have to say that, it is
not deemed advisable to change the manner in which payment of annuities to these Indians has heretofore been made until the Department
shall be fully satisfied that a proper disposition Will be made of the
funds if paid in the manner proposed by the Chiefs."

Opinion of the Court.

Item Five.
This is a claim for the moneys, $864,702.58 in all, paid
to the Seminole tribal treasurer after the passage of the
Curtis Act of June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat. 495, 502. The
payments were made during the fiscal years 1899 to 1907
and consisted of the following items: (a) $212,500 paid to
discharge the per capita obligation under Article VIII of
the Treaty of 1856 (see Item Two, ante); (b) $29,750 paid
to discharge the obligation of Article III of the Treaty of
1866 providing for the support of schools (see Item Three,
ante) and for the support of the Seminole Government,;
(c) $622,156.87 paid pursuant to § 12 of the Act of March
2, 1839, c. 412, 25 Stat. 980, 1004, providing for the payment of interest at five per centum per annum on
$1,500,000 "to be paid semi-annually to the treasurer of
said nation"; and, (d) $295.71, the "proceeds of labor."
Section 19 of the Curtis Act, 30 Stat. 495, 502, provides:
"That no payment of any moneys on any account whatever shall hereafter be made by the United States to
any of the tribal governments or to any officer thereof
for disbursement, but payments of all sums to members
of said tribes shall be made under direction of the Secretary of the Interior by an officer appointed by him; and
per capita payments shall be made direct to each individual in lawful money of the United States, and the same
shall not be liable to the payment of any previously contracted obligation."
Petitioner insists that this section prohibited the Government from making the payments in question to the
Seminole treasurer, and that it is entitled to recover the
sums illegally so paid.
Assuming, without deciding, that § 19 is applicable
.to the Seminole Nation and that an action could be
brought by the Nation for payments made in violation
thereof, there can be no recovery here because none of

the payments contravened § 19. The text of that sectionand its legislative history demonstrate that it prohibits
only payments to tribal officers which are "for disbursement"-i. e., payments to be distributed by them to
members of the tribe. If the first clause of § 19 is construed as prohibiting all payments to the tribe or its
officers, then the later clauses, providing only for payments to members and per capita payments, are inadequate to dispose of the problems raised by the first
clause. For then no provision is made for the expenses
of maintaining and conducting the tribal government,
despite the fact that the Seminole tribal government
was not only to continue after the Curtis Act but was
in fact relieved of the necessity of securing Presidential
approval of its legislation " by an agreement ratified
three days after the passage of that statute. See 30
Stat. 567, 569. Section 19, as originally introduced in
the House, provided that payments of "all expenses incurred in transacting their business" were to be made
under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. 2°
The deletion of this clause is persuasive that Congress intended that tribal officers should retain the right to disburse their funds for the expenses of their respective
tribal governments. For these reasons we think § 19
prohibits payment by the Government to the tribal
19
Act of June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 62, 84.
19, as originally introduced, was as follows:
that no payment of any moneys on any account whatever shall
hereafter be made to any of the tribal governments or to any officer
thereof for disbursement, but payments of all expenses incurred in
transacting their business and of all sums to members of said tribes
shall be made under direction of the Secretary of the Interior by an
officer appointed by him; and per capita payments shall be made
direct to each individual in lawful money of the United States, and
the same shall not be liable to the payment of any previously contracted obligation.'? [Italics supplied.] H. R. 8581, 55th Cong.,

treasurer only when such payments are to be distributed
by him to members of the tribe. It has no application to
money earmarked for educational or tribal purposes, and
money intended for any purpose the tribe may
designate.
None of the payments in question were for disbursement to the individual members of the Seminole Nation.
While the sum of $212,500 was paid pursuant to Article
VIII of the Treaty of 1856, and while that obligation
was originally an annuity payable per capita to the individual Seminoles, the character and purpose of this
interest payment were by agreement changed into a payment for the benefit of the Seminole Nation itself, and
this before the payment of the $212,500 from 1899 to
1907. The Act of April 15, 1874, c. 97, 18 Stat. 29,
authorized the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, with the
sanction of the Secretary of the Interior and the President,
to pay this annuity into the treasury of the Seminole
Nation, provided $5,000 was annually appropriated out
of the annuity by the General Council for the school fund,
and provided "that the consent of said tribe to such
expenditures and payment shall be first obtained." By
act of the Seminole General Council on April 2, 1879, the
Seminole Nation accepted the provisions of the Act of
1874, and consented that all annuities due or to become due
under Article VIII of the Treaty of 1856 should be paid
into the Seminole treasury, to be used as the tribal council
should provide. This was a consensual conversion of the
Government's obligation from payments to individuals
to payments to the tribe, and § 19 of the Curtis Act is
inapplicable to the $212,500 paid pursuant to this. converted agreement.
While none of the payments were in violation of § 19
of the Curtis Act and there can therefore be no recovery
on that score, the Government is not necessarily relieved
of all liability for this $864,702.58 claim. There remains

for consideration the fiduciary duty of the Government,
as discussed in Item Two, ante. During this period, 1899
to 1907 as from 1870 to 1874, the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs supervised
Indian matters and the disbursement of Indian moneys.
Apparently, it was the practice of the Department of
the Interior to deposit the Seminole funds with the Assistant Treasurer of the United States at St. Louis to the
credit of the tribal treasurer; the Indian agent for the
Five Civilized Tribes did not disburse the Seminole payments although he did distribute moneys to the other
tribes.' Shortly before the payments in question were
made, the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes 22
pointedly described in its annual reports to the Secretary
of the Interior and Congress the unbridled corruption of,
the various tribal governments, without singling out.
any particular government for unenviable distinction.
Thus:

"Corruption of the grossest kind, openly and unblushingly practiced, has found its way into every branch of
the service of the tribal governments. All branches of the
governments are reeking with it, and so common has it
become that no attempt at concealment is thought necessary. The governments have fallen into the hands of
a few able and energetic Indian' citizens, nearly all mixed
blood and adopted whites, who have so administered their
affairs and have enacted such laws that they are enabled

Commonly known as the Dawes Commission. It was created
by the Act. of March 3, 1893, c. 209, 27 Stat. 612, 64.5, to negotiate
with the Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles for

to appropriate to their own exclusive use almost the entire
property of the Territory of any kind that can be rendered
profitable and available." 23
And again:
"The Commission is compelled by the evidence forced
upon them during their examination into the administration of the so-called governments in this Territory to report that these governments in all their branches are
wholly corrupt, irresponsible, and unworthy to be longer
trusted with the care and control of the money and other
property of Indian citizens, much less their lives, which
they scarcely pretend to protect." 24
While these warnings were of a general nature, specific
complaints of misgcvernment, venality, and fraudulent
conduct on the part of the Seminole leaders were brought
to the attention of the Secretary of the Interior and the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs. By a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, dated January 24, 1898, certain
Seminoles remonstrated against the ratification of the
agreement concluded with the Seminole leaders on Decefliber 16, .1897. The remonstrance alleged misgovernment and the participation by these leaders in a land
swindle at the expense of the tribe. The Secretary laid
this protest before Congress.25 During much of the period

in question, 1899-1907, and for some time prior thereto,
two half-breed brothers were principal chief and treasurer,
respectively, of the Seminole Nation. Together they ran
a trading store in the Seminole country and extended
credit by giving due bills, good only in trade at their
store, to individual Seminoles in the amount of annuities
or other payments owing those individuals. The activities of thes6 brothers, and their system of credit in particular, were attacked on the floor of Congress in 1896
and 1897,26 and severely criticized by an investigator for

of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, dated

"We beg leave to state further that we have no law regulating

This report stated in part:
"It is not too much to say that, in view of the ignorance of these
Indians, this system of credit is dishonest. It should be condemned
because it keeps these Indians in a constant state of poverty. They
do not realize that these due bills are in fact money, and the result
is that they are squandered without care. I am not informed 'as to
whether the Department of the Interior has knowledge of this state
of affairs. It should be brought to its attention, so that, if possible,
it may take steps looking to the breaking up of the system, which can

All this tends to show that the Seminole tribal officers
might have beenfaithless to their trust during the period
in question, and that the Government officials administering Indian affairs and disbursing Seminole funds might
have been aware of that faithlessness at the time payments
were made to the Seminole treasurer. Here again the
Court of Claims did not address itself to, and made no
findings on, this material issue. As we said in the discussion of Item Two, ante, it is not our function to make
basic findings of fact. Again, we do not say that the
showing with respect to this Item establishes breach of
the Government's fiduciary obligation, but we are of
opinion that it is sufficient to justify remanding this branch
of the case to the Court of Claims for further findings, in
the light of such evidence as may be brought to its attenbe done by having the appropriations distributed in some other manner."
Win. L. Bowie, Special Investigator for the Interior Department,
reported to the Superintendent for the Five Civilized Tribes in 1916
that:
"Governor Brown and his brother have been in the mercantile business in the Seminole Nation for many years. It is a fact much commented upon by those acquainted with Seminole tribal affairs, that
for a number of years Governor Brown held the dual relationship to
the members of the Seminole tribe of governor and paymaster on
the one hand, and Indian trader on the other hand."
"... In my opinion, Governor Brown has shown in his transactions
with John Smith and Lizzie Yahola, that lie has little regard for
the welfare and protection of the Indians in general, and it is unfortunate that he occupies a position which enables him by reason
of the confidence placed in him as such official to impose upon
them."
On the basis of reports from subordinates Assistant Commissioner
of Indian Affairs Merrit recommended to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, by a letter dated July 20, 1916, that the Seminole tribal
government be abolished as "the only way to prevent Brown and Crain
from continuing to use their official positions to advance their personal interests at the expense of the Indians under their authority."

tion, as to whether the Seminole tribal officers were mulcting the Nation from 1899 to 1907; whether, if such were
the case, the appropriate Government officials administering Indian affairs and disbursing moneys to the Seminoles
had knowledge thereof at the time any of the payments
to the tribal treasurer were made; and, if so, whether the
Seminole Nation received the benefit of any sums expended
by the tribal treasurer. On the basis of these findings,
the Court of Claims can then determine whether there
was a breach of the Government's fiduciary obligation, as
defined in the discussion of Item Two, ante, and if there
was a breach, the resultant liability.
III
Petitioner asserts that the Court of Claims committed
numerous errors with respect to the items which it included in the list of gratuitous offsets, and the Government admits that the court erred in a few instances. However, since the case must be remanded to determine
whether the Government has any further obligation on
Items Two and Five, we deem it unnecessary to consider
in detail the challenged offsets.
One phase of this question does require attention. In
Seminole Nation v. United States, No. 830, post, p. 310,
petitioner asserted that the Court of Claims gave the
Government credit there for an offset which it had employed in the instant case, thus allowing a double credit.
To avoid this confusion the Court of Claims should find
and designate the precise gratuitous expenditures to be
offset against the Government's liability, instead of finding
generally all the items which the Government may ever
be entitled to use. Gratuity offsets resemble a fund in a
bank, to be drawn upon by the Government in successive
Indian claims cases until exhausted. Since they may be
needed in future cases, it becomes important to know pre-

SEMINOLE NATION v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

cisely what items have been employed to extinguish liability in a particular case, as the instant case and No. 830
demonstrate. The disadvantage of the alternative, to
treat as binding in subsequent suits involving the same
parties the findings of the Court of Claims that the Government has total offsets in a certain amount, is evident
because it may require this Court to do a vain thing, that
is, to examine offsets which might never be needed and
which, even if disapproved, would not change the result
reached by the Court of Claims.
The judgment below is reversed, with the exception of
the disposition of Items One, Three and Four which is
in all respects affirmed, and the entire cause is remanded
to the Court of Claims with directions to make further
findings with respect to Items Two and Five; to determine
the additional liability of the Government, if any, thereon;
and, to find and designate the particular gratuitous expenditures to be offset against the Government's total
liability.
Upon the remand the Court of Claims will be free to
consider any legal or equitable defenses which the Government may interpose to the claims asserted there by
petitioner.
So ordered.
