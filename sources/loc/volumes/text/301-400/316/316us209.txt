ucts of the plaintiff company." The Circuit Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion: "No justification is
found in the record for an inference that any one appears
to have been deceived by appellee's trade-mark into purchasing its shoe heels and lifts in the belief that he was
purchasing shoe heels produced by appellant." 119 F. 2d
316, 324.
If the respondent had wilfully palmed off the heels it
sold as products of the petitioner, and if it had been
shown that the petitioner had suffered any injury, I should
agree to a decision resolving doubts about the measure of
damages in favor of the petitioner. But under the circumstances of this case, I believe the effect of the decision
handed down is to grant a windfall to the petitioner and
to impose a penalty upon the respondent, neither of which
is deserved. Finding nothing in the Trade-Mark Act of
1905 which compels such a result, I can see no abuse of
discretion in the decree of the trial court which the Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed. Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper

2. The fact that, because of he refusal of the Government to recognize the claim, its payment was delayed until after the period for
monthly payments provided in the policy had expired, did not en-

title the estate in this case to have the interest included in computing the present value of such installments. P. 214.
3. The provision of the amendatory Act of 1925 that present value
shall be computed "as of the date of the last payment made under
any existing award," is confined to cases where, prior to 1924, part

payment to such estates had been made in monthly installments,
including interest; and the purpose of the amendment was to avoid
the retraction of interest already so paid, which would otherwise
result from the retroactive lump sum provision of the 1924 Act.

be increased.

States.
Mr. Camden R. McAtee for respondent.
MR. JusTIcE BYRNES delivered the opinion of the Court.
Joseph Kelly Kerr, while in the United States Army
during the last war, took out a yearly renewable term insurance policy in the amount of $10,000, naming as beneficiary his father, Eugene Kerr. The insured died November 8, 1919. On March 6, 1920, the War Risk Bureau
denied any liability under the contract. Eugene Kerr,
the designated beneficiary, died June 24, 1924. This suit
was filed November 6, 1925.
In the District Court, judgment was rendered denying
any recovery on the policy. The Court of Appeals for

the District of Columbia, on December 4, 1939, reversed
the judgment of the District Court. 71 App. D. C. 222,
108 F. 2d 585. The District Court, on April 5, 1940, entered judgment for $3,220.00 in favor of the estate of Eugene Kerr, the beneficiary under the policy, and a judgment for $10,580.00 in favor of the estate of the insured,
Joseph Kelly Kerr. Upon rehearing, the District Court,
by its order of January 9, 1941, reduced the latter judgment to $8,227.50. On appeal, the Court of Appeals again
reversed the District Court and ordered the payment of
$10,580.00. 74 App. D. C. 244, 122 F. 2d 638. We granted
certiorari, 314 U. S. 605.
The insurance contract provided for the payment of
240 monthly installments of $57.50 each. It is not disputed that Eugene Kerr, as beneficiary, was entitled to
receive the 56 monthly installments that accrued during
his lifetime.1 They aggregated $3,220.00. The portion of
the District Court's judgment which awarded that sum
to Eugene Kerr's estate is not in controversy.
The issue here involves only the amount due the estate
of Joseph Kelly Kerr, the insured, on the 184 installments
remaining after the death of the beneficiary. The Government contends that the amount due the estate is $8,234,
which represents the present value of the 184 installments
computed as of the death of the beneficiary on June 24,
1924. Respondent argues that the amount due is $10,580,
which is the aggregate of 184 installments of $57.50
each.'
Prior to 1924, the statutes of the United States directed
that, when the estate of an insured became eligible to pro'I. e.from Nov. 8, 1919, the date of the death of the insured, through
June 8, 1924, the last due date for a monthly installment prior to the
beneficiary's death.
' It is agreed that, however this issue is resolved, respondent's recovery is subject to a deduction of $6.50, the amount of a premium due
on the policy for November 1919, the month during which the insured
died.

ceeds under the contract," they should be paid in regular
monthly installments. The most recent enactment prior
to that year was the Act of August 9, 1921, which provided:
"If no person within the permitted class of beneficiaries
survive the insured, then there shall be paid to the estate
of the insured the monthly installments payable and applicable under the provisions of Article IV of the War Risk
Insurance Act [Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, 40 Stat. 398,
409] . .
The World War Veterans Act of 1924' superseded the
War Risk Insurance Act of 1917 and its amendments. It
provided, in ยง 303:
"If no person within the permitted class of beneficiaries
survive the insured, or if before the completion of payments the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall die and there
be no surviving person within said permitted class, then
there shall be paid to the estate of the insured the present
value of the monthly installments thereafter payable
under the provisions of this title . . ."
This section altered the method of payment only with
respect to benefits payable to the estates of insured. It
did not change the method of payment to beneficiaries.
Its obvious purpose was to have the obligation to the estate
paid in one lump sum rather than in monthly installments.
Since these installments included interest as well as principal, Congress desired to eliminate the interest when it
provided for the lump sum payment. Accordingly, it
declared that the lump sum should be~equal to "the pres8
The claim to the proceeds might fall to the estate in several ways,
such as by the death of the named beneficiary or by the death of an
insured who has designated no beneficiary.

Since the respondent in

this case became entitled as of the death of Eugene Kerr, the beneficiary, the latter will be spoken of as the critical event in our dis-

cussion.

embodied in the 1924 Act and the 1925 amendment required a settlement as if there had been an award of
monthly installments. That is, it took the view that the
184 monthly installments concededly due to the estate
should be multiplied by $57.50, which represents a payment of interest as well as principal, and the resulting total
of $10,580 awarded to respondent. But one of the purposes of the 1.924 and 1925 enactments was to abolish
the monthly installment method of settling the claims
of veterans' estates. Congress could not have made
clearer its intention that the value of the remaining installments, purged of interest, should be paid in a lump
sum to the estate. Both the Veterans Administration
and this Court have recognized a legislative policy against
the allowance of interest on past due payments on these
policies. United States v. Worley, 281 U. S. 339. The
error which undermines respondent's contention and the
decision of the Court of Appeals is the failure to give
full effect to this Congressional purpose to eliminate interest from the lump sum settlement.
The Court of Appeals was evidently impressed by the
delay in the settlement of respondent's claim. We share
that concern. The insured died almost 23 years ago and
final disposition of the case is only now in view. But
responsibility for the delay is not easily apportioned.,
And in any event, it could not influence our construction
of the language of the statute. Congress has authorized
neither the payment of damages for the delay nor an
award of interest on past due obligations incurred under
these insurance certificates, and it is not within our power
to do so.:
The case is remanded for reinstatement of the judgment
of the District Court.
