least a portion of that which they would have received
as his heirs in the absence of a will. Thus, as a result
of the compromise, property did pass from the decedent
to his heirs at law, and it was held that, as they were
his heirs, they took by inheritance in contemplation of
the Revenue Act. Here, nothing passed by virtue of the
exercise of the power and no portion of' the decedent's
estate passed under the law of descent and distribution,
or as property would have passed under that law from
the decedent to the beneficiaries of the compromise.
We are at a loss to understand how the Board of Tax
Appeals can be permitted to find that any taxable transfer occurred within the meaning of § 302 of the Revenue
Act of 1926. Moreover, the compromise was motivated
by considerations other than the invalidity of the power,
for the claims of the decedent's children had a large
influence in bringing it about. We cannot perceive how
the Board can calculate the relative weight of these conflicting claims and thus assess as taxable an apportioned
part of the total amount the decedent's collateral relatives received, and thus determine what part of the property passed under the power and what part did not.

This is a suit for refund of capital lock taxes paid by
respondent for the years ending June 30, 1936, through

1939. We are asked to determine whether respondent was
"carrying on or doing business" within the meaning of
§ 105 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1935, c. 829,49 Stat. 1017,
and subsequent acts, which provide:
"For each year ending June 30, beginning with the year
ending June 30, 1936, there is hereby imposed upon every
domestic corporation -ith respect to carrying on or doing
business for any part of such year an excise tax of $1.40 for
each $1,000 of the adjusted declared value of its capital
stock." 1

the amount of the tax, in the subsequent acts covering the tax period

Opinion of the Court.

Respondent was organized in 1935 with broad corporate
powers under the laws of Maryland by the protective committee for the bondholders of the defunct Washington,
Baltimore & Annapolis Railway Company. It was formed
for the purpose of liquidating certain properties, formerly
belonging to the Railway Company, which the committee
had acquired through foreclosure. Among the properties
received by respondent from the committee were certain
rights of way, easements, terminal properties, and other
real estate located in Baltimore, Annapolis, and Washington, as well as at the other points along the line of the railroad, and the stock of a realty holding company which
owned another realty company, both of which had been
subsidiaries of the Railway Company for the purpose of
holding legal title to real estate. The value of the properties received in 1935, as shown by respondent's balance
sheet, was $419,250.
Since its incorporation respondent has been carrying on
negotiations for the sale of the properties acquired, selling
them from time to time as satisfactory offers were received,
and renting unsold properties under short term leases in an
attempt to earn the carrying charges pending ultimate
sale. Receipts from sales during the four year period
here in question were approximately $675,000, and rentals
amounted to $136,000. At the end of this period respondent's book still showed properties worth $122,000. All
net income, except small reserves for contingencies, was
distributed as received to the stockholders, former bondholders of the Railway Company.
Respondent paid capital stock taxes for the four years
in question, and then brought this suit for refund of the
payments in the District Court. The court held that,
because respondent was a liquidating corporation, it was
here in question. See § 401, Revenue Act of 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat.
1733; § 601, Revenue Act of 1938, c. 289, 52 Stat. 565. The'provision
is now incorporated in § 1200 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

not "carrying on Or doing business" within the meaning
of the capital stock tax and was therefore exempt. In so
holding, the court refused to give effect to the Treasury
regulation claimed to be applicable.2 35 F. Supp. 340.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 120 F. 2d 441.
We granted certiorari because of the importance of the
question in the administration of the revenue acts. 314
U. S. 601.
The regulation, Article 43 (i) (5), provides:
"ART. 43. Illustrations.-(a)General.-In general 'doing business' includes any activities of a corporation
whether it engages in"(5) the orderly liquidation of property by negotiating
sales from time to time as opportunity and judgment dictate and distributing the proceeds as liquidation is effected-for example, the liquidation of an estate, or of
properties taken over from another corporation, or of
the shareholders' fractional interests in particular property;"
If the regulation is both applicable and valid, respondent
manifestly cannot prevail.
On the question of applicability there can be no doubt,
for the language of the regulation precisely "describes respondent's activities. We find without substance respondent's assertions that Article 43 (b) (2) is inconsistent with
Article 43 (a) (5) and that it more exactly fits the facts
"Article 43 (a) (5) of Treasury Regulations 64 (1936 Edition).
a"Exceptions.-Ordinarilythe exceptions to 'doing business' are
restricted to limited activities of a corporation, such as-"(2) the distribution of the avails of property and the doing only of
such acts as may be necessary for the maintenance of its corporate
status in the case in which the corporation either was organized
for, or has reduced its activities to, the mere bwning and holding

of specific property."

of this case. During the period in question, respondent
did not fall into that state of quietude, covered by the
specific language of Article 43 (b) (2), in which it was
merely owning and holding specific property and distributing the resulting proceeds. See Zonne v. Minneapolis
Syndicate, 220 U. S. 187; cf. Von Baumbach v. Sargent
Land Co., 242 U. S. 503, 516-17. On the contrary, respondent was actively engaged in fulfilling the purpose of
its creation, the liquidation of its holdings for the bdst
obtainable price.
Article 43 (a) (5) is both a contemporary and a long
standing administrative interpretation, having been in
effect in substantially the same form since 1918, except for
the period from 1926 to 1933 when the tax was not imposed.4 We are of opinion that it is valid, as well as applicable. The-crucial words of the statute, "carrying on
or doing business;' are not so easy of application to varying
facts that they leave no room for administrative, interpretation or elucidation. To be sure, in many, if not in most,
instances the factual situation will be so extreme as to
leave no doubt whether a corporation is doing business
or not. But the nuances of facts between the two ex'Article 5 of Treasury Regulations 38 (1918 ed.), issued under
the Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, provided:
...
A corporation formed to take over miscellaneous stocks,
bonds, and other property, to negotiate the sale of the various items
from time to time as opportunity and judgment dictate, and to distribute the proceeds from time to time as liquidation is effected, is
organized for profit andwhile engaged in such liquidation is carrying

on business."
This provision, with minor changes in wording, was :continued in
Treasury Regulations 50 (1919 ed.), Art. 18; (1920.ed.), Art. 11;
Treasury Regulations.64 (1922 ed.), Art. 12; (1924 ed.), Art. 12; (1933
ed.), Art. 22; (1934 ed.), Art. 33. In 1936 Treasury Regulations 64
were reorganized and the substance of the provision quoted above was
continued as Art. 43 (a) (5) of the 1936 edf.,on. No change was
made in'the 1938 edition.

tremes have produced a nebulous field of confusion which
has been recognized by courts striving to fit close cases into
one category or the other.' Interpretative regulations,
such as Article 43 (a) (5), are appropriate aids toward
eliminating that confusion and uncertainty. Cf. Helvering v. Wilshire Oil Co., 308 U. S. 90, 102; Textile Mills

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.

No. 535. Argued March 4, 1942.-Decided April 13, 1942.
1. The provision of § 206 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act, 1935, granting
"grandfather" rights to common carriers "mn bona fide operation
on June 1, 1935, and since that time," requires that the service shall
have been continuous (except for interruptions over which the carrier "had no control") from June 1, 1935, until the, time of the
hearing by the Commission on the application. P. 78'
2. The Commission was warranted in holding as a matter of law that
an interruption of service caused by the carrier's bankruptcy was
not one over which the carrier "had no control" within the meaning
of the Act; and it was not required to go behind the adjudication
and examine into the particular causes of the bankruptcy. P. 79.

States v. Hotchkiss Redwood Co., 25 F. 2d 958; Harmar Coal Co. v.
