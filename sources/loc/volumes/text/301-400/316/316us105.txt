for want of jurisdiction of the trial court to render it.
It extends also to those exceptional cases where the conviction has been in disregard of the constitutional rights
of the accused, and where the writ is the only effective
means of preserving his rights. Moore v. Dempsey, 261
U. S. 86; Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103; Bowen v.
Johnston,306 U. S. 19, 24.
The principle of res judicatadoes not apply to a decision
on habeas corpus refusing to discharge a prisoner, Sa/inger
v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224. It does not appear that on petitioner's earlier application for a writ of coram nobis the
*same issue was raised as that now presented. The earlier
application was denied for insufficiency upon its face and
without a hearing. There is thus no basis for the holding
of the District Court that the denial is res judicataof the
present petition.
The judgment below will be vacated and the cause remanded for a hearing in conformity to Walker v. Johnston,

So ordered.

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

316 U. S.

Mr. Ernest A. Gross, with whom Solicitor General Fahy
and Messrs. Richard S. Salant, Robert B. Watts, and Morris P. Glushien were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. C. C. Parsons, with whom Mr. H. M. Fennemore
was on the brief, for respondent.
PER CMUAM.

In this case the National Labor Relations Board found
that respondent, in refusing to reemploy a number of its
former employees and to employ two new applicants, had
discriminated against them in order to discourage membership in a labor union in violation of § 8 (1) and (3) of the
National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C.
§ 151. The Board made its order directing employment
of these individuals with back pay. The Circuit Court of
Appeals refused to enforce the Board's order on the ground
that its findings were without substantial support in the
evidence. 122 F. 2d 587.
Examination of the record discloses that there was substantial evidence from which the Board could have concluded that respondent's refusal to employ the men was
motivated by its belief that they had engaged or threatened
to engage in destruction of respondent's property and had
threatened to injure some of respondent's managerial employees and members of their families. There was also
substantial evidence from which the Board could have
concluded, as it did, that respondent's motive for refusing
the employment was discouragement of membership' in a
labor union. The possibility of drawing either of two
inconsistent inferences from the evidence did not prevent
the Board from drawing one of them, as the court below
seems to have thought.
We have repeatedly held that Congress, by providing,
§ 10 (c), (e) and (f), of the National Labor Relations Act,
that the Board's findings "as to the facts, if supported by

evidence, shall be conclusive," precludes the courts from
weighing evidence in reviewing the Board's orders, and
if the findings of the Board are supported by evidence the
courts are not free to set them aside, even though the Board
could have drawn different inferences. Labor Board v.
Link-Belt Co., 311 U. S. 584, and cases cited; Labor Board
v. Automotive Maintenance Co., 315 U. S. 282; cf.
Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, 300 U. S. 297, 307;
Federal Trade Comm'n v. Pacific Paper Assn., 273 U. S.
52, 63; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Algoma Co., 291 U. S.
67, 73. Since upon an examination of the record we cannot say that the findings of fact of the Board are without
support in the evidence, the judgment below must be reversed with directions to enforce the Board's order, but
with the modification proposed by the Board to cohform
to our decision in Republic Steel Corp. v. Labor Board,
311 U. S. 7.
Reversed.

REVENUE, v. CREDIT ALLIANCE CORP.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 708.

Argued April 7, 1942.-Decided April 27, 1942.

1. Under § 27 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1930, a distribution in liquidation of surplus accumulated since February 28, 1913, is to be treated,
in computing the dividends-paid credit for the purpose of the tax
imposed by § 14 on undistributed net income, as a taxable dividend
paid. P. 110.
So held although, under § 112 (b) (6), the distribution resulted
in no gain or loss to the distributee for tax purposes; and althoughthe distributee did not, in the tax year of such distribution, distribute
to its stockholders any part of the distribution, and did not apportion or allocate to the distributor any part thereof.
2. The clause "properly chargeable to the earnings or profits accumulated after February 28, 1913" in subsection 27 (f) refers to the
