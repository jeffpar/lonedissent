COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v.
GLENSHAW GLASS CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.*

No. 199.

Argued February 28, 1955.-Decided March 28, 1955.

Money received as exemplary damages for fraud or as the punitive
two-thirds portion of a treble-damage antitrust recovery must be
reported by a taxpayer as "gross income" under § 22 (a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Pp. 427-433.
(a) In determining what constitutes "gross income" as defined
in § 22 (a), effect must be given to the catchall language "gains
or profits and income derived from any source whatever." Pp. 429430.
(b) Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, distinguished. Pp. 430431.
(c) The mere fact that such payments are extracted from the
wrongdoers as punishment for unlawful conduct cannot detract
from their character as taxable income to the recipients. P. 431.
(d) A different result is not required by the fact that § 22 (a)
was re-enacted without change after the Board of Tax Appeals had
held punitive damages nontaxable in Highland Farms Corp., 42
B. T. A. 1314. Pp. 431-432.
(e) The legislative history of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954 does not require a different result. The definition of gross
income was simplified, but no effect upon its present broad scope
was intended. P. 432.
(f) Punitive damages cannot be classified as gifts, nor do they
come under any other exemption in the Code. P. 432.
211 F. 2d 928, reversed.

Solicitor General Sobeloff argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Assistant Attorney
General Holland, Charles F. Barber, Ellis N. Slack and
Melva M. Graney.

delivered the opinion of
the Court.
This ,litigation involves two cases with independent
factual backgrounds yet presenting the identical issue.
The two cases were consolidated for argument before the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and were heard en
banc. The common question is whether money received
as exemplary damages for fraud or as the punitive twothirds portion of a treble-damage antitrust recovery must
be reported by a taxpayer as gross income under § 22 (a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.1 In a single opinion, 211 F. 2d 928, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Tax
Court's separate rulings in favor of the taxpayers. 18
T. C. 860; 19 T. C. 637. Because of the frequent recurrence of the question and differing interpretations by
the lower courts of this Court's decisions bearing upon
the problem, we granted the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue's ensuing petition for certiorari. 348 U. S. 813.
The facts of the cases were largely stipulated and are
not in dispute. So far as pertinent they are as follows:
Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.-The Glenshaw
Glass Company, a Pennsylvania corporatiofi, manufactures glass bottles and containers. It was engaged in
protracted litigation with the Hartford-Empire Company, which manufactures machinery of a character used
by Glenshaw. Among the claims advanced by Glenshaw

were demands for exemplary damages for fraud ' and
treble damages for injury to its business by reason of
Hartford's violation of the federal antitrust laws.' In
December, 1947, the parties concluded a settlement of all
pending litigation, by which Hartford paid Glenshaw
approximately $800,000. Through a method of allocation which was approved by the Tax Court, 18 T. C. 860,
870-872, and which is no longer in issue, it was ultimately
determined that, of the total settlement, $324,529.94 represented payment of punitive damages for fraud and
antitrust violations. Glenshaw did not report this portion of the settlement as income for the tax year involved.
The Commissioner determined a deficiency claiming as
taxable the entire sum less only deductible legal fees.
As previously noted, the Tax Court and the Court of
Appeals upheld the taxpayer.
Commissioner v. William Goldman Theatres, Inc.William Goldman Theatres, Inc., a Delaware corporation
operating motion picture houses in Pennsylvania, sued
Loew's, Inc., alleging a violation of the federal antitrust
laws and seeking treble damages. After a holding that
a violation had occurred, William Goldman Theatres, Inc.
v. Loew's, Inc., 150 F. 2d 738, the case was remanded to
the trial court for a determination of damages. It was
found that Goldman had suffered a loss of profits equal
to $125,000 and was entitled to treble damages in the sum
of $375,000. William Goldman Theatres, Inc. v. Loew's,
Inc., 69 F. Supp. 103, aff'd, 164 F. 2d 1021, cert. denied,
334 U. S. 811. Goldman reported only $125,000 of the
recovery as gross income and claimed that the $250,000

balance constituted punitive damages and as such was
not taxable. The Tax Court agreed, 19 T. C. 637, and
the Court of Appeals, hearing this with the Glenshaw case,
affirmed. 211 F. 2d 928.
It is conceded by the respondents that there is no
constitutional barrier to the imposition of a tax on punitive damages. Our question is one of statutory construction: are these payments comprehended by § 22 (a)?
The sweeping scope of the controverted statute is
readily apparent:
"SEC. 22.

income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries,
wages, or compensation for personal service . . .of
whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from
professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce,
or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or
personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or
interest in such property; also from interest, rent,
dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits
and income derived from any source whatever..

GENERAL DEFINITION.-'Gross

This Court has frequently stated that this language was
used by Congress to exert in this field "the full measure
of its taxing power." Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U. S.331,
334; Helvering v. Midland Mutual Life Ins. Co., 300 U. S.
216, 223; Douglas v. Willcuts, 296 U. S. 1, 9; Irwin v.
Gavit, 268 U. S. 161, 166. Respondents contend that
punitive damages, characterized as "windfalls" flowing
from the culpable conduct of third parties, are not within
the scope of the section. But Congress applied no limitations as to the source of taxable receipts, nor restrictive

labels as to their nature. And the Court has given a
liberal construction to this broad phraseology in reccgnition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except
those specifically exempted. Commissioner v. Jacobson,
336 U. S. 28, 49; Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank,
293 U. S. 84, 87-91. Thus, the fortuitous gain accruing
to a lessor by reason of the forfeiture of a lessee's improvements on the rented property was taxed in Helvering v.
Bruun, 309 U. S. 461. Cf. Robertson v. United States,
343 U. S. 711; Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. Si 130;
United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., 284 U. S. 1. Such
decisions demonstrate that we cannot but ascribe content
to the catchall provision of § 22 (a), "gains or profits and
income derived from any source whatever." The importance of that phrase has been too frequently recognized
since its first appearance in the Revenue Act of 1913'
to say now that it adds nothing to the meaning of "gross
income."
Nor can we accept respondents' contention that a narrower reading of § 22 (a) is required by the Court's characterization of income in Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S.
189, 207, as "the gain derived from capital, from labor, or
from both combined." ' The Court was there endeavoring to determine whether the distribution of a corporate
stock dividend constituted a realized gain to the shareholder, or changed "only the form, not the essence," of
538 Stat. 114, 167.

The phrase was derived from Stratton's Independence, Ltd. v.
Howbert, 231 U. S. 399, 415, and Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., 247
U. S. 179, 185i two cases construing the Revenue Act of 1909, 36
Stat. 11, 112. Both taxpayers were "wasting asset" corporations, one
being engaged in mining, the other in lumbering operations. The
definition was applied by the Court to demonstrate a distinction between a return on capital and "a mere conversion of capital assets."
Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., supra, at 184. The question raised by
the instant case is clearly distinguishable.

Opinion of the Court.

his capital investment. Id., at 210. It was held that
the taxpayer had "received nothing out of the company's
assets for his separate use and benefit." Id., at 211. The
distribution, therefore, was held not a taxable event. In
that context-distinguishing gain from capital-the
definition served a useful purpose. But it was not meant
to provide a touchstone to all future gross income
questions. Helvering v. Bruun, supra, at 468-469;
United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., supra, at 3.
Here we have instances of undeniable accessions to
wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers
have complete dominion. The mere fact that the payments were extracted from the wrongdoers as punishment
for unlawful conduct cannot detract from their character
as taxable income to the recipients. Respondents
concede, as they must, that the recoveries are taxable to
the extent that they compensate for damages actually
incurred. It would be an anomaly that could not be
justified in the absence of clear congressional intent to
say that a recovery for actual damages is taxable but not
the additional amount extracted as punishment for the
same conduct which caused the injury. And we find no
such evidence of intent to exempt the, payments.
It is urged that re-enactment of § 22 (A.)without change
since the Board of Tax Appeals held 1,-aitive damages
nontaxable in Highland Farms Corp., 42 B. T. A. 1314,
indicates congressional satisfaction with that holding.
Re-enactment--particularly without the slightest affirmative indication that Congress ever had the Highland Farms
decision before it-is an unreliable indicium at best.
Helvering v. Wilshire Oil Co., 308 U. S. 90, 100-101;
Koshland v. Helvering,298 U. S. 441, 447. Moreover, the
Commissioner promptly published his nonacquiescence in
this portion of the Highland Farms holding7 and has,

before and since, consistently maintained the position
that these receipts are taxable.' It therefore cannot be
said with certitude that Congress intended to carve an
exception out of § 22 (a)'s pervasive coverage. Nor does
the 1954 Code's' legislative history, with its reiteration
of the proposition that statutory gross income is "allinclusive," '0 give support to respondents' position. The
definition of gross income has been simplified, but no
effect upon its present broad scope was intended.11 Certainly punitive damages cannot reasonably be classified as
gifts, cf. Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28, 47-52,
nor do they come under any other exemption provision
in the Code. We would do violence to the plain meaning
of the statute and restrict a clear legislative attempt to
8The long history of departmental rulings holding personal injury
recoveries nontaxable on the theory that they roughly correspond to
a return of capital cannot support exemption of punitive damages
following injury to property. See 2 Cum. Bull. 71; I-1 Cum.
Bull. 92, 93; VII-2 Cum. Bull. 123; 1954-1 Cum. Bull. 179, 180.
Damages for personal injury are by definition compensatory only.
Punitive damages, on the other hand, cannot be considered a restoration of capital for taxation purposes.

11In discussing § 61 (a) of the 1954 Code, the House Report states:
"This section corresponds to section 22 (a) of the 1939 Code.
While the language in existing section 22 (a) has been simplified, the
all-inclusive nature of statutory gross income has not been affected
thereby. Section 61 (a) is as broad in scope as section 22 (a).
"Section 61 (a) provides that gross income includes 'all income
from whatever source derived.' This definition is based upon the
16th Amendment and the word 'income' is used in its constitutional
sense." H. R. Rep. No. 1337, supra, note 10, at A18.
A virtually identical statement appears in S. Rep. No. 1622, supra,
note 10, at 168.
