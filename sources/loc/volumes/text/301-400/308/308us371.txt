CHICOT COUNTY DRAINAGE DISTRICT v. BAX-

TER STATE BANK ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 122. Argued December 7, 1939.-Decided January 2, 1940.
1. Bondholders of a state drainage district, who were parties to a
proceeding under the Act of Congress of May 24, 1934, for a
re-adjustment of its indebtedness, and who did not then question
the constitutionality of that statute, but did not comply with the
provisions of the decree for retirement of their bonds within a
time limited, are estopped, by the principle of res judicata, from
raising that question of constitutionality in a subsequent action on
their bonds, notwithstanding that, in the meantime, in another
case, coming from another district, this Court had declared the Act
unconstitutional. Pp. 374-375.
2. The lower federal courts, including the District Court sitting
as a court of bankruptcy, though their jurisdiction is limited to
that prescribed by Acts of Congress, are nevertheless courts with
authority, when parties are brought before them in accordance with
the requirements of due process, to determine whether or not they
have jurisdiction to entertain the cause and for this purpose to
construe and apply the statute under which they are asked to act.
Their determinations of such questions, while open to direct review,
may not be assailed collaterally. P. 376.
3. Res judicata may be pleaded as a bar, not only as respects matters
actually presented to sustain or defeat the right asserted' in the
earlier proceedings, but also as respects any other available matter
which might have been presented to that end. P. 378.
103 F. 2d 847, reversed.

judgment recovered in the District Court in an action on
bonds of a drainage district.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
Respondents brought this suit in the United States
District Court for the Western Division of the Eastern
District of Arkansas to recover on fourteen bonds of
$1,000 each, which had been issued in 1924 by the petitioner, Chicot County Drainage District, organized under
statutes of Arkansas,' and had been in default since 1932.
In its answer, petitioner pleaded a decree of the same
District Court in a proceeding instituted by petitioner to
effect a plan of readjustment of its indebtedness under
the Act of May 24, 1934,2 providing for "MunicipalDebt Readjustments." The decree recited that a plan
of readjustment had been accepted by the holders of
more than two-thirds of the outstanding indebtedness
'Act No. 405, Extra. Sess., General Assembly of Arkansas, approved February 20, 1920,- as amended by Act No. 432 of 1921, and
General Drainage Law of Arkansas, approved May 27, 1909.
'48 Stat. 798. Originally this provision was limited to two years
but it was extended to January 1, 1940, by Act approved April 10,
1936, 49 Stat. 1198.

and was fair and equitable; that to consummate the plan
and with the approval of the court petitioner had issued
and sold new serial bonds to the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation in the amount of $193,500 and that these
new bonds were valid obligations; that, also with the
approval of the court, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation had purchased outstanding obligations of petitioner to the amount of $705,087.06 which had been
delivered in exchange for new bonds and canceled; that
certain proceeds had been turned over to the clerk of
the court and that the disbursing agent had filed his
report showing that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation had purchased all the, old bonds of petitioner other
than the amount of $57,449.30. The decree provided
for the application of the amount paid into court to the
remaining old obligations of petitioner, that such obligations might be presented within one year, and that unless
so presented they should be forever barred from participating in the plan of readjustment or in the fund paid
into court. Except for. the provision for such presentation, the decree canceled the old bonds and the holders
were enjoined from thereafter asserting any claim
thereon.
Petitioner pleaded this decree, which was entered in
March, 1936, as res judicata,. Respondents demurred to
the answer. Thereupon the parties stipulated for trial
without a jury.
The evidence showed respondents' ownership of the
bonds in suit and that respondents had notice of the proceeding for debt readjustment. The record of that proceeding, including the final decree, was introduced. The
District, Court ruled in favor of respondents and the
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 103 F. 2d 847. The
decision was placed upon- the ground that the decree was
void because, subsequent to its entry, this Court in a

proceeding relating to a municipal district in Texas had
declared the statute under which the District Court had
acted to be unconstitutional. Ashton v. Cameron
County District, 298 U. S. 513. In view of the importance of the question we granted certiorari. October 9,
1939.
The courts below have proceeded on the theory that the
Act of Congress, having been found to be unconstitutional, was not a law; that it was inoperative, conferring
no rights and imposing no duties, and hence affording no
basis for the challenged decree. Norton v. Shelby
County, 118 U. S. 425, 442; Chicago, I. & L. Ry. Co. v.
Hackett, 228 U. S. 559, 566. It is quite clear, however,
that such broad statements as to the effect of a determination of unconstitutionality must be taken with qualifications. The actual existence of a statute, prior to such a
determination, is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot
always be erased by a new judicial declaration. The effect
of the subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be
considered in various aspects,-with respect to particular
relations, individual and corporate, and particular conduct, private and official. Questions of rights claimed
to have become vested, of status, of prior determinations
deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly, of
public policy in the light of the nature both of the statute
and of its previous application, demand examination.
These questions are among the most difficult of those
which have engaged the attention of courts, state and federal, and it is manifest from numerous decisions that an
all-inclusive statement of a principle of absolute retroactive invalidity cannot be justified. Without attempting

Opinion of the Court.

to review the different classes of cases in which the consequences of a ruling against validity have been determined in relation to the particular circumstances of past
transactions, we appropriately confine our consideration
to the question of res judicata as it now comes before
US.
:First. Apart froin the contention as to the effect of
the later decision as to constitutionality, all the elements
necessary to constitute the defense of res judicata are
present. It appears that the proceedings in the District
Court to bring about a plan of readjustment were conducted in complete conformity to the statute. The Circuit Court of Appeals observed that no question had been
raised as to the regularity of the court's action. The
answer in the present suit alleged that the plaintiffs
(respondents here) had notice of the proceeding and were
parties, and the evidence was to the same effect, showing'
compliance with the statute in that respect. As parties,
these bondholders had full opportunity to present any
objections to the proceeding, not only as to its regularity,
or the fairness of the proposed plan of readjustment, or
the propriety of the terms of the decree, but also as to
the validity of the statute under which the proceeding was
brought and the plan put into effect. Apparently no
question of validity was raised and the cause proceeded
to decree on the assumption by all parties and the court
itself that the statute was valid. There was no attempt
to review the decree. If the general principles governing the defense of res judicata are applicable, these bondholders, having the opportunity to raise the question of
invalidity, were not the less bound by the decree because
they failed to raise it. Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94
U. S. 351, 352; Case v. Beauregard, 101 U. S. 688, 692;
Baltimore Steamship Co. v. Phillips, 274 U. S. 316, 319,

Second. The argument is pressed that the District
Court was sitting as a court of bankruptcy, with the
limited jurisdiction conferred by statute, and that, as
the statute was later declared to be invalid, the District
Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding and hence its decree is open to collateral attack. We
think the-argument untenable. Th lower federal courts
are all courts of limited jurisdiction, that is, with only
the jurisdiction which Congress has prescribed. But none
the less they are courts with authority, when parties are
brought before them in accordance with the requirements
of due process, to determine whether or not they have
jurisdiction to entertain the cause and for this purpose to
construe and apply the statute under which they are
asked to act. Their determinations of such 'questions,
while open to direct review, may not be assailed
collaterally.
In the early case of M'Cormick v. Sullivant, 10 Wheat.
192, where it was contended that the decree of. the federal district court did not show that the parties to the
proceedings were citizens of different States and hence
that the suit was coram non judice and the decree void,
this Court said: "But this reason proceeds upon an incorrect view of the character and jurisdiction of the
inferior Courts of the United States. They are all of
limited jurisdiction; but they are not, on that account,
inferior Courts, in the technical sense of those words,
whose judgments, taken alone, are to be disregarded. If
the jurisdiction be not alleged in the proceedings, their
judgments and decrees are erroneous, and may, upon a
writ of error, or appeal, be reversed for that cause. But
they are not absolute nullities." Id., p. 199. See, also,
Skillern's Executors v. May's Executors, 6 Cranch 267;
Des Moines Navigation Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., 123
U. S.552, 557, 559; Dowell v. Applegate, 152 U. S.327,
340; Evers v. Watson, 156 U. S. 527, 533; Cutler v.

Opinion of the Court.

Huston, 158 U. S. 423, 430, 431. This rule applies equally
to the decrees of the District Court sitting in bankruptcy,
that is, purporting to act under a statute of Congress
passed in the exercise of the bankruptcy power. The
court has the authority to pass upon its own jurisdiction
and its decree sustaining jurisdiction against attack, while
open to direct review, is res judicata in a collateral action.
Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 171, 172.
Whatever the contention as to jurisdiction may be,
whether it is that the boundaries of a valid statute have
been transgressed, or that the statute itself is invalid, the
question of jurisdiction is still one for judicial determination. If the contention is one as to validity, the question
is to be considered in the light of the standing of the
party who seeks to raise the question and of its particular
application. In the present instance it is suggested that
the situation of petitioner, Chicot County Drainage District, is different from that of the municipal district before
the court in the Ashton case. Petitioner contends that it
is not a political subdivision of the State of Arkansas but
an agent of the property owners within the District. See
Drainage District No. 7 of Poinsett County v. Hutchins,
184 Ark. 521; 42 S. W. 2d 996.' We do not refer to that
phase of the case as now determinative but merely as
illustrating the sort of question which the District Court
might have been called upon to resolve had the validity of
the Act of Congress in the present application been raised.
As the question of validity was one which had to be determined by a judicial decision, if determined at all, no reason appears why it should not be regarded as determinable
by the District Court like any other question affecting its
jurisdiction. Them can be no doubt that if the question
of the constitutionality, of the statute had actually been
raised and decided by tlfe District Court in the proceed'See Drainage District No. 2 v. Merc'antile-Comme,ce Bank, 69

ing to effect a plan of debt readjustment in accordance
with the statute, that determination would have been
final save as it was open to direct review upon appeal.
Stoll v. Gottlieb, supra.5
The remaining question is simply whether respondents,
having failed to raise the question in the proceeding to
which they were parties and in which they could have
raised it and had it finally determined, were privileged
to remain quiet and raise it in a subsequent suit. Such
a view is contrary to the well-settled principle that res
judicata may be pleaded as a bar, not only as respects
matters actually presented to sustain or defeat the right
asserted in the earlier proceeding, "but also as respects
any other available matter which might have been presented to that end." Grubb v. Public Utilities Comm'n,
supra; Cromwell v. County of Sac, supra.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to
the District Court with direction to dismiss the complaint.
