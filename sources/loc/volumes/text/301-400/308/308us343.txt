BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS OF THE
COUNTY OF JACKSON, KANSAS, v. UNITED
STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

TENTH CIRCL IT.

No. 14. Argued October 16, 1939.-Decided December 18, 1939.
An Indian allotment was by treaty stipulation and provisions of a

trust patent, issued under the General Allotment Act, exempt
from taxation so long as the United States should hold it in trust.
Over the Indian's objection, the Secretary of the Interior issued
to the Indian a patent in fee simple, which later, after long and
unexcused delay, he canceled, by authority of an Act of Congress.
In the meantime the fee patent had been registered in the county,
and the county. authorities, in reliance upon it, had collected taxes
upon the land. Thereafter, the United States in an action on
behalf of the Indian recovered a judgment against the county for
the amount of the tax payments with interest. Held:

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Argument for Petitioner.

308 U. S.

1. The question whether interest should have been allowed is
not determined by a law of the State precluding recovery of interest from a county upon taxes illegally collected. P. 349.
2. Congress not having specifically defined the relief to be
granted for loss suffered through denial of the tax exemption,
remedial details are left to judicial implications; and, since the
origin of the right to be enforced is the treaty, whatever rule
may be fashioned as to interest is ultimately attributable to the
Constitution, treaties and statutes of the United States. P. 349.
3. In determining the question of interest here presented, the
Court is guided by considerations of equity and of public convenience; and, conformably to those considerations, the state law
of interest can be respected without impinging upon the exemption
commanded by the treaty. Pp. 350, 352.
4. It is a general principle that, in the absence of explicit congressional policy cutting across state interests, beneficiaries of federal rights are not to have a preferred position over other
aggrieved taxpayers in their relation with the States or their
political subdivisions. P. 352.
5. In governmental actions based upon quasi-contractual obligations interest (in the absence of statutory direction) is not recovered according to a rigid theory of compensation for money
withheld, but is given or denied in response to considerations of
fairness and equity. P. 352.
6. In the circumstances of this case, whatever may be the duty
of the county to repay the taxes which there was every practical
justification for collecting at the time, the county can not in fairness be called upon to pay interest for the use of the money. P. 353.
100 F. 2d 929, reversed in part.

County v. United States, supra; United States v. Board

v. Board of County Commissioners, 13 F. Supp. 641.
If there was any mistake in issuing the patent, or if
there was any laches in attempting to secure a refund of
the taxes, it was on the part of the Governmerit and the
government officials. The county officials were fully
warranted in thinking that the land was subject to
taxation from the time the patent was issued in 1918
up until the time the Government, acting under the
long subsequent Act of Congress, cancelled it. The sole
basis upon which the authorities hold that such taxes must
be refunded to the Indian allottee is that they were collected during the time of the existence of a patent to the
allottee which had been issued without his or her request.
The county was fully warranted in assuming that the
Government, the trustee of the rights of the Indian allottee, had taken all essential steps prior to the time of
the issuance of the patent. For the Government now to
come back on the county long years after the taxes had
been collected, and speaking on behalf of the allottee,
attempt to collect interest on payments of taxes which
had been assessed in good faith by the county in reliance
upon a fee simple patent issued by the Government to the
allottee, is to place an unwarrantable burden on the
county.

There being no statute providing for the recovery of
interest, the decisions of the Kansas court that interest
is not recoverable against the county should be followed.

Even under the federal court rule as to liability for

Public officers are presumed to do their duty, and
there is a further presumption that all necessary preliminary steps to the issuance of a patent have been taken.

that the patent had been regularly issued.
Mr. Raymond T. Nagle, with whom Solicitor General
Jackson and Assistant Attorney General Littell were on
the brief, for the United States.
The exemption is a federal right and its scope is determined by federal law. Carpenterv. Shaw 280 U. S.
363, 367; United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432.
The exemption should be construed broadly in favor
of the allottee. Unzted States v. Shoshone Tribe, 304
U. S. 111, 116; Carpenter v. Shaw, supra. The Indian
is entitled to an outright exemption from enforced contributions for the maintenance of local governments.
Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665; cf. United States v. Osage
County, 251 U. S. 128, 133. This clearly precludes the
existence of any right in. terms to demand from the
allottee the uncompensated use of her money or property
for the support of the county. Carpenterv. Shaw, supra;
Ward v. Love County, 253 U. S. 17. The claim of the
allottee for interest is merely an assertion of the right
to be made wh6le for the enforced use of her money in
violation of the exemption.

BOARD OF COMM'RS v. U. S.
343

Opinion of the Court.

Full restitution requires the payment of interest. Billings v. United States, 232 U. S. 261, 284-288. The doctrine that interest does not run against the sovereign
has no bearing upon the scope of the exemption from
local taxes conferred by Congress upon the allottee.
This Court has, without discussion, affirmed or reinstated
judgments which allowed interest against a county on
taxes wrongfully collected from Indian allottees. Ward
v. Love County, supra; McCurdy v. United States, 264
U. 0".484.
Federal courts may apply established federal principles
where interest is claimed. Concordia Ins. Co. v. School
Dist., 282 U. S. 545, 551. The state law, if contrary,
must yield. The power of Congress over the Indians in
Kansas is plenary. The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737,
755-756; Sage v. Hampe, 235 U. S. 99, 106. Cf. United
States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432; Bunch v. Cole, 263 U. S.
250; Carpenterv. Shaw, supra. The conflict need not be
direct or immediate; a possible interference with the
policy of the federal law may render the state doctrine
inapplicable. Sage v. Hampe, supra; cf. Tullock v. Mulvane, 184 U. S. 497. A suit by the United States on behalf of its Indian wards can not be defeated by either
substantive or procedural rules of state law. Carpenter
v. Shaw, supra; Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U. S. 22, 24.
Neither fiscal arrangements nor local doctrines of estoppel
bind the United States suing on behalf of its ward.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case is here to review an affirmance by the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit of a ruling by

OCTOBER TERM, 1939
Opinion of the Court.

308 U. S.

the District Court for the District of Kansas allowing
interest in a suit for the recovery of taxes by the United
States on behalf of an Indian under circumstances pres.ently to be stated. 100 F. 2d 929. .We granted certiorari
because of conflicting views between the Ninth and the
Tenth Circuits. See United States v. Nez Perce County,
Idaho, 95 F. 2d 232.'
M-Ko-Quah-Wah is a full-blooded Pottawatomie Indian. In her behalf the United States asserts whatever
rights she may have flowing from the Treaty of November 15, 1861, between the United States and the
Pottawatomie nation of Indians, 12 Stat. 1191, and the
legislation in aid of it. This Treaty. made lands held by
the United States in trust for the Pottawatomie Indians
"exempt from levy, taxation, or sale . . .," "until otherwise provided by law. . . ." The land which gave rise
to this controversy, situated in Jackson County, Kansas,
was patented under the General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, 24 4Stat. 388, 25 U. S. C. § 348. In pursuance
of thisAct, the United States agreed to hold the land for
twenty-five years under the restrictions of the 1861
Treaty, subject to extension at the President's discretion.
Two ten-year extensions were made by Executive Order,
one, in 1918 and the other in 1928; and by the Act of
June 18, 1934, the existing trust periods were indefinitely
extended by Congress. 48 Stat. 984.
In this legislative setting, the Secretary of the Interior
in 1918, over the objection of M-Ko-Quah-Wah, cancelled her outstanding trust patent and in its place issued
a foe simple patent. This was duly recorded in the
Registry of Deeds for Jackson County. In consequence
Jackson County in 1919 began to subject the land to its
regular property taxes. It continued to do so as long as
1 This

case has since been followed by the same court in United

States v. Lewis County, Idaho, 95 F. 2d 236, and Glacier County,
Mont., v. United States, 99 F. 2d 733.

BOARD OF COMM'RS v. U. S.
343

Opinion of the Court.

this fee simple patent was left undisturbed by the United
States. In 1927 Congress authorized the Secretary of the
Interior to cancel fee simple patents theretofore issued
over the objection of allottees. In 1935 the patent for
the land in controversy was cancelled, and in the next
year proceedings were begun by the United States as
guardian of M-Ko-Quah-Wah to recover the taxes which
Jackson County had collected, amounting to $1,966.13,
with interest from the respective dates of payment. The
District Court allowed interest at 6%, and a verdict for
principal and interest, amounting to $3,277.49, was
returned by the jury. A judgment upon this verdict was
affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Jackson
County does not here contest its liability for tht principal, but challenges the Government's right to interest
prior to judgment.
The issue is uncontrolled by any formal expression of
the will of Congress. The United States jirges that we
must be indifferent to the law of the state pertaining to
the recovery of taxes improperly levied on land within it.
Jackson County, on the other hand, urges that the law of
Kansas controls. It is settled doctrine there that a taxpayer may not recover from a county interest upon taxes
wrongfully collected. Jackson County v. Kaul, 77 Kan.
715; 96 P. 45.
We deem neither thp juristic theory urged by the Government nor that of Jackson County entirely appropriate
for the solution of our problem. The starting point for
relief in this case is the Treaty of 1861, exempting M-KoQuah-Wah's property from taxation. Effectuation of
the exemption is, of course, entirely within Congressional
control. But Congress has not specifically provided for
the present contingency, that is, thp nature and extent
of relief in case loss is suffered through denial of exemption. It has left such remedial details to judicial implications. Since the origin of the right to be enforced is the
Treaty, plainly whatever rule we fashion is ultimately.

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.

attributable to the Constitution, treaties or statutes of
the United States, and does not owe its authority to the
law-making agencies of Kansas. Cf. Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64. And so the concrete problem is

to determine the materials out of which the judicial rule
regarding interest as an incident to the main remedy
should be formulated. In ordinary suits where thi Government seeks, as between itself and a private litigant,
to enforce a money claim ultimately derived from a federal law, thus implying a wish of Congress to collect what
it deemed fairly owing according to the traditional
notions of Anglo-American law, this Court has chosen
that rule as to interest which comports best with general
notions of equity. United States v. Sanborn, 135 U. S.
271, 281; Billings v. United States, 232 U. S. 261. Instead of choosing a rigid rule, the Court has drawn upon
those flexible considerations of equity which are established sources for judicial law-making.
But the present case introduces an important factor
not present in former decisions. The litigation is not
between the United States and a private litigant, but
between the United States and the political subdivision
of a state. In effect, therefore, we have another aspect
of our task in adjusting the interests of two governments within the same territory.
Nothing that the state can do will be allowed to destroy
the federal right which is to be vindicated; but in defining the extent of that right its relation to the operation
of state laws is relevant. The state will not be allowed
to invade the immunities of Indians, no matter how skilful its legal manipulations. United States v. Rickert'
188 U. S. 432. Cf. Bunch v. Cole, 263 U. S. 250. Nor are
the federal courts restricted to the remedies available in
state courts in enforcing such federal rights. United
States v. Osage County, 251 U. S. 128; Ward v. Love
County, 253 U. S. 17. Nor may the right to recover taxe

BOARD OF COMM'RS v. U. S.
343

Opinion of the Court.

illegally collected from Indians be unduly circumscribed
by state law. Carpenterv. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363. Again,
state notions of laches and state statutes of limitations
have no applicability to suits by the Government,
whether on behalf of Indians or otherwise. United States
v. Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181. Cf. Chesapeake & Delaware
Canal Co. v. United States, 250 U. S. 123. This is so
because the immunity of the sovereign from these
defenses is historic. Unless expressly waived, it is implied
in all federal enactments.
But the recovery of interest in inter-governmental litigation has no such roots in history. Indeed, liability for
interest is of relatively recent origin and the rationale
of its recognition or denial is not always clear. That it
is not a congenital rule in our law is indicated by its
denial in United States v. North Carolina,136 U. S. 211,
on grounds of "public cnvenience." Since Congress has,
in the legislation implementing the Indians' tax immunity, remained silent as to recovery of interest, we need
not presume that it has impliedly fixed liability for interest in a suit like the present.
Having left the matter at large for judicial determination within the framework of familiar remedies equitable
in their nature, see Stone v. White, 301 U. S. 532, 534,
Congress has left us free to take into account appropriate
considerations of "public convenience." Cf. Virginian
Ry. Co. v. Federation,300 U. S. 515, 552. Nothing seems
to us more appropriate than due regard for local institutions and local interests. We are concerned with the
interplay between the rights of Indians under federal
guardianship and the local repercussion of those rights.
Congress has. not been heedless of the interests of the
states in which Indian. lands were situated, as reflected by
their local laws. See, e. g., § 5 of the General Allotment
Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, 389. With reference to other
federal rights, the state law has been absorbed, as it were,

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

308 U. S.

as the governing federal rule not because state law was
the source of the right but because recogn'ition of state
interests was not deemed inconsistent with federal policy.
See Brown v. United States, 263 U. S. 78; Seaboard Air
Line R. Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 299. In the
absence of explicit legislative policy cutting across state
interests, we draw upon a general principle that the beneficiaries of federal rights are not to have a privileged
position over other aggrieved tax-payers in their relation
with the states or their political subdivisions. To respect
the law of interest prevailing in Kansas in no wise impinges upon the exemption which the Treaty of 1861 has
commanded Kansas to respect and the federal courts to
Vindicate.
Assuming, however, that the law as to interest in
governmental actions based upon quasi-contractual obligations be applicable, the United States must fail here.
The cases teach that interest is not recovered according to
a rigid theory of compensation for money withheld, but
is given in response to considerations of fairness. It is
denied when its exaction would be inequitable. United
States v. Sanborn, 135 U. S. 271, 281; Billings v. United
States, 232 U. S. 261.
Jackson County in all innocence acted in reliance on
a fee patent given under the hand of the President of
the United States. Even after Congress in 1927 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to cancel such a patent,
it was not until 1935 that such cancellation was made.
Here is a long, unexcused delay in the assertion of a right
for which Jackson County should not be penalized. By
virtue of the most authoritative semblance of legitimacy
under national law, the land of M-Ko-Quah-Wah and
the lands of other Indians had become part of the economy of Jackson County. For eight years after Congress had directed attention to the problem, those specially entrusted with the intricacies of Indian law did not

call Jackson County's action into question. Whatever
may.be her unfortunate duty to restore the taxes which
she had every practical justification for collecting at the
time, no claim of fairness calls upon her also to pay interest for the use of the money which she could not have
known was not properly hers.
Such is this Court's doctrine regarding the imposition
of interest in cases where this Court has fashioned its own
doctrine. If it be said that the default of the United
States should not be charged against its Indian wards,
a choice has to be made between equally innocent victims of official neglect from 1918 until 1936 in the administration of the Indian law. The loss of interest to the
United States because of the conduct of its officials in the
Sanborn and Billings cases, supra, had to be borne by
the innocent public. We think as to interest here, the
loss should remain where it has fallen. If thereby Indians are out of pocket, they should not be made whole
by putting Jackson County unfairly out of pocket. The
appeal for relief must be made elsewhere.
The judgment below must accordingly be modified,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

progressively subjected Indians to the laws under which
all other citizens must live in the Indians' States of
residence, if not in conflict with specific protective measures of Congress.! Here, in the exercise of its plenary
authority, Congress by treaty exempted the lands of the
Pottawatomies from taxation. It could have by stipulation granted the additional right to recover interest on
any taxes collected in violation of the exemption; but it
did not. The failure of Congress to stipulate that a
State-as here-must pay interest to an Indian when the
State law permits interest to no one, 4 is entirely consistent with the congressional policy of steadily extending
the operation of the States' laws over their resident
Indians. Congress--with exclusive plenary power to legislate concerning the Indians--has not provided for recovery of interest from Kansas, and the courts have no
constitutional power to create the right.
That Congress contented itself with the creation of the
right to be free from taxation-as distinguished from a
right to interest in a suit for refund-is emphasized by
the conclusion which would be inescapable were this a
suit against the United States for violation of the exemption here conceded to be binding on it.' Without more,'
Congress would then-even on the basis of this concession-be deemed to have refused to create the separate
right to recover interest."
