CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TEXAS.

No. 720, Misc.

Decided May 23, 1966.

Certiorari granted; reversed.

Howard M. Fender, Assistant Attorney General, for

PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis
and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The
judgment is reversed. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S.
335: Doughty v. Maxwell, 376 U. S. 202; see Garner v.
Pennsylvania,372 U. S.768; United States ex rel. Durocher v. LaVallee, 330 F. 2d 303 (C. A. 2d Cir.).
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN would set the case for argument,
believing that the retroactivity of Gideon v. Wainwright,
372 U. S. 335, as applied in a recidivist case, presents
problems of its own that are deserving of plenary
consideration.
