OCTOBER TERM, 1965.
Per Curiam.

384 U.S.

WESTBROOK v. ARIZONA.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF ARIZONA.

No. 1250, Misc.

Decided May 2, 1966.

The question whether in the circumstances of this case a hearing on
the accused's competence to stand trial was sufficient to determine
his competence to waive his right to the assistance of counsel, or
whether the trial judge had a further protecting duty, should be
re-examined in light of Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375.
Certiorari granted; 99 Ariz. 30, 406 P. 2d 388, vacated and remanded.

W. Edward Morgan for petitioner.
Darrell F. Smith, Attorney General of Arizona, and
Paul G. Rosenblatt, Assistant Attorney General, for
respondent.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and
the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. Although petitioner received a hearing on the issue of his
competence to stand trial, there appears to have been
no hearing or inquiry into the issue of his competence
to waive his constitutional right to the assistance of
counsel and proceed, as he did, to conduct his own defense. "The constitutional right of an accused to be
represented by counsel invokes, of itself, the protection
of a trial court, in which' the accused-whose life or
liberty is at stake-is without counsel. This protecting
duty imposes the serious and weighty responsibility upon
the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused." Johnson v.
Zierbst, 304 U. S. 458, 465; Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S.
506.

Per Curiam.

From an independent examination of the record, we
conclude that the question whether this "protecting
duty" was fulfilled should-be re-examined in light of our
decision this Term in Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Arizona is vacated and the case is remanded to that court
for proceedings not inconsistent herewith.
It is so ordered.
