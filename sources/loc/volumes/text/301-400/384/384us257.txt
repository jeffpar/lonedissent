UNITED STATES v. COOK.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.

No. 256.

Argued April 19, 1966.-Decided 'May 23, 1966.

18 U. S. C. § 660, prohibiting embezzlement by employees of "any
firm, association, or corporation engaged in commerce as a common carrier," in view of its legislative history, the broad meaning
of term "firm," and lack of reason to exclude from its protection
the large number of common carriers operated as individual proprietorships, held to apply to employees of such common carriers.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question presented is whether 8 U., S. C. § 660
(1964 ed.), which prohibits certain embezzlerhents by
employees of "any firm, association, or corporation engaged in commerce as a common carrier," ' applies to the
"Whoever, being a president, director, officer, or manager of any
firm, association, or corporation engaged in commerce as a common
carrier, or whoever, being an employee of such common carrier.,
riding in or upon any railroad car, motortruck, steamboat, vessel,
aircraft or other vehicle of such carrier moving in interstate commerce, embezzles, steals, abstracts, or willfully misapplies, or willfully permits to be misapplied, any of the moneys, funds, credits,
securities, property, or assets of such firm, association, or corporation arising or accruing from, or used in, such commerce, in whole

conduct of an employee of an individual doing business
as a common carrier. The indictment in this case
charged that, while riding on his employer's truck, appellee,. "a truck driver for Tolbert Hawkins, an individual engaged in commerce as a common carrier," embezzled approximately $200 from funds of his employer
accruing from an interstate shipment of bananas. Holding that the indictment failed to charge an offense within
§ 660 because it charged that appellee acted as an' employee of "an individual" while § 660 forbids' the proscribed acts only when committed by employees of a
"firm, association, or corporation," the District Court dismissed the indictment. Accord, Schmokey v. United
States-, 182 F. 2d 937 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1950). The United
States brought a direct appeal pursuant to 18 U. S. C.
§ 3731 (1964 ed.), and -we noted probable- jurisdiction,
382 U. S. 953.
Section 660 punishes embezzlements from a common
carrier by either (1) "a president, director, officer, or
manager of any firm, association, or corporation engaged
in commerce as a common carrier," or (2) "an employee
of such common carrier riding in or upon any . . . ve'
hicle of such carrier moving in interstate commerce. ) 2
The present form of the statute dates from the 1948
revision of the Criminal Code. Prior to that time, the
separate groups-named executives, and employees riding in vehicles in commerce-were the subject of distinct
criminal provisions. 18 U. S. C. § 412 (1946 ed.), like
the present § 660, applied to named executives of "any
firm, association, or corporation engaged in commerce as
or in part, or willfully or knowipgly converts the same to his own
(use or te-the use of another, shall be fined not more than $5,000
or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both." 18 U. S. C. § 660

a common carrier."
18 U. S. C. § 409 (a) (5) (1946 ed.)
applied to employees of "any carrier," with no express
limitation relating to the form of the employer's ownership.' The legislative history-including a 1946 revision
expanding the coverage of the section to all modes of
transportation-and the prevalent usage of the expression "any carrier" in statutes regulating commerce con-'
vincingly establish that § 409 (a) (5) embraced employees
of individual proprietorships. As this much is conceded
by appellee, we need not detail that legislative history
and common usage here. Appellee urges, however, that
the phrase "firm, association, or corporation" absorbed
into § 660 frorh the earlier executive provision, § 412, is
not sufficiently broad to include individual proprietors;
that the revision in 1948 therefore narrowed the cover3

age of the employee provision; and that this result
is compelled by the general canon of construction that
criminal statutes are to be strictly construed. The
United States counters that the choice of the language
used in the predecessor executive provision, rather than
that °in the predecessor employee provision, was merely a
stylistic preference not evidencing any intent to narrow
coverage of employee offenders and that a "firm" may be
any business organization, whether Individually owned
or otherwise.
We think the position of the- United States is sound
and we reverse the District Court. There is no doubt
that the 1946 statute covered employees of individuals
and in our view it was not intended by adopting the
1948 revision of the Code to make any substantive change
in the law by excluding from its- coverage the employees
of any class of carrier who had been previously covered.
The 'general purpose of the new Code was to "codify and
revise .....
The original intent of Congress is preserved," S. Rep. No. 1620, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1, and
with respect to the new § 660, the reviser's note, while
noting the consolidation of a portion of § 409 and § 412
and stating that "[c]hanges were made in phraseology,"
disclosed no intention of making any change in the substantive content or the coverage of the law. See legislative history note following 18 U. S. C. § 660 (1964 ed.).
To us the congressional intent to reach the employees of
any carrier, whatever the form of business organization,
seems reasonably clear.
Appellee relies principally upon the abandonment of
the words "employee of any carrier" and the substitution of the present language of § 660 which does not
expressly include the employees of "any person" or "any
individual" doing business as a common carrier. But
the term "firm" is certainly broad enough in common

usage to embrace individuals acting as common carriers;
and in those instances wlaere Congress has explicitly
indicated its understanding of the term, the definition
of "firm" has included individual proprietorships. 19
5 Some.sources define "firm" as "[t]he persons composing a partnership, taken collectively." II Bouvier's Law Dictionary 1232
(1914); see also Ballentmie's Law Dictionary 507 (2d ed. 1948);
Black's Law Dictionary761762 (4th ed. 1951); Crowell's Dictionary
of Business and Finance 225 (rev: ed. 1930); Encyclopedia of Banking and Finance 238 (Garcia, 5th ed. 1949). But other dictionaries,
while recognizing that narrow definition, also state that the word
has a broader meaning in pophlar usage, connoting any business
entity, including individual proprietorships. For example, the standard American reference defines "firm" both as "a partnership of two
or more persons not recognized as a legal person distinct from the
members composing it" and as any "business unit or enterprise."
Webster's Third New International Dictionary-Unabridged 856
(1961). Accord, Clark & Gottfried, Dictionary of Business and
Finance 152 (1957) ("Strictly, an unincorporated business carried on
by more than one person, jointly; a partnership ....
In popular
usage, any business, company, or concern, incorporated or not.");.
Dictionary of Business and Industry 218. (Schwartz ed. 1954) (".A
business partnership; any business house or organization, no matter
what its legal fQrm . . ."); Dictionary of English La* 807 (1959)
("the style or title- under which one or several persons carry on
business"); Dictionary of Foreign Trade 308 (Henius, 2d ed. '947)
("The name or title under which one or more persons do business").
While numerous decisions of state courts have enunciated a restrictive definition of "firm"-and in turn have influenced the definition given in law dictionaries, see the citation to'FirestoneTire&
Rubber Co. v. Webb, 207 Ark. 820, 182 S. W.. 2d 941 (1944), in
Black's Law Dictionary, supra-such decisions have not involved
the issue of whether an individual proprietorship may be ,deemed
a "firm." Typically the question has been whether two or more
persons holding themselves out as a firm should be held to constitute a partnership for various purposes of partnership law such as
liability on a partnership note, Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.
Webb, supra, imputation of knowledge from partners to the partnership, McCosker v. Banks, 84 Md. 292, 35 A. 935 (1896), or
liability of one partner for the acts of another, Bufton v. Hoseley,
236 Ore. 12, 386 P. 2d 471 *(1963).

Nor has any plausible reason been advanced for drawing a distinction between employees of individuals and
employees of partnership or corporate common carriers.
The possible burden to interstate commerce or the need
for federal jurisdiction to supplement state jurisdictionin View of the frequent difficulty of showing in what
State the crime occurred-does not vary with the form
of business organization. On the other hand, since a
large portion of common carriers are individually' owned
proprietorships,7 acceptance of appellee's interpretation
of § 660 would exclude a substantial segment of the industry from the coverage of the Act-a result that should
not be inferred from the 1948 "changes . . . in phraseology" without some specific indication that Congress
had receded from the intention it clearly expressed in
1946 of expanding ,coverage of the Act to all carriers.
See S. Rep. No. 1632, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.
We are mindful of the maxim-that penal statutes
should be strictly construed. But that canon "is not an
inexorable command to override common sense and evident statutory purpose," United States v. Brown, 333
U., S. 18, 25, and does not "require that the act be given
the 'narrowest meaning.' It is sufficient if the words are
given their fair meaning in accord with the evident intent
two provisions are identical and read as follows:

were individually owned and operated. About 1% operated in
partnership form, and the remainder operated as corporations.

United States v. A & P Trucking Co., 358 U. S. 121;
United States v. Shirey, 359 U. S.255. In this case the
fair meaning of the term in dispute-as evidenced by
common usage and its statutory meaning in other contexts-and the manifest intention of Congress in using
it here lead us to conclude that § 660 encompasses embezzlements by employees of individual proprietorships.
