ASHTON v. KENTUCKY.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY.

No. 619. Argued April 28, 1966.
Decided May 16, 1966.
Petitioner was indicted and convicted for violating the Kentucky
common-law crime of criminal libel. The indictment charged "the
offense of criminal libel" committed "by publishing a false and
malicious publication which tends to degrade or injuie" three
named persons. The trial court charged that "criminal libel is
defined as any writing calculated to create disturbances of the
peace, corrupt the public morals, or lead to any act; which, when
done, is indictable." The court also charged that malice and
falsity were essential elements-of the offense. The Kentucky
Court of Appeals, in affirming the conviction, ruled that breach
of the peace is not a constitutional basis for imposing criminal
liability, and held that common-law criminal libel is "the publication of a defamatory statement about another which is false, with
malice." Held:
1. Where an accused is convicted under A broad construction of
a law which would make it unconstituiidnal, the conviction cannot
be sustained on appeal by a limiting construction which eliminates
the unconstitutional features of the law. Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U. S. 87. P. 198.
2. Because the offense was defined at trial as th'publication of
a writing calculated to disturb the peace, petitioner was judged
by an unconstitutionally vague standard which required calculations as to the reaction of the audience to which the publication was addressed. Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296;
Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1. Pp. 198-201.
3. Although vague laws in any setting are impermissible, laws
which touch on First Amendment rights must be carefully and
narrowly drawn. Pp. 200-201.
405 S. W. 2d 562, reversed.

Ephraim London argued the cause for petitioner.
With him on the brief were Dan Jack Combs and Melvin
L. . Wulf.

John B. Browning, Assistant Attorney General of
Kentucky, argued the cause for respondent. With him
on the brief was Robert Matthews, Attorney General.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Petitioner was sentenced to six months in prison and
fined $3,000 for printing a pamphlet found to be prohibited by the common law of criminal libel in Kentucky.
The Kentucky Court of Appeals, with three judges dissenting, affirmed petitioner's conviction. 405 S. W. 2d
562. We granted certiorari (382 U. S. 971) and reverse.
Petitioner went to Hazard, Kentucky, in 1963, where a
bitter labor dispute raged, to appeal for food, clothing
and aid for unemployed miners. 'The challenged pamphlet, which had a limited circulation, stated concerning
Sam L. Luttrell, Chief of Police of Hazard:
"Six weeks ago I witnessed a plot to kill the one
pro-strike city policeman on- the Hazard Force.
Three of the other cops were after him while he was
on night-duty. It took 5 pickets guarding him all
night long to keep him from getting killed, but they
could not prevent him from being fired, which he
was* three weeks ago. Another note on the City
Police: The Chief of the force, Bud Luttrell, has a
job on the side of guarding an operator's home for
$100 a week. Its against the law for a peace officer
to take private jobs."
It said concerning Charles E. Combs, the Sheriff:
"The High Sheriff has hired 72 deputies at one
time, more than ever before in history; most of them
hired because they wanted to carry guns. He, Sheriff Combs, is also a mine operator-in a recent Court
decision he was fined $5,000 for intentionally blinding a boy with tear-gas and beating him while he
was locked in a jail cell with his hands cuffed. The

boy lost the sight of one eye completely and is nearly
blind in the .other. Before the trial Sheriff Combs
offered the boy $75,000 to keep it out of court, but
he refused. Then for a few thousand dollars Combs
probably bought off the jury. The case is being
appealed 'by the boy to a higher court-be wants
$200,000. Combs is now indicted for the murder
of a mn-voluntary manslaughter. - Yet he is still
the law in this county and has the support of the
rich man because he will fight the pickets and the
strike. The same is true of the State Police. They
escort the scabs into the mines and hold the pickets
at gunpoint."
And it said respecting Mrs. W. P. Nolan, co-owner of
the Hazard Herald:
"The town newspaper, the Hazard Herald, has
hollered that 'the cbmmies have come to the mountains of Kentucky' and .are leading the strike. The
Herald was the recipient-of over $14,000 cash and
several truckloads of food and clothing which were
.sent as the result of a CBS-TV show just before
Christmas. The story was on the strike and aid
-was supposed to be sent-to the pickets in care of
the Hazard Herald, however the editor, Mrs. W. P.
Nolan, is vehemently against labor-she has said that
she would rather give the incoming aid to the merchants in town than to the miners. Apparently that
is what she has done, for only $1100 of the money
has come to the pickets, and none of the food and
clothes. They are now either still under lock and
key, or have been given out to the scabs ahd others
still."
The indictment charged "the offense of criminal libel"

persois. The trial court charged that "criminal libel is
defined as any writing calculated to create*disturbances
of the peace, corrupt the public morals, or lead to any
act, which, when done, is indictable."
The court also charged that malice is "an essential
element of this offense" and falsity as well.
The Court of Appeals in affirming the judgment of
conviction adopted a different definition of the offense
of criminal libel from that given the jury' by the trial
court. It ruled that the element of breach of the peace
was no longer a constitutional basis for imposing criminal
liability. It held that the common-law crime of criminal
libel in Kentucky is "the publication of a defamatory
statement about another which is false, with malice."
-We indicated in Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382
U. S. 87, that where an Accused is tried and convicted
under a broad construction of an Act which would make
it unconstitutional, the conviction cannot-be sustained on
'appeal by a limiting construction which eliminates the
unconstitutional features of the Act, as the trial took
place under the unconstitutional construction of the Act.
We think that principle applies here. Petitioner was
tried and convi6ted according to the trial court's understanding of Kentucky law, which defined the offense as
"any writing calculated to create disturbances of the
peace ....
We agree with the dissenters in the Court of Appeals
who stated that: "...
since the English common law
of criminal libel is inconsistent with constitutional provisions, and since no Kentucky case .has redefined the
crime in understandable, terms, and since the law must
be made on a case to case basis; the elements of the crime
are so indefinite and uncertain that it should not be
enforced as a penal offense in Kentucky."
The case is close to Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S.
296, involving a conviction of the common-law crime

of inciting a breach of the peace. The accused was
charged with having played in the hearing of Catholics
in a public place a phonograph record attacking their
religion and church. In reversing we said: "The offense
known as breach of the peace embraces a great variety
of conduct destroying or menacing public order and tranquility. It includes not only violent acts but acts and
words likely to produce violence in others. . . . Here
we have a situation analogous to a conviction under a:
statute sweeping in a great variety of conduct under a
general and indefinite characterization, and leaving to
the executive and judicial branches too wide a discretion
in its application.", Id., at 308.
In Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, we held unconstitutional an ordinance which as construed punished an
utterance as a breach of the peace "if it stirs the public to
anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest,
or creates a disturbance." Id., at 3. We' ser aside the
conviction, saying:
"The vitality of civil and political institutions in
our society depends on free discussion. As Chief
Justice Hughes wrote in De Jonge v. Oregon, 299
U. S. 353, 365, it is only through free debate and
free exchange of ideas that government remains
responsive to the will of the people and peaceful
change is effected. The right to speak freely and
to promote diversity of ideas and programs is therefore one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart
from totalitarian regimes..
"Accordingly a function of free speech under our
system of government is to invite dispute. It may
indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a
condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction *vith conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.
Speech is often provocative and challenging. It

ilay strike at prejudices and preconceptions and
have profound unsettling effects as it presses for
acceptance of an idea." Id., at 4.
Convictions for "breach. of the peace" where the offense
Was imprecisely defined were similarly reversed in
Edwards v. South Carolina,372 U. S. 229, 236-238, and
Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 536, 551-552. These decisions recognize that to make an offense of conduct which
is "calculated to create disturbances of the peace" leaves
wide open the standard of responsibility. It involves
calculations as to the boiling point of a particular person
or a particular group, not an appraisal of the nature of
the comments per se. This kind of criminal libel "makes
a man a criminal simply because his neighbors have no
self-control and cannot refrain from violence." Chafee,
Free Speech in the United States 151 (1954).
Here, as in the cases discussed above, we deal with First
Amendment rights. Vague laws in any area suffer a constitutional infirmity.' When First Amendment rights are
involved, we look even more closely lest, under the guise
of regulating conduct that is reachable by the police
power, freedom of speech or of the press suffer.2 We

said in Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra. that such a law
must be "narrowly drawn to prevent the supposed evil,"
310 U. S., at 307, and that a conviction for an utterance
"based on a common law concept of the most general afid
undefined nature," id., at 308, could not stand.
All the infirmities of the convictio of the common-law
crime of breach of the peace as defined by Connecticut
judges are present in this conviction of the common-law
crime of criminal libel as defined by Kentucky judges.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurs in the result.
