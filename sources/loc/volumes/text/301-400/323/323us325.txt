OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

323 U. S.

Like that case the present suit was brought by appellant
against Federal Laboratories, Inc. and Breeze Corporations, Inc. to secure among other things an adjudication of
the constitutional validity of the Royalty Adjustment Act
of Congress of October 31, 1942, 56 Stat. 1013, 35 U. S. C.
Supp. III, §§ 89-96. It sought also to enjoin defendants
from paying over to the Treasury of the United States
royalties alleged to be due upon the license agreements
involved in the Breeze suit, as required by the notices and
orders of the War and Navy Departments served upon
appellant and the defendants pursuant to the Act.
In addition; the bill of complaint alleges that the defendants owe royalties to appellant under the license
agreements, for which it prays an accounting. By way of
anticipation of the defense that the Royalty Adjustment
Act and the notices and orders of the War and Navy Departments require appellee to pay the royalties into the
Treasury, appellant sets up the unconstitutionality of the
Act.
A district court of three judges was convened to hear the
cause as required by the Act of August 24, 1937, 50 Stat.
752, 28 U. S. C. § 380 (a), and the United States was
allowed to intervene as a party in accordance with § 1 of
the Act. 50 Stat. 751, 28 U. S. C. § 401. The District
Court, on motion of the Government, dismissed so much
of the bill of complaint as sought an adjudication of the
constitutional validity of the Royalty Adjustment Act and
of the notice and orders issued under it. It struck from
the bill of complaint the anticipatory allegations that the
Royalty Adjustment Act and the orders with respect to
the royalties owing appellant are unconstitutional and
void, and it struck the prayer of the bill for an injunction.
For the reasons stated in our opinion in the Breeze case
we hold that appellant has shown no ground for equitable
relief by way of injunction. The allegations of unconstitutionality of the Royalty Adjustment Act and the
orders were pleaded only as supporting the prayer for an

injunction and were therefore properly stricken with that
prayer. The allegations are not essential to or a proper
part of the cause of action for an accounting and recovery
of the royalties alleged to be due.
Since the allegations were stricken, appellee Federal
has answered setting up as a separate defense the royalty
adjustment orders prohibiting payment of the royalties
to appellant. Upon that issue appellant will be free to
contest the constitutional validity of the orders. The
judgment below is accordingly
Affirmed.
