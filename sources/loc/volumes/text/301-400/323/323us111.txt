as a result of reductions in tariff duties. Yet the difference between them and other taxes under this contract
is not apparent. Although there will be exceptions, in
general the United States as a contractor must be treated
as other contractors under analogous situations. When
problems of the interpretation of its contracts arise the
law of contracts governs. Hollerbach v. United States,

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA.

No. 23. Argued October 16, 1944.-Decided December 4, 1944.
1. An open account claim of a creditor of the United States, representing a balance claimed to be due under Army construction contracts, held not a credit instrumentality of the United States and
not constitutionally immune from non-discriminatory state taxation. P. 113.
2. R. S. § 3701, exempting from state and local taxation "All stocks,
bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States,"
held inapplicable to an open account claim of a creditor of the
United States. P. 116.
3. Under the rule of ejusdem generis, the words "other obligations"
in R. S. § 3701 are to be construed as referring only to obligations
or securities of the same type as those specifically enumerated, and
not as extending to non-interest-bearing claims or obligations which
the United States does not use or need for credit purposes. P. 117.

Opinion of the Court.

323 U. S.

CERTIORARI, 321 U. S. 761, to review a judgment directing dismissal of a suit to enjoin the assessment of a state
tax.

Mr. Ben H. Sullivan, with whom Mr. John H. Connaughton was on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. W. S. Northcutt, with whom Messrs. E. H. Sheats
and Standish Thompson were on the brief, for respondents.
At the request of the Court, Solicitor General Fahy,
Assistant Attorney General Samuel 0. Clark, Jr., and
Messrs. Sewall Key, J. Louis.Monarch and Bernard Chertcoff filed a brief on behalf of the United States, as amicus
curiae, expressing the view that R. S. § 3701 does not apply to the obligation here involved but that Congress has
constitutional power to declare such an immunity.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Petitioners are partners engaged in the contracting and
construction business. They claim that on January 1,
1942, the United States owed them a balance of $29,831.10.
This amount was, due under the terms of two contracts for
work, labor and materials furnished in connection with
the construction of two airports for the use of the United
States Army. Petitioners state that this balance "was in
the nature of an open account and represented an account
receivable" in their hands.
The respondent tax officials of Fulton County, Georgia,
sought to assess*this open account for state and county ad
valorem tax purposes.' Petitioners brought this action in
Georgia Code (1933) § 92-101 subjects all real and personal property to taxation, except as otherwise provided by law, and § 92-102
includes within the definition of personal property "money due on
open account or evidenced by notes, contracts,. bonds, or other obligations, secured or unsecuied." '

Opinion of the Court.

a state court to enjoin such assessment, claiming that the
open account was an instrumentality of the United States
and hence was immune from state or county taxation.
The Supreme Court of Georgia overruled the trial court's
dismissal of respondents' general. demurrer and directed
that the petition be dismissed. 197 Ga. 95, 28 S. E. 2d
148. We granted -certiorari because of. the important
constitutional and statutory problems inherent in the
case.
I. Petitioners claim that the proposed tax on the open
account claim against the United States is a tax upon the
credit of the federal government and upon its power to
raise money to carry on military and civil operations.
Hence, it is argued, such a tax is unconstitutional under
the rule, first enunciated in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4
Wheat. 316, that .without Congressional action there is
immunity from, state and local taxation, implied from
the Constitution itself, of all properties, functions and
instrumentalities of the federal government.2 We think
otherwise.
. In the first place, an open account claim against the
United States does not represent a credit instrumentality
of the federalgovernment within the meaning of this constitutional immunity. The record here reveals only that
petitioners claim that the United States owes them
$29,831.10, which amount is carried by them as an account
receivable and "is in the nature of an open account."
There are the usual provisions of standard form government construction contracts calling for progress payments
by the United States, with final payment being made
after completion and acceptance of the work. There is no
evidence of any bargaining for a credit extension of
$29,831.10 or any provisions for the payment of interest

on amounts due under the contracts. Nor is there any
indication that any conditions precedent needed to be
fulfilled or that, on the supposition that the amount was
conceded to be correct by the United States, anything
other than the formal mechanics of payment needed to
be performed. We can only assume, therefore, that this
is an ordinary open account as generally defined in the
commercial world.' In other words, it is an unsettled
claim or demand made by the creditor which appears in
his account books. It is not evidenced by any written
document whereby the United States, the debtor, has
promised to pay this claim at a certain time in the future;
nor is there any binding acknowledgment by the United
States of the correctness of the claim. Conceivably the
amount claimed to be due is incorrect or is subject to certain defenses or counterclaims by the United States, necessitating further settlement or adjustment. Such a unilateral, unliquidated creditor's claim, which by itself does
not bind the United States and which in no way increases
or affects the public debt, cannot be said to be a credit
instrumentality of the United States for purposes of tax
immunity.
In these respects a mere open account claim differs vitally from the type of credit instrumentalities which this
Court in the past has recognized as constitutionally exempt from state and local taxation.4 Such instrumentalis See Paton, Accountants' Handbook 229-30 (2d ed., 1934); Olson
and Hallman, Credit Management 36 (1925); Jamison, Finance 56 ff
(1927); Kramer v. Gardner, 104 Minn. 370, 373, 116 N. W.' 925, 926.
4 In Bank v. Supervisors, 7 Wall. 26, this Court held that Congress
had the constitutional power, and exercised it, to exempt non-interestbearing United States legal tender notes, called "greenbacks." The
decision did not rest on a finding that these notes were constitutionally exempt in and of themselves. Congress thereafter enacted a
statute which in effect reversed this decision and allowed such notes
to be taxed by states. Act of Aug. 13, 1894, 28 Stat. 278, § 1, 31
U. S. C. § 425.

Opinion of the Court.

ties in each instance have been characterized by (1) written documents, (2) the bearing of interest, (3) a binding
promise by the United States to pay specified sums at
specified dates and (4) specific Congressional authorization, which also pledged the faith and credit of the United
States in support of the promise to pay. Thus in The
Banks v. The Mayor, 7 Wall. 16, immunity was granted
to interest-bearing certificates of indebtedness issued to
public creditors pursuant to the Act of March 1, 1862, 12
Stat. 352, and the Act of March 17, 1862, 12 Stat. 370.
United States stock, bearing interest of 6% and 7%, issued pursuant to the Act of April 20, 1822, 3 Stat. 663,
was declared immune in Weston v. Charleston,2 Pet. 449.
See also Bank of Commerce v. New York City, 2 Black
620, holding immune interest-bearing stock of the United
States authorized by various acts of Congress,' and Bank
of the Commonwealth v. Commissioner of Taxes, 2 Black
635, note, declaring immune United States stock, bearing
not over 5% interest, authorized by the Act of June 14,
1858, 11 Stat. 365. Interest-bearing bonds of the federal
government authorized by law have consistently been held
immune from state and local taxation. See, for example,
Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, 205 U. S. 503. None
of these cases is authority for placing an open account
claim under the protective umbrella of constitutional
immunity.
It is clear, moreover, that the proposed taxation of this
open account will not affect or embarrass in any substantial measure the power of the United States to secure
credit or to secure aid from independent contractors for
necessary military and civil construction projects. The
tax here is a uniform, non-discriminatory levy upon an
unliquidated asset of the creditor and not upon a credit
5 This case involved stock issued under the Act of April 15, 1842,
5 Stat. 473, the Act of Jan. 26, 1847, 9 Stat. 118, the Act of March 31,
1848, 9 Stat. 217, and the Act of Feb. 8, 1861, 12 Stat. 129.

instrumentality of the United States. That this asset involves a claim against the federal government is no more
fatal to the validity of the tax than the fact that in James
v. Dravo.ContractingCo., 302 U. S. 134, the tax was levied
on the contractor's gross receipts from the United States
or the fact that in Alabama.v. King & Boozer, 314. U. S.1,
the sales tax was placed on the sale of property to a contractor for use in a federal governmen't project. The
assets of an independent contractor that are derived from
the profits of a government contract stand in no preferred
constitutional position so far as taxation is concerned.
They too must bear their fair share of the tax burden.
And as long as that burden is non-discriminatory, there is
no basis for assuming that contractors will be any less
willing to enter into construction contracts with the
United States. Nor is such a tax likely to affect or impair
in any way their ability to discharge their duties efficiently.
There is thus no practical reason for immunizing open
accounts of this nature from taxation.
II. The claim that an open account is an obligation exempt from taxation under the provisions of § 3701 of the
Revised Statutes, 31 U. S. C. § 742, is also without merit.
Congress by this section has provided that "All stocks,
bonds, Treasury notes, and otherobligations of the United
States, shall be exempt from taxation by or under State
or municipal or local authority." The plain meaning of
these words and their legislative background dispel any
doubt as to their inapplicability to an open account claim
of a creditor of the United States.
Section 3701 on its face applies only to written interestbearing obligations issued pursuant to Congressional authorization. Stocks, bonds and Treasury notes6 are
6 The only Treasury notes that could be included within § 3701
are interest-bearing ones, in light of the provisions of the Act of Aug.
13, 1894, 28 Stat. 278, § 1, 31 U. S. C. § 425, allowing notes and certificates payable on demand and circulating as currency to be taxed
by the states.

obviously of that nature. And, under the rule of ejusdem
generis, it is reasonable -to construe the general words
"other obligations,?' which allegedly cover open accounts,
as referring only .to obligations or securities of the same
type as those specifically enumerated. Hibernia Savings
Society v. San Francisco,200 U. S.310. Cf. Helvering v.
Stockholms Enskilda Bank, 293 U. S. 84. This interpretation is in accord with the long established Congressional
intent to prevent taxes which diminish in the slightest
degree the market value or the investment attractiveness
of obligations issued by the United States in an effort to
secure necessary credit. It is unnecessary to extend such
tax exemption, at least 1through statutory, interpretation,
to non-interest-bearing claims or obligations which the
United States does not use or need for -credit purposes.
Tax exemptions being the exception rather than the rule,
much clearer langiage evidencing an ' intent to immunize
open account claims under § 3701 is necessary under these
circumstances.
The seven statutory exemption provisions ' from which
§ 3701 was derived further confirm -the conclusion that
Congress at no time intended to exempt open account
claims. In all seven 'instances the exemption provisions
appeared in statutes authorizing the issuance of interestAct of Feb. 25, 1862, 12 Stat. 345, 346, exempting "all stocks,
other securities of the United States"; .(2) Act of March

(5) Act of Jan. 28, 1865, 13 Stat. 425, exempting "such notes" as
were issued under the.statute in lieu of bonds; (6) Act- of March 3,
1865, 13 Stat. 468,. 469, exempting "all .bonds or other obligations

bearing bonds or Treasury notes. Five of the seven
statutes specifically limited tax exemptions to the securities issued under those enactments; one extended exemption to "all stocks, bonds, and other securities of the
United States";8 and the other granted exemption to "all
bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the
United States." I Thus, if the rule of ejusdem generis be
applied to the two latter provisions, all seven exemptions
were limited by their terms to interest-bearing securities
or obligations authorized by Congress, for the payment of
which the credit and faith of the United States was
pledged. Full effect must also be given to the subsequent
statutory provision allowing states to tax "legal tender
notes and other notes and certificates of the United States
payable on demand and circulating or intended to circus Act of Feb. 25, 1862, 12 Stat. 345, 346. This has been described
in Congress as embracing "simply the public securities, such as are
described as the permanent debt of the Government." Cong. Globe,
p. 3184, 38th Cong., 1st Sess.
Act of June 30, 1864, 13 Stat. 218. This provision comes closest
to the wording of § 3701. In speaking of the term "other obligations,"
Rep. Hooper said during the Congressional debates on the Act that
"I understand, however, that this provision applies only to the interest-bearing obligations of the Government." Cong. Globe, p. 3183,
38th Cong., 1st Sess. He also stated that the committee in charge
of the bill which eventually became law "found the general practice
since the commencement of the Government had been to exempt from
taxation the obligations of the Government issued by the United
States under loan bills." Ibid.
This Act, moreover, obviously used the word "obligation" throughout to refer to written documents, making provisions relating to counterfeiting, altering, printing and photographing them. And in § 13,
the Act defined the words "obligation or other security of the United
States," as used in this Act, to include and mean "all bonds, coupons,
national currency, United States notes, treasury notes, fractional notes,
checks for money of authorized officers of the United States, certificates of indebtedness, certificates of deposit, stamps, and other representatives of value of whatever denomination, which have been or
may be issued under any act of Congress." (Italics added.)

late as currency." 10 All of these related statutes are a clear
indication of an intent to immunize from state taxation
only the interest-bearing obligations of the United States
which are needed to secure credit to carry on the necessary

functions of government. That intent, which is largely
codified in § 3701, should not be expanded or modified in
