STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.*

Argued December 6, 1944.-Decided January 2, 1945.
1. Under § 266 of the Judicial Code, the jurisdiction of a district court

statewide application. P. 332.

the use of federal funds and credit to improve housing conditions,
was a valid exercise of the power of Congress to provide for the
general welfare. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 1. P. 333.
3. It was within the power of Congress to exempt from state taxation
property acquired and owned by the United States, or an instrumentality thereof, pursuant to the United States Housing Act.
P. 333.
52 F. Supp. 906, affirmed.
143 Ohio St. 251, 55 N. E. 2d 265, reversed.

By special leave of Court, Mr. FrancisM. Thompson
for the Ohio Real Estate Association, as amicus curiae in
Nos. 68 and 69, urging reversal; and Mr. Francis T. Bartlett for the Cincinnati Metropolitan Housing Authority,
as amicus curiae in No. 388, urging reversal.
MR. JUSICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
These appeals present the same question of substantive
law and will be dealt with in a single opinion.
In No. 68 the appellees sought an injunction against the
taxing officials of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and those of the
City of Cleveland, to restrain them from attempting to
assess and collect taxes, pursuant to the laws of Ohio, on
lands acquired by condemnation and owned by the appellees in the city and county. A preliminary injunction was
issued but, pursuant to stipulation, the court proceeded at
once to hear the case on the merits, and entered a final
injunction.'
152 F. Supp. 906.

CLEVELAND v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

329

The lands involved were acquired by the United States
by condemnation under the National Recovery programme for low-cost housing projects. The Federal
Public Housing Authority then erected low-cost dwelling
units which were leased to Cleveland Metropolitan Housing, a State of Ohio authority. The latter has sublet the
units to tenants for residence purposes.
The appellant contended that the United States Housing Act of September 1, 1937, is unconstitutional because
Congress has no power under the Constitution to establish
low-cost housing projects.
A majority of the court below held the federal statute
authorized by the Constitution.3 Its reasoning was that
even though the evils of bad housing are local in their origin, their effect may become so widespread as to create a
menace to the national welfare and that Congress is empowered to deal with the subject in that aspect. The dissenting judge was of the view that the project amounted
merely to an embarkation by the federal Government in
a private business and that the Government could not do
this in such a way as to immunize the property employed
from normal state taxation to support local police and
other services required by the community of which the
housing project forms a part.
In No. 69 the appellees sought and were awarded an injunction against the collection of local taxes under like
circumstances.
In No. 388 the United States Housing Authority applied
for exemption from local property taxes pursuant to the
law of Ohio,4 in respect of a housing project in Cincinnati.
The real estate had been purchased by the United States
and devoted to a low-cost housing project pursuant to the

federal statute.' The application was denied. Appeal
was taken to the Supreme Court of Ohio.' The denial
was affirmed on the grounds that no exemption was permitted by the constitution and statutes of the State and
that refusal of the claimed exemption was consistent with
An appeal to this court was

perfected.
Nos. 68 and 69 were heard and decided by a district
court of three judges pursuant to § 266 of the Judicial
Code.' The appellants insist that they do not act as officers of the State in the enforcement or execution of any
state statute in collecting the taxes in question, and that
§ 266 therefore confers no jurisdiction on a three-judge
court to hear the cause. We overrule this contention.
The section is inapplicable to suits challenging local
ordinances or statutes having only local application.' But
these cases involve state law the application of which is
state-wide." If the taxing officials were, in these instances, though acting under such a law, doing so as local
officials and on behalf of the locality and not as officers of
the State, the section is inapplicable to suits to restrain
them." Here, however, the officials were enforcing state
laws embodying a state-wide concern and in the State's
interest, and in such a case § 266 is applicable. 2 The
jurisdiction of a court of three judges was properly invoked.

CLEVELAND v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

Little need be said concerning the merits. Section 1 of
the Housing Act 11 declares a policy to promote the general
welfare of the Nation by employing its funds and credit to
assist the States and their political subdivisions to relieve
unemployment and safeguard health, safety and morals of
the Nation's citizens by improving housing conditions.
Section 5 "4provides in part, "The Authority, including
but not limited to its franchise, capital, reserves, surplus,
loans, income, assets, and property of any kind, shall be
exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the
United States or by any State, county, municipality, or
local taxing authority." Section 13 authorizes agreements by the Authority to pay annual sums, not exceeding taxes which would otherwise be paid, in lieu of taxes.1
Challenge of the power of Congress to enact the Housing
Act must fail."6 And Congress may exempt property
owned by the United States or its instrumentality from
state taxation in furtherance of the purposes of the federal
legislation. This is settled by such an array of authority
that citation would seem unnecessary."
The judgments in Nos. 68 and 69 are affirmed and that
in No. 388 is reversed.
Nos. 68 and 69 affirmed.
