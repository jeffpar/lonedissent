PER CURIAM.

The judgments of the Supreme Court of Florida in
these twelve consolidated cases must be reversed. They
all concern the power of the courts of Florida to enjoin
-organizational picketing at twelve Florida resort hotels.
After a series of decisions in regard to these and related
cases,* the Florida.Supreme Court, in identical per curiam
opinions, affirmed the issuance of permanent injunctions
against the -picketing.
fTogether with No. 6, Hotel Employees Union, Local No. 255, et al.
v. Levy et al., doing business as Sherry FrontenacHotel, et al., also
on certiorari to the same Court.

Per Curiam.

The Florida courts were without jurisdiction to enjoin
this organizational picketing, whether it was activity
protected by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, as
amended, 29 U. S. C. § 157, Hill v. Floridaexre. Watson,
325 U. S. 538, or prohibited by §8 (b)(4) of the Act,
29 U. S. C. § 158 (b) (4), Garner v. Teamsters Union,
346 U. S. 485. See Weber.v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 348
U. S. 468, at 481. This follows even though the National
Labor Relations Board refused to take jurisdiction, Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. FairlawnMeats, 353 U. S. 20.
The record does not disclose violence sufficient to give the
State jurisdiction under United Automobile Workers v.
Wisconsin Board, 351 U. S. 266. fn none of the twelve
cases did the Florida trial courts make any finding of
violence, and in some an affirmative finding of no violence
was made.
Since it was stipulated below that a witness would
testify that interstate commerce was involved in the
Florida resort hotel industry, and since the parties asked
that "Final Decree be entered by the Chancellor upon the
record as now made in the light of this Stipulation," we
find it unnecessary to remand for consideration of that
question. See Hotel Employees Local No. 255,v. Leedom,
358 U. S. 99. Other questions raised by responkdents are
either without merit or irrelevant to this disposition of
the cases.
Reversed.
