LEE,

DOING BUSINESS AS

GANADO TRADING POST.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARIZONA.

No. 39. Argued November 20, 1958.-Decided January 12, 1959.
Respondent, who is not an Indian, operates a general store in Arizona
on the Navajo Indian Reservation under a license required by
federal statute. He brought this action in an Arizona state court
against petitioners, a Navajo Indian and his wife who live on the
Reservation, to collect for goods sold to them there on credit.
They moved to dismiss on the ground that jurisdiction lay in the
tribal court rather than in the state court. Held: The motion
should have been granted, since the exercise of state jurisdiction in
this case would undermine the authority of the tribal courts over
Reservation affairs and hence would infringe on the right of the
Indians to govern themselves, which right was recognized by
Congress in the Treaty of 1868 with the Navajos and has never been
taken away. Pp. 217-223.
83 Ariz. 241, 319 P. 2d 998, reversed.

With him on the brief was FrederickBernays Wiener.

action in the Superior Court of Arizona against petitioners,
a Navajo Indian and his wife who live on the Reservation,
to collect for goods sold them there on credit. Over petitioners' motion to dismiss on the ground that jurisdiction
lay in the tribal court rather than in the state court, judgment was entered in favor of respondent. The Supreme
Court of Arizona affirmed, holding that since no Act of
Congress expressly forbids their doing so Arizona courts
are free to exercise jurisdiction over civil suits by nonIndians against Indians though the action -arises on an
Indian reservation. 83 Ariz. 241, 319 P. 2d 998. Because
this was a doubtful determination of the important
question of state power over Indian affairs, we granted
certiorari. 356 U. S. 930.
Originally the Indian tribes were separate nations
within what is now the United States. Through conquest
and treaties they were induced to give up complete independence and the right to go to war in exchange for federal protection, aid, and grants of land. When the lands
granted lay within States these governments sometimes
sought to impose their laws and courts on the Indians.
Around 1830 the Georgia Legislature extended its laws to
the Cherokee Reservation despite federal treaties with the
Indians-which set aside this land for them.2 The Georgia
statutes forbade the Cherokees from enacting laws or
holding courts and prohibited outsiders from being on the
Reservation except with permission of the State Governor.
The constitutionality of these laws was tested in Worcester v. Georgia,6 Pet. 515, when the State sought to punish
of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, that he is a proper person
to engage in such trade, be permitted to do so under such rules
and regulations as the Cdmmissioner of Indian Affairs may prescribe
for the protection of said Indians."
2 The Georgia laws are set out~extensively in Worcester v. Georgia,
6 Pet. 515, 521-528. The principal treaties involved are found at

a white man, licensed by the Federal Government to practice as a missionary among the Cherokees, for his refusal,
to leave the Reservation. Rendering one of his most
courageous and eloquent opinions, Chief Justice Marshall
held that Georgia's assertion of power was invalid. "The
Cherokee nation . . . is a distinct community, occupying
its own territory . . . in which the laws of Georgia can

have no force, and which the citizens of Georgia have no
right to enter, but with the assent of the Cherokees them-

selves, or in conformity with treaties, and with the acts of
congress.

The whole intercourse between the United

States and this nation, is, by our constitution and laws,
vested in the government of the United States." 6 Pet.,
at 561.
Despite bitter criticism. and the defiance of Georgia
which refused to obey this Court's mandate in Worcester3
the broad principles of that decision came to be accepted
as law. Over the years this Court has modified these
principles in cases where essential tribal relations were
not involved and where the rights of Indians would not
be jeopardized, but the basic policy of Worcester has
remained. Thus, suits by Indians against outsiders in
state courts have been sanctioned. See Felix v. Patrick,

of John Marshall, 539-552; I Warren, The Supreme Court in Unifed

The Federal Government's power over Indians is derive!d from

States, 232 U. S. 478, and from the necessity of giving uniform protection to a dependent people. United States v. Kagama, supra.

the States to exercise this power it has expressly granted
them the jurisdiction which Worcester v. -Georgia had
dfiled
No departure from the policies which have been applied
to other, Indians is apparent i- the relationship between
the United States and the Navajos. On June 1, 1868,
a treaty was signed between General William T. Sherman, for the United States, and numerous chiefs and
headmen of the "Navajo nation or tribe of Indians."
At the time this document was signed the Navajos were
an exiled people, forced by the United States to live
crowded together on a small piece of land on the Pecos
River in eastern New Mexico, some 300 miles east of the
area they had occupied before the coming of the white
man. In return for their promises to keep peace, this
treaty "set apart" for "their permanent home ' a portion
of what had been their native country, and provided that
no one, except United States Government personnel, was
to enter the reserved area. Implicit in these treaty terms,
as it was in the treaties with the Cherokees involved in'
Worcester v. Georgia, was the understanding that the
internal affairs of the Indians remained exclusively within
C See; e. g., 62 Stat. '1224, 64 Stat. 845, 25 U. S.- C. §§ 232, 233
(1952) (granting broad civil and criminal jurisdiction to New York);
18 U. S. C. § 1162, 28 U. S. 'C. § 1360 (granting broad civil and
criminal jurisdiction to Califoriia, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and
Wisconsin). The series of statutes granting extensive jurisdiction
over Oklahoma Indians to state courts are discussed in Cohen, op. cit.
supra, note 4, at 985-1051.
7 15 Stat. 667. In 16 Stat. 566 (1871), Congress declared that no
Indian tribe or nation within the United States should thekeafter
be recognized as an independent power with whom the United States
could execute a treaty but provided that this should not impair the
obligations of any treaty' previously ratified. Thus the 1868 treaty
with the Navajos survived this Act.

Since then; Congress and the Bureau of Indian Affairs
have assisted in strengthening the Navajo tribal government and its courts. See the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation
Act of 1950, § 6, 64.Stat. 46, 25 U. S. C. § 636; 25 CFR
§§ 11.1 through 11.87NH. - The Tribe itself has in recent
years greatly improved its legal system through increased
expenditures and better-trained personnel. Today the
Navajo Courts of Indian Offenses exercise broad criminal
and civil jurisdiction which . covers suits by outsiders
against Indian defendants.8 No'Federal Act has given
state courts jurisdiction over such controversies.9

In the 1949 Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Bill, S. 1407, 81st Cong.,
1st Sess., setting up a 10-year program of capital and other improvements on the Reservation, Congress provided for concuirent state,
federbl and tribal jurisdiction. President Truman vetoed the bill
because he felt that subjecting the Navajo and Hopi to state jurisdiction was undesirable in view of their illiteracy, poverty and primitive social concepts. He was also impressed by the fact that the
Indians vigorously opposed the bill. 95 Cong. Rec. 14784-14785.
After the objectionable features of the bill were deleted it was passed
again and became law. 64 Stat. 44, 25 U. S. C. §§ 631-640.

State anticipate that the burdens accompanying such
power might be considerable."
There can be no doubt that to allow the*exercise of
state jurisdiction here would undermine the authority of
the tribal courts over Reservation affairs and hence would
infringe on the right of the Indians to govern themselves.
It is immaterial that respondent is not an Indian. He was
on the Reservation and the transaction with an Indian
took place there. Cf. Donnelly v. United States, supra;
Williams v. -United States, supra. The cases in this
Court have consistently guarded the authority of Indian
governments over their reservations. Congress recognized this authority in, the Navajos in the Treaty of 1868,
-and has done so ever since. If-this power is to be taken
away from thiem, it is for Congress to do it. Lone Wolf v.

Arizona has an express disclaimer of jurisdiction over Indian lands

Constitution. Cf. Draperv. United States, 164 U. S. 240.
