was improvidently granted.
MR. JUSTICE W ITTAKER, with whom MR. JUSTICE
BuRTON joins, dissenting.
In my view the record does not contain any evidence
of negligence by respondent, but instead it affirmatively
shows that the sole cause of petitioner's injury was his
own negligent act. Hence, I think the Supreme Court
of Missouri was right in holding that there was nothing
to submit to a jury.
The undisputed facts, principally physical facts, are
these. Respondent's tracks run in pairs to the south from
a point just outside the waiting room of its Union Station
in St. Louis. Between each pair of tracks is a concrete
loading platforn designed for the use of passengers in
walking, and of respondent's employees in transporting
baggage, to and from trains. The platform between tracks
numbered 4 and 5 is. the scene of this occurrence. It is
about 18 inches high, 14 feet 1% inches'wide and 1,800

feet long. It is under a roof supported by metal posts
14 inches in diameter located down the center of the
platform at 30-foot intervals. At the time of this occurrence a train was standing on track 4 abutting the west
side of the platform, and an incoming train was being
backed north toward the waiting room along the east side
of the platform on track 5. Petitioner, who was employed
by respondent as a baggage handler, was on this platform
for the purpose of transporting baggage from the incoming
train. He was using a hand cart, referred to in the evidence as a "flat wagon," which was 14 feet 8 inches long
(including the handlebars at either end), 3 feet 8 inches
wide, and supported in the center by an axle riding on
two 26-inch wheels, operating both as a fulcrum and a
pivot. Being some distance south of the point at which
the baggage car was to be stopped for unloading, petitioner started pulling his cart to the north along the east
side of the platform and adjacent to the moving train.
After so proceeding a short way, he observed a 4-wheel
wagon standing on the east side of the platform, slightly
north and east of one of the roof supports, making it
necessary for him to turn his cart to the left and to pass
on the west half of the platform. At that time another
hand cart, a few feet to the left and ahead of him, was
also being moved to the north over the west half of the
platform. In changing the course of his cart, petitioner
pulled its north end to the west at such an angle as caused
its south end to be pivoted and swung to the east against
the third car of the moving train which, in turn, caused
him to be thrown to the west against a car standing on
track 4 and to be injured. Other wagons were on the
platform but were either some distance behind or ahead '
of petitioner and had no connection with this occurrence.
It cannot be, and is not, denied that the casualty resulted solely from the-collision of.the cart with the moving

train. What caused this to happen? Petitioner admits
that ifwas the turn of the cart that did so. He also admits
that the turn was made by his own hand. How then may
it be said that any act of respondent caused or contributed
to cause the south end of the cart to collide with the
moving train? Petitioner attempts to attribute his conduct in some way to the presence of the other hand cart
which was being pulled to the north a few feet ahead
and to the west of him, saying that except for its presence
he "could have made that turn easy." Yet he admits
not only that there was no contact between that cart
and his, but also that it was moving ahead and away from
him. Surely thle presence of that moving cart at that
place did not constitute negligence. Do not these admitted and indisputable physical facts show that the
casualty was not one "resulting in whole or in part from
the negligence of" respondent? Do they not show that
the casualty was one "resulting in whole" from the negligence of petitioner? The Federal Employers' Liability
Act does not create liability without fault. Liability
under the Act is predicated on both negligence and causation. By.the plain words of ยง 1 of the Act a railroad is
made liable for injuries to its employees "resulting in
whole or in part from, [its] negligence." (Emphasis
added.) 53 Stat. 1404, 45 U. S. C. ยง 51. "The Act does
not make the employer the insurer of the safety of his
employees while they are on duty. The basis of his liability is his negligence, not the fact that injuries occur.
And that negligence must be 'in whole or in part' the
cause of the injury," Ellis v. Union Pacific R. Co., 329
U. S. 649, 653. I submit that the simple facts recited
do not show even a "scintilla" or an "iota" of evidence,
to say nothing of any substantial evidence, of negligence
by respondent. Instead, I insist, they affirmatively show
that it was petitioner's own act in turning the cart at

such an angle as brought its south end into collision with
the moving train that was exclusively "the cause of the
injury." Ibid.
To hold that these facts are sufficient to make a jury
case of negligence under the Act is in practical effect to
say that a railroad is an insurer of its employees. Such
is not the law. For these reasons I dissent.
