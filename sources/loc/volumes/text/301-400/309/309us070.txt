McGOLDRICK, COMPTROLLER OF THE CITY OF
NEW YORK, v. FELT & TARRANT MFG. CO.*
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 45.

Argued January 2, 1940.-Decided January 29, 1940.

Sales of merchandise for which orders were taken within the City
of New York, subject to approval by the vendors in other States,
and delivery of wfiich, following such approval, was made to purchasers in that city, either by direct interstate shipment, or by interstate shipment to the vendor's New York City agency and delivery by the agent to the purchaser after inspection, tests, and
adjustments,-held constitutionally subject to the New York City
sales tax, on the authority of McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal
Mining Co., ante, p. 33. P. 76.

Mr. William C. Chanler, with whom Messrs. Sol Charles
Levine, Edmund B. Hennefeld, and Jerome R. Hellerstein were on the briefs, for petitioner.
A state tax is void under the commerce clause only if in
some way it interferes with the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the several States. That is a question of fact. Each statute must be judged upon its own
facts. Hump Hairpin Co. v. Emmerson, 258 U. S. 290,

New York, v. A. H. DuGrenier,Inc., et al., also on writ of certiorari,

This Court has recently sustained a state tax in a case
involving one of these respondents, under circumstances
identical in every respect with those here presented. Felt
& TarrantMfg. Co. v. Gallagher,306 U. S. 62, 64-66. Cf.
Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S. 167.
It is apparent that both the California and the New
York taxes are upon the consumer, based upon his acquisition of property for consumption. The New York tax
is as much a "use" tax as the California tax, and the California tax is as much a "sales" tax as the New York tax.
Both are taxes on the consumer, both require collection by
the vendor, and both are otherwise identical in substance
and procedure.
Upon the facts, this case is indistinguishable from the
recent case of GraybarElectric Co. v. Curry, 308 U. S. 513.
The fact that the orders for the goods in these two cases
may have been accepted at the home office of the sellers
in other States, does not subject the transactions to the
danger of a greater burden than that borne by the local
transactions.
The order is made in one State and the acceptance
takes place in another. Neither activity has any realistic physical relationship to any locality. The purchaser
might send his order by mail directly to Illinois or Massachusetts instead of delivering it to the seller's local
agent in New York; or the seller might send the order
back to its agent in New York, with its approval, to be
accepted in New York by its agent. All of these are
common business practices. No part of the making of the
contract has any inherently local attributes.
By administrative interpretation and by decision of
the state court, mere contracts of sale or the transfer of
title without transfer of possession are not taxed. Matter

Argument for Respondents.

309 U. S.

of Gunther's Sons v. McGoldrick, 279 N. Y. 148. The
tax is imposed only upon local transfers of title and possession to purchasers.
The rule against multiple taxation has application only
where the validation of a particular tax would necessarily
compel the validation of an identical tax upon the identical counterpart of the identical transaction when imposed by another State. The fact that some different
tax might be imposed upon a different taxpayer and upon
a different phase of the same transaction by another
State, does not subject interstate commerce to the danger
of a burden of multiple taxation not borne by local commerce. The reason is that if such tax is valid its burden
exists independently of the imposition of the tax at bar,
and is a burden which will be equally borne by local
commerce.
An apportioned tax on the making of contracts would
be identical in effect with an apportioned gross receipts
tax. Each State where some part of the activity took
place could impose an apportioned tax upon the transaction, and local transactions would bear the same burden
as interstate transactions.

and collected from a foreign manufacturer and not from
a local purchaser in New York City. The amount of tax
payable by the manufacturer to the City depends entirely
upon the amount of interstate business done, namely, 2%
on all gross sales made in New York City. It is therefore
a direct charge on interstate business and a burden on
such commerce. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, 304 U. S. 307,
311-312; Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305
U. S. 434; Anglo-Chilean Corp. v. Alabama, 288 U. S. 218.
There is also the risk of multiple taxation. Gwin,
White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U. S. 434, 439440.
When the City of New York compels an Illinois corporation, which is not authorized to do business in New
York, to act as a collecting agency for the City, compels
it to file returns, to make reports, and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses, the City is attempting
to exercise its sovereign powers beyond its jurisdiction.
That it can not do without burdening interstate commerce.
Invalidation of this tax would not cause discrimination
against New York manufacturers and merchants.
The orders for the machines were directed to the manufacturer in Illinois, and there accepted or rejected. A
machine by serial number was appropriated to each order
in Illinois and shipped to the purchaser in New York.
The purchaser was billed from Chicago and remitted
directly to Chicago. Thus the elements of local sales are
lacking.
Testing of the machines before delivery to customers
was in furtherance of interstate commerce. Dozier v.
Alabama, 218 U. S. 124; Rearick v. Pennsylvania, 203
U. S. 507; Caldwell v. North Carolina,187 U. S. 622; and

Argument for Respondents.

Mr. John H. Jackson, with whom Mr. Haig H. Davidian was on the brief, for respondents in No. 474.
The tax is violative of the commerce clause because it
imposes a direct and immediate burden upon transactions
constituting interstate commerce. Where the subject
matter of the tax is some integral part of the process of
interstate commerce, the state tax is bad without regard
to discrimination. Upon this point the decisions of this
Court have been consistent from Robbins v. Shelby
County Taxing District, 120. U. S. 489, to the recent decisions in Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, 304 U. S. 307, and
Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U. S. 434.
U. S. Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, 247 U. S. 321, 328;
Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier, 266 U. S. 555, 568 (dissent); Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S.
267; Coverdale v. Arkansas-LouisianaPipe Line Co., 303
U. S. 604; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, 245 U. S.
292; Spalding & Bros. v. Edwards, 262 U. S. 66, 69;
Cooney v. MountainStates Tel. Co., 294 U. S. 384, 393.
The tax is violative of the commerce clause because it
exposes the manufacturer to the danger of double taxation
on the same transaction. The contract of sale was made
in Massachusetts and it is beyond the possibility of dispute that it would be taxable there.
As an economic fact the tax is discriminatory as against
residents of other States and tends substantially to discourage the sale of vending machines in interstate
commerce.
If a State were free to tax the sale of goods in interstate
commerce, provided only that it taxed its own identical
goods at the same rate, the power could easily be used to
exclude goods of a type not locally manufactured in order
to give an advantage to local manufacturers of goods
which could be substituted for them.
Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S. 62, is
not analogous.

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE STONE

309 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These are companion cases to McGoldrick v. BerwindWhite Coal Mining Co., ante, p. 33. As in that case the
question for decision is whether the New York City tax
laid upon sales of goods for consumption as applied to
respondents infringes the commerce clause of the Federal
Constitution.
Upon certiorari to review determinations by the Comptroller of the City of New York, that each of the respondents was subject to the tax, the Appellate Division of
the New York Supreme Court set the levy aside. Matter
of Felt & TarrantMfg. Co. v. Taylor, 254 App. Div. 246;
4 N. Y. S. 2d 615; Matter of A. H. DuGrenier,Inc., 255
App. Div. 961; 8 N. Y. S. 2d 667. The New York Court
of Appeals, without opinion, affirmed the judgment in
each case, 279 N.Y. 678; '18 N.E. 2d 311; 281 N. Y.
608; 22 N. E. 2d 172, but by its amended remittitur declared that the affirmance was upon the sole ground that
the tax infringed the commerce clause of the Federal
Constitution, 280 N. Y. 688; 281 N. Y. 669. The relevant
provisions of the taxing act are set out in our opinion in the
Berwind-White Company case and need not be repeated
here.
Respondent, Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co., an Illinois corporation, with its factory and principal place of business
in that state, manufactures and sells adding and calculating machines known as comptometers. It maintains an
office in New York City, from which its agents solicit in
the city orders for comptometers, which are forwarded
to the Illinois office for approval. If accepted each order
is filled by allocating to it the purchased comptometer
designated by its serial number. It is invoiced to the
purchaser and shipped to the New York City office of
respondent's sales agent, where it is inspected, tested and
adjusted, and then delivered to the purchaser. Remit-

tances are made by the purchaser direct to the Illinois
office. The course of business in soliciting and filling orders so far as now material is that of the same company,
described in Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, 306
U. S. 62.
Respondent, DuGrenier, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with its factory and principal office in that state, is
engaged in the manufacture and sale of automatic :vending machines. They are sold throughout the United
States by an exclusive sales agent, the respondent Stewart
& McGuire, Inc., having an office in New York City.
The sales in the city, when not of machines located at the
New York office, are effected through solicitations of
orders by the agent, which takes from the prospective
purchaser a signed order or a contract for a conditional
sale on partial payment, which is forwarded by the agent
to the Massachusetts office. If accepted there the order
'is filled by shipping the purchased machine by rail or
truck direct to the purchaser in New York City, who pays
the freight.
In both cases the tax was imposed on all the sales of
merchandise for which orders were taken within the city
and possession of which was transferred to the purchaser
there. Decision in both is controlled by our decision in
the Berwind-White Company case. For reasons stated
at length in the opinion in that case the tax so laid does
not infringe the commerce clause. The judgments will
be reversed and the causes remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.

dissent from the judgments in these
cases upon the grounds stated in the dissenting opinion
