SIXTH CIRCUIT.

FOR THE

No. 237. Argued January 5, 1940.-Decided January 15, 1940.

Mr. Elmer McClain for petitioner.
Mr. Kent W. Hughes, with whom Mr. H. E. Garling

PER CURIAM.

This proceeding was instituted by a farmer-debtor pursuant to ยง 75 of the Bankruptcy Act. Under an order of
the District Court, approving an order of the conciliation
commissioner, petitioner's farm was sold to one of the cotrustees of a mortgage upon the property and the sale
was confirmed by the District Court.
A petition for rehearing was denied. Upon appeal to
the Circuit Court of Appeals, that court found that the
purchaser at the sale was not a party to the appeal and

Syllabus.

309 U. S.

Petitioner sought a rehearing upon the
dismissed it.
ground that the purchaser had actual notice of the appeal
and had appeared in the Court of Appeals joining in an
objection to an enlargement of time for filing the record
and also seeking appointment of a receiver or an additional supersedeas bond. Petitioner also asked that if it
be considered that the purchaser was not already before
the court, a citation should be issued to bring him in.
The Court of Appeals denied both applications. Certiorari was granted, 308 U. S. 534.
We are of the opinion that the action of the Court of
Appeals was erroneous. If the court deemed the purchaser to be a necessary party and not before the court,
the motion to issue a citation to him should have been
granted. R. S. 954, 28 U. S. C. 777. Dodge v. Knowles,

Co., 97 F. 2d 61.
The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded to the
Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
