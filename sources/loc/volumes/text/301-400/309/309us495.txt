No. 570.

Argued February 27, 1940.-Decided March 25, 1940.

1. A suit against the United States may be brought only with
consent given, and in the courts designated, by statute. P. 500.
2. The United States, by filing a claim against an estate in a state
probate proceeding, does not subject itself to a binding, though
not enforcible, ascertainment and allowance of a cross-claim
against itself, in excess of set-off. The Thekla, 266 U. S. 328,
distinguished. Pp. 501-504.
3. By taking over the assets of the Fleet Corporation and assuming
its obligations, the United States did not waive its immunity from
suit in a state court on a counter-claim based on the corporation's
breach of contract. P. 505.

United States v. The Thekla, 266 U. S. 328.
The United States voluntarily entered a state court
having jurisdiction in rem over the res of an estate and
asserted, in accordance with the local statutory practice,
a claim against the res. In accordance with the mandatory requirements of the same local practice, a counterclaim was duly asserted and it was thereafter upheld on
the merits. There is no essential difference between the
act of joining in suit in the one case and the act of entry
into court for assertion of claim in the present case. The
principle of The Thekla is applicable to proceedings instituted by the Government in modern courts of law,
equity and admiralty. See American Propeller Co. v.

Louth's to purchase lumber from the Ingram-Day Lumber Company. The Lumber Company obtained a judgment against McLouth for $42,789.96 for breach of this
contract,' and, McLouth having died in 1923, filed its
claim on the judgment in the probate court of St. Clair
County, Michigan. Subsequently the United States obtained a judgment of $40,165.48 against McLouth's administrator,' representing damages for the conversion of
the materials left with McLouth as bailee, and claim on
this judgment was filed in the probate court. The administrator, respondent here, having presented without
success the Lumber Company's judgment to the General
Accounting Office,' sought to set off that judgment
against the judgment of the United States. The probate
court allowed the claim of the United States and denied
the set-off, but its ruling as to the set-off was reversed on
appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court.4 The administrator then petitioned the probate court to grant statutory judgment of the balance due the estate. The court
found that the claim of the United States, with interest,
amounted to $49,442.41 and the Lumber Company's
claim to $73;071.38 and "ordered, adjudged and ascertained" that the United States was indebted to the estate
for the difference, $23,628.97, "and that such indebtedness be and the same is hereby allowed as and determined
to be a proper claim which, is owing to said estate by the

Opinion of the Court.

On this certiorari we are concerned with the question
whether the United States by filing a claim against an
estate in a state court subjects itself, in accordance with
local statutory practice, to a binding, though not immediately enforceable, ascertainment and allowance by the
state court of a cross-claim against itself.
Because of different views of other federal courts as to
the decisions of this Court in the important federal field
of cross-claims against the United States,' we granted

of Claims Act o or the Merchant Marine Act." Execution against property of governmental agencies subjected
to such procedure by statute is sometimes allowed." The
position taken is that the probate court judgment is a
"final determination" of the rights of the litigants, howsoever such rights may later become important. We are
not here concerned with the manner of collection. Such
was the holding of the Supreme Court of Michigan."
The state procedure for the determination of the balance against or in favor of an estate, which was employed
here, was the recognized method of closing an estate at
the time of the probate judgment. The probate judge
was empowered to act as commissioner under the statute
quoted above. 4 His decision unreviewed was considered
final." The determination of the probate court between
private parties was enforceable without reixamination in
the circuit court." Even the right to execution is not
essential to a complete judicial process. 7 The order entered was a final determination of the amounts due the
estate by the United States on this claim and cross-claim
if the probate court had jurisdiction to render the order
against the petitioner.
Whether that jurisdiction exists depends upon the
effect of the voluntary submission to the Michigan court
by the United States of its claim against the estate. As
a foundation for the examination of that question we
may lay the postulate that without specific statutory
consent, no suit may be brought against the United

No officer by his action can confer jurisdiction.19 Even when suits are authorized they must be
brought only in designated courts. 2 The reasons for this
immunity are imbedded in our legal philosophy. They
partake somewhat of dignity and decorum, somewhat of
practical administration, somewhat of the political desirability of an impregnable legal citadel where government as distinct from its functionaries may operate undisturbed by the demands of litigants. A sense of justice
has brought a progressive relaxation by legislative enactments of the rigor of the immunity rule. As representative governments attempt to ameliorate inequalities
as necessities will permit, prerogatives of the government
yield to the needs of the citizen. By the act of March 3,
1797, and its successor legislation, as interpreted by this
Court, cross-claims are allowed to the amount of the
government's claim, where the government voluntarily
sues.2 1 Specially designated claims against the United
States may be sued upon in the Court of Claims or the
district courts under the Tucker Act.2 2 Special government activities, set apart as corporations or individual
agencies, have been made suable freely. When authority
is given, it is liberally construed. 2' As to these matters
no controversy exists.
Respondent contends this immunity extends, however,
only to original suits; that when a sovereign voluntarily

ness it takes the form of a private suitor and thereby
subjects itself to the full jurisdiction of the court. The
principle of a single adjudication is stressed, as is the
necessity for a complete examination into the cross-claim,
despite attendant dislocation of government business by
the appearance of Important officers at distant points.
and the production of documents as evidence, to justify
the allowance of an offset to the government's claim.24
It is pointed out that surprise is not involved as no crossclaim may be proven until after submission to and refusal
by the government accounting officers.25 Respondent
further insists that his position is supported by The
Thekla 2 and subsequent decisions quoting its language.27
Emphasis is placed upon the fact that these probate
proceedings are in rem or quasi in rem " as were the libels
in admiralty in The Thekla.
It is not our right to extend the waiver of sovereign
immunity more broadly than has been directed by the
Congress. We, of course, intimate no opinion as to the
desirability of further changes. That is immaterial.
Against the background of complete immunity we find
no Congressional action modifying the immunity rule in
favor of cross-actions beyond the amount necessary as
a set-off.
The Thekla turns upon a relationship characteristic of
claims for collision in admiralty but entirely absent in
claims and cross-claims in settlement of estates. The
subject matter of a suit for damages in collision is not the
vessel libelled but the collision. Libels and cross-libels
for collision are one litigation and give rise to one

liability."9 In equal fault, the entire damage is divided.
As a consequence when the United States libels the vessel
of another for collision damages and a cross-libel is filed,
it is necessary to determine the cross-libel as well as the
original libel to reach a conclusion as to liability for the
collision. That conclusion must be stated in terms of
responsibility for damages. In The Thekla opinion the
cases of Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission "oand Nassau Smelting Works v. United States "'
were cited in support of the statement that ". . . generally speaking a claim that would not constitute a cause
of action against the sovereign cannot be asserted as a
counterclaim." This Court then said: "We do not qualify the foregoing decisions in any way." In the Smelting
case this Court had said, two weeks before, on a certificate
as to the jurisdiction of the district court to consider a
counterclaim:
"The objection to a suit against the United States is
fundamental, whether it be in the form of an original
action or a set-off or a counterclaim. Jurisdiction in
either case does not exist unless there is specific congressional authority for it. Nor is there doubt that the question is one which involves the jurisdiction of the District
Court as a federal court under the statutes of the United
States, for the jurisdiction of the District Court in this
regard is wholly dependent on such statutes." 2
There is little indication in the facts or language of The
Thek/a to indicate an intention to permit generally unlimited cross-claims. Quotations from The Thekla in
later opinions of this Court are used to illustrate probBowker v. United States, 186 U. S. 135, 139.

lems entirely apart from the one under consideration
here.3"
The suggestion that the order of the probate court is
in reality not a judgment but only a "judicial ascertainment" of credits does not affect our conclusion. No judgment against the United States is more than that. But
such an entry, if within the competence of the court passing the order, would be res judicata of the issue of indebtedness. 4 The suggestion springs from the opinion in
United States v. Eckford." These words there appear:
"Without extending the argument, we adopt the views
expressed by this court in the case of De Groot v. United
States, (5 Wall. 432) decided at the last term, that when
the United States is plaintiff and the defendant has
pleaded a set-off, which the acts of Congress have authorized him to do, no judgment can be rendered against the
government, although it may be judicially ascertained
that, on striking a balance of just demands, the government is indebted to the defendant in an ascertained
amount."
The Court had just written that no action could be sustained against the government without consent and that
to permit a demand in set-off to become the foundation
of a judgment would be the same thing as sustaining the
prosecution of a suit."
The language quoted above
means no more than that no judgment may be entered
against the government even though the court has ascertained, through its processes, that the government is actually indebted to the defendants. The judgment should
be limited to a dismissal of the government's claim.

litigation at a more advanced stage than the present liti" American Propeller Co. v. United States, 300 U. S. 475, 478;

gation has reached. The United States had sued Eckford's executors on his bond in the District Court for the
Southern District of New York. They pleaded a set-off,
a balance was found in their favor and a judgment entered that the executors were entitled to be paid the
amount found. Suit in the Court of Claims was instituted by the executors, the record was proven, over objection, and judgment entered accordingly. Consequently a reversal of the Court of Claims was the only
step necessary. This Court did not deal with the New
York judgment. 7
We have considered respondent's further argument
that sovereign immunity was waived when the United
States took possession of the assets of its agent the Fleet
Corporation prior to the institution of this action, and
later, but prior to the entry of the probate judgment appealed from, assumed the Corporation's obligations by
the act of June 29, 1936.3" We see nothing in these transactions which indicates an intention to waive the immunity of the United States in the state courts.
