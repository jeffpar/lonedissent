UNITED STATES v. UNITED STATES FIDELITY
& GUARANTY CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 569. Argued February 27, 1940.-Decided March 25, 1940.
In a reorganization proceeding in the District Court for the Western District of Missouri under § 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, the
United States filed a claim in behalf of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. The court allowed it but allowed the debtor's
cross-claim for a larger amount and decreed the balance in favor
of the debtor against the Nations to be "collected in the manner
provided by law." The validity of the judgment to the extent
that it satisfied the principal claim was conceded. In another suit
in Oklahoma by the United States for the Indian Nations against
the surety on a bond given by the debtor, the debtor pleaded the
former judgment as res judicata and asked for a determination of
accounts. Held:
1. The Indian Nations and the United States acting for them are
exempt from suits and also from cross suits, except when authorized,
and in the courts designated, by Act of Congress. P. 512.
2. The judgment, in so far as it undertakes to fix a credit
against the Indian Nations, is void and can not be given the
effect of res judicata in other litigation. P. 512.
3. The immunity from suit of the United States and of Indian Nations in tutelage can not be waived by official failure
to object to the jurisdiction or to appeal from the judgment. In
the absence of statutory consent to the suit, the judgment is subject to collateral attack. Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter
State Bank, 308 U. S. 371, distinguished. P. 513.
4. Where a judgment in the District Court was entered before the effective date of the" Rules of Civil Procedure, questions
as to parties are governed by the Conformity Act. P. 516.
Semble that under the procedure of Oklahoma a principal
in a bond, though he can not compel his admission as a party
defendant in a suit against the surety, becomes such, in effect, if
allowed without objection to file his intervening petition.
5. Under the Act of April 26, 1906, which provided that where
suit is brought in any United States court in the Indian Territory
by or on behalf of any of the Five Civilized Tribes to recover

moneys claimed to be due and owing such Tribe, the party defendants shall have the right to set up and have adjudicated claims

by the Tribe shall be paid by the Treasurer of the United

MR. JUSTICE REED

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This certiorari brings two questions here for review:
(1) Is a former judgment against the United States on a
cross-claim, which was entered without statutory authority, fixing a balance of indebtedness to be collected
as provided by law, res judicata in this litigation for collection of the balance; and (2) as the controverted former
judgment was entered against the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, appearing by the United States, does the
jurisdictional act of April 26, 1906, authorizing adjudication of cross demands by defendants in suits on behalf of
these Nations, permit the former credit, obtained by
the principal in a bond guaranteed by the sole original
defendant here, to be set up in the present suit.
Certiorari was granted 1 because of probable conflict, on
the first question, between the judgment below and
Adams v. United States 2 and because of the importance
of clarifying the meaning of the language in United
States v. Eckford' relating to the judicial ascertainment

of the indebtedness of the Government on striking a balance against the United States where cross-claims are involved. A somewhat similar question arises in United
States v. Shaw.' The second question was taken because
its solution is involved in certain phases of this litigation.
The United States, acting for the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, leased some coal lands to the Kansas and
Texas Coal Company, with the respondent United States
Fidelity and Guaranty Company acting as surety on a
bond guaranteeing payment of the lease royalties. By
various assignments the leases became the property of
the Central Coal and Coke Company, as substituted
lessee, the Guaranty Company remaining as surety. The
Central Coal and Coke Company went into receivership
in the Western District of Missouri, and the United
States filed a claim for the Indian Nations for royalties
due under the leases. Answering this claim, the Central
Coal and Coke Company denied that any royalties were
owing and claimed credits against the Nations for
$11,060.90. By order of the court, reorganization of the
Coal Company under § 77B of the Bankruptcy Act was
instituted and the trustee took possession from the receivers. In the reorganization proceedings the claim of
the Nations was allowed for $2,000, the debtor's crossclaim was allowed for $11,060.90, and the court on February 19, 1936, decreed a balance of $9,060.90 in favor of
the debtor, to be "collected in the manner provided by
law." No review of this judgment of the Missouri district court was ever sought.
On December 24, 1935, the United States, on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Indian Nations, filed the
present suit in the Eastern District of Oklahoma against
the Guaranty Company, as surety on the royalty bond,
for the same royalties involved in the Missouri proceed'Ante, p. 495.

ings. After the judgment of the Missouri district court,
the Guaranty Company pleaded that judgment as a bar
to recovery by the United States. The trustee of Central
Coal and Coke Company, and the Central Coal and Coke
Corporation, which had taken over certain interests in
the assets of the Coal Company, alleged by a petition for
leave to intervene, and, upon its allowance without objection, by an intervening petition, that they were necessary
and proper parties because each had an interest in the
judgment of the Missouri court; they pleaded the Missouri judgment as determinative and pleaded the merits
of the counterclaims by setting up the facts which supported the judgment; they asked for a decree that the
Missouri judgment was valid, for a determination of accounts between themselves and the Indian Nations, and
for all other proper relief. Replying to the answer of
the surety and the petition of the interveners, the United
States pleaded that the Missouri judgment was void as
to the interveners' cross-claims because the court was
''without jurisdiction to render the judgment" against
the United States and denied the cross-claims on the
merits. The district court concluded that the Missouri
judgment barred the claim against the surety and entitled the interveners to a judgment against the Indian
Nations in the amount of the balance found by the Missouri court. This judgment the Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed.'
A.-By concession of the Government the validity of
so much of the Missouri judgment as satisfies the Indian
Nations' claim against the lessee is accepted. This concession is upon the theory that a defendant may, without
statutory authority, recoup on a counterclaim an amount
equal to the principal claim.'

B.-We are of the view, however, that the Missouri
judgment is void in so far as it undertakes to fix a credit
against the Indian Nations. In United States v. Shaw I
we hold that cross-claims against the United States are
justiciable only in those courts where Congress has consented to their consideration. Proceedings upon them
are governed by the same rules as direct suits. In the
Missouri proceedings in corporate reorganization, the
United States, by the Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes for the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, filed
a claim on behalf of the Indian Nations. This it is authorized to do.8 No statutory authority granted jurisdiction to the Missouri Court to adjudicate a cross-claim
against the United States.' The public policy which exempted the dependent as well as the dominant sovereignties from suit without consent 1 9 continues this immunity
eyen after dissolution of the tribal government. These
Indian Nations are exempt from suit without Congressional authorization." It is as though the immunity
which was theirs as sovereigns passed to the United
States for their benefit, as their tribal properties did.

Opinion of the Court.

506

Possessing this immunity from direct suit, we are of the
opinion it possesses a similar immunity from cross-suits.
This seems necessarily to follow if the public policy which
protects a. quasi-sovereignty from judicial attack is to be
made effective. The Congress has made provision for
cross-suits against the Indian Nations by. defendants. 2
This provision, however, is applicable only to "any United
States court in the Indian Territory." Against this conclusion respondents urge that as the right to file the claim
against the debtor was transitory, the right to set up the
cross-claim properly followed the main proceeding. 3 The
desirability for complete settlement of all issues between
parties must, we think, yield to the principle of immunity. The sovereignty possessing immunity should not be
compelled to defend against cross-actions away from its
own territory or in courts not of its own choice, merely
because its debtor was unavailable except outside the
jurisdiction of the sovereign's consent. This reasoning is
particularly applicable to Indian Nations with their unusual governmental organization and peculiar problems.
But, it is said that there was a waiver of immunity by
a failure to object to the jurisdiction of the Missouri
District Court over the cross-claim. It is a corollary to
immunity from suit on the part of the United States and
the Indian Nations in tutelage that this immunity cannot
be waived by officials. If the contrary were true, it
would subject the Government to suit in any court
in the discretion of its responsible officers. This is not
permissible. 4

The reasons for the conclusion that this immunity may
not be waived govern likewise the question of res
judicata. As no appeal was taken from this Missouri
judgment, it is subject to collateral attack only if void.
It has heretofore been shown that the suability of the
United States and the Indian Nations, whether directly
or by cross-action, depends upon affirmative statutory
authority. Consent alone gives jurisdiction to adjudge
against a sovereign. Absent that consent, the attempted
exercise of judicial power is void. The failure of officials
to seek review cannot give force to this exercise of judicial
power. Public policy forbids the suit unless consent is
given, as clearly as public policy makes jurisdiction exclusive by declaration of the legislative body.1" Chicot
County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank 16 is
inapplicable where the issue is the waiver of immunity.
In the Chicot County case no inflexible rule as to collateral objection in general to judgments was declared.
We explicitly limited our examination to the effect of a
subsequent invalidation of the applicable jurisdictional
statute upon an existing judgment in bankruptcy. 7 To
this extent the case definitely extended the area of adjudications that may not be the subject of collateral
attack. No examination was made of the susceptibility
to such objection of numerous groups of judgments concerning status, 8 extra-territorial action of courts, 9 or
strictly jurisdictional and quasi-jurisdictional facts."0 No
solution was attempted of the legal results of a collision
between the desirable principle that rights may be ade"Kalb v. Feuerstein,308 U. S. 433.

quately vindicated through a single trial of an issue and
the sovereign right of immunity from suit. We are of
the opinion, however, that without legislative action the
doctrine of immunity should prevail.
C.-The conclusion that the Missouri judgment is void
determines this review. There is left in the case, however, an issue which requires brief reference to the second
question upon which certiorari was granted. The intervening petition set up the facts supporting the claim of
the interveners against the Indian Nations. An issue
was made and the evidence of the Missouri controversy
stipulated for consideration in the present case. As the
district court determined that the Missouri judgment
was valid, no finding or conclusion appeared in the judgment of the district court upon the merits. Respondents
made no objection to this omission but call attention to
it in their brief. On a new trial this issue obviously
will be important.
It is the contention of the Government that the crossclaim cannot be liquidated in this proceeding for the reason that by the statute under which this suit is brought,
the right to set up a cross-claim is limited to "party defendants." 1 Respondents' reply that as they were admitted as interveners without objection, as they have
an interest in cross-claims arising from the same transactions which form the basis of the principal suit, and as
one of them is a principal liable for any judgment against
S34 Stat. 137, § 18:
"Where suit is now pending, or may hereafter be filed in any United
States court in the Indian Territory, by or on behalf of any one or
more of the Five Civilized Tribes to recover moneys claimed to be
due and owing to such tribe, the party defendants to such suit shall
have the right to set up and have adjudicated any claim it may have
against such tribe; and any balance that may be found due by any
tribe or tribes shall be paid by the Treasurer of the United States out
of any funds of such tribe or tribes upon the filing of the decree of the
court with him."

the defendant surety, they are to all intents and purposes
defendants under § 18 of the Act of April 26, 1906.
As this judgment was entered before the effective date
of the Civil Rules, procedure as to parties was governed
by the Conformity Act. Apparently under Oklahoma
law the principal in the bond could not compel its admission as a party defendant. 3 As the Government did
not object to the order filing the intervening petition,
we assume it properly filed and that the trustee for the
Coal Company was actually a defendant. The name used
is immaterial.
Whether the Coal Company was such a defendant as
was meant by § 18 raises other questions. Since they
depend upon an interpretation of the federal statute they
are to be determined by federal, not Oklahoma, law.24
As the extent and character of the interest of the assignee
Coal Corporation in the unliquidated claims of the Company do not appear from the record, we do not pass upon
the question of whether the Company defendant has any
cross-claim against the Indian Nations, after satisfaction
of the Indian Nations' claim against it or whether, if
there is such a claim, owned jointly with the Corporation,
it is a claim the Company may enforce as defendant
under § 18.
The cause is reversed and remanded to the district
court for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.
