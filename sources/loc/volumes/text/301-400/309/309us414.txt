was not sufficient to warrant the deduction until the

McGOLDRICK, COMPTROLLER OF THE CITY OF

C
CERTIORARI TO THE, SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 473.

Reargued February 27, 1940.-Decided March 25, 1940.

1. The tax imposed by ยง 601 of the Revenue Act of 1932 on importation of crude petroleum is by force of the provisions of that
section to be treated as a duty imposed by the Tariff Act of
1930, which in turn incorporated, by reference, customs regulations relating to the entry of merchandise in bonded manufacturing warehouses for exportation or disposition as ships' stores;
section 630 of the Revenue Act (amendment of 1933) exempts from
tax any article sold for use as fuel, ships' stores, -etc., on vessels
actually engaged in foreign trade, and, read in conjunction with
the Tariff Act, provides that articles manufactured from imported
articles and laden for use on vessels engaged in foreign commerce
under customs regulations are to be duty free and considered or
held to be exported for the purpose of drawback provisions of
ยง 601 of the Revenue Act and ยง 309 [b] of the Tariff Act. P. 423.
2. Under these provisions, oil imported in bond in the crude form
into a State, converted into fuel oil in a bonded warehouse, and
withdrawn duty free for sale for fuel to a vessel engaged in
foreign trade, is from the time of importation until the moment
of lading on the vessel, segregated from the common mass of

Statement of the Case.

property within the State and subject to the supervision and
control of federal customs officials. P. 425.
3. A customs regulation providing that "imported goods in a bonded
warehouse are exempt from taxation under the general laws of
the several States" was incorporated in the Tariff Act of 1930 by
reference, and when applied to the facts of the present case, states
only what is implicit in the Congressional regulation of commerce
presently involved. Pp. 426, 429.
4. The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1932, read with those of
the Tariff Act of 1930 and with other statutes and regulations,
afford a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of the importation of crude petroleum and of its control while in the course of
manufacture in bond into fuel oil and its delivery as ships' stores
to vessels in foreign commerce, all calculated to insure the devotion
of the manufactured oil exclusively to that purpose. P. 426.
5. The statutes and regulations taken together operate as regulations of foreign commerce. P. 427.
6. The purpose of the exemption from the tax laid upon importation
of crude petroleum when it or its product is used as ships' stores
by vessels engaged in foreign commerce is, first, to encourage importation of crude oil for such use and thus to enable American
refiners to meet foreign competition and to recover trade which
had been lost by the imposition of the tax, and, secondly, to promote foreign commerce through the sale of tax-free fuel to vessels
engaged in it. P. 427.
7. The adoption of these means of regulating and promoting foreign
commerce was within the Congressional power. P. 427.
8. The laying of a duty on imports, although an exercise of the taxing power, is also an exercise of the power to regulate foreign
commerce. The exemption of imports from the duty or the allowance of a drawback when they are devoted to particular purposes
or uses, or when they are exported or otherwise sent out of the
country, is likewise a regulation of foreign commerce. P. 428.
9. New York City sales tax imposed on sales to vessels engaged in
foreign commerce of fuel oil manufactured from imported crude
petroleum in bond, held invalid as an infringement of the Congressional regulation of the commerce. Pp. 423-428.
281 N. Y. 647; 22 N. E. 2d 480, affirmed.

Mr. Paxton Blair, with whom Messrs. William C.
Chanler and Sol Charles Levine were on the brief, for
petitioner.
The constitutional provision against state taxation of
imports is not contravened by a sales tax (1) imposed
after the imported goods have, through processing, undergone a radical change, and (2) imposed not on the importer but on the purchaser after the goods have left
the bonded warehouse. Gulf Fisheries Co. v. Macnerney, 276 U. S. 124; H. P. Hood & Sons v. Commonwealth, 235 Mass. 572, 576-577; Standard Oil Co. v.

McGOLDRICK v. GULF OIL CORP.
414

Argument for Petitioner.

The circumstances under which ยง 630 was added to the
Revenue Act of 1932 support the conclusion, inferable
from the text itself, that Congress did not intend to
interfere with state powers of taxation.
Section 630 has none of the attributes of a regulatory
measure. It confers an exemption, and reflects the conclusion of Congress that the original 1932 Act did more
harm than good. In rescinding its former action, Congress has simply refrained from taxing this particular
commodity. How can imposing and then lifting a' tax
be regulation, when nonaction ab initio would not be
such?
Legislative history of a statute can not affect its interpretation when the meaning is clear. Kuehner v. Irving
Trust Co., 299 U. S. 445, 449. Extraneous aids are only
admissible to solve doubt. Wisconsin Railroad Comm'n
v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563, 589. Moreover,
the congressional documents relied on by respondent
give no hint of intent to affect state taxation.
An intention to supersede state tax laws is not to be
left to inference and conjecture. Savage v. Jones, 225
U. S. 501, 533; Welch Co. v. New Hampshire, 306 U. S.
79, 85; Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S.
466, 479-480; Palmer v. Massachusetts, 308 U. S. 79,
83-84. See also FederalHousing Administration v. Burr,
309 U. S. 242.
The fact that Congress has extended the federal regulatory power to a given industry will not support an
inference of intention to remove it from the state taxing
power. Federal Compress & Warehouse Co. v. McLean,
291 U. S. 17, 22-23; Minnesota v. Blasius, 290 U. S. 1;
National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin
Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 35.
The proposition that Congress can declare a local
transaction to be a part of foreign commerce, and oompel
the State to keep hands off, is unsanctioned by the Con215234--40-27

stitution and the decisions of this Court. See Pipe Line
Cases, 234 U. S. 548, 560-561.
"Exports" is a constitutional term and is to be given
its ordinary meaning. Congress can not enlarge the concept and thereby curtail the taxing powers of the States.
Cf., Thompson v. United States, 142 U. S. 471, 477;
Ribble, State and National Control over Commerce,
p. 232.
The immunity from state taxation enjoyed by bonded
goods is no greater than that which such goods enjoy
by virtue of the Import-Export clause of the Constitution.
States furnish police and fire protection to goods in
bonded warehouses, and the owners of such goods remain under a correlative duty to pay state taxes,-excepting goods in the original packages. See Thompson v.
Kentucky, 209 U. S. 340, 347.
The owner could have paid the tax, and on proof that
the oil had been sold as sea stores could have applied for
a drawback. That would not have interfered with the
state's power. It is unreasonable to regard that power
as present or absent according to the method of gaining
federal tax exemption selected by the owner.
The language of Art. 942 (d) as to state taxation is
an elliptic and infelicitous abstract of the original package doctrine. Note the marginal citations accompanying
it. Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29; Blount v. Munroe, 60 Ga.
61; Clarke v. Clarke, 3 Woods 408; State v. Pinckney,
44 So. Car. Law 474.
The oil came to such a stop as subjected it to state
taxation. Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 527, 528; General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211, 230-231; Bacon v.
Illinois, 227 U. S. 504, 515-516; Susquehanna Coal Co.
v. South Amboy, 208 U. S. 665, 669; Minnesota v.
Blasius, 290 U. S. 1, 9. Cf., McGoldrick v. BerwindWhite Coal Mining Co., 309 U. S. 33.
The tax is not a forbidden burden on foreign commerce,
since (1) the fuel oil does not become an instrument of

McGOLDRICK v. GULF OIL CORP.
414

Argument for Petitioner.

commerce until after the incidence of the tax, and (2) the
tax is non-discriminatory. Moreover, since the fuel oil
came into existence in New York City and passed into
the ultimate consumer's hands in New York City, the
possibility of multiple taxation is absent.
The status of the oil is similar to that of gasoline sold
to interstate airplanes. Eastern Air Transport, Inc. v.
Tax Commission, 285 U. S. 147; Edelman v. Boeing Air
Transport, Inc., 289 U. S. 249. See Nashville, C. &
St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249, 267.
That the oil was to be used eventually to propel vessels in foreign commerce is immaterial, for at the moment
of taxation that commerce had not yet begun. McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., 309 U. S.
33. Cf., Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S.
167. Dist'g Helson v. Kentucky, 279 U. S. 245.
Goods taken on board as ships' stores are not deemed
"exported." Swan & Finch Co. v. United States, 190
U. S. 143. See also United States v. Chavez, 228 U. S.
525; Dooley v. United States, 183 U. S. 151; United
States v. Hill, 34 F. 2d 133; Kennedy v. United States,
95 F. 127; West India Oil Co. v. Sancho, 108 F. 2d 144.
If sea stores were exports, the addition of ยง 630 to the
Revenue Act would have been unnecessary, exemption
having been conferred by ยง 313 of the Tariff Act of
1930.
The tax is not selective, but equal. It does not aim at
or discriminate against any phases of the export trade.
In Peck & Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 165, 173, the Court
upheld a tax on an exporter's net income.
The tax is based on the sale of something which never
was either an export, or a symbol for an export, or part
of the processes of exportation. Cf., Turpin v. Burgess,
117 U. S. 504, 507.
The exemption attaches to the export and not to the
article before its exportation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

309 U. S.

The tax affects foreign commerce only incidentally and
remotely.
The vice of the argument for statutory ratification of
Art. 942 (d) of the Regulations is that the allusions
in the statutes to the regulations are specific rather than
general, and evidence no intent to ratify a regulation
like Art. 942 (d).
Congress itself must have regarded fuel oil sold for
ships' stores as not an export, for it has imposed taxes
thereon, though having no more power than the States
to tax exports.
Mr. Matthew S. Gibson for respondent.
By leave of Court, Messrs. George deForest Lord and
Woodson D. Scott, as amici curiae, filed a brief on behalf
of the Cunard White Star, Ltd., challenging the validity
of the tax.
MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Comptroller of the City of New York determined
that respondent was subject to a New York City tax
laid upon sales in 1934 and 1935 of fuel oil manufactured
in New York City, from crude petroleum, which had been
imported from a foreign country to New York, and there
sold and delivered as ships' stores to vessels engaged in
foreign commerce. Upon certiorari to review the Comptroller's determination, the Appellate Division of the
New York Supreme Court held that the taxing statute
as applied infringed the power of Congress to regulate
foreign commerce which it had exercised by statutes
regulating the control and disposition of the imported
oil. 256 App. Div. 207; 9 N. Y. S. 2d 544.
The New York Court of Appeals affirmed without
opinion, 281 N. Y. 647; 22 N. E. 2d 480, but by its
amended remittitur declared that the affirmance was
upon the ground, and none other, that the tax as applied

Opinion of the Court.

violated the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution,
Article I, ยง 8, Clause 3, Article I, ยง 10, Clause 2, which
commands that no state shall lay any imposts or duties
on imports or exports, and Article VI, Clause 2, making
the "Constitution and laws of the United States which
shall be made in pursuance thereof . . . the supreme law
of the land."1 We granted certiorari upon a petition
which challenged the several grounds of decision as defined by the amended remittitur of the Court of Appeals,
the questions presented being of public importance.
The taxing enactment, Local Law No. 24 of 1934 (published as Local Law No. 25) is that of the municipal assembly of the City of New York, adopted pursuant to
authority of Chapter 815 of the New York Laws of 1933,
as amended by Chapter 873 of New York Laws of 1934.
Its details were recently discussed in our opinion in
McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., ante,
p. 33, and it is unnecessary to repeat them here. It
suffices to say that it lays a tax on purchasers for consumption of tangible personal property at the rate of 2
per cent. of the sales price. The tax is conditioned upon
events occurring within the state, eithtr transfer of title
or possession of the purchased property, or an agreement
within the state, "consummated there" for the transfer of
title or possession. The duty of collecting the tax and
paying it over to the Comptroller is imposed on the seller,
'Certiorari which had been allowed by the Supreme Court of the
United States December 4, 1939, 308 U. S. 545, before the amendment
of the remittitur by the New York Court of Appeals, was dismissed
January 15, 1940, ante, p. 2, on the ground that in the absence of an
explicit statement by the Court of Appeals that it had annulled the
assessment of the tax solely because of the violation of the Federal
Constitution, the Court was unable to find that the decision of the
highest court of the state did not rest upon an adequate non-federal
ground. On motion for rehearing, based on the amended remittitur
of the Court of Appeals, the order of dismissal was, on February 5,
1940, vacated and the cause restored to the docket, post, p. 692.

309 U. S.

who must pay it whether he collects it or not, in addition
to the duty imposed upon the buyer to pay the tax to the
Comptroller when not so collected.
The material facts are not in dispute. In 1934 and
1935 respondent's predecessor imported crude petroleum
from Venezuela and made customs entry of it for its own
manufacturing warehouse in New York City, pursuant to
its bonds known as "Proprietor's Manufacturing Warehouse Bond, Class 6," given to the United States under
the warehouse laws of the United States and treasury
regulations. The bonds were given for the purpose of
enabling the importer, under statutes of the United States
and treasury regulations, to bring the petroleum into the
United States, to manufacture it while in bond into fuel
oil and then to withdraw it for export or other lawful purpose free of the import duty which would otherwise be
payable. The bonds were conditioned, among other
things, upon compliance with laws and regulations relating to the custody and safekeeping of the imported
merchandise and its products held in bond, and to its
lawful withdrawal from the warehouse under permit of
the collector of the customs within the time permitted by
law.
The tax in question was laid on the sale of bunker "C"
fuel oil, manufactured in respondent's bonded warehouse
from the imported oil and delivered alongside foreign
bound vessels in New York City which purchased the oil
as ships' stores for consumption as fuel in propelling them
in foreign commerce.
Petitioner argues that the tax imposed on the purchaser
for consumption of the fuel oil after it had been changed
radically by manufacture from the imported oil, and after
it had been withdrawn from the bonded warehouse, is not
a prohibited tax on imports and does not contravene any
policy which the laws of the United States have
sanctioned.

McGOLDRICK v. GULF OIL CORP.
414

Opinion of the Court.

For present purposes we may assume, without deciding,
that had the crude oil not been imported in bond it
would, upon its manufacture, have become a part of the
common mass of property in the state and so would have
lost its distinctive character as an import and its constitutional immunity as such from state taxation. See
Gulf Fisheries Co. v. MacInerney, 276 U. S. 124, 126;
Waring v. The Mayor, 8 Wall. 110; May v. New Orleans,
178 U. S. 496; New York ex rel. Burke v. Wells, 208
U. S. 14. Respondent rests its argument on different
considerations growing out of the control over the foreign
commerce involved in the importation of the oil and its
ultimate disposition as ships' stores of vessels engaged in
foreign commerce, which Congress has exercised in pursuance of a national policy with which, it is insisted, the
tax conflicts. Expression of this policy, it is urged, is
to be found in the statutes of the United States, read in
light of their legislative history, -exempting the imported
oil from federal taxation, otherwise imposed, if it is sold
for use as fuel on vessels engaged in the foreign trade, and
in the measures taken in statutes and regulations to make
that policy effective by segregating the oil under the
direction of customs officers of the United States from
the time of its importation until it is delivered to the
purchasing vessel.
The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1932 laying a
tax on the importation of crude petroleum and granting
exemptions, and the related provisions of the Tariff Act
of 1930 and the applicable treasury regulations support
this contention.
Section 601 (a), (c) (4) of the Revenue Act of 1932,
47 Stat. 169, 260, lays a tax "with respect to the importation" of crude petroleum of one-half cent per gallon
unless otherwise provided by treaties of the United
States, and ยง 601 (b) declares that the tax imposed
"shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid in the same

309 U. S.

manner as a duty imposed by the Tariff Act of 1930 and
shall be treated for the purposes of all provisions of law
relating to the customs revenue as a duty imposed by
such Act. . . ." Section 630 of the Revenue Act of 1932,
added by amendment of June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 256, declares that no tax under ยง 601 shall be laid "upon any
article sold for use as fuel supplies, ships' stores ...
or . . .equipment on vessels .. .actually engaged in
foreign trade . . ." and provides that "articles manufactured or produced with the use of articles upon the
importation of which tax has been paid under this title,
if laden for use as supplies on such vessels shall be held
to be exported for the purposes" of the drawback provision of ยง 601 (b).
Section 309 (a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 590,
690, authorizes the withdrawal, duty free, under regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury of articles from
bonded manufacturing warehouses, for supplies to vessels
of the United States engaged in foreign trade and directs
that no such article shall be landed at any port or place
in the United States or its possessions. By virtue of the
terms already noted of ยงยง 601 and 630 of the Revenue
Act of 1932, these provisions were extended to articles
sold for fuel to vessels engaged in foreign trade, and the
provisions of statutes and regulations relating to withdrawal from manufacturing bonded warehouses 2 for export were thus extended to similar withdrawals of fuel
oil for disposition as ships' stores.'
2Article

829 of the Customs Regulations of 1929, in force when the

Tariff Act of 1930 was enacted and continued as Article 921 of Customs Regulations of 1931, and as Article 919 of Customs Regulations
of 1937, defines Class 6 warehouses as those "for the manufacture in
bond, solely for exportation, of articles made in whole or in part of
imported materials. ...
'Section 311 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 691, under which
respondent's Class 6 bonded warehouse was established and operated,
provided for the manufacture in such warehouse of articles made from

McGOLDRICK v. GULF OIL CORP.
414

Opinion of the Court.

It will be noted that the tax imposed on importation
of crude petroleum by ยง 601 of the Revenue Act of 1932
is, by force of its own provisions to be treated as a duty
imposed by the Tariff Act of 1930, which, in turn, has
incorporated, by reference, customs regulations relating
to the entry of merchandise in bonded manufacturing
warehouses, its manufacture there and its withdrawal
from bonded warehouses for exportation or disposition
as ships' stores; ' that ยง 630, read in conjunction with
ยง 601 (b) and the related provisions of the Tariff Act of
1930 (ยง 309 [b]) provides that articles manufactured
from imported articles and laden for use on vessels engaged in foreign commerce under customs regulations are
to be duty free and considered or held as exported for
the purpose of the drawback provisions of both ยง 601 of
the Revenue Act of 1932 and ยง 309 (b) of the Tariff Act
of 1930.
From the time of importation until the moment when
the bunker "C" oil is laden on vessels engaged in foreign
trade, the imported petroleum and its product, the fuel
oil, is segregated from the common mass of goods and
imported materials and intended for exportation free of duty under
such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury might prescribe, and
also declared that the provisions of ยง 1351 of Title 26, U. S. C. (ยง 3433
of the Revised Statutes) should, so far as practicable, apply to such
bonded manufacturing warehouses. Section 1351 provides for the
manufacture in bonded warehouse of articles from imported materials under such rules as the Secretary may prescribe and under the
direction of the proper customs officer, and directs that no article so
manufactured in a bonded warehouse "shall be taken therefrom except
for exportation under the direction of the proper officer having charge
thereof . . . whose certificate describing the articles . . . shall be received by the Collector of Customs in cancellation of the bonds, or
return of the amount of foreign import duties." See Articles 455, 457,
and 960 of the 1931 Customs Regulations.
'See Articles 455 to 461, Customs Regulations of 1931, cf. Articles
410-414, Regulations of 1915; Articles 433-437, Regulations of 1923

property within the state, and is subject to the supervision and control of federal customs officers.' It cannot
lawfully be removed from the manufacturing warehouse
except for delivery for use as fuel to a vessel engaged
in foreign, commerce and it cannot lawfully be diverted
from such destination and use and cannot, after delivery
to the vessel, be landed in the United States. Throughout, the oil is subject to the obligation of respondent's
bonds that it shall remain under such supervision and
control and shall not be diverted from its ultimate destination as ships' stores.
Article 942 of the Customs Regulations of 1931 provides that "merchandise in bonded warehouse is not subject to levy, attachment, or other process of a State
court . . ." and that "imported goods in bonded warehouse are exempt from taxation under the general laws
of the several States." These regulations, continued in
Customs Regulations of 1937, Art. 940, appeared as Art.
731, Regulations of 1915, and Art. 850 of Regulations
of 1923. They were thus in force when the Tariff Act
of 1930 was adopted and were incorporated by reference,
cf. McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., 283 U. S. 488,
492, by the provisions of ยงยง 309, 311, already noted,
which also adopted the earlier provisions of ยง 1351, Title
26, U. S. C., R. S. ยง 3433, and declared that articles manufactured from imported materials in bonded warehouse
should be placed there under regulations prescribed by
the Secretary of the Treasury.
The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1932, read with
those of the Tariff Act of 1930 and with the statutes and
regulations which we have mentioned, thus afford a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of the importation
of the crude petroleum and of its control while in the

Opinion of the Court.

course of manufacture in bond into fuel oil and its delivery as ships' stores to vessels in foreign commerce, all
calculated to insure the devotion of the manufactured
oil exclusively to that purpose.
The statutes and regulations taken together operate
as regulations of foreign commerce, as the legislative history shows they were intended to do. The Tariff Act of
1930, of which ยง 601 of the Revenue Act of 1932 is in
effect a part, is entitled, "An Act to provide revenue, to
regulate commerce with foreign countries, to encourage
industries of the United States, to protect American
labor, and for other purposes." The obvious tendncy
of the exemption, from the tax laid upon importation of
crude petroleum, when it or its product is used as ships'
stores by vessels engaged in foreign commerce is to encourage importation of the crude oil for such use and
thus to enable American refiners to meet foreign competition and to recover trade which had been lost by the
imposition of the tax. That tendency, and the tendency
of, the sale of tax-free fuel to vessels engaged in foreign
commerce to promote the commerce, were considerations
to be taken into account by Congress in fixing the terms
of the statute, and its adoption as a means of regulating
and promoting foreign commerce was within the Congressional power. Board of Trustees v. United States,
289 U. S. 48.
That such was the purpose of the present legislation
is confirmed by its history. Senate Report No. 58, 73d
Cong., 1st Sess., on the bill which was enacted as ยง 630
of the Revenue Act of 1932, exempting fuel placed on
vessels engaged in foreign commerce from the tax, declared, page 3: "It is believed that this amendment will
enable the American manufacturers to compete more
favorably with their foreign competitors for this business
without any substantial loss of revenue, since the effect
of the present law is to force purchases abroad." It

added that the provisions for drawback of the tax on importation "also relieves American manufacturers from a
competitive disadvantage." From statements made on
the floor of the Senate by the sponsor of the bill it appears
that one purpose of the exemption was to increase the
trade in fuel oil in American ports which had been lost
through purchase of fuel in foreign ports by vessels engaged in foreign commerce following the imposition of
the tax by ยง 601 (c) (4). 77 Cong. Rec., Part III, 32123214.
The laying of a duty on imports, although an exercise
of the taxing power, is also an exercise of the power to
regulate foreign commerce, Hampton & Co. v. United
States, 276 U. S. 394, 411; Board of Trustees v. United
States, supra, 58. The exemption of imports from the
duty or the allowance of a drawback when they are devoted to particular purposes or uses, or when they are
exported or otherwise sent out of the country, is likewise
a regulation of foreign commerce, see Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1, 201, 202; Groves v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. 449, 505.
Customs regulations to insure the devotion of the imports to the intended use are likewise within the Congressional power since such regulations are not only necessary or appropriate to protect the revenue, but are
means to the desired end, the regulation of foreign commerce by insuring that the particular class of exempted
imports are used for the purposes for which the exemption is allowed.
The question remains, whether the present tax conflicts
with the Congressional policy adopted by the Acts of
Congress which we have discussed. As we have seen, the
exemption and drawback provisions were designed, among
other purposes, to relieve the importer of the import tax
so that he might meet foreign competition in the sale of
fuel as ships' stores. In furtherance of that end Congress provided for the segregation of the imported mer-

chandise from the mass of goods within the state, prescribed the procedure to insure its use for the intended
purpose, and by reference confirmed and adopted customs
regulations prescribing that the merchandise, while in
bonded warehouse, should be free from state taxation. It
is evident that the purpose of the Congressional regulation of the commerce would fail if the state were free
at any stage of the transaction to impose a tax which
would lessen the competitive advantage conferred on the
importer by Congress, and which might equal or exceed
the remitted import duty. See, People v. Compagnie
Generale Transatlantique, 107 U. S. 59, 63. The Congressional regulation, read in the light of its purpose, is
tantamount to a declaration that in order to accomplish
constitutionally permissible ends, the imported merchandise shall not become a part of the common mass of taxable property within the state, pending its disposition as
ships' stores and shall not become subject to the state taxing power. The customs regulation prescribing the exemption from state taxation, when applied to the facts of
the present case, states only what is implicit in the Congressional regulation of commerce presently involved.
The state tax in the circumstances must fail as an infringement of the Congressional regulation of the commerce. Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227; People v.
Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,supra, 63; cf. Kelly
v. Washington,302 U. S. 1, 9, 10.
It is unnecessary to consider whether the tax upon the
sale of the oil as ships' stores to vessels engaged in foreign
commerce is in the circumstances of this case an impost
on imports or exports, or a duty of tonnage prohibited by
Article I, ยง 10, Clauses 2 and 3 of the Constitution.
