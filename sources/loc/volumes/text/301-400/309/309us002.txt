Syllabus.

309 U. S.

Petitioner sought a rehearing upon the
dismissed it.
ground that the purchaser had actual notice of the appeal
and had appeared in the Court of Appeals joining in an
objection to an enlargement of time for filing the record
and also seeking appointment of a receiver or an additional supersedeas bond. Petitioner also asked that if it
be considered that the purchaser was not already before
the court, a citation should be issued to bring him in.
The Court of Appeals denied both applications. Certiorari was granted, 308 U. S. 534.
We are of the opinion that the action of the Court of
Appeals was erroneous. If the court deemed the purchaser to be a necessary party and not before the court,
the motion to issue a citation to him should have been
granted. R. S. 954, 28 U. S. C. 777. Dodge v. Knowles,

McGOLDRICK v. GULF OIL CORP.
2

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Paxton Blair, with whom Messrs. William C.
Chanler and Sol Charles Levine were on the brief, for
petitioner.
Mr. Matthew S. Gibson for respondent.
By leave of Court, Messrs. George deForest Lord and
Woodson D. Scott filed a brief on behalf of the Cunard
White Star, Ltd., as amici curiae, challenging the validity
of the tax.
PER CURIAM.

The City of New York, through its Comptroller, assessed a tax against respondent with respect to sales of
oil manufactured in that city in a bonded manufacturing
warehouse, Class 6, established pursuant to the customs
laws of the United States, the crude oil having been imported from Venezuela and the sales of the manufactured
oil having been made to supply fuel to vessels engaged
exclusively in foreign commerce. The Appellate Division, First Department, annulled the determination of the
Comptroller considering the tax to be a burden upon foreign commerce. 256 App. Div. 207. The Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the Appellate Division, without
opinion. 281 N. Y. 647. Certiorari was granted, 308 U. S.
545.
In the absence of an explicit statement by the Court of
Appeals that it annulled the assessment of the tax solely
because of violation of the federal Constitution, we are
unable to find that the decision of the highest court of the
State did not rest upon an adequate non-federal ground.
Jud. Code, ยง 237 (b), 28 U. S. C. 344 (b). Lynch v. New
York, 293 U. S. 52; Honeyman v. Hanan, 300 U. S. 14;
New York City v. Central Savings Bank, 306 U. S. 661.
The writ of certiorari is dismissed for the want of
jurisdiction.
Dismissed.
