No. 19. Argued October 17, 1939.-Decided December 4, 1939.
Opinion on Petition for Rehearing delivered January 15, 1940.
1. A Delaware corporation, pursuant to the laws of Oklahoma, designated an agent for service of process "in any action in the State
of Oklahoma." Held amenable to suit in the federal District
Court in Oklahoma upon a cause of action arising in that State.

2. A determination of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma that its judgments, on appeal from rate orders of the Corporation Commission,
were formerly legislative in character and that they can not be
given the effect of res judicata by the retroactive influence of a
later doctrine of that court characterizing such judgments as
judicial,-held binding on this Court. P. 7.
3. Where an action upon supersedeas bonds given by a gas company
for the security of one of its consumers in connection with its
appeal from a rate order, was pending in a state court and defended
by the company's answer upon the ground that the order violated

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the
Court.

The case concerns a rate controversy which has been
winding its slow way through state and federal courts for

thirteen years.' While the relationship of two utilities
with Wilson & Co., a consumer of natural gas, complicates
the situation, the legal issues before us may be disposed
of as though this were a typical case of a utility resisting
an order reducing its rates.2

Oklahoma Gas & Electric

Company (hereafter called Gas & Electric) appealed to
' A history of the controversy is to be found in Oklahoma Gas &
Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 146 Okla. 272; 288 P. 316; Oklahoma
Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 54 F. 2d 596; Oklahoma
Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., 6 F. Supp. 893;
Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., 292 U. S.
386; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 178 Okla. 604;
62 P. 2d 703; Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas & Electric
Co., 100 F. 2d 770.
'Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. and Oklahoma Gas and Electric Co.,
both engaged in the sale of natural gas in and about Oklahoma City,
had agreed to a division of territory. Under that agreement, Wilson &
Co. bought gas from Gas & Electric. The Oklahoma Corporation
Commission found that Natural Gas had held itself out to provide gas
to industrial consumers at a lower rate than that at which Wilson &
Co. was able to buy from Gas & Electric. The Commission then
ordered Natural Gas to provide Wilson & Co. with its gas at prevailing industrial rates. Both Natural Gas and Gas & Electric resisted
the order. Natural Gas contended that it had never held itself out
to industrial consumers; Gas & Electric claimed that it was being
unconstitutionally deprived of its right to sell to Wilson & Co. at
the higher rate. If, pending appeal from the Commission, the order
were not stayed, Wilson & Co. would have been able to purchase gas
from Natural Gas at the lower rate and Gas & Electric would have
been forced either to lower its rates to meet the competition or to
lose the business.

the Oklahoma Supreme Court from such an order by
the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. The reduction
was stayed pending the appeal, but to protect Wilson &
Co. against a potential overcharge, Gas & Electric gave
a supersedeas bond. Gas & Electric lost its appeal, Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 146 Okla. 272,
288 P. 316, and Wilson & Co. brought suit on the bond.
That suit was instituted on December 3, 1931, in one of
the district courts of Oklahoma. To enjoin prosecution
of the latter suit Gas & Electric on May 20, 1932, invoked
the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the Western District of Oklahoma.' After a complicated
series of moves in both state and federal courts, not necessary here to detail, this relief was granted by the District
Court on September 10, 1937, and on December 19, 1938,
sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Oklahoma
Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co., 100 F. 2d
770. Since the case in part was in conflict with the Second Circuit's decision in Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 103 F. 2d 765, and also presented novel
aspects of important questions of federal law, we granted
certiorari, 306 U. S. 629. We are not concerned with the
merits of the Commission's order.
At the threshold we are met by the procedural objection, seasonably made, that Wilson & Co., a Delaware
corporation, was improperly sued in the District Court
of the Western District of Oklahoma. The objection is
'In 1928 Natural Gas complied with the order; and since that
time Wilson & Co. has been buying gas at the lower rate prescribed
by the Commission. The sole question now involved in these proceedings is the liability of Gas & Electric to Wilson & Co. for alleged
overcharges between 1926 and 1928. The District Court found
specifically that the Corporation Commission had made no threat to
enforce penalties for violations of the 1926 order, and as to the
Commission, declined to grant any injunctive relief. Cf. Oklahoma
Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., 292 U. S. 386, 390.

unavailable. Prior to this suit, Wilson & Co. had, agreeable to the laws of Oklahoma, designated an agent for
service of process "in any action in the State of Oklahoma." Both courts below found this to be in fact a
consent on Wilson & Co.'s part to be sued in the courts
of Oklahoma upon causes of action arising in that state.
The Federal District Court is, we hold, a court of Oklahoma within the scope of that consent, and for the reasons
indicated in Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.,
308 U. S. 165, Wilson & Co. was amenable to suit in the
Western District of Oklahoma.
Petitioners further urge (1) that their plea of res judicata should have been sustained, and (2) that § 265 of
the Judicial Act (Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1162,
28 U. S. C. § 379, derived from § 5 of the Act of March 2,
1793, 1 Stat. 333, 335), was a bar to the suit.
The claim of res judicata is based on the prior determination in 1930 by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma that
the contested order of the Corporation Commission was
valid. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co.,
146 Okla. 272; 288 P. 316. The pronouncements of the
Oklahoma Supreme Court concerning the character of
such a determination-whether under the Oklahoma Constitution it was a "legislative" or "judicial" review-have
for a time, however, been ambiguous and fluctuating.
After the present bill was filed but before the challenged
injunction was decreed, the Oklahoma Supreme Court
had held that its decision in cases like that of Oklahoma
Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., was a judicial judgment. Oklahoma Cotton Ginners' Assn. v. State, 174
Okla. 243; 51 P. 2d 327. But, in Community Natural
Gas Co. v. Corporation Commission, 182 Okla. 137; 76
P. 2d 393, decided after the decree here in issfie, the Oklahoma court formally characterized its review in cases prior
to the decision in the Ginners' case as "legislative," re-

fused to give that decision retroactive effect, and therefore deemed the res judicata doctrine inapplicable to these
prior reviews. Hence, the plea of res judicata in this case
must fail, for on that issue state law is determinative
here. Union & Planters'Bank v. Memphis, 189 U. S. 71;
Covington v. First National Bank, 198 U. S. 100; Wright
v. Georgia Railroad & Banking Co., 216 U. S. 420.
There remains, therefore, the applicability of § 265 of
the Judicial Code.4 That provision would operate as a
bar upon the power of the District Court to enjoin proceedings previously brought in the state court on the
supersedeas bond, if "the only thing sought to be accomplished by this equitable action" is to stay the continuance of that action. Such was the construction placed
upon the bill by the earlier District Court of three judges,
and such was this Court's assumption when the latter decision came here on appeal. Oklahoma Gas & Electric
Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., 6 F. Supp. 893, 895; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., 292
U. S. 386, 389. That case eliminated the Corporation
Commission as party to the litigation. The District
Court to which this Court remanded the matter summarized Gas & Electric's claim by way of answer to the
action brought by Wilson & Co. in the state court as an
attack upon the Commission's order "for substantially
the same reasons as set out" in the present bill.
The present suit, therefore, is one for an injunction "to
stay proceedings" previously begun in a state court. The
decree below is thus within the plain interdiction of an
Act of Congress, and not taken out of it by any of the
exceptions which this Court has heretofore engrafted
upon a limitation of the power of the federal courts dat'Section 265 provides: "The writ of
by any court of the United States to
of a State, except in cases where such
by any law relating to proceedings in

injunction shall not be granted
stay proceedings in any court
injunction may be authorized
bankruptcy."

ing almost from the beginning of our history and expressing an important Congressional policy-to prevent
needless friction between state and federal courts. Compare Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining
Co., 196 U. S.239; Simon v. Southern Railway Co., 236
U. S. 115; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, 254 U. S. 175.
See Warren, "Federal and State Court Interference," 43
Harv. L. Rev. 345, 372-77. That the injunction was a
restraint of the parties and was not formally directed
against the state court itself is immaterial. Hill v.
Martin, 296 U. S. 393, 403. Cf. Kohn v. Central Distributing Co., 306 U. S.531. Steelman v. All Continent
Corp., 301 U. S.278, pressed upon us by respondents and
relied upon below, is plainly inapplicable.
Neither record nor findings below give any other basis
for injunctive relief save the threatened injury implied
in the state court lawsuit; and that could not be enjoined.
The decree below is reversed, with directions to dismiss
the bill.
Reversed.
The CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS and
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS adhere to the views expressed in
their separate opinion in this case.
The separate opinion referred to was delivered December 4, 1939 (see footnote, p. 4), and is as follows:
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES:

I concur in the reversal of the judgment upon the
ground that Wilson & Co., a Delaware corporation, was
not amenable to suit in the federal District Court in
Oklahoma. The question is essentially the same as that
presented in Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.,
308 U. S.165, and what was said in the dissenting opinion
in that case need not be repeated here. (See, as to the
scope of the consent under the Oklahoma statute, the

Opinion of

observations of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Neirbo
case, 103 F. 2d 765, 769.)
But if it be granted that the Delaware Corporation was
amenable to the process in question, I am unable to agree
that the complainants should be denied relief because of
the defense of res judicata. The judgment to which this
effect is given was rendered by the Supreme Court of
Oklahoma in 1930, sustaining, on appeal, an order of the
Corporation Commission requiring gas to be furnished to
Wilson & Co. at a specified rate. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 146 Okla. 272; 288 P. 316.
At the time of that decision, the review by the Supreme
Court of Oklahoma of such an order of the Corporation
Commission was considered to be legislative in character. Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, 261 U. S. 290, 291;
McAlester Gas & Coke Co. v. Corporation Commission,
101 Okla. 268, 270; 224 P. 698; City of Poteau v. American Indian Oil & Gas Co., 159 Okla. 240, 242, 243;
18 P. 2d 523, in which the state court cited with approval
the decision to that effect of the Circuit Court of Appeals
in Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 54 F.
2d 596, 598, 599, applying the Oklahoma decisions. Compare Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing
Co., 292 U. S. 386, 388; CorporationCommission v. Cary,
296 U. S.452, 458. The contention of the complainants
before the state court was that the Commission's order
violated their rights under the Federal Constitution. 146
Okla. 272, 281, 288; 288 P. 316. But in the view, as then
held, that the action of the state court was legislative in
character, no appeal lay to this Court from the state
court's determination of the federal question. Prentis v.
Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S.210, 226, 227; Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, supra. Accordingly, the complainants brought this suit in the federal court to enjoin
the enforcement of the Commission's order.

Opinion of

HUGHES,

C. J.

It was not until several years later (in 1935) that the
Oklahoma Supreme Court decided, in a suit between
other parties, that its action in reviewing such an order
of the Commission was judicial and not legislative in
character. Oklahoma Cotton Ginners' Assn. v. State, 174
Okla. 243; 51 P. 2d 327. The manifest injustice of holding
that complainants are bound by the state court's ruling
in 1930 as a judicial determination, when at that time
under the state court's construction of the state constitution the complainants were not at liberty to treat the
ruling as a judicial determination and to obtain a review
of the federal question by this Court upon that ground,
is not met, as it seems to me, by invoking the general
doctrine of res judicata.
Whether the judgment of a state court is res judicata
is a question of state law. The federal courts are not
bound to give such domestic judgments any greater force
than that awarded them by the courts of the State where
rendered. Union & Planters'Bank v. Memphis, 189 U. S.
71, 75; Covington v. First National Bank, 198 U. S. 100,
109; Wright v. GeorgiaRailroad& Banking Co., 216 U. S.
420, 429. I think that we are not at liberty to assume
that the Oklahoma court would so far depart from the
plain requirements of justice as to preclude in these circumstances a review of the federal question in a court of
competent jurisdiction. The state court has not spoken
to that effect and what the state court has said I think
clearly imports the contrary.
This appears from its decision in Oklahoma Gas &
Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 178 Okla. 604; 63 P. 2d 703.
That was an action in the state court on the supersedeas
bond given on the appeal to the Supreme Court from the
Commission's order in question, and Wilson & Co., the
plaintiff, had judgment. The Supreme Court reversed
that judgment and directed a stay pending the deter-

mination in this very suit in the federal court of the
validity of the Commission's order. The Supreme Court
expressly referred to its decision, in 1935, in Oklahoma
Cotton Ginners' Assn. v. State, supra, that its action in
ieviewing orders of the Commission affecting rates of
public utilities constituted a judicial determination of
the questions involved. But instead of holding that the
ruling in 1930, upon the order now under review, constituted a final adjudication of the validity of that order, the
Supreme, Court held that the question of validity was an
open one for determination by the federal court in the
present suit. After saying that in view of the uncertainty
with respect to the "right to a judicial remedy in the state
courts," the federal court had acquired jurisdiction of this
suit, the state court concluded as follows:
"That remedy was available to them as the only certain method of obtaining a judicial determination of the
validity of the commission's order. The suit was a direct
attack upon such order, and until its validity was established in that suit, the state court was without jurisdiction to proceed with an action based upon such order.
This for the reason that where direct attack in equity is
made upon the order of the commission, the defendants'
liability on such order is not finally determined judicially
until final determination of the equitable action."
If under the state law as thus declared in Oklahoma
upon consideration of the particular circumstances of this
case, liability on the Commission's order is not finally
determined judicially until the determination of that
question in this equity suit, I am at a loss to understand
how the action of the state court on the 1930 appeal
can be regarded as res judicata and thus a bar to that
determination.
The decree below enjoining enforcement of the Commission's order appropriately followed the determination
of its invalidity. The point that the decree should not

have gone further and enjoined the prosecution of the
action in the state court upon the supersedeas bond is
at best only one of technical importance, as the state court
itself enjoined such proceedings pending the determination of this suit, apparently in the view that a determination herein of the invalidity of the order would dispose
of the merits.
