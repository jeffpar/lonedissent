CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 329.

Argued January 12, 1940.-Decided February 26, 1940.

1. The shareholders' liability, "equally and ratably," for the debts of
a joint stock land bank, under § 16 of the Federal Farm Loan
Act, is enforceable only by a single representative suit in equity
in behalf of all the creditors, in which the existence and extent of
insolvency, and the ratable shares of the contribution by shareholders, can be ascertained and an equitable distribution made of
the fund recovered. P. 285.
The suit is not any the less in equity because it turns out that
the liability of the shareholders equals the full par-value of their
stock. P. 286.
2. The test of the inadequacy of the legal remedy prerequisite to
resort to a federal court of equity is the legal remedy which
federal rather than state courts afford. P. 286.
The jurisdiction of federal courts of equity, as determined by
that test, is neither enlarged nor diminished by the names given
to remedies or the distinction made between them by state practice.
3. The Rules of Decision Act embraces rules established by judicial
decision as well as statutory rules, but does not apply to suits in
equity. P. 287.
4. Equity provides its own rule of limitations through the doctrine
of laches, in the absence of any statute of limitations made applicable to equity suits. P. 287.
5. When consonant with equitable principles, federal courts of equity
apply as their own the local statutes of limitations applicable to
equitable causes of action. P. 288.
6. Even though there is no state statute applicable to similar equitable demands, when the jurisdiction of the federal court is concurrent with that at law, or the suit is brought in aid of a legal
right, equity will withhold its remedy if the legal right is barred
by the local statute of limitations. P. 289.
7. Where the federal equity jurisdiction is exclusive and is not
exercised in aid of a legal right, state statutes of limitations barring
actions at law are inapplicable; and in the absence of any state
statute barring the equitable remedy in like cases, the federal court

is remitted to and applies the doctrine of laches as controlling.
P. 289.
8. In the absence of a controlling Act of Congress, federal courts of
equity, in enforcing rights arising under federal statutes, will,
without reference to the Rules of Decision Act, adopt and apply
local statutes of limitations which are applied to like causes of
action by the state courts. P. 293.
9. See. 49 of the New York Civil Practice Act, barring in three
years actions against directors or stockholders of moneyed corporations or banking associations to enforce a liability created by
the common law or by statute, appears to have been construed
by the state courts as inapplicable to suits where the remedy is
exclusively equitable. Held, that the present equitable cause of
action given by § 16 of the Federal Farm Loan Act is not barred
by the three year statute of limitations prescribed by that section.
Pp. 290, 293.
10. The extent to which federal courts, in the exercise of the authority
conferred upon them by Congress to administer equitable remedies, are bound to follow state statutes and decisions affecting
those remedies, is not considered. P. 294.
104 F. 2d 169, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 308 U. S. 541, to review the affirmance of a

decree, 1 F. Supp. 788; 20 id. 930, 936, which overruled
a plea of the statute of limitations and granted relief to
the plaintiffs in a suit to enforce shareholders' liability
for debts of an insolvent joint stock land bank.
Mr. Ralph M. Carson, with whom Messrs. Samuel A.
Pleasants and John B. Coleman were on the brief, for

petitioners.
The three-year limitation bars the action.
No distinction is made between actions in equity and
those at law. Civil Practice Act, § 49; Wright v. Russell,

Nettles v. Childs, 281 N. Y. 636; Schram v. Cotton, 281

N. Y. 499. The ten-year limitation is inapplicable.
Under New York law laches alone is not a defense

against a claim of right. Pollitz v. Wabash R. Co., 207
N. Y. 113. Laches now subsists in New York as an
equitable defense only, in cases where the favor or discretion of the court is sought, and serves to shorten, but

never to extend, the time limited by the statute of limitations. Groesbeck v. Morgan, 206 N. Y. 385, 389; Calhoun
v. Millard, 121 N. Y. 69, 82; Goldberg v. Berry, 231 App.
Div. 165, 170; Coghlan v. Coghlan & Shuttleworth, Inc.,
226 App. Div. 764. The concept of laches supplanting
limitations and thus extending the period in which an
action would otherwise be barred by the statute has been
since at least 1848 utterly foreign to the law of New York.
A fixed limitation of time has been imposed upon every
remedy, legal and equitable. Gilmore v. Ham, 142 N. Y.
1. The New York courts have applied these limitations
strictly, and have refused to vary them even in cases of
hardship. Schmidt v. Merchants Dispatch Co., 270 N. Y.
287; Matter of City of New York, 239 N. Y. 220, 225;
Erickson v. Macy, 236 N. Y. 412, 415; Gilmore v. Ham,
supra; Engel v. Fischer, 102 N. Y. 400; Streeter v. Graham & Norton Co., 263 N. Y. 39.
Laches is a matter of substantive law. It affects the
right, not merely the remedy. To apply such a doctrine
of substantive law in a State where it is no longer recognized, to govern claims of right, is a plain violation of the
rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, and Ruhlin
v. New York Life Ins. Co., 304 U. S. 202. The doctrine
of laches relied upon below is based upon the theory of
a general federal equity jurisprudence, and must fall
with it.
Independently of the New York rule, existing federal
precedents required the application to this case of limitations, rather than laches, by reason of the concurrent
jurisdiction of law and equity.
Jurisdiction herein lies primarily at law by virtue of
the fact that money is the measure of the liability imposed upon petitioners by the statute, 12 U. S. C. § 812.
Weeks v. Love, 50 N. Y. 568, 570; Van Hook v. Whitlock,

one for another." In some cases this language might be
deemed to require an accounting among all the shareholders in order to assure the proportionate payment of his
liability by each, but any such possibility is excluded
here by the fact that the assessment required is 100%.
Each of the defendant shareholders was liable in full.
Under New York Civil Practice Act, § 195, which at the
inception of this action was available to the plaintiffs
under the Conformity Act, 28 U. S. C. § 724, the plaintiffs
could have stated a representative claim at law in the District Court for the benefit of all the creditors, without
resort to equity. McKenzie v. L'Amoureux, 11 Barb. 516;
Kirk v. Young, 2 Abb. Pr. 453; Cherry v. Howell, 4 F.
Supp. 597, 599.
The only reason adduced for maintaining*the exclusive
jurisdiction of equity in this case is that the receiver of a
joint stock land bank can not himself sue to enforce the
shareholders' statutory liability. Wheeler v. Greene, 280
U. S. 49.
The jurisdiction of equity herein is at most concurrent
and does not affect the operation of the statute of limitations at law. Curtis v. Connly, 257 U. S. 260; McDonald
v. Thompson, 184 U. S. 71; Morgan v. Hamlet, 113 U. S.

This Court has applied the statute of limitations at law
to equitable actions in form indistinguishable from the
present. Pollardv. Bailey, 20 Wall. 520; Terry v. Little,

Opinion of the Court.

309 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question decisive of this case is whether, in a suit
brought in the federal district court in New York to
enforce the statutory liability of shareholders of a joint
stock land bank for its debts, the court rightly declined
to apply the three-year state statute of limitations.
Respondents Todd, Work and Weiss, copartners, in
behalf of themselves and other creditors of the insolvent
Ohio Joint Stock Land Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio, brought
suit in the District Court for Southern New York against
petitioners, copartners, to enforce their liability as record
shareholders of the bank under § 16 of the Federal Farm
Loan Act, 39 Stat. 374, 12 U. S. C. § 812. Petitioners,
among other defenses, pleaded the New York three-year
statute of limitations. § 49 (4) N. Y. Civil Practice Act.
The district court found, as is conceded here, that the
cause of action accrued April 6, 1928; that plaintiffs in
the suit had notice of its accrual on April 15, 1928, and
that the suit was commenced three years and eight
months later, on December 16, 1931. It overruled the
plea of limitations and gave judgment for respondents.
1 F. Supp. 788; 20 F. Supp. 930, 936. The Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 104 F. 2d 169.
Both courts, holding that the suit was exclusively
within the equity jurisdiction of the court, ruled that the
doctrine of laches and not the state statute of limitations
was applicable, and held that respondents had not been
guilty of laches. We granted certiorari, 308 U. S. 541,
limited to the question of the application of the New
York statute, upon a petition which challenged the decision below as in conflict with the decisions of this Court
applying the three-year statute of limitations in a suit to
enforce the liability of stockholders of a state bank in
Platt v. Wilmot, 193 U. S. 602; cf. as to liability of stockholders of national banks, McDonald v. Thompson, 184
U. S. 71; McClaine v. Rankin, 197 U. S. 154.
MR.

JUSTICE STONE

RUSSELL v. TODD.
280

Opinion of the Court.

Section 16 of the Federal Farm Loan Act provides that
the shareholders of every joint stock land bank "shall be
held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and
not one for another, for all . . . debts . . . of such bank
to the extent of the amount of stock owned by them at
the par value thereof. . . ." Unlike the comparable
provisions of the National Bank Act, R. S. §§ 5151, 5234,
12 U. S. C. §§ 63, 192, which authorize the receiver of a
national bank to enforce the liability of stockholders of
an insolvent national bank assessed against them by the
comptroller of the currency, this section of the Federal
Farm Loan Act confers no power on the receiver of a
farm loan bank to levy an assessment on the stockholders
of an insolvent bank or to maintain a suit to enforce their
liability. Wheeler v. Greene, 280 U. S. 49; Christopher
v. Brusselback, 302 U. S. 500, 502; Brusselback v. Cago
Corporation,85 F. 2d 20.
As the liability of the stockholders as prescribed by this
section is to pay "equally and ratably," the sole remedy
is by plenary representative suit brought in equity in
behalf of all creditors of the bank, in which the existence
and extent of insolvency, and the ratable shares of the
contribution by shareholders can be ascertained and an
equitable distribution made of the fund recovered. But
this amount cannot be determined and its distribution
effected without resort to the procedures traditionally
employed by equity upon a bill for an accounting and
for the distribution of a fund brought into its custody.
No stockholder is liable for more than his proportion of
the debts not exceeding the par value of his stock. His
proportion can be ascertained only upon an accounting of
the debts and of the stock and a pro rata distribution of
the liability among the shareholders and of the proceeds
of recovery among the creditors. Such a suit during its
progress and at its conclusion by a final decree of distribution requires the exercise of powers which are pecu-

liarly those of a court of equity to bring before it in a
single suit all the necessary parties to ascertain their
rights and liabilities, and to adjust and settle them by its
decrees. Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall. 520; Terry v. Little,
101 U. S. 216; Richmond v. Irons, 121 U. S. 27; Christopher v. Brusselback, supra.
When the receiver or officer performing like functions
is authorized by statute to assess the shareholders, the
assessment is binding on them by reason of their membership in the corporation, and each shareholder then
becomes liable in a suit at law for the amount of the
assessment. See Christopher v. Brusselback, supra, 503,
and cases cited. It is for this reason that there is a divergence between the procedure for recovering assessments
of shareholders of national banks, and that for enforcing
the liability of shareholders in a federal land bank. In the
latter case there is no legal remedy, the relief being afforded exclusively in equity. The test of the inadequacy
of the legal remedy prerequisite to resort to a federal
court of equity is the legal remedy which federal rather
than state courts afford. Di Giovanni v. Camden Fire Insurance Assn., 296 U. S. 64; Atlas Life Insurance Co. v.
Southern, Inc., 306 U. S. 563. And the jurisdiction of
federal courts of equity, as determined by that test, is
neither enlarged nor diminished by the names given to
remedies or the distinction made between them by
state practice. Stratton v. St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co.,
284 U. S. 530, 534.
The present suit is not any the less in equity because
it turns out that the liability of the shareholders equals
the full par-value of their stock. The amount of the
liability could not be determined and assessed without
an accounting of assets and liabilities, and distribution
could not be effected among creditors without resort to
the power traditionally that of a court of equity to make
its determination of the rights of the parties effective

Opinion of the Court.

through its decrees in personam. Here the decree directs
payment into court of the amount found to be due, for
distribution among the creditors in conformity to the
further order of the court.
The suit being in equity, brought in a federal district
court, the question decisive of this case is what lapse of
time will bar recovery in the absence of an applicable
federal statute of limitations. The Rules of Decision Act
does not apply to suits in equity. Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 28 U. S. C. 725, directing that the
"laws of the several states" "shall be regarded as rules
of decision" in the courts of the United States, applies
only to the rules of decision in "trials at common law"
in such courts, but applies as well to rules established
by judicial decision in the states as those established by
statute. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64.
From the beginning, equity, in the absence of any statute of limitations made applicable to equity suits, has
provided its own rule of limitations through the doctrine
of laches, the principle that equity will not aid a plaintiff whose unexcused delay, if the suit were allowed,
would be prejudicial to the defendant. Wagner v. Baird,
7 How. 234, 258; Stearns v. Page, 7 How. 819, 828, 829;
Philippi v. Philippe, 115 U. S. 151, 157; United States v.
Beebe, 127 U. S. 338; Curtner v. United States, 149 U. S.
662, 676; Alsop v. Riker, 155 U. S. 448, 460;Abraham v.
Ordway, 158 U. S. 416, 420. In the application of the
doctrine of laches it recognized that prejudice may arise
from delay alone, so prolonged that in the normal course
of events evidence is lost or obscured; and the English
Court of Chancery early adopted the rule, followed in
the federal courts, that suits to assert equitable interests
in real estate will, without more, be barred after the
lapse of twenty years when ejectment or the right of
entry for the assertion of a comparable legal interest in
the land would be barred. Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10

Opinion of the Court.

309 U. S.

Wheat. 152, 173; Hovenden v. Lord Annesly, 2 Sch. &
Lef. 607. And where resort was had to equity in aid of
a legal right, equity, following the law, would refuse its
aid if the legal right had been barred by the applicable
statute of limitations. Carrot v. Green, 92 U. S. 609;
Godden v. Kimmell, 99 U. S. 201, 210; Wood v. Carpenter, 101 U. S. 135; Philippiv. Philippe,supra; McDonald
v. Thompson, supra; Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence
(4th ed.), § 1441 and cases cited.
In federal courts of equity the doctrine of laches was
early supplemented by the rule that when the question
is of lapse of time barring relief in equity, such courts,
even though not regarding themselves as bound by state
statutes of limitations, will nevertheless, when consonant
with equitable principles, adopt and apply as their own,
the local statute of limitations applicable to the equitable
causes of action in the judicial district in which the case

is heard.

Bacon v. Howard, 20 How. 22, 26; Clarke v.

Boorman's Executors, 18 Wall. 493, 505, 506; Boone
County v. Burlington& M. R. R. Co., 139 U. S. 684, 692;
Pearsall v. Smith, 149 U. S. 231, 233, 237; Benedict v.
City of New York, 250 U. S. 321.'
'But federal courts of equity have not always held themselves
bound to follow local statutes which in ordinary circumstances they
could adopt and apply by analogy. In each case the refusal has been
placed upon the ground of special equitable doctrines, making it
inequitable to apply the statute. Laches may bar equitable remedy
before the local statute has run. Alsop v. Riker, 155 U. S. 448, 460,
461; Abraham v. Ordway, 158 U. S. 416; Patterson v. Hewitt, 195
U. S. 309, 318, et seq.; Badger v. Badger, 2 Clifford 137, 154; Lemoine
v. Dunklin County, 51 F. 487, 492; Kelley v. Boettcher, 85 F. 55, 62;
Pooler v. Hyne, 213 F. 154, 159. On the other hand, time has been
held to be no bar to an equitable suit for a trustee's accounting.
Michoud v. Girod, 4 How. 503, 561; cf. Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall.
87, 92; Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogert, 250 U. S. 483. Federal courts
of equity have not considered themselves obligated to apply local
statutes of limitations when they conflict with equitable principles,
as where they apply, irrespective of the plaintiff's ignorance of his

RUSSELL v. TODD.
280

Opinion of the Court.

Even though there is no state statute applicable to
similar equitable demands, when the jurisdiction of the
federal court is concurrent with that at law, or the suit
is brought in aid of a legal right, equity will withhold its
remedy if the legal right is barred by the local statute of
limitations. It thus stays its hand in aid of a legal right
which, under the Rules of Decision Act, would be unenforcible in the federal courts of law as well as in the state
courts. Wilson v. Koontz, 7 Cranch 202, 205-6;

How. 819; Clarke v. Boorman's Executors, supra, 505;

McDonald v. Thompson, supra; Hughes v. Reed, 46 F.
2d 435; cf. Wagner v. Baird, 7 How. 234; Godden v. Kimmell, supra; Wood v. Carpenter,supra.
But where the equity jurisdiction is exclusive and is
not exercised in aid or support of a legal right, state
statutes of limitations barring actions at law are inapplicable, and in the absence of any state statute barring the
equitable remedy in like cases, the federal court is remitted to and applies the doctrine of laches as controlling.

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

309 U. S.

The question remains whether the court below correctly held that the doctrine of laches and not the local
three-year statute of limitations is -controlling. The
present suit being, as we have seen and as the court below
held, exclusively of equitable cognizance, in that it is
not predicated upon any legal cause of action, the statute
is not one which a federal court of equity will adopt and
apply as a substitute for or a supplement to its own doctrine of laches, unless it is applied to like causes of action
in the state courts.
The present suit was brought in less than four years
after the cause of action had accrued, and it is conceded
that the cause of action is not barred unless by the threeyear statute. Section 49 of the Civil Practice Act provides that "the following actions must be commenced
within three years after the cause of action has accrued: . .. (4) An action against a director or stockholder
of a moneyed corporation, or banking association . . . to
enforce a liability created by the common law or by statute. The cause of action is not deemed to have accrued
until the discovery by the plaintiff of the facts under
which . . . the liability was created." This Court has
recognized that this statute is a bar to actions at law and
has so applied it in suits to recover assessments on shareholders of a bank. See Platt v. Wilmot, supra.
Respondents, admitting that the statute is a bar to suits
at law, argue that it is inapplicable to suits in equity and
that when the remedy at law is so inadequate that resort
must be had to remedies which are traditionally equitable, the limitation is not that of the three-year but of the
ten-year statute, which is made applicable to all actions
for which no limitation is otherwise specially prescribed.
§ 53, N. Y. Civil Practice Act.
At the outset we are confronted with those cases in
which this Court in McDonald v. Thompson, supra, and

RUSSELL v. TODD.
280

Opinion of the Court.

the state courts 2 have recognized and applied the statutory bar to an action at law to equity suits brought in aid
of the legal right to recover an assessment upon stockholders. But as we have seen, those cases are referable
to the doctrine accepted and applied in the federal courts
of equity that equity does not give relief predicated on a
legal right which the statute has barred.
Here the jurisdiction being exclusively in equity to enforce rights cognizable only in equity, statutes barring
legal causes of action, as we have seen, are not controlling
and we turn to the argument of petitioners that the threeyear statute is a bar as well to such suits brought in the
state courts, even though they are suits in which it is
necessary to resort to remedies which are exclusively or
traditionally equitable.
The precise question thus raised appears not to have
been decided by the New York Court of Appeals. In
Mencher v. Richards, 256 App. Div. 280; 9 N. Y. S. 2d
990, which was a stockholders' suit brought against directors of a moneyed corporation for an accounting for
profits gained through their malfeasance in office, the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court held that the
thre'e-year statute did not apply. It pointed out that
the statute relates only to causes of action for which a
money judgment will suffice and not to suits which, al'Schram v. Cotton, 281 N. Y. 499; 24 N. E. 2d 305; Nettles v.

though specifically within the language of the statute,
require resort to the equitable remedy for an accounting,
and that as to them the ten-year statute applies. In so
construing the statute, it followed the rulings of the
Court of Appeals that under the New York statutory
scheme of limitations, suits in equity brought against
corporate directors for an accounting for want of an adequate legal remedy are governed by the ten-year statute
of limitations and not statutes fixing a shorter period of
limitations which would be applicable if the suit were
at law. Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Morse Dry Dock
& Repair Co., 270 N. Y. 86; 200 N. E. 589; Potter v.
Walker, 276 N. Y. 15; 11 N. E. 2d 335.' Cf. Gilmore v.
'In Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co.,
270 N. Y. 86; 200 N. E. 590, the Court of Appeals declared (pp.
89, 90):
"In an action in equity the ten-year limitation prescribed by section 53 of the Civil Practice Act is applicable unless, in a particular
action, a party has a choice of two remedies, one at law, the other
in equity, both complete and adequate, and he selects the action in
equity. In that event the party whose cause of action would be
barred under the six-year statute, if he should elect to proceed at law,
may not enlarge this time by electing to proceed in equity. Such is
the rule where the remedies are concurrent. (Rundle v. Allison, 34

Boorman's Executors, 85 U. S. 493.)
"The exception is not applicable in cases of concurrent jurisdiction,
however, if a party's remedy at law is inadequate and imperfect and
he is required to go into equity to procure complete and adequate
relief. (Rundle v. Allison, supra; Mann v. Fairchild, 14 Barb: 548.)
"If relief may be had at law in an action for damages and in equity
for rescission of a contract on the ground of fraud with a reconveyance of land and an accounting for profits, the action in equity is
subject to the ten-year limitation though the action for damages is
barred under the six-year statute. (Schenck v. State Line Telephone
Co., 238 N. Y. 308; 144 N. E. 592.)"
In Potter v. Walker, 276 N. Y. 15; 11 N. E. 2d 335, the court
said (pp. 25, 26):

profits received by directors by reason of wrongful acts, an action

Opinion of the Court.

Ham, 142 N. Y. 1; 36 N. E. 826; Treadwell v. Clark, 190
N. Y. 51; 82 N. E. 505.
In the absence of a definitive ruling by the highest
court of the state, we accept the decision of the Appellate
Division and the reasoning of the Court of Appeals upon
which it rests as persuasive that the three-year statute
does not apply to suits like the present where the remedy
is exclusively equitable. See Wichita Royalty Co. v.
City Bank, 306 U. S. 103, 107.
We take it that in the absence of a controlling act of
Congress federal courts of equity, in enforcing rights arising under statutes of the United States, will without reference to the Rules of Decision Act adopt and apply
local statutes of limitations which are applied to like
causes of action by the state courts. Cf. Mason v.
United States, 260 U. S. 545; Jackson ,County v. United
States, 308 U. S. 343. In thus giving effect to state
statutes of limitations as a substitute or supplement for
the equitable doctrine of laches, it must appear with
reasonable certainty that there is a state statute applicable to like causes of action. As that does not appear
here with respect to the three-year statute, the court beat law would not afford adequate relief. To the extent that an accounting is necessary, the right and the remedy must necessarily be
of an equitable nature. The Appellate Division is, therefore, clearly
right in applying the ten-year Statute of Limitations as to such
causes of action. (Civ. Prac. Act, § 53; Hanover Fire Ins. Co. v.
Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co., 270 N. Y. 86.)"
Wright v. Russell, 269 N. Y. 683, 245 App. Div. 708; 281 N. Y. S.
994; 155 Misc. 877; 280 N. Y. S. 614, and Reisman v. Hall, 257
App. Div. 892; 12 N. Y. S. 2d 442, cited by petitioner, do not qualify
this doctrine. There, although representative actions were brought,
the Illinois constitution under which the liability arose had been
interpreted as permitting actions at law, Golden v. Cervenka, 278 Ill.
409; 116 N. E. 273. Since the legal action would have been barred
within three years, the court, as in McDonald v. Thompson, 184
U. S. 71, and consistently with Potter v. Walker, supra, applied the
same period to the equitable action founded upon it.

Syllabus.

309 U. S.

low rightly declined to give effect to that statute and as
it found that the cause of action was not barred by
laches, it rightly gave judgment for respondents.
Petitioners argue that under New York law, laches is
not a defense to actions like the present and that in the
light of our decisions in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra,
Ruhlin v. New York Life Insurance Co., 304 U. S. 202,
federal courts in the exercise of the equity jurisdiction
conferred upon them by § 24 of the Judicial Code, 28
U. S. C. § 41, are no longer free to apply a different rule.
But in this case laches has not been held to be a defense
and the Court has not declined to give effect to a state
statute shown to be applicable. In the circumstances we
have no occasion to consider the extent to which federal
courts, in the exercise of the authority conferred upon
them by Congress to administer equitable remedies, are
bound to follow state statutes and decisions affecting
those remedies.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS is of opinion that the judgment
should be reversed for the reasons stated in the dissenting
opinion of Clark, J., in the Circuit Court of Appeals.

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

FISCHER v. PAULINE OIL & GAS CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 239.

Submitted December 12, 1939.-Decided February 26, 1940.

1. Where a state supreme court bases its judgment exclusively upon
its construction of a federal statute, expressly declining to consider
an alternative local ground, the judgment is reviewable by this

Court. P. 296.
