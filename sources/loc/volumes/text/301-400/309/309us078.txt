MORGAN, EXECUTOR, v. COMMISSIONER OF
INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

FOR THE

No. 210. Argued January 4, 5, 1940.-Decided January 29, 1940.
A decedent in Wisconsin exercised a power of appointment over
property held in trusts created under the law of that State. The
trusts empowered the trustees to withhold from any beneficiary,
property which in their judgment would be dissipated or be improvidently handled, and gave directions for disposition, in such
event, of what was withheld. Held:
1.That the power exercised was a "general power of appointment" within § 302 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1926, whatever its
characterization-whether "general" or "special"--by the Wisconsin law. P. 80.
State law creates legal interests and rights. The federal
Revenue Acts designate what interests or rights, so created, shall
be taxed.
2. The term "general power of appointment," as used in the
federal Revenue Acts, applies where the donee may appoint to any
person he chooses, including his own estate -or his creditors.
P. 81.
This accords with common acceptation and with administrative construction approved by Congressional re-enactments of the
provisions construed.
3. Assuming that the trustees could withhold the appointed
property from an appointee, the power must still be held general.
The important considerafion is the breadth of the control in the
donee of the power, whatever the nature or extent of the appointee's
interest. P.82.

was on the brief, for petitioner.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Richard H. Demuth, with whom Solicitor General
Jackson, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Messrs.
Sewall Key and Warren F. Wattles were on the brief, for

respondent.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
We took this case because it raises an important question as to the construction of the Revenue Act of 1926,
§ 302 (f), amended by the Revenue Act of 1932,
§ 803 (b).
The question is to what extent and in what sense the
law of the decedent's domicile governs in determining
whether a power of appointment exercised by him is a

general power within the meaning of the statute.
The petitioner is the executor of Elizabeth S. Morgan
who was the donee of two powers of appointment over
property held in two trusts created by her father by will
and by deed. The persons named are, or were, at death,
citizens of. Wisconsin. It is unnecessary to recite the
terms of the trusts. Suffice it to say that under each,
property remaining in the trustees' hands for Elizabeth
S. Morgan was given at her death, to the appointee or
appointees named in her will, with gifts over in case she
failed to appoint. Under both trusts, if in the judgment

"Sec. 302. The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be
determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated"(f) To the extent of any property passing under a general power
of appointment exercised by the decedent (1) by will, or (2) by deed
executed in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession
or enjoyment at or after his death, . . . except in case of a bona fide
sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's
worth; . . ."

of the trustees, property going to any beneficiary would
be dissipated for any reason, or improvidently handled,
the trustees were to withhold any part of such property;
with directions for disposition, in such event, of what
was withheld. The decedent appointed in favor of her
husband.
The Commissioner ruled that the value of the appointed property should be included in the gross estate
and determined a tax deficiency. The Board of Tax
Appeals approved his action.' The Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the Board's decision.'
Although, under the law of Wisconsin, the decedent
could have appointed anyone to receive the trust property,
including her estate and her creditors, the petitioner urges
that, by statute and decision, Wisconsin has defined as
special a power such as she held.4 The respondent urges
that this is not a correct interpretation of the state law. We
find it unnecessary to resolve the issue, since we hold that
the powers are general within the intent of the Revenue
Act, notwithstanding they may be classified, as special
by the law of Wisconsin.
State law creates legal interests and rights. The federal revenue acts designate what interests or rights, so
created, shall be taxed. Our duty is to ascertain the

"Sec. 232.05: General Power. A power is general when it authorizes the alienation in fee, by means of a conveyance, will, or
charge of the lands embraced in the power, to any alienee whatever.
"232.06. Special Power. A power is special: (1) When the person
or class of persons to whom the disposition of the lands under the
power to be made are designated. (2) When the power authorizes
the alienation by means of a conveyance, will, or charge of a particular estate or interest less than a fee."

Opinion of the Court.

meaning of the words used to specify the thing taxed.
If it is found in a given case that an interest or right
created by local law was the object intended to be taxed,
the federal law must prevail no matter what name is
given to the interest or right by state law.'
None of the revenue acts has defined the phrase "general power of appointment." The distinction usually
made between a general and a special power lies in the
circumstance that, under the former, the donee may appoint to anyone, including his own estate or his creditors,
thus having as full dominion over the property as if he
owned it; whereas, under the latter, the donee may appoint only amongst a restricted or designated class of
persons other than himself.'
We should expect, therefore, that Congress had this
distinction in mind when it used the adjective "general."
The legislative history indicates that this is so.7 The
Treasury regulations have provided that a power is within
the purview of the statute, if the donee may appoint to
any person.'
With these regulations outstanding Congress has
several times reenacted § 302 (f), and has thus adopted
the administrative construction. That construction is in
accord with the opinion of several federal courts.'

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

309 U. S.

The petitioner claims, however, that the decision below
is in conflict with two by other Circuit Courts of Appeal."0
The contention is based on certain phrases found in the
opinions. We think it clear that, in both cases, the courts
examined the local law to ascertain whether a power
would be construed by the state court to permit the appointment of the donee, his estate or his creditors, and
on the basis of the answer to, that question determined
whether the power was general within the intent of the
federal act.
As the decedent in this case could have appointed to
her estate, or to her creditors, we hold that she had a
general power within the meaning of § 302 (f). This
conclusion is not inconsistent with authorities on which
the petitioner relies," holding that, in the application of
a federal revenue act, state law controls in determining
the nature of the legal interest which the taxpayer had in
the property or income sought to be reached by the statute.
The petitioner's second position is that, inasmuch as
the trustees had an unfettered discretion to withhold
principal or income from any beneficiary, they could
exercise their discretion as respects any appointee of the
decedent. This fact, they say, renders the power a special one. Assuming that the trustees could withhold the
appointed property from an appointee, we think the
power must still be held general. The quantum or character of the interest appointed, or the conditions imposed
by the terms of the trust upon its enjoyment, do not
render the powers in question special within the purport

REEVES, COMMISSIONER OF REVENUE.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY.

No. 92. Argued December 14, 1939.-Decided January 29, 1940.
1. A statute by which a State taxed deposits in banks outside of the
State atfifty cents per hundred dollars and deposits in banks within
the State at ten cents per hundred dollars, held consistent with the
due process, equal protection and privileges and immunities clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 86.
2. In taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess
the greatest freedom in classification. The presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes. P. 87.
3. The treatment accorded the two kinds of deposits in this case
may have resulted from the differences in the difficulties and expenses of tax collection. P. 89.
4. The right to carry out an incident to a trade, business or calling,
such as the deposit of money in banks, is not a privilege of national
citizenship, protected by the privileges and immunities clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. Hague v. C. I 0., 307 U. S. 496,
expounded; Colgate v. Harvey, 296 U. S. 404, in part overruled.
