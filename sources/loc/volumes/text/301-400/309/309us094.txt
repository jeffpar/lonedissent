JAMES STEWART & CO. v. SADRAKULA,
ADMINISTRATRIX.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 251.

Argued January 12, 1940.-Decided January 29, 1940.

1. Under Jud. Code § 237 (a) and the Act of January 31, 1928,
this Court has jurisdiction over an appeal from a judgment of a
state court of last resort, sustaining a recovery of damages for
accidental death, which necessarily upholds a state statute under
which the damages were awarded against the contention that, in
its application to the locus in quo-a post-office site-it violated
the provisions of the Constitution as to authority of the United
States in such places. P. 97.
2. Upon the transfer from a State to the United States of exclusive
jurisdiction of a site for a postoffice, the state laws in effect
at the time continue in force as federal laws, save as they may be
inappropriate to the changed situation or inconsistent with the
national purpose, and save as Congress may have provided otherwise. P. 99.
3. Section 241 (4) of the New York Labor Law, which requires the
planking-over of floor beams on which iron or steel work is being
erected in building construction, remained in force as to the postoffice site in New York City after the acquisition of the site by.
the United States, and was applicable to a contractor engaged
in constructing the post office under a contract with the Government. P. 100.
The fact that the Labor Law contains numerous administrative and other provisions inapplicable in the changed situation
does not render § 241 (4) inapplicable.
4. The possibility that the safety requirement of boarding-over the
steel tiers may slightly increase the cost of construction to the
Government does not make the requirement inapplicable to the
postoffice site. P. 104.

Argument for Appellant.

5. While the government building contract is in a sense the means
by which the United States secures the construction of its post
office, the contractor in carrying out the contract has not the
immunity of a government instrumentality. P. 105.
6. A contract for the building of a post-office in the City of New
York provided that "State or Municipal Building Regulations do
not apply to work inside the Government's lot lines," the sentence quoted being in a section of the contract relating to "licenses, permits, etc." Held that the intention was to relieve the
contractor from provisions of the city building code relating to
types of material, fire hazards and the like. P. 105.

York, entered on remittitur from the Court of Appeals,

and sustaining an award of damages for accidental death.

Mr. Clarence E. Mellen for appellant.
Upon transfer of jurisdiction, certain state laws, termed
municipal, governing the personal and property rights of
the inhabitants in their relations with one another, remain effective, unless they conflict with the political character, institutions or Constitution of the United States.
That rule, borrowed from international law, results from
the necessity of avoiding the alternative that, until action
by Congress, there would be no law there for the protection of such rights. American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet.
511, 541; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. McGlinn, 114 U. S.
542, 546, 547; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Chiles,
214 U. S. 274, 277, 278; Vilas v. Manila, 220 U. S. 345;
Arlington Hotel Co. v. Fant, 278 U. S. 439; Halleck, International Law, c. 34, § 14; 38 Col. L. Rev., p. 133.
Implicit in such rule is the assumption that laws which
thus continue in force have been adopted by the new
government as its own. Such adoption should be only
presumed of laws which are clearly within the purpose of

the rule and which, when applied, will not interfere with
the activities of the Government.
The New York Labor Law is a comprehensive code of
regulations designed to promote the health, welfare and
personal safety of those engaged in many different occupations. Article 10, of which § 241 is part, relates to the
construction of buildings. In New York City, its enforcement is entrusted to the superintendent of buildings,
a municipal official, who is also charged with the enforcement of the city Building Code, a municipal ordinance
which has the force of a statute. That official is empowered to enter upon all premises in which such work is
being conducted, require compliance with both the Labor
Law and the Building Code, and, if he deem it necessary,
stop all work meanwhile.
Those provisions for its executive administration and
enforcement clearly distinguish this statute from those
which have been classified as "municipal." Crook v. Old
Point Comfort, 54 F. 2d 669; McCarthy v. Packard Co.,
105 App. Div. 436; 182 N. Y. 555.
Exercise of such executive authority in federal territory would clearly infringe upon federal sovereignty.
Arizona v. California,283 U. S. 423, 451, 452; Educational
Films Corp. v. Ward, 282 U. S. 379, 388, 389; Oklahoma
City v. Sanders, 94 F. 2d 323, 326; United States v. San
FranciscoBridge Co., 88 F. 891, 894, 895.
May it then be reasonably inferred that the Federal
Government intended that this statute should be even
partially effective in its territory? Cf. Murray v. Joe
Gerrick & Co., 291 U. S. 315, 319.
Even though its executive provisions be deemed eliminated, the mandates of the statute, as applied herein, are
not "municipal," but "political."
The only building to which the statute could apply
was to be constructed pursuant to a contract with the

STEWART & CO. v. SADRAKULA.
Opinion of the Court.

94

United States. Complete control of its construction was
vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by Congress.
40 U. S. C. §§ 285, 341, 342.
The statute is such that it could not be effective in its
entirety in federal territory, and its mandates are such
that their adoption therein should not be presumed.
Such presumption would seem contrary to the intent of
Congress, as evidenced by its failure to enact several bills
for the adoption of state safety laws in all federal
projects.
Appellant's contract was an instrumentality of the
Federal Government and, as applied herein, the state
statute conflicted and interfered with that contract and
its performance.
Mr. Leo Fixler for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE REED delivered

the opinion of the Court.

This is an appeal from a final judgment of the Supreme
Court of New York awarding damages for accidental
death. As a statute of the state necessarily was sustained against a contention that its application to these
circumstances violated the provisions of the Constitution
as to the exclusive authority of the United States over a
post-office site purchased with the consent of New York,'
this Court has jurisdiction under § 237 (a) of the Judicial
Code and the Act of January 31, 1928.
The issue of law involved is whether an existing provision of a state statute requiring the protection of places
of work in the manner specified in the statute 2 remains
'Constitution, Art. I, § 8, Cl. 17:
"The Congress shall have Power ... To exercise exclusive Legislation . . .over all Places purchased by the consent of the Legislature

of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts,
Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings; . .
'New York Labor Law § 241 reads as follows:

effective as a statute of the United States applicable to
the particular parcel after the federal government acquires exclusive jurisdiction of a parcel of realty on
which work is being done.
The decedent, an employee of a rigging company, a
sub-contractor engaged in the construction of the New
York post office, fell from an unplanked tier of steel
beams down a bay and was killed. In an action of tort
against the general contractor, his administratrix narrowed the scope of the charges of negligence until violation of the quoted sub-section of the Labor Law only
was alleged. The trial court found that the proximate
cause of the accident was the negligent failure to plank
the beams as required by the statute. The Appellate
Division affirmed' on the ground that the Labor Law
provision continued effective over the post-office site after
the transfer of sovereignty, and the Court of Appeals by
an order of remittitur, 21 N. E. 2d 217, also affirmed on
the same ground with a statement that in its affirmance
it necessarily passed upon the validity and applicability of
§ 241 (4) of the Labor Law under Article I, § 8 of the
Constitution. 280 N.Y. 651, 730; 20 N. E. 2d 1015; 21
N. E. 2d 217.
The language of the Court of Appeals and the record
show indubitably that a determinative federal question
Demolition Work. All contractors and owners, when constructing
or demolishing buildings, shall comply with the following requirements:
"4. If the floor beams are of iron or steel, the entire tier of iron or
steel beams on which the structural iron or steel work is being erected
shall be thoroughly planked over to not less than six feet beyond such
beams, except spaces reasonably required for proper construction of
the iron or steel work, for raising or lowering of material or for stairways and elevator shafts designated by the plans and specifications."

was decided.4 The conclusion as to the continued vitality of existing state statutory regulations in the protection of workmen in ceded federal areas makes it substantial.5 The motions to dismiss or affirm the appeal are
denied.'
If the quoted provision of the Labor Law is operative
even though exclusive jurisdiction had already vested in
the United States, it is unnecessary to determine whether
exclusive jurisdiction had actually passed to the United
States. The state courts assumed that federal sovereignty was complete through consent by the state and
we make the same assumption. Does the acceptance of
sovereignty by the United States have the effect of displacing this sub-section of the New York Labor Law?
We think it did not. The sub-section continues as a
part of the laws of the federal territory.
It is now settled that the jurisdiction acquired from a
state by the United States whether by consent to the purchase or by cession may be qualified in accordance with
agreements reached by the respective governments. The
Constitution does not command that every vestige of the
laws of the former sovereignty must vanish. On the contrary its language has long been interpreted so as to
permit the continuance until abrogated of those rules
existing at the time of the surrender of sovereignty which
govern the rights of the occupants of the territory trans4

ferred.8 This assures that no area however small will be
left without a developed legal system for private rights.
In Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. McGlinn, supra, a Kansas statute relating to recovery against a railroad for the
injury to livestock on its right of way existed at the time
of the cession to the United States of exclusive jurisdiction over Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation. It
was held that the statute was carried over into the law
Conversely, in Arlington
covering the Reservation.
Hotel Co. v. Fant, supra, an Arkansas statute relieving
innkeepers, passed after cession of Hot Springs Reservation, was held unavailing as a defense to a Reservation
innkeeper's common-law liability in accordance with
Arkansas law before the cession. Such holdings assimilate the laws of the federal territory, where the Congress
has not legislated otherwise, to the laws of the surrounding state.
The Congress has recognized in certain instances the
desirability of such similarity between the municipal
laws of the state and those of the federal parcel. Since
only the law in effect at the time of the transfer of jurisdiction continues in force, future statutes of the state are
not a part of the body of laws in the ceded area. Congressional action is necessary to keep it current. Consequently as defects become apparent legislation is enacted
covering certain phases. This occurred as to rights of
action for accidental death by negligence or wrongful
act.' After this statute was held inapplicable to claims

lation undertook to extend the provisions of those acts
to the places under federal sovereignty.
With growing
frequency the federal government leaves largely unimpaired the civil and criminal authority of the state over
national reservations or properties." While exclusive
federal jurisdiction attaches, state courts are without
power to punish for crimes committed on federal property. 2 This has made necessary the legislation which
gives federal courts jurisdiction over these crimes. 3 The
tendency toward a uniformity between the federal and
surrounding state territory has caused a series of congressional acts adopting the state criminal laws.'
Through these concessions our dual system of government works co6peratively towards harmonious adjustment.
It is urged that the provisions of the Labor Law contain numerous administrative and other provisions which
cannot be relevant to the federal territory. The Labor
Law does have a number of articles. 5 Obviously much

arise in the territory. With the domestication in the
excised area of the entire applicable body of state municipal law much of the state law must necessarily be inappropriate. Some sections authorize quasi-judicial proceedings or administrative action and may well have no

City v. Sanders, 94 F. 2d 323 (C. C. A. 10). In this case an injunction was obtained in the federal district court enjoining a city and
certain of its officers from enforcing ordinances relating to licenses,
bonds and inspections by daily arrests on account of violations of
these ordinances by a contractor doing construction work on a lowcost housing project. The decree was affirmed by the circuit court
of appeals after consideration of the Act of June 29, 1936 which
reads that "The acquisition by the United States of any real property .. .in connection with any low-cost housing . ..project . . .
shall not be held to deprive any State or political subdivision thereof

Except as affected by the act just quoted in part, the area was federal

Opinion of the Court.

Labor Law is not applicable as a whole, it follows that
none of its sections are. We have held in Collins v.
Yosemite Park Company 17 that the sections of a California statute which levied excises on sales of liquor in
Yosemite National Park were enforceable in the Park,
while sections of the same statute providing regulation
of the Park liquor traffic through licenses were unenforceable."8
But the authority of state laws or their administration
may not interfere with the carrying out of a national
purpose."9 Where enforcement of the state law would

It also quoted with approval an excerpt from an opinion of the
Director, Legal Division, Federal Emergency Administration of Public
Works:
"I am, therefore, of the opinion that the state or local government
may not supervise the work of a contractor performing work on
property owned by the United States of a contract with the United
States."

"If it were held that beneficiaries may sue, pursuant to the compensation law, we should have the incongruous situation that this law is in
part effective and in part ineffective within the area under the jurisdiction of the federal government."
That quotation had reference to a contention that the dependents of
an employee, killed on federal territory within a state, might claim
compensation as beneficiaries under a state compensation act. The
compensation fund, collected and administered by state officers, was
not effective in federal territory. Cf. Atkinson v. Tax Commission,
303 U. S. 20, 25. As the fund was not augmented by assessments
against the federal contractor, the Court held the procedural provisions of the state compensation act did not apply.

handicap efforts to carry out the plans of the United
States, the state enactment must, of course, give
20
way.
May it be said that the continued application of § 241
(4) of the Labor Law 21 will interfere with the construction of the building upon this sitt? This is like other
squares in the city. There are, of course, differentiations
because of its ownership, but ownership as such has nothing to do with the safety requirements. It is true that
it is possible that the safety requirement of boarding over
the steel tiers may slightly increase the cost of construction to the government, but such an increase is not
significant in the determination of the applicability of
the New York statute. In answer to the argument that
a similar increased cost from taxation would "make it
difficult or impossible" for the government to obtain the
service it needs, we said in James v. Dravo Contracting
Co." that such a contention "ignores the power of Congress to protect the performance of the functions of the
National Government and to prevent interference therewith through any attempted state action." Such a safety
requirement is akin to the safety provisions of Maryland
law which in Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad Co. v.
Lichtenberg 2 were held applicable to trucks of an independent contractor transporting government employees
under a contract with the United States.

Opinion of the Court.

Finally the point is made that a provision requiring
boarding over of open steel tiers is a direct interference
with the government. This is said to follow from the
fact that the contract for the construction of the post
office is an instrumentality of the federal government.
As a corollary to this argument, error is assigned to the
refusal of the trial court to admit in evidence a clause
of the contract between the United States and the appellant reading, "State or Municipal Building Regulations
do not apply to work inside the Government's lot lines." 24
While, of course, in a sense the contract is the means by
which the United States secures the construction of its
post office, certainly the contractor in this independent
operation does not share any governmental immunity.25
Nor do we think there was error in refusing to admit the
clause of the contract as to building regulations. The
quoted sentence is in a section of the contract relating to
"licenses, permits, etc." We are of the opinion that it
is intended to relieve the contractor from provisions as
to types of material, fire hazards and the like, which are
covered by the New York City Building Code.
Such a safety regulation as § 241 (4) of the New York
Labor Law provides is effective in the federal area, until
such time as the Congress may otherwise provide.26
Affirmed.
The entire section reads:
"22. Permits. The contractor shall without additional expense to

the Government obtain all required licenses, permits, etc. This applies to work outside the lot lines, the use of streets and sidewalks, the
protection of public and traffic, connections to utility service lines,
etc. State or Municipal Building Regulations do not apply to work
inside the Government's lot lines."
