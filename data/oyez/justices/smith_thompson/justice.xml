  <justiceBiography>
    <p>
      <span>Smith Thompson was born in New York. He attended Princeton and taught school briefly upon graduating. He read law and entered practice shortly thereafter.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Thompson served in the state legislature and then won an appointment to the state's highest court, where he served for 16 years (four of those as chief justice).</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Thompson always held ambition for the presidency. He accepted Monroe's nomination to the Supreme Court when Van Buren captured the presidential nomination in 1824. Seeking a taste for partisan politics, Thompson campaigned unsuccessfully for governor of New York in 1828 while on the Court.</span>
