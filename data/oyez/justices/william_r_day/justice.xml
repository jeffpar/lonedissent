  <justiceBiography>
    <p>
      <span>William Rufus Day was probably born to be a judge. His maternal great-grandfather was chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court; his maternal grandfather served on the Ohio Supreme Court; and, his father was chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. While establishing a solid reputation as a lawyer, Day struck up a friendship with William McKinley and became his adviser.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Day was popular in Ohio. He was elected to the state trial court with the endorsement of both the Democrats and the Republicans. A few years later, President Benjamin Harrison nominated Day to the federal district court but his frail health required that he decline the nomination.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Day served in several capacities in President McKinley's cabinet. (It pays to have friends in high places!) Later McKinley named Day to the federal appeals court Day was nominated to the High Court by McKinley's successor, Theodore Roosevelt.</span>
